Those three strangers being gorgeous, good-natured, and giantesses was not at all in your plans. However, you couldn\u2019t deny that this twist of fate, however unexpected, brought benefits all its own. Three lifelong friends to go through each wacky day with you, experience every humiliating incident fate threw your way, and still be by your side at the end of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonths passed, and your friendship with the three girls was solidified in stone. You exercised with Morgan as frequently as you could, spent hours into the night chatting about life with Quinn, and endured (and sometimes participated in) Avery\u2019s ceaseless flirting and pranking. You\u2019d begun to develop feelings for each of your roommates, and they in turn for you, but no one in the apartment had yet acted on their desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spent your time working part-time, but in three different jobs at once! Point of fact, you\u2019d ended up forming a partnership with Sanderson Beach, Workout World, AND Starlight Studios, all at the same time. Somedays you helped Quinn by being her lifeguard partner, sometimes you co-taught yoga classes with Morgan, and sometimes you modeled for magazines with Avery. You led a tiring but fulfilling life that still granted you plenty of free time to hang out at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife wasn\u2019t without accident, of course. Tinies never got it easy. A serious of mishaps had landed you as Morgan\u2019s well-worn sweat rag for a week, Avery ended up accidentally tanning you to her butt cheek for nearly two weeks before finding you, and a prank gone wrong led to Quinn using you poor body for a loofah for just shy of a month. These incidents were just a few examples of hundreds that befell you in the months you\u2019d been living with the girls. Still, it always worked out in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFamily was also a key factor, and everyone living in your apartment all got to know each other\u2019s close family members. Your mother, Helen, and younger sister, Tracy, both came over several times, and really hit it off with your roommates. Likewise, Morgan and Avery\u2019s mothers, Mariah and Lilyana, stopped by several times a month, and doted on their precious daughters and you in equal measure. Quinn\u2019s mother, Becky, was an occasional visitor, but you often avoided her, as her disdain for tinies knew no bounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, you loved every second of your life, ups and downs together. If you could\u2019ve changed a single thing about your circumstances, you wouldn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the present, the current day was of special significance, unlike the many days of the year the preceded it. That was because\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You couldn\u2019t believe that time had flown so much that it was already Christmas Day. Sure, the weather outside had gotten colder, and freshly radiant snow had fallen just the night before, blanketing the ground in pure white bliss. Even still, it didn\u2019t feel real. You really had been in your new apartment for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling with contentment, you took another huge bite out of the slice of ham that Morgan had cut for you. She\u2019d gotten up earlier than everyone else to prepare some Christmas ham for breakfast (an unorthodox but filling breakfast to be sure), and her skills in the kitchen had only grown stronger since your first day meeting her. Trying not to seem too gluttonous, you wiped your mouth and grinned at Morgan, who was sitting to your right in the recliner in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez, dude! Scarfing it down, huh? Glad you like it!\u201d Morgan smiled, teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brown-haired giantess was dressed in normal attire for her usual M.O., but with a slightly Christmas flair. She was wearing a slimming red tank-top and red compression shorts, and both her shorts and top had green stripes through them. Her tank-top was also adorned with the words \u2018Reindeer Run\u2019, in reference to the local 15K marathon she\u2019d participated in the other day. She\u2019d managed to come in first place with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a sip from the cap-full of eggnog placed beside your ham slice, you gulped it down and then smiled. \u201cIt really is delicious, Morgan. Merry Christmas!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned your smile warmly, with perhaps a faint touch of pink in her cheeks. \u201cMerry Christmas, Hunter. Let\u2019s make it a great day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blindingly fast form dashed into the room and struck a confident pose. \u201cGreat day? This\u2019ll totes be the greatest day, like, ever!\u201d The energetic figure proclaimed loudly, bursting with enthusiasm. It was, of course, Avery, as dramatic and bombastic as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to look at Avery, and were momentarily stunned by the pink-haired girl\u2019s attire. A silky, low-cut red crop-top adorned her chest and left most of her lean stomach bare. The top was lined with white fluffy trim. Similarly, she had one an incredibly short red miniskirt that flared out as she moved, and was also lined with white fluffy trim. A matching red and white hat sat adorably on her head, completing the look. In summary: Sexy Santa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery sauntered over to the couch and plopped down. She flashed you a huge grin. \u201cMerry Christmas, Hunter! Today is gonna be super-duper fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope so too, Avery.\u201d You chuckled, still amazed even now at how overbearingly high-energy the girl was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last member of your four-person crew finally meandered into the room, carefully balancing her plate, which was stacked high with ham and other assorted foods. Though you couldn\u2019t see her face behind her wobbling plate of food, it wasn\u2019t hard to figure out who it was. For starters, process of elimination made the answer stupidly obvious. However, secondly, the proportions of her body alone confirmed her identity instantly as the ever-apathetic Quinn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Quinn\u2019s apathy had dried up considerably in the past few months as the black-haired girl had opened up to everyone. She was still reserved and analytical, and her tough love approach towards you and tinies in general had only grown stronger. Seemingly, so had her already outrageously curvaceous figure. Though dressed conservatively on paper by wearing a snowy white sweater and black leggings, Quinn\u2019s immensely developed body stretched the fabric of both sweater and leggings to their absolute limits, and it was quite hard not to stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a seat, Quinn set her plate down then looked at you. \u201cMerry Christmas, Hunter. These have sure been some wild months, haven\u2019t they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded with a wry grin. \u201cDefinitely. I\u2019m really glad that they happened though. I cherish all of our memories together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn rolled her eyes at your sappy but heartfelt sentiment, and couldn\u2019t fully suppress her own small smile. She then paused and blushed a second later, causing you to wonder exactly what had just gone through her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery, barely chewing through her meal before speaking, gushed excitedly. \u201cWhat are we gonna do, guys? There\u2019s so much Christmas-y things we need to do! Totes required holiday fun!\" She bounced in her seat. \"What about all of our gifts, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the exuberant girl soothingly. \"Presents can wait until later, Avery. Besides...\" You began, then trailed off. For some reason, your mind was having trouble remembering everything correctly. You HAD bought a present for everyone, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeedless to your internal concern, Morgan leaned back in her chair and rubbed her chin. \u201cI\u2019m game for whatever. Let\u2019s just all pool our ideas and then settle on a plan of action.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecovering from a moment ago, Quinn nodded in agreement with Morgan\u2019s suggestion. A minute then passed, while the four of you chowed through the rest of your breakfast and thought about what to do on your first Christmas day together as a group. The day was still young, after all.</span></div></div>",

This left you alone with Avery, whose eating had been slowed due to her paying more attention to her phone than the food. As a model, she never ate much anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were distracted too, ever since Avery had brought up the presents. You'd gone shopping for your roommates presents weeks ago and then put it out of your head, to the point where you didn't even remember what you bought them. But now that you were thinking about it again, you were pretty sure you'd only got two, and had meant to go back out to get a third but forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently your concern was visible on your face. \"What's up Hunter? You look stressed. Don't you like Christmas?\" Avery asked, putting her phone aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do Avery! It's just you mentioned presents and I suddenly felt like I was forgetting something. I'm worried I didn't get everyone a present.\" You explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sure you're just being paranoid. But here, I'll bring you to go check.\" Avery said, pinching your tiny form off the table. She held you just above chest height, giving you a very direct view down her Santa styled top into her cleavage. You tried to avert your eyes from the bouncing sea of boob below you as she carried you out of the kitchen and into the living room where the tree was. She kneeled down on the floor in front of the tree before placing you next to her. \"Wait here Hunter. Lemme see if I can find the presents from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery crawled under the tree to inspect the presents, looking for ones that said they were from you. As she did, you were treated to a view of her tremendous butt, her butt cheeks clearly visible as her miniskirt flipped up, separated only by a red thong. You turned away as the giant girl inadvertently mooned you..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you were right Hunter. There are only two presents here.\" Avery said, her face returning to view. She was frowning now, realizing the pickle you were in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap! I knew it! What am I going to do? No stores are open on Christmas Day!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Avery's eyes lit up. \"Don't worry Hunter, there's an easy solution. I'll just make you into a present for whoever you forgot! Then I can go out and buy a replacement present once Christmas is over and we can turn you back.\" Avery explained, chest puffed out with pride. The giant ditz was clearly proud of her idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Avery, this seems like a bad idea...\" You began, but you were totally ignored. You were talking to her ass again as she headed back under the tree, eager to find out who would be getting Hunter as their Christmas present this year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Avery, I need you to listen to me for a seco-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour objection was cut off as Avery suddenly sat back, her bare ass cheek slamming down on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry about that Hunter.\" Avery said, feeling you squish under her butt. After living with you for a few months though, she wasn't too worried. She was much more focused on Christmas. \"The good news is, I know whose Christmas gift you're going to be this year! You forgot to buy a present for....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. \"Me!\". Avery doesn't mind though. She puts a bow on you, wraps you up, and declares that you're her present now, and for the next 12 days of Christmas she can do whatever she wants with you, whether that means being pampering her, being played with, or being molded into whatever she needs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Morgan. Avery has some ideas about what to turn you into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Quinn. Avery has some ideas about what to turn you into. </span></div></div>",

You were far too squished to object to Avery's announcement, so all you could do was listen as she rattled off some ideas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... What should we get her?\" Avery mused. \"Ooo I know! I have some extra unopened shampoos and bath bombs and stuff. We could arrange those in a basket and make little self care bath kit! I'm sure Quinn would appreciate a relaxing bath from time to time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShockingly, this was actually a great idea. Avery had a proposal that didn't require going to the store or squishing you into anything. You wanted to agree with this plan, but her butt made sure all you could do was vaguely squirm against her cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, good point Hunter. The present has to be from you, but this stuff is mostly from me. How do we incorporate a little squishy guy into it?\" Avery was seemingly perfectly happy putting words in your mouth, interpreting your wriggling as whatever she thought would make the most sense for you to say. \"Ooo, I could make you into a loofah for the basket! That would complement this perfectly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, Avery's good idea had fallen apart. You had no interest in being reduced to a glorified wash cloth, and you doubted Quinn would be pleased to find out you'd been in the bath or shower with her. You squirmed a little more violently, but that's all you could do as the ditz rambled on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, we've got one idea now, let's see if we can think of anything else.\" Avery continued. \"Making you into clothing is always an option. Quinn always has trouble finding shorts that fit over her butt. Though then it might take me a while to find replacement shorts to swap out for you. A thong might be better, easier to stretch you out into.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery continued to ramble for a while, suggesting one bad idea after another, and never lifting her giant butt off of you. Finally, she decided to go with....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Making you into a loofah<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Some sort of clothing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Reader's choice</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You sat back on the couch and let out a big sigh of relief. Finally, the next big step in your life was ready to begin. With the help of your younger sister Tracy, you'd just finished bringing your belongings from your old house into your new apartment in the quiet suburban community of <i>Sanderson</i>. Of course, since you were a tiny from birth, you didn't really have a lot of personal belongings. In fact, all of your clothes, toiletries, and various other belongings fit completely inside of a single duffel bag, which was currently resting on the floor beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour new apartment was spacious and clean, and definitely a place you could see yourself living for the foreseeable future. It was a two-floor house, with the first floor having an entry hallway, living room, kitchen, laundry room, and bathroom, and the second floor having three bedrooms. The kitchen and living room came fully supplied with appliances and furniture. Each of the three bedrooms also had a bed and a dresser. On that note, you wondered how you missed the fact that there were only three bedrooms while reading the apartment description. Based on your split-rent deal, there would be four people total in this apartment. You supposed that someone would take the living room as their bedroom then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered when your new roommates would finally arrive, as everyone was scheduled to move in in about the same timeframe on this day. Tracy had left twenty minutes ago after saying her goodbyes, and you hoped you wouldn't be by yourself for much longer. Truthfully, you were nervous to meet the three other guys who would be sharing this place with you, but seeing as how they would be tinies like you (as you were still absolutely sure that you'd clicked the <i>Tinies Only </i>button), you believed that you'd be best friends with Morgan Sinclair, Avery Sinclair, and Quinn Wallace. As it was, all you knew about them were their names and ages, as their profiles had been quite barren on the website.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as you'd been reduced to nothing more than twiddling your thumbs while waiting on the living room couch, you heard the unmistakable sound of the front door to the apartment opening. Instantly bolting up at the ready, you quickly brushed your hair a bit neater and straightened your shirt. You weren't sure why you felt this compulsion to appear as neat as possible for your fellow tinies, but first impressions were important, after all. However, you were a bit caught off guard by hearing female giggles after the door opened, and could only assume that your new roommates had also enlisted their sisters for help moving in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, and all thought fled out of your mind as two titanic giantesses strolled into the room. The first had long, chocolate brown hair, and was a fair bit taller than the second girl, who had the same brown hair dyed with bright streaks of pink. Both girls had deeply tanned, smooth skin, and were unbelievably attractive. Your mind went straight to their rather abundant curves (and you chastised yourself for staring at them even as you kept doing it), and their bodies were shown off brilliantly. The taller girl was wearing tight compression shorts and a trim tank top, and the shorter girl was wearing a quite revealing tank top and barely-there booty shorts. They were like twin angels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gosh, this is a comfy living room!\" The shorter girl gushed, her voice bouncy and energetic. She spun around in a circle as she entered the room. \"Don'tcha think so, Morgan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taller girl rolled her eyes, but was still smiling. \"Yeah, Avery, it's nice. Lots of space for my workout gear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls kept talking while looking around the living room, but you could only stare at them slack-jawed, your mind racing at a mile a minute. A tiny, unsettling thought had been creeping up into your mind as soon as you heard female voices in the entryway, but hearing the girls confirm their names for you sealed the deal: somehow, you had both managed to join an apartment deal with people who weren't tinies, and people who were giantesses on top of that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were shaken out of your dumbfounded stupor by the sight of Avery approaching the couch backwards, still engaged in conversation with her sister. The sight of the curvy girl towering above you stunned you into motionless inactivity, at least until she started lying down on the couch, never once making eye contact with you. You let out a startled scream and tried to run, only to trip as Avery's butt plopped down onto the half of the couch furthest from you, shaking the couch cushions and toppling you over. To make matters worse, your scream was drowned out by the titanic girl's infectious giggle, and fell on deaf ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Morgan sighed, and Avery laughed harmoniously again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gettin' comfy! Like, unloading our stuff can wait!\" Avery grinned childishly, utterly oblivious to what she was doing to the living room's third, tiny occupant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Avery completely laid out on the couch, and with a muffled <i>squelch</i>, her left breast crashed onto you. She was lying on her side, so her sizable boobs had piled right onto your body, squashing your miniscule, one-inch body all the way up to your neck under her copious mounds of flesh. Your weak body flattened into nothing under her tank top covered boobs, and you thrashed your head around in a futile attempt to get free. All you could do was speak, which you hoped was enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Please! Please, get off! I'm down here!\" You shouted as loud as you could. Unfortunately, they way Avery's boobs were pinning you down, you had to angle your voice more into the cushion of the couch than up towards the two girls who could actually do something about the humiliating position you'd found yourself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, fate cut you a break, and it was enough. Morgan frowned, and began looking around the room. \"Uh, Avery...do you hear that?\" She began pacing around the room, trying to pick up the location of your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery shook her head. \"Nope. Is it someone outside? Are Quinn and that other girl...Hunter...here yet? I hope that they're both super cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan smirked for a second. \"You hope everyone is cute. But no, it sounds like...\" Her voice trailed off as she spotted your almost unnoticeable head, sticking out from under her twin sister's tits and buried into the couch cushion. Kneeling in front of Avery, Morgan peered closely at you and gasped. \"Oh! Oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery bit her lip adorably. \"What? What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan flicked her eyes up from you to her sister. \"You...uh...sat on a tiny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, and everything was cleared up. Or, at least, as well as it could be. You had introduced yourself to the twins after being freed from under Avery's boobs, and they had introduced themselves to you in turn. The three of you couldn't believe how crazy the mix-up in the apartment scheduling was, but Morgan and Avery seemed totally fine with rooming with a tiny. Avery in particular seemed quite intrigued by the prospect. From your initial meeting with them, Morgan seemed like the down-to-earth and sensible twin, while Avery was much more flirty and fun-loving. This whole scenario still put you on edge a tiny bit, as (aside from your mother and sister) you'd had very little direct interaction with giantesses your whole life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter introductions, Morgan had gone to use the bathroom, leaving you alone with Avery. However, that only lasted a second before the front door opened again. Avery jumped to her feet to greet the newest visitor, and you, back on the couch, turned to watch as a third girl strolled into the room. Presumably, she was Quinn Wallace, and her appearance here practically cemented how dumb you had been to not double-check the apartment website before signing the contract. You'd seen your roommates' names, and as they were fairly gender neutral, you hadn't thought twice about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour pre-planned introduction to Quinn fell to pieces as she walked into the room. Her hair was pitch-black and cut in a bob with bangs, and compared to the twin's, her skin tone was much paler and milky smooth. This was hardly the only difference, as you shamefully noted just how large Quinn's proportions were. Morgan and Avery had been a vision, true, but Quinn was on another level of thickness. Her boobs, butt, and thighs were some of the largest you'd ever seen, and they jiggled a bit as she walked. She was heavier than the twins, but in all the right places as far as you were concerned. She was wearing a comfy black sweater and very tight black leggings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, right as you regained the ability to form sentences, Quinn walked over towards you while looking at Avery. Avery smiled cheerfully at Quinn, then flicked her eyes down to you. A mischievous glint twinkled in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi! You must be Quinn!\" Avery beamed. \"My name is Avery, and can I say that you are totes adorable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn huffed out a bit of air. \"Thanks. Name's Quinn Wallace.\" She folded her arms and began to sit down, directly where you were on the couch. You hardly had time to react, and could only look up in surprise. Out of the corner of your eye, you saw Avery smiling with a playful expression that made your heart sink. She was totally letting this happen. That girl was going to be a handful, wasn't she?</span></div></div>",

Your face was rubbed fully into the fabric of her leggings, the pain of squashing contrasting with the almost pleasant smell of her perfume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Avery couldn't hold in her mischievous, prankster attitude any longer, and she burst out laughing. Giggling rightly, Avery smiled at Quinn, who merely looked at her with a raised eyebrow. \"You...you sat on a tiny!\" Avery said, between fits of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn frowned and looked down at the couch, where her big butt took up half of the total sofa. Shrugging, she looked back at Avery. \"Huh. He should've moved, I guess.\" Quinn replied, while taking her phone out of her purse and checking a text she'd just gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery's smile dimmed at that response. \"O-oh, it's actually our fourth roommate, Hunter. We thought he'd be a cute girl, but there was some mix-up, and he's actually an adorable little tiny. Couldn't even tell before meeting him, cuz of his name! Isn't that amazing?\" Avery had to pause a nanosecond to catch her breath. \"Morgan and I have never lived with a tiny before! It's so exciting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn shrugged again. \"Sounds like it.\" She finished typing her text, and then stretched her arms. She continued to make no attempt to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery was getting nervous now, and felt the faintest twinge of guilt for putting you into this situation. With each passing second, Quinn's indomitable ass crushed you further flat, and the heat was beginning to build up quite a bit. \"Uh...could you get off of him? I'm sure he didn't mean to be sat on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn rolled her eyes and put down her phone. \"He isn't bothering me where he is. I'll be getting up in a few minutes.\" Quinn stated. \"Anyway, you said your name was Avery? Does that mean Morgan is your sister? Is she here too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Avery's face lit back up into full excitement mode, and she launched into a rambling and bouncy conversation about herself and her sister. She told Quinn how she was hoping to become a world famous super model, and that Morgan was a super-fit exercise junkie working at the local gym, <i>Workout World</i>. Quinn responded in turn, saying how she wanted to be more approachable, so she'd applied for a more active job, and landed a position as a lifeguard at Sanderson Beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you heard none of this, as all sounds of the outside world were muffled while under Quinn's hefty buttocks. All of the curvy girl's weight as squeezing you into paste beneath her butt, and you soon began sweating profusely. Your sweat only served to further bond you to her leggings-clad left cheek. Try as you might to struggle or reform, it was quite pointless. You only hoped Avery would save you soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that hope was entirely useless, as you'd slipped Avery's mind the second Quinn had asked her about Morgan. Avery was a mile-a-minute type of girl, but this came with the drawback of her exceptionally forgetful and oblivious mindset. Her airheadedness was unrivalled amongst almost anyone in the world. This ditzy nature could be a detriment to herself and others, but no one could stay mad at Avery for long with her boundless enthusiasm and overflowing optimism towards life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, what this meant for you was that you went unnoticed beneath Quinn for the next five minutes as they talked. Then Morgan returned and got caught up in the conversation, and you were stuck for another thirty minutes. Then the girls helped each other unpack their belongings, and move into and set up their new rooms on the second floor. You stayed stuck to Quinn's booty for this entire three hour experience as well, and were pretty much just a sticker on her jiggly cheek by the time everything was said and done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBending over to retrieve her water bottle from the floor, Quinn's shapely rear was accentuated for all to see, and Avery's wandering eyes were drawn to the heavenly sight. Taking in all of Quinn's beauty, Avery smiled, but paused when her eyes locked onto you. Confused for a split second, the pink-haired girl finally connected the dots, screamed out almost comically, and pointed at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG! Hunter, you poor thing!\" She cried, gesturing to you. Morgan followed her sister's finger to you, and gasped, while Quinn merely looked over her shoulder to where they were pointing. She couldn't even see you from that angle, her ass was so massive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? How did he get there? How long has he been there?\" Morgan exclaimed, looking between her twin and Quinn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I totally forgot that Quinn sat on him!\" Avery explained. \"When she first came into the living room!\" The carefree girl tactically avoided informing her twin about her involvement in getting you squished to Quinn's rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Morgan could berate her sister, Quinn sauntered over to the nearest mirror to help her see you better, then began picking you off of her leggings. \"Yeah, I figured he'd still be stuck. I was sitting on him for a while before getting up, then with all the moving around...\" The black-haired girl shrugged. \"It was probably a bit too much for him to reform.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan and Avery blinked at Quinn, then each other. Morgan then gaped at Quinn. \"Wait...you knew he was there the whole time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn nodded. \"Assumed he was, at least. But, it's not like I could feel him, so he wasn't bothering me enough to get me to peel him off while we were working.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan threw up her hands. \"But why would you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn held up a hand defensively. \"Don't misunderstand. I'm not being rude or disrespectful to tinies.\" As she spoke, her fingernail finally slid between your pancaked body and her curvy butt cheek. Peeling you free, Quinn kept talking. \"I've lived my whole life with friends who were tinies, I know about their struggles. Even still, tinies need to learn how to be strong on their own. I left Hunter under me because I wanted him to fight for himself. People won't always be around to save him.\" The girl dropped you into Morgan's warm hands. \"Still, I didn't make it easy on him, I suppose. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she apologized, she looked you right in your squished, slightly smeared eye, and you could tell it was a genuine apology. You didn't know what to make of her and her seemingly apathetic attitude towards life just yet, but there was clearly more to her than you saw at first glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thirty minutes passed, in which Morgan whisked you off to the bathroom and helped you wash off and tidy yourself up. She'd then carried you to the kitchen and fixed you a small little meal. You couldn't help but feel that, to a small degree, she was babying you a little, but you assumed that this was just her personality. From what you'd gathered, she was a caring, helpful girl who would willingly go out of her way to lend anyone a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that diversion, Morgan had carried you into the living room, where Avery and Quinn were waiting. She sat on the couch beside Avery, and set you down on the coffee table in the middle of the room. Quinn was in a recliner beside the couch. Quinn gave you a small nod of recognition, and Avery winked at you while sticking her tongue out playfully. You rolled your eyes at her, prompting a satisfied giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this moment that it dawned on you, the full weight of what your future held. Here you were, away from home and moved into a brand new building, in a brand new community. You, a one inch tall tiny, and your three new gigantic giantess roommates. Whatever the future held, it was surely going to be wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...this is it, then.\" You said, a bit awkwardly. All three of the girls nodded. They'd each moved into the three bedrooms upstairs, unpacking all of their belongings. Actually, if they were upstairs, then...your eyes drifted over to the side of the couch, where your duffel bag packed full of belongings was still sitting. You hadn't unpacked your stuff yet! Now where were you going to sleep?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching your eye, Morgan followed your gaze. \"Ah, that's your stuff, isn't it, Hunter?\" She asked. Smiling a bit sheepishly, she continued. \"We kinda took all the rooms upstairs, didn't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waved her off, trying to act as confident as possible. It wasn't hard, with your extroverted personality, but the twists and mishaps this day had brought were still trying to settle in your mind. \"Nah, it's no big deal. I can sleep wherever there's room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn nodded, in an approving manner. \"That's good. Still, sorry for not asking you first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery, who was rocking back and forth in her seat, burst out. \"Come on guys! It's barely even four o'clock in the afternoon. Aren't we gonna do something fun today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan rubbed her sister's shoulder. \"Let's take it easy for today. Hunter's had quite the time of it, right? If he wants to do anything, let him decide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery looked sulky for a second, before cheering up again. \"...Kay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the coffee table, you observed the three jaw-droppingly gorgeous girls who were now your roommates. Well, this was it. Your new life. Better make the most of it!</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before you could think of something to say, Avery piped up with an adorable little exclamation noise. \"Oh! Wait! Where's little cutie Hunter going to sleep? We took all the bedrooms, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan sighed. \"Yes, Avery. That's what we were just discussing.\" She playfully rapped her sister on the forehead with her knuckle. \"Pay attention sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh...hee hee!\" Avery giggled, then looked down at you. As she leaned forward, her boobs threatened to spill from her already incredibly revealing top, and they jiggled slightly as they hovered above you. You had to fight to keep looking the pink-haired giantess in the eye instead of at her abyss of cleavage. \"Anyway, we gotta pick out a room for you, don'tcha think, Hunter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned up at her. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl <i>tsk tsked</i> you, wagging her finger. \"Well, ya can't sleep in the living room down here all by yourself. That'd be lonely! Plus...\" Avery smirked and winked at you. \"You got all squished twice today already on this couch. Don'tcha think it would happen a lot if you slept in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, the ditzy girl's line of thinking was spot on, but her reminder of how you'd been introduced to both her and Quinn still made you blush a bit, earning a grin from Avery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding at her sister's reasoning, Morgan laid down her palm in front of you, and motioned with her eyes for you to hop on. You were grateful that she was willing to carry you around like this, so you hopped on. She delicately stood up, careful not to shake her palm too much. She brought you all the way up to her eye level, and smiled at you. Her radiant face, and the way her chocolate brown hair framed her features was a sight to behold. Your breath caught in your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Hunter, I know it might be a little weird, but Avery makes a good point. I think you would be safest and more comfortable sharing one of our room's upstairs.\" She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully, it did make perfect sense, even though you were embarrassed beyond belief that you'd now be sharing the same room as one of these three total knockout girls you'd only just met. Still, you flashed Morgan a thumbs up. \"Sure thing! Sounds like a plan to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan smiled at your show of acceptance, and moved to leave the living room with you. Avery hopped out of the couch, and Quinn stood as well, the black-haired girl picking up and shouldering your duffel bag of belongings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thanks Quinn.\" You said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged. \"You couldn't have gotten it yourself.\" She reasoned. Taking the lead, Quinn walked up the stairs, Morgan following after and Avery behind. As the four of you ascended to the top of the stairs, your gaze was entranced by Quinn's perfectly sculpted, humongous rear end swaying side-to-side as she meandered up the stairs. It was an incredible sight, and one you had to literally slap yourself out of gawking at. After slapping yourself, you heard a small chuckle above you, and you turned to see Morgan smirking playfully. Your staring at Quinn had apparently not gone unnoticed by your carrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the second floor, Morgan slipped by Quinn and approached the first open door. \"So, this is my room. If we're doing this like some sort of equal debate thing, I guess it's choice number one.\" She said, and you realized that she was right. It would only be fair for you to look at each girl's room first, then decide who you wanted to room with. Really though, that just made all of this even more embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan showed off her room, and it was basically what you expected from someone like her. Her bed was tucked in and straightened, her clothes were neatly stored away in dressers and in the closet, and one corner of her room was taken up by a organized collection of exercise weights and training props. One other corner of the room was barren. The entire room was decorated in shades of tan and brown, a very earthy and natural feel. There was also a TV with what looked like a gaming console hooked up to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan smiled. \"If you wanted to room with me, you could have that whole empty corner to yourself. That way, we wouldn't be taking up each other's space. I also have a spare pillow I can give you to use for a bed, if you'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery was next to show off her room, and once again it was right in the same ballpark as how you would've guessed. It was the same sort of neatness as Morgan, but filled to the brim with personal belongings. There were twice as many dressers and drawers for clothes, a sprawling make-up table, and even a full-size mannequin currently wearing a sparkly white dress. There was hardly any free space, and the whole room was colored in a wide assortment of rainbow hues, though mostly bright pinks, blues, and reds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery spun in a circle excitedly. \"If you wanted to room with me, I have a few empty drawers for all your stuff.\" Avery gestured to one of her dresser cabinets, where two empty drawers were (worryingly, right beside what appeared to be drawers stuffed with lingerie and swimsuits). \"I also figured we could just share the bed, as there's totes enough room for me and a cutie like you!\" Avery giggled, prompting a startled blush from you, a surprised look from Morgan, and a shrug from Quinn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn's room was last, and it was the one that caught you off guard the most. You anticipated that everything would be mostly colored in black, gray, and purple, but what you didn't expect was for it to be so messy. She had the same style bed, dressers, and closet as the twins, but the floor of her room was covered with clothes strewn all about. You'd be hard pressed to believe she had only just moved in hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn put her hands on her hips as she talked. \"Yeah, it's a mess, I know. I have a hard time...feeling like I need to tidy up. Still, it's comfy, I guess. If you wanted to room with me, I'm sure you could find space somewhere, like on the floor, or in a drawer, or something. Anything that doesn't bother me is okay. You can do whatever.\" She shrugged again, and you couldn't help but smile. Something about her nonchalant attitude could be so endearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the tour finished, Morgan took you back out into the hall, and the three girls looked at you expectantly, obviously anticipating your answer. You knew this was a pretty big decision, so you thought about it for a second, cleared your throat, then spoke up.</span></div></div>",

Why don't I show you up to <i>our</i> room?\" Morgan asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, then realizing that she didn't notice the slight movement of your head, called up to her, \"Yeah sure.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed her hand down for you to climb onto, and you stepped off the table she had set you down onto and back into her waiting palm. She started to walk upstairs, occasionally glancing down at you once or twice to make sure you were still there and hadn't fallen off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where would you like to sleep, Hunter? I'm sure we can set up some sort of bed for you on my nightstand that you'll be able to climb up and into? I don't think sleeping in the same bed as me would be very safe since I could probably roll over at some time during the night and squish you, and I doubt either of us would want that,\" she asked. You couldn't help but stare at the giant pair of breasts in front of you as she said the word squish, thinking maybe you'd enjoy it a bit more than you should let on to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that doesn't sound too appealing. The nightstand bed sounds like a great idea,\" you call up to her, and she smiles back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach the top of the stairs and look around into the room, noticing how clean and orderly everything is. All the luggage was off to one corner of the room with no clothes or accessories strewn about anywhere on the floor. The bed was nicely made and you noticed that even the nightstand was spotless, with an alarm clock and lamp to keep you company through the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan set you down on the bed, then sat down gently next to you, making sure that the impact didn't jostle or throw you up into the air. You appreciated the carefulness she showed towards you, and started to feel like you made the right choice choosing Morgan to room with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've just gotta change into my pajamas, and then I'll be set for bed. Maybe we can order in dinner or something too to celebrate our first night as roomies,\" said Morgan, breaking you out of the little stupor you were in. \"No peeking while I change though, or else you'll be in trouble,\" she added, with a raised eyebrow and the slightest hint of a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course milady,\" you respond, bowing in an exaggerated manner and grinning up to her, before turning towards the middle of the bed and covering your eyes. \"Don't take too long, or else I might not be able to hold back any longer,\" you joke, feeling the bed around you elevate slightly as Morgan gets up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be looking, so don't you dare turn around,\" Morgan retorts, and you start to mentally undress your unbelievably attractive roommate. You feel the blood rush down slightly into your nether regions, and you start to wonder if Morgan would really notice if you turned around slightly just to see what she was up to.</span></div></div>",

This is gonna be so fun!\" Avery squealed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, good luck with that.\" Quinn said, before turning and heading back towards her bedroom. As she did so, you couldn't help but be distracted by the massive butt that had squished you earlier in the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan's voice snapped you back to the two sisters. \"Are you sure sharing a bed is a good idea guys? Avery could easily steamroll you in her sleep. She tends to roll around a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStupidly, you hadn't even considered this. Your mind flashed with images of you laying down in bed, only to be awoken by an avalanche of boob as Avery rolled over onto you. \"Avery, maybe your sister has-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could continue your objection, Avery snatched you up into her own hand. \"You're always worrying Morgan! It's going to be fine, trust me. And even if I do squish him a little bit, he did fine under Quinn's butt today, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's gonna get squished a lot living with us. Might as well get used to it.\" Quinn's voice called out from her bedroom. The three of you were all surprised she had joined the conversation at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, I'm not gonna squish him, it'll be fine, you'll see.\" Avery retorted. \"In fact, it's getting late, I think me and the little guy are going to turn in early tonight. Quinn's butt probably tired him out anyway.\" Avery didn't wait for a reply from the other girls. Satisfied with the arrangements, she just walked into her bedroom, your tiny body gripped in her fist as it swung disorientingly at her side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got to her room, she dropped you down onto the right side of the queen sized bed. From your perspective, it was massive. Morgan must have been worrying too much, you were sure the two of you could share all of this space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to get changed little guy. No peeking! Even though we both know you want to.\" Avery teased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, you turned towards the head of the bed, covering your eyes with your hands for extra measure. Though you couldn't see what was going on behind you, your imagination was happy to mentally undress the giant girl despite yourself. Maybe this whole rooming mixup would turn out for the best...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you can open your eyes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you turned around, your saw that Avery's penchant for revealing clothing carried over into pajamas. She was wearing a matching pink pajama set that looked like it was a few sizes too small for her. The bottom edge of her butt cheeks peeked out of the tight shorts she was wearing, while her top hugged her breasts tightly and only covered up to her belly button. You could tell she was no longer wearing a bra, as the outline of her nipples was visible through the fabric. She had also put on fluffy pink ankle socks, presumably to keep her feet warm while sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cute right?\" Avery asked, striking a little pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah... Very... 'cute'.\" You replied, realizing you hadn't blinked for 30 seconds at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery grinned and flopped down into bed. The impact of her butt on the mattress launched you a few inches into the air, but her soft mattress also was there to break your fall moments later. When you stop up again, Avery was laying in bed on her side, smiling cutely at you. Even when she was a little careless, it was impossible to stay mad at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's get you to your new sleeping spot.\" Avery said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were confused. You were already on the bed, weren't you? \"I thought you were just going to have me sleep on the mattress next to you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was my first plan, but I was thinking it'd be better if you slept on my body. That way I don't have to wonder where you are when I wake up in the morning.\" Avery explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped. Her body? It's true that Avery was incredibly hot, but this still seemed like a big jump for first day roommates. And where on her body would she put you anyway? Your face reddened as you imagined laying on her chest, using one of her enormous breasts as a pillow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooo I can tell by the color of your face that you like this plan.\" Avery said, her grin widening even further. \"Now, let's get you situated. I have a nice.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. soft mattress picked out for you.\" (Avery lays on her chest and tucks you into her pajama bottoms, making her ass cheek your \"mattress\")<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. comfy room picked out for you.\" (Avery tucks you deep between her tremendous breasts, leaving you unable to move an inch)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. warm sleeping bag picked out for you.\" (Avery decides to tuck you into her socks, figuring sleeping up next to her feet will keep you warm and cozy all night)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI have a nice comfy room picked out for you!\u201d Avery giggled. \u201cIt\u2019s soft, padded all around, and more warm and cozy than you could ever dream!\u201d The pink-haired giantess grinned from ear-to-ear, and then leaned forward, causing her prodigious chest to swing like a pendulum directly above you. The abyss of her cleavage was seemingly infinite, and you found it impossible to tear your gaze from her titanic tits as they jiggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaping like an idiot, you stammered out a reply. \u201cOh\u2026uh\u2026really?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery\u2019s eyes gleamed with delight. \u201cAny guesses where your room is, cutie?\u201d The flirtatious giantess pressed her arms up against her breasts, squeezing her gargantuan globes tighter together, accentuating their incredible size and threatening to spill her boobs from her tight top. You were once more enraptured by the sensual display, with the logical part of your brain screaming at you to focus and divert Avery from this line of thinking. Sadly, your hormones won out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know, Avery\u2026uh\u2026\u201d You balked, utterly failing to be a proper gentleman. To be fair, Avery was pretty much cheating, having cornered you on her bed like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling again, Avery scooped you up without warning, pinching your chest lightly between two fingers and hoisting you up into the air. You let out a small yelp of surprise, which only caused Avery to grin wider. The faintest of blushes was growing in her cheeks, and you quickly realized why. Even in your dazed stupor, you weren\u2019t so dumb as to not figure out Avery\u2019s plan, as your new giantess roommate dangled you above her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes widened, you sobered up instantly. \u201cW-wait, Avery! I don\u2019t think\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, cutie! No need to worry! This is perfect.\u201d Avery cut you off with confident assurance. \u201cLike, you\u2019ll sleep like an adorable baby, Hunter!\u201d Leaning forward again, Avery puckered her lips and planted a kiss on you, her plush lips easily overwhelming your entire body. Your protests were eaten up by her lips encompassing your whole being, swallowing you in sticky saliva and euphoric bliss in equal measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeeling you back from her quick smooch, Avery smirked playfully at your dumbfounded expression, winked in a sultry manner, and dropped you. To stunned to even cry out, your inch-tall body fell through the air, before finally landing directly in Avery\u2019s cleavage; a clean drop. You sank in between her mammoth mammaries up to your neck, her pillowy flesh wobbling all around you. Though she wore no bra, her tight top more than compressed her tits enough to hold you in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, nighty-night, Hunter! Hope you have a totes awesome night!\u201d Avery exclaimed, before delicately slamming her index finger into your head. Shocked back into awareness, you uttered one more panicked plea for your flirty roommate to stop, but to no avail. Powerless, you could do nothing as Avery shoved you entirely into her cleavage, all the way until your body disappeared from view, your vision became darkness, and everything around you was hot flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still desperate to avoid this situation, so as soon as Avery withdrew her finger, you began thrashing and kicking, trying to crawl out. As unbelievably sexy as Avery was, you really didn\u2019t want to spend your first night with her jammed into her cleavage. It was, frankly, kind of demeaning for her to treat you this way. Also, from your little interactions with her, you knew she was a colossal ditzy airhead. Spending the night crushed between her boobs seemed like a recipe for disaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, your panicked squirming only registered as a faint tickling sensation, which Avery interpreted as you enjoying yourself. Blushing more and smiling in a satisfied manner, the pink-haired giantess flicked off the lights and then flopped backwards onto her bed, her head plopping down onto her pillow. Pulling the covers up over herself, Avery closed her eyes and quickly slipped off into peaceful dreams of toying with cute tinies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Avery laid down, her breasts sprawled out, no longer so tightly constrained by gravity. Hot flesh poured onto you from all directions, and you attempts to wiggle free backfired horribly. Legs and arms sprawled out while trying to move, your limbs were now crushed and flattened in painfully twisted directions, your whole body forcibly contorted into a pretzel-like figure. Your mouth, held open to call out to Avery, was met by a wall of breast flesh forcing its way in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn seconds, you\u2019d been reduced to not much more than a sticker, mangled and flattened between Avery\u2019s gigantic globes of flesh. The tight confines, and the extra addition of the covers Avery pulled up increased the temperature by a hundred, and both you and Avery\u2019s boobs were slicked with sweat mere minutes after Avery turned off the lights. The warmth was unbearable, simultaneously gross and exhausting, while also luring you to give up an embrace sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever one to back down despite your size, you soon formulated a plan. Bracing yourself in position, you twitched and squirmed what little bit you could still manage, and pushed back against the unrelenting walls of boobs all around you. Though it strained your muscles, you managed to clear a miniscule pocket around yourself, in which you were free to resume reforming back to normal shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLimbs reinflating slowly but surely, you fought the urge to yawn and succumb to sleep. Sweaty as they were, Avery hadn\u2019t been lying about how heavenly soft her skin was. Her boobs were essentially the world\u2019s largest and comfiest pillows. There was also something mesmerizing about your giantess roommate\u2019s methodical, rhythmical heartbeat as it pounded softly, the only noise you could even hear while entombed in breast flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you were unflattened, and with an agonizingly slow pace, you began crawling across Avery\u2019s skin. Pitch black in the cavernous confines of her cleavage, you didn\u2019t exactly know where you were going, or even which way was up. Still, you were determined to escape from her tits and back out onto her bed. If you were fast enough, you might even still end up able to catch a bit of actually peaceful sleep before morning came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery small bit you wiggled forward was taken with painstaking care. Avery\u2019s boobs were rising and falling with her every breath, generating a nauseating wave-like motion. You also sunk into her doughy flesh even with your miniscule amount of weight, your body displacing boob flesh all around you. It was claustrophobic as hell with her boobs serving as the ground, walls, and pressing ceiling above you, but you kept fighting. Whether you came out the top of her shirt or the bottom, you\u2019d take your victory and run with it.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>However, as fate was wont to do, a cruel twist spelled out disaster. You were still thoroughly trapped and hidden away, a surprisingly hefty amount of breast flesh pinning you down from above, when Avery apparently got tired of lying on her back. Still happily dreaming, Avery let out a cute groan of discomfort and flipped over onto her stomach, quickly and efficiently. It happened in the blink of an eye, catching you totally off guard and ruining everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy flipping over, all the weight of Avery\u2019s breasts now squeezed down onto you, once more crushing you flat and reducing you to nothing more than a sticker on her sweat-slicked flesh. The weight was immense, and you found yourself completely unable to move a single muscle, or even twitch. The swell of Avery\u2019s chest was far too pronounced for someone at your size to conquer, and your plans to escape had only led to your own defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust barely, you could hear Avery lightly giggle in her sleep, and some part of you knew that she wasn\u2019t planning on moving again anytime soon. Crushed under the full, overwhelming weight of her breasts, even your most desperate attempts to move or reform were all for naught. Squished away like a mashed, mangled boob sticker, you gave up your hope and plans, and allowed yourself to succumb to the warm embrace and soft caress of Avery\u2019s tits, passing out and sleeping fitfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome morning, it was immediately clear that only one of you had slept restfully. Though you briefly forgot where you were, Avery\u2019s steady heartbeat, coat of sweat, and softness of her flesh reminded you quickly. Testing out your ability to wiggle, you found yourself seemingly engrained to your giantess roommates\u2019 tits even more than before. Apparently, Avery had stayed on her stomach all night since turning, and the hours of pressure had quite thoroughly baked you in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was incredibly distressing, as you were now one step closer to being nothing more than a tattoo on Avery\u2019s skin. Sadly, the culprit was entirely oblivious, and you could feel yourself shaking and jostling around as Avery yawned adorably and rolled herself out of bed. As she sat up, a figurative mountain of flesh fell upon you, squashing you tightly and piling all around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhm\u2026oh. Oh! I have the day off! OMG, sweet!\u201d Avery\u2019s bubbly voice came out muffled from under tons of her breast flesh, but you could still make it out. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll shower!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the pink-haired giantesses massive breasts bounced as your captor stood up, and it was immediately clear to you that the scatterbrained girl had totally forgotten all about you. Moving and speaking was impossible crushed this flat, so you mentally begged Avery to remember you and notice you. Your only reply was for Avery to yawn again, stretching her arms upwards as she padded out of her bedroom and towards the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stretched, her arms pushed against the sides of her prodigious chest, pushing her boobs up just a bit. As they rose, the pressure on you lessened greatly, and you felt yourself rising too. When her stretch finished and gravity took hold again, her boobs claimed you once more, burying you totally and crushing you up into a mangled form on her skin. Or, to be more specific, ONE boob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, you realized where you were, and it scared you tremendously. During your blind and failed crawl to freedom hours earlier, you\u2019d apparently ended up closer to the bottom of Avery\u2019s tits. When she\u2019d flipped onto her stomach, you\u2019d ended up wedged underneath her left breast, and stayed crushed there all night, your malleable body engraining itself more and more to her smooth, supple skin from all the pressure and hours. Essentially, you were squished up deep in Avery\u2019s left underboob, the folds of her boobs tucking you away and mashing all around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the bathroom, Avery giggled at her disheveled bedhead and stripped out of her clothes, while turning on the water in the tub and letting it heat up to incredible temperatures. As soon as she slipped her top off, her humongous, perky breasts hung loose and free. Incredibly, this smooshed you even further into her flesh, as her left tit fell around you, pressing into you and hiding you from the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Avery took a passing glance at herself in the mirror, smiled, and then turned around. You weren\u2019t visible in the slightest, mashed as you were into the underside of Avery\u2019s left breast. In fact, even if someone looked at you from below, they wouldn\u2019t see you, as you were crushed up where her boob squished into her chest proper, folded tight. Someone would only notice you if they actually grabbed hold of Avery\u2019s left breast and hefted it up and away from her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlissfully unaware to the horribly cruel position that her tiny little roommate was in, Avery switched the water from faucet to showerhead and then hopped into the tub, grinning at the searing temperatures that she loved so much. The water cascading down her body, Avery childishly spun in a circle, relishing in the feeling of her routine morning shower rinsing her completely and fully waking her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom where you were, only the slightest amount of water actually trickled down Avery\u2019s curvy body and touched you. It singed so hotly that you mentally cried out in pain, only for your pain to be met by Avery singing a happy song, her vocals surprisingly good from someone as airheaded as her. One part of your brain thought of how she really was the total package, save for smarts. The other part of you snidely remarked that it was exactly Avery\u2019s lack of smarts that had put you into this position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching for a washcloth, Avery dabbled body wash onto the cloth and then began thoroughly scrubbing her body. As she bent to scrub her legs, her boobs squished back into her chest, the weight crushing you doubling as you were squeezed from all sides. It seemed like a welcome reprieve when Avery stood back up, but you soon felt the sensation of her wash cloth approaching, and it dawned on you that this was actually very, very awful instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one redeeming grace to this whole travesty was that you\u2019d been crushed into Avery\u2019s tit back first, so your face was looking out. You\u2019d hoped this would make you just a bit more easy to notice, despite how thoroughly crushed from sight that you were. However, as Avery scrubbed painfully away at you with the washcloth, you realized fate would never, ever cut you break, and would instead find ways to make everything so much more hellish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving no reason (in her mind) to be extra-delicate or careful, Avery casually rubbed the cloth all around her boobs, including her underboobs. This meant she dragged the cloth harshly against your body, over and over and over, like you were tiny, flat cheese, and the cloth was a cheese grater. Each pass over your body mangled and smeared your squishy facial features, blurring your vision and muddying your recognizable appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved eventually, but the damage was done. Not only did you feel even more engrained into her flesh, but you were significantly harder to spot. All the remained was the slight skin tone difference between you and her breasts, and your faintly visible but contorted facial features. Otherwise, in the span of a single rough night, Avery had just about turned you into the perfect little man tattoo on the underside of her left breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to her underboob tagalong, Avery spent the rest of her shower scrubbing and treating her hair carefully with the most designer of products. Finished after nearly thirty minutes under the water, Avery emerged like a naked, soaking goddess, and she reached for a nearby towel. With the same carelessness as with the washcloth, she dried off, subjecting you to just a bit more grinding from the rough towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSqueaky clean and dry, Avery sauntered back to her bedroom, sparing a quick wave and smile to Quinn, who was on her way off to her job as a lifeguard at the beach. Her twin, Morgan, had already left for work too. Avery reentered her room a minute later, and began digging around for a cute, stylish outfit to wear for her relaxing day off. Her mind spun with ideas for what she could do, ranging from a lazy stay-at-home day, to shopping sprees, or even a full-body massage at the local massage parlor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she grabbed clothes, her gaze drifted to the bed, and lingered there. A faint tickling sensation buzzed in the back of the pink-haired giantess\u2019 admittedly fairly empty brain, and she frowned. She felt convinced there was something important she was forgetting, but she couldn\u2019t place her finger on what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrapped as you were, glued to Avery\u2019s left underboob, you could only pray her mind put the pieces together. Your flirty, ditzy new roommate was now your only hope left.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Avery stared at her bed, trying to figure out what exactly it was that she was forgetting. She stood up straight, causing the breast that you to shake and wobble on top of you, battering you into the unyielding surface of her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm, what am I forgetting?\u201d Avery pouted as she concentrated on figuring out what she had forgotten. \u201cOMG, duh! I had little cute Hunter with me last night. I bet he had an totes amazing sleep between my boobs last night!\u201d<br>\r\nAfter realising that you had been with her last night, she glanced around the room briefly.<br>\r\n\u201c... Where is he? Hunter, where are you? Are you still snuggled in?\u201d She parted her mammoth mammaries, dropping her towel to allow herself to make it easier. She inspected the vast valley of her cleavage, but couldn\u2019t find you. \u201cHmmm, maybe he got washed out in the shower?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked into the bathroom, still nude since she was the only person in the house. After briefly inspecting the bathroom and not finding you, Avery huffed in frustration.<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is he? Did that little sneak slip out in the night? Take advantage of my poor little self and then slip out when he got what he wanted,\u201d Avery snickered at her own joke, covering her nude body from no one in particular. After laughing, she went more serious and started to actually think where you could be. \u201cHmmm, did he mention having a job? Maybe he left already? Yeah that\u2019s probably it. Bummer, I was hoping to spend a little more time with the little cutie. Oh well, he\u2019ll be living with us for a while anyway, plenty of time for more teasing him, he\u2019s so adorable when he gets flustered!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you heard this, you realised that you would need to do something to get her attention, otherwise you might be stuck here for a long time. Focusing your efforts, you tried to move as hard as you could. It was difficult to get any movement at all with the hefty weight of Avery\u2019s monumental left breast crushing you under it\u2019s weight. After struggling for almost a minute straight you finally managed a small vibration. You felt Avery jump, startled by the sudden sensation on her breast. Her sudden motion lifted her breast slightly before it suddenly slammed back into position, crushing you once more and silencing your struggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that? Wait, is that you Hunter?\u201d Avery seemed to grow more confused when your buzzing stopped, squashed flat once more by her slight jump when you startled her.<br>\r\nSeconds later you felt your breast shift as she slid her hand along her underboob, looking for the source of the buzzing. As her fingers slid over you, you were pressed into the soft flesh of her breast.<br>\r\n\u201cIs that you Hunter? I really hope it is because that feels super weird under there,\u201d Avery didn\u2019t seem to be very concerned, based on the tone of her voice. She sounded more concerned that it wasn\u2019t you currently squished to the bottom of her boob, clearly not grasping how badly you were engrained into her skin. Avery attempted to scratch at you, but you wouldn\u2019t budge from her skin, all she accomplished was hurting you as her  polished nails scraped across your skin. <br>\r\n\u201cUgh, I can\u2019t get a grip on you cutie! Got any ideas?\u201d After a few seconds of waiting on an answer you heard her start to giggle. \u201cOh wait, duh. You\u2019re, like, totally squished aren\u2019t you. You can\u2019t talk.\u201d<br>\r\nIf you could roll your eyes, you would have. How was it possible for Avery to be so ditsy? You thought your Aunt Norah was bad but Avery seemed to be on a whole other level.<br>\r\n\u201cHold on Hunter, I\u2019ll go get a mirror to see that it\u2019s definitely you,\u201d With that said she let her boob drop back down, smushing you once again into it\u2019s squishy embrace. As she practically skipped to her room to retrieve a small pocket mirror in her dresser, you were battered as her generous chest bounced with every step. With every bounce you felt yourself become slightly flatter, and you feared that Avery would struggle to even recognise you, never mind free you after all the abuse your body had suffered over the last ten hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter grabbing the mirror from her dresser, Avery sat at her make-up desk, which had a large mirror placed on top of it. She sat down, jostling you once again, before lifting her breast and using the large mirror on her desk and the small mirror in her hand to start examining the underside of her breast. <br>\r\n\u201cYou under there little guy?\u201d You could see Avery through the mirror directly in front of you, her tongue poking out of the side of her mouth as she concentrated. You would have found it cute if she wasn\u2019t also the person who put you in this position. You watched Avery look for what felt like three or four minutes, beginning to look increasingly frustrated that she couldn\u2019t find the source of the buzz she felt. Finally her eyes locked with your barely there ones and you saw a faint hint of recognition in her eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, is that you?\u201d After a few minutes free of pressure, you had managed to reform just enough to buzz in response. Avery gasped. \u201cWow my boobs did a number on you, huh? We\u2019re they a bit too much for a cute little thing like you to handle? I\u2019m sure you loved snuggling up with them though, I imagine getting all squished by them was worth it, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>\r\nYou buzzed in response, trying to tell this colossal airhead that no, it wasn\u2019t worth it, but after feeling your buzz Avery seemed to take it as confirmation of her question.<br>\r\n\u201cI knew my big boobies would make a comfy bed for you little guy, glad you enjoyed it, it was pretty fun for me as well,\u201d she winked at you. How could she still be flirting at a time like this? \u201cAnyway, let\u2019s get you out of there so we can have a fun day together!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her hand that was holding the mirror, Avery started to pick at your body, trying to peel you off her skin. All she achieved was painfully scratching you with her nails and blurring your edges slightly. After a few attempts to free you, you heard Avery sigh in frustration.<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Hunter, why won\u2019t you come off? I know my boobs are nice but jeez, I\u2019ve got stuff to do today!\u201d You couldn\u2019t believe this, she thought you were willingly staying on her breast like this! Your frustration was interrupted by Avery snickering. \u201cNah I\u2019m just kidding! Seriously though I can\u2019t get you off!\u201d<br>\r\nYou could tell by the tone of her voice that she was feeling bad about your predicament. You would have almost felt bad for her if this wasn\u2019t completely her fault.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd this was my only day off for a while as well, I had so much stuff planned,\u201d she sighed glumly. Not two seconds later you heard her voice perk up. \u201cOmg I\u2019ve got a totes amazing idea...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got a sinking feeling, you could probably guess that Avery\u2019s \u201cgreat idea\u201d would be counterintuitive to getting you freed from her breast. But in the end you had no control over the situation, and just had to hope that Avery would do something to help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) \u201c...we should go visit Morgan at her job, I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll know what to do.\u201d <br>\r\n2) \u201c...we should go to Sanderson Beach, Quinn should be able to help. Plus while we are there I can relax and tan while we are there.\u201d<br>\r\n3) \u201c...I was already planning on going shopping anyway, and I don\u2019t see any way to get you off. So you can just stay there till tonight and we can get you off then.\u201d</span></div></div>",

She locked eyes with your blurred smear of a body and grinned. \u201cWe should go to Sanderson Beach, cuz Quinn should be able to help! Plus, while we\u2019re there I can relax and tan!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes went wide with panic upon hearing these words. You couldn\u2019t even begin to fathom how Avery considered heading out to the beach to be a viable strategy for freeing you from her breast. Throwing all your energy into a desperate attempt to dissuade Avery from her poorly-conceived plan, you twitched your body and managed to produce a small buzz. As soon as you did so, you heard Avery giggle infectiously, and her flesh rippled underneath you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I knew you\u2019d be as psyched as me, Hunter!\u201d Avery smiled from ear-to-ear. \u201cThis is gonna be such a totally awesome day! We\u2019re gonna be bonding like best buddies in no time!\u201d Avery laughed again, and you couldn\u2019t help but recognize the cruel irony in her use of the word \u2018bonding\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied that you\u2019d accepted her plan, Avery let go off her doughy breasts, and let them jiggle back into place. Her hefty left breast slammed down onto you again, squishing you tightly in its overwhelmingly warm and claustrophobic embrace. You mentally groaned as your whole world shook and quaked as Avery skipped around her room rummaging for the perfect, cute bikini to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eventually settled on a revealing pink two-piece with heart patterns across the fabric. She slid the bottoms up her long legs and snapped it into place, and then fit her sizable boobs into the cups of bikini. As she did so, the bikini pinched against your body, the cup pressing you up into Avery\u2019s pillowy soft flesh and not allowing you even the slightest amount of room to move or squirm anymore. If anything, it just helped to stick you to her even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmiring herself in the mirror for a second, Avery threw on some stylish sunglasses and then bounded down the stairs to get to her car. Her chest heaved up and down almost comically as she ran, breasts slamming into you over and over again with each bouncy step. Each pounding you received pushed your splattered body more and more into Avery\u2019s skin, which was already beginning to grow slick with sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the beach, Avery was no less enthusiastic about sprinting out from the parking lot and onto the sand, eager to find the perfect spot. More crushing and smushing of your miniscule body ensued, and you were growing practically immune to the constant smashing by this point. What worried you was that each fleshy impact smeared your recognizable features more and more, to the point where the only thing that would distinguish you from Avery soon would be your slightly different skin tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery quickly found a quiet, spacious spot to spread out her towel and set down the bag she\u2019d brought with her. As she was doing so, a faint tickling in the back of her mind tried to tell her she was forgetting something. A moment later, the pink-haired giantess gasped adorably and slapped her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh gosh, Hunter!\u201d Avery exclaimed, then looked down at her breasts. \u201cNearly forgot you, little cutie! That\u2019d be silly of me, huh?\u201d She giggled, then scanned the horizon. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t see Quinn, so let\u2019s find another lifeguard and ask where she might be. Sound like a plan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot waiting for your response, Avery strolled over to the nearest lifeguard tower and called up to the lifeguard on duty. A second later, and an alert looking brunette peeked her head over the side of the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can I help, miss?\u201d The lifeguard asked earnestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust wondering where my friend is.\u201d Avery explained. \u201cHer name is Quinn, and she\u2019s totes thicc!\u201d Avery grinned, and the lifeguard looked taken aback by Avery\u2019s blunt and flirty description. \u201cI think she works here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecovering quickly, the lifeguard frowned. \u201cAh, Quinn is actually taking care of some special tasks for our boss, Brigitte. She might be busy for a few hours.\u201d The lifeguard smiled sheepishly. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t an inconvenience, I can send her your way when she\u2019s finished!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery saluted comically. \u201cRoger that! I\u2019ll just be over at that towel, getting a totally sexy tan!\u201d Spinning on her heel, your roommate and captor sauntered back to her towel and kneeled down. Reaching into her bag, she pulled out a bottle of tanning lotion. She then slipped off her bikini bottoms and unhooked her bikini top, letting it fall off and allowing her prodigious breasts to breathe free once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidya hear that, Hunter? Guess we\u2019ll be tanning first, then talking to Quinn!\u201d Avery elaborated while beginning to thoroughly rub the tanning lotion across her thighs and up and down her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering a full-on frenzied panic by this point, you twitched and buzzed feverishly, begging Avery to stop. If she tanned while you were still glued to her breast, the effects could be catastrophic. Tanning was nearly a death sentence to tinies such as yourself. You\u2019d lost a good friend years back at the local pool, after he\u2019d been accidentally tanned onto a stranger\u2019s thigh, and the stranger had left before you\u2019d been able to alert her to what had happened. A dark part of you bet he was still fused there to this day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, the curse of your airheaded roommate struck, and Avery rolled her eyes dramatically. \u201cYes, of course I haven\u2019t forgotten you, Hunter. You\u2019ll be nice and lathered up to, okay?\u201d Avery laughed as she worked the tanning lotion along her lean stomach. \u201cI mean, we wouldn\u2019t want to leave you out, right? You\u2019ll be a hot little stud with a nice new tan! The two of us will practically match!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou internally screamed and buzzed some more, but Avery only giggled. Your efforts to convey your horror at this nightmare scenario only tickled the giantess girl\u2019s sensitive breasts. At last, the moment came, and Avery slammed her hands right into your body. Her dexterous fingers worked you into the soft embrace of her fleshy underboob, smudging your face and pushing you more into her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact of her probing fingers squished you so flat and smeared that you could no longer wiggle and buzz, preventing you from even hoping to communicate with Avery. And, of course, Avery took your sudden silence as being content with her lathering you up. She smiled with a faint blush, totally excited that she was having so much fun with her tiny new roommate. She was also looking forward to the alluring sheen of her sexy new tan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely coated in tanning lotion, Avery sprawled out on her towel, lying on her back and looking up at the warmth of the sun. Closing her eyes, Avery stretched her arms out above her head to present as much of her body to the sun as possible. In doing so, she peeled up her breasts just a bit, presenting her underboob (and by extension, you) to the killer rays of the sun. All you could do was mentally cry out in vain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling sleepily, Avery spoke one last time. \u201cWhat a great\u2026day\u2026\u201d She then let sleep claim her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t know how long it took you to fall asleep, but both you and Avery were woken up hours later by the sound of Quinn\u2019s voice. Your vision cleared after a second of staring into the sun, and you found yourself only able to see out of one mangled eye. This was annoying, but not the end of the world. After all, Quinn had proven herself to be quite adept at looking after tinies. She\u2019d spot you and free you in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery was a heavier sleeper, but she finally let out a cute yawn and opened her eyes. Stretching her arms, she blinked a few times and then looked at Quinn. She grinned lazily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Quinn. What\u2019s up?\u201d Avery asked with a yawn. \u201cNeed something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn, who was standing to Avery\u2019s side, rolled her eyes. \u201cI was told YOU were the one who needed something. If you don\u2019t, I can get back to work.\u201d Quinn gestured to her lifeguard uniform. You couldn\u2019t help but note how ludicrously small it was on her, hugging her monumental curves so tightly it was impossible not to stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery frowned, puzzled. \u201cI did? Huh. Gimme a sec, it\u2019ll come to me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn sighed, and then locked eyes directly with you. Your heart leapt for joy at being spotted, but after a second, Quinn\u2019s face didn\u2019t show recognition at all. In fact, she seemed to just be staring at you analytically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another second, Quinn nodded. \u201cNice tan, by the way. Looks really good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hope crashed into pieces, as your worst fears were realized. After hours baking in the sun, both you and Avery were now glowing with a brilliant bronze sheen. Not only were you smeared to the point of only having one eye visible, but your entire body was the same color as Avery\u2019s skin tone. To make matters worse, the heat of the sun had just about cemented you to Avery\u2019s pores, practically fusing you to her skin. And, of course, the matter of being stuck to her left underboob of all places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn grabbed Avery and helped the pink-haired girl stand up. As she did so, Avery\u2019s breasts fell back into place, smashing you into an embrace of sweat and darkness. You felt overwhelming despair as your horrible situation dawned on you. How would you possibly get out of this now? Could you get out of this, or were you just a new, secret little tattoo on the busty ditz\u2019s tits?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Avery reached for her cute bikini to put back on, Quinn put her hands on her hips. \u201cSo, remember what you needed me for yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before Avery slid her top back on, she paused to bite her lip and think. A minute later, she replied.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cOh yeah! Hunter!\u201d Avery jokingly slapped her forehead. Quinn raised an eyebrow, not seeing you around, so she was confused what Avery was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHunter? What about him?\u201d Quinn asked flatly. It was clear that Quinn had little patience for people wasting her time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe kinda got stuck to my boob... and I can\u2019t get him off,\u201d Avery sheepishly smiled at Quinn, embarrassed by admitting that she had forgotten you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, so where is he? I didn\u2019t notice him when you were lying down earlier, and your skin tones are quite different so surely I\u2019d have spotted him,\u201d Quinn, normally the type to let you try and solve your own problems, was confused, and slightly concerned, that she hadn\u2019t seen you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? He was squished to my left underboob. The little cutie buzzed to remind me to put some sunscreen on him before we started tanning together to pass the time while we waited on you. Maybe he freed himself?\u201d <br>\r\nYou tried your hardest to buzz to let Avery know that you were still stuck, but you were so engrained to the jiggling flesh that you couldn\u2019t make any movements whatsoever. You\u2019d just have to hope that Quinn would spot you, because you doubt Avery would look for you here again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, you tanned with Hunter still stuck to you? Avery, that could be really bad. Hunter could fuse to your skin if you tan for too long with him on you,\u201d Quinn struggled not to facepalm at her new roommate\u2019s stupidity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, what! You mean little cute Hunter could be, like, totally glued to my breast FOREVER!\u201d Avery was finally realising the gravity of the situation and was beginning to panic. \u201cQuinn can you please, please, PLEASE get him off?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn nodded and took Avery to one of the family changing rooms. Avery\u2019s too small bikini top allowing her chest to bounce and wobble as they hurried, battering your crushed form further and further into their sweaty embrace. By the time the two women got into a changing room all of the shaking had made you dizzy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the bikini top that was pressing you into Avery\u2019s breast lift off of you, and the breast you were attached to dropped down once again, pressing you into Avery\u2019s chest. Not long after the weight was lifted off of you and you could see light once again, as well as Quinn\u2019s face scanning Avery\u2019s skin for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn\u2019s brow was furrowed in concentration as she closely examined every square inch of Avery\u2019s underboob for you, knowing that you would be incredibly difficult to spot, now that Avery had tanned. You tried to wiggle or twitch, anything to draw Quinn\u2019s attention to your one visible eye, but you were just too crushed to do anything. You couldn\u2019t even blink. You would just have to hope that Quinn would spot you unassisted. <br>\r\nSuddenly Quinn\u2019s neutral expression shifted slightly, a glint of recognition flashed across her eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cFound him,\u201d Quinn said flatly, clearly not enthused about inspecting Avery\u2019s underboob. You would have cheered if you could have, Quinn finding you was practically a guarantee that you would get off of here eventually! <br>\r\n\u201cI had a friend get into a similar situation in high school. Wasn\u2019t as bad as this though. I\u2019ll just try the thing that got him off,\u201d with that you saw Quinn\u2019s hand approach, holding a piece of tape. You cringed, knowing this was going to hurt a lot, but if it got you off of Avery\u2019s boob then it would be all worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn wordlessly pressed the tape onto you and Avery\u2019s underboob for about thirty seconds before, satisfied that it was sufficiently stuck, grabbing an edge and ripping it off in one swift motion. You had already braced yourself, but the pain of the tape tugging against your skin in a tug-of-war with Avery\u2019s skin was much more painful than you had anticipated. Your vision blurred from the pain and you heard Avery squeal out in pain as well.<br>\r\nWhen your vision cleared you looked at Avery\u2019s face, contorted in a pained grimace... wait, Avery\u2019s face! You were free!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw, Quinn! Did you have to pull so hard?\u201d Avery complained, while rubbing the area of her skin that you had been adhered to, which now had a bright pink splotch where your body used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had to be sure he\u2019d come off,\u201d Quinn said flatly, before slowly peeling your paper thin form off of the piece of tape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I guess, doesn\u2019t make it hurt any less,\u201d Avery pouted. Her face softened when she saw you on Quinn\u2019s open palm, and then immediately switched back to flirty. \u201cBut it was all worth it, now that my little cute roomie is free! Tell me the truth Hunter, apart from getting stuck to them, weren\u2019t my boobies the best, most comfortable pillows you\u2019ve ever had!\u201d<br>\r\nAs Avery said this she leaned forward, placing her hands on her knees and using her upper arms to press her boobs together, still braless, which pushed them up and made the valley of her cleavage even deeper. You heard a heavy sigh leave Quinn behind you, a sentiment you would share if your lungs were inflated, and also if you weren\u2019t entranced by Avery\u2019s show she was putting on. You should have been  terrified of Avery\u2019s breasts considering that not five minutes ago you were in very real danger of being a permanent addition to them, but your rational part of your brain was seemingly not in charge right now as you stared longingly into the crevasse of her cleavage. Now that the danger to you had passed, Avery seemed to have forgotten all about it and went straight back to flirting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell... I\u2019m gonna go, got to get back to work. Bridgette will be wondering where I\u2019ve disappeared to,\u201d Quinn said before tossing your crumpled form to Avery without warning. Avery fumbled to catch you, before grinning cutely down at your flattened form in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Quinn, you\u2019re the best!\u201d Avery grinned. \u201cAlso, you look totes hot in that bikini by the way!\u201d<br>\r\nAs Avery finished her compliment with a wink and a giggle, you saw Quinn\u2019s face turn beetroot red. She quietly whispered \u201cT-thanks\u201d before quickly shuffling out of the changing room.<br>\r\nAfter Quinn left, Avery turned her attention back to you.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, cutie, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re off my boob now. We\u2019ve still got a few hours of fun at the beach as well!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery approached her towel, which was exactly where she had left it. You had reformed on the walk over, and Avery was carrying you in her palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing we\u2019ve got a few hours left to tan, Hunter. Your tan is, like, so uneven,\u201d Avery giggled as you inspected yourself. She was right, since you had been stuck to her breast face-up, your front was nicely bronzed but your back was completely unchanged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if that\u2019s the case then yours will be uneven as well, since I was blocking part of your underboob that won\u2019t have been tanned either,\u201d you smirked at Avery as she gasped and tried to inspect her boob, remembering quickly that she couldn\u2019t see that part of her breast, that was the whole reason for your trip to the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw man, really? That sucks,\u201d she pouted. Just as quickly as the pout appeared, it was replaced by Avery\u2019s exuberant smile. \u201cOh well, guess we\u2019ll just have to sit out here for the rest of the day!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery later down on her towel, depositing you on her belly. Looking up towards Avery\u2019s gorgeous face, you could see that it was mostly obscured by her ample chest. Avery peaked over the twin mounds of her cleavage, sitting up slightly to do it, which caused you to slide down her belly towards the awaiting hole of her belly button. Avery pinned you to her warm belly with a finger.<br>\r\n\u201cBetter enjoy your time tanning, you certainly have a good view,\u201d she teased you, knowing that you would be staring at her boobs. \u201cAnd I know I\u2019m totes enjoying mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stared at you, you followed her gaze and realised that you were shirtless from sleeping last night. Slightly embarrassed, your face flushed pink, but this only seemed to make Avery giggle and up the flirtation written all over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, am I embarrassing you, cutie,\u201d as she said this the finger pinning you to her stomach moves, the slope not steep enough to have you slide further, and begins to lightly stroke and prod your torso with the long, slender digit. <br>\r\nAfter a while of this teasing, you couldn\u2019t help but feel your lower half begin to respond. Your flushed pink cheeks shifted to a full crimson blush, you silently prayed that Avery wouldn\u2019t notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoohh, what\u2019s this?\u201d Avery cooed. \u201cAre you enjoying this cutie?\u201d<br>\r\nYou tried your best to cross your legs and hide your shame, but it was too late.<br>\r\nAvery winked and grinned down at you as she stopped her teasing before pinching your legs between two of her fingers and lifting you up to her face. Dangling you above her head, Avery started to pucker her lips and slowly lower you towards then, smacking them together as you were lowered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Avery, cut it out! Put me down!\u201d You protested and started to squirm, but as you were lowered towards Avery\u2019s puckered lips, you knew she wasn\u2019t going to stop teasing you, you would just have to put up with it until something interrupted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Nothing interrupts her, Avery continues to tease you.<br>\r\n2) Someone interrupts Avery before she kisses you.<br>\r\n3) Writer\u2019s Choice.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Now, let's get you situated. I have a nice warm sleeping bag picked out for you.\"<br>\r\nAs those words left Avery\u2019s smiling mouth she sat up and began sliding her foot out of her fluffy pink sock. <br>\r\nYou began to panic at the thought of spending the night squished up next to Avery\u2019s foot.<br>\r\n\u201cA-Avery, I-I\u2019m not sure this is such a great idea,\u201d you tried to reason with her, already regretting not deciding to room with Morgan. Avery\u2019s innocent smile never left her face, clearly not understanding why you were anxious about rooming up with her massive foot.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, cutie. This\u2019ll be totes the comfiest bed you\u2019ve ever had. Plus you\u2019ll have five cute little friends in there to cuddle with all night,\u201d to emphasise her point, she wiggled all 5 of her toes teasingly at you. At your size her toes may have been seen by some people as cute, but they were definitely not little, the smallest one was almost the same size as you.  \u201cThey\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re nice and warm. And hey, if you\u2019re worried about it being a bit smelly I only showered like 2 hours ago, I use a fruity lotion that I know you\u2019ll love the smell of. You\u2019ll be glad your rooming with my cute toes, I can tell you from personal experience that Morgan\u2019s feet reek after she\u2019s done with a work out, which is basically always. You\u2019ll be glad you picked me. Anyway I\u2019ll get you all tucked in.\u201d<br>\r\nAs Avery plucked you up off the bed with a wink, you couldn\u2019t help but be shocked at how airheaded she was. If you had chose to room with Morgan then you wouldn\u2019t be anywhere near her feet! Did Avery think this was what people did normally with tiny guys?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery hoisted you over to her foot, her toes were wiggling in anticipation. You turned your head to plead with Avery, but as you looked up to her happy, carefree face staring down at you with a childlike glee you realised there probably wasn\u2019t anything you could say to stop this.<br>\r\nYou were lowered down to her now bare foot, between her big and second toes. She gently grasps you between the two massive appendages, surprising you at how gentle she could be, not crushing you at all. Before you could get another word in your world went dark as you were covered by the pink fluffy sock she was pulling back over her foot, trapping you inside with it. The air immediately became much hotter and it trapped the overpowering scent of Avery\u2019s berry scented lotion in with you. Avery\u2019s preference of tight clothing seemed to extend slightly to her socks as well, as the presence of the sock seemed to press her toes in on you slightly, holding you firmly in place between her big and second toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy that her sock was on and her cute little roommate was secure, Avery happily flopped back into her bed with a content sigh.<br>\r\n\u201cGoodnight cutie. Hope you get on well with your bunkmates,\u201d she snickers playfully as her toes gently squeeze you, slightly compressing your tiny form without her realising. \u201cI\u2019ve got the day off tomorrow, so when Morgan and Quinn go to work we\u2019ll have the whole house to ourselves, we can get up to so much fun, I can\u2019t wait!\u201d<br>\r\nShe stopped talking to you after that and you assumed she was going to sleep. Trying your best to go to sleep yourself in the stuffy, hot environment of Avery\u2019s sock, you almost managed to. Until Avery started to move in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Avery rolled around, she kicked out her legs and scrunched her toes, all gentleness her feet once showed you was gone now that she was sleeping. Her toes mercilessly crushed your minuscule form further into the recess between her toes, compacting you further and further. Even now after what you only assumed was around a half hour her feet were starting to sweat, the salty smell and taste quickly beginning to overpower her lotion. You tried to scream out to get Avery\u2019s attention, but your crushed form only managed a small buzz against the sensitive skin between her toes. You heard Avery mumble something indistinguishable, before there was a shifting sound as she moved her other foot around to scratch the spot you had irritated. Her gargantuan big toe on her other foot plunged between her big and second toe, pushing you further into the crevices and silencing your cries for help. <br>\r\nThe itch now gone, Avery let out another content sigh and rolled over once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mangled body was now nothing but an unrecognisable tan smear between Avery\u2019s toes. The constant motion and scrunching of the surrounding digits kept your body from being able to reform and if anything only compacted you further. You started to worry about how difficult it could be to get out of here if this treatment continued all night, hopefully Avery wouldn\u2019t forget you in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like hours of this treatment you felt Avery\u2019s toes stop moving as she came to what seemed like a restful part of her sleep. You immediately began trying to reform and pull yourself out of this crevice on your roommates foot that every squeeze of her toes seemed to push you deeper into, but you found that your reforming was taking a long time. Just as you felt yourself making some progress her other big toe returned to scratch the irritation that you were obviously causing by struggling to reform, crushing you back into the recesses of Avery\u2019s foot even worse than you were before, before retreating and Avery lay still once again. This repeated a few times before you passed out from exhaustion, crushed even worse than you were before trying to reform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were woken up by the sound of Avery yawning softly as she woke up, stretched her legs out, which splayed her toes to the side, giving you your first respite from the crushing embrace of her toes since last night. After she stretched and the constricting toes returned, you noticed a little less pressure than there was before you passed out, it looked like you had been compacted further into the crevices while you weren\u2019t awake. You hoped you weren\u2019t too crushed to get out on your own, or failing that, for Avery to get you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh what an amazing sleep I had! Should probably go for a shower before I get on with my day off, how did you sleep cutie...\u201d<br>\r\nShe looked around the bed for you, clearly having forgotten where you were. You started to panic, if she had forgotten where you were you could be trapped in here all day at least! <br>\r\n\u201cHunter? Where are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a tense moment of her searching, her toes scrunched up over the top of you, painfully crushing you.<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) \u201c... he was in my sock, duh!\u201d (Avery remembers where you are and is able to free you.)<br>\r\n2) \u201c... he was in my sock, duh!\u201d (Avery remembers you but is unable to free you/ can\u2019t find you.)<br>\r\n3) \u201c... he must have gotten up early and went downstairs!\u201d (Avery has completely forgotten about you.)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking up at your three giantess roommates from Morgan\u2019s hand, your eyes traveled from the exuberant energy of Avery, the interested warmth of Morgan, and finally to the complete nonchalance of Quinn. In fact, Quinn wasn\u2019t even looking at you, she was clearly reading something on her phone. The logical side of your brain was screaming at you to pick Morgan. She had an entire corner of her room unused that you could comfortably fit in. Plus she was by far the most reliable out of the three. But some part of you held you back. You thought about it for a moment then realized that if you wanted to be babied then you would have just moved back home after graduating college. You wanted to be an adult, and living on your own meant literally living on your own as much as possible. No doubt about it, even knowing that you lived with a responsible woman like Morgan brought you great peace of mind. But as for the literal room you wanted to live in, you craved a bit more freedom. For this reason once again your gaze turned to the utterly uninterested Quinn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I want to dig out some space in your room, Quinn, if that\u2019s cool with you.\u201d You said up to the three. Avery\u2019s jaw dropped with shock, Morgan\u2019s eyebrows raised as well, and Quinn simply looked up from her phone, looked towards you, and responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah sure, you don\u2019t take up much space anyway so it works for me.\u201d Quinn said. \u201cI already have your stuff so hop on and we\u2019ll find a spot to set you up.\u201d Quinn held out her hand close to Morgan\u2019s and you rather daringly hopped across the divide. Rather impressed by even this small feat of strength, the three women smiled down at you. Both of the twins had their doubts about your choice of living situation, but they weren\u2019t the boss of you by any means, so they simply let it be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright you two go get set up, we\u2019re going to head downstairs and hang out. Come join when you\u2019re all done!\u201d Morgan said, Avery excitedly nodding in agreement. The two then turned and walked down the hallway and down the stairs. Quinn simply walked the two of you back into her mess of a room. There was hardly a square inch of space not covered with some article of clothing. Luckily it seemed like other than being a bit untidy, she didn\u2019t have any really nasty things laying around like trash or food. You could handle some spare clothing no sweat. Reaching a spot smack in between Quinn\u2019s bed, her dresser, and the path to her closet, she peered downward and with one bare foot began kicking articles of clothing to the side. Eventually she cleared a few feet of space and dropped your duffel bag down, lowering you down rather quickly as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s your space, set up your stuff however you want, makes no difference to me.\u201d Quinn said, already walking towards her queen bed and flopping down on it, pulling out her phone to continue browsing. You hopped up onto your duffel bag and grabbed the zipper that was as big as you were, effortfully unzipping the bag open. Your sister Tracy had packed almost everything herself, an act which took her no more than five minutes. You knew it would take you significantly longer to unpack everything. Once again you thought about how quickly either Avery or Morgan would have set all of your belongings up if you had decided to room with them, but you felt some deep satisfaction going through the arduous process of doing it yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours must have passed of you painstakingly dragging items out of your duffel bag and onto the patch of carpet beside you. Somehow, Quinn stayed laying on her bed the entire time, part of the time browsing social media on her phone, and part of the time napping. By now you were pretty exhausted, you had set up your wardrobe and bed at least. Your bed being a sample square of memory foam given to your family by a salesperson along with a frame made out of popsicle sticks that you had fashioned together. Your wardrobe was a repurposed cracker box, that you fitted with a few tiny shelves to separate your things. In reality there had already been a variety of tiny versions of products made for the shrunken population of men, but you took some pride in making things yourself. Collapsing onto your bed to relax, mirroring your giantess roommate, you closed your eyes and chilled out for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, after hours of immobility from Quinn, this was the exact moment which she stood up to head downstairs and figure out what the girls would do for dinner. Her first step off of her bed pressed down onto a pile of laundry, a feeling she had grown used to over the years. But her second step brought with it a bit of squish, along with a surprisingly loud series of crunches. Quinn casually looked down beneath her, leaving her foot where it was. Standing at 5\u201910\u201d Quinn had appropriately large feet for a woman of her height. For that reason in a single step her heel had obliterated your handmade dresser, while her toes had shattered the frame of your bed, squishing down onto the bit of memory foam on top, as well as your tiny body. She looked down more carefully and saw your tiny body, now eyes wide open, pinched between her second and third toes and staring up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh shit, did I just destroy your stuff? My bad, dude. You probably should have set your stuff up somewhere else in retrospect. We\u2019ll figure somewhere else out for you to sleep after dinner though.\u201d Quinn\u2019s half-assed apology caught you off guard. You could tell part of it was genuine, but at the same time you knew that her intentions of forcing you to \u201cbe strong on your own\u201d were going to lead to many events like this in the future. Case in point, with any other woman you would have expected her to reach down and save you from your current position and toe jam, but not Quinn. She simply lifted the foot you were trapped on, brushed the broken popsicle sticks off of her sole, then returned both you and her toes to the carpeted ground. The top half of your body was sitting pinched between her toes, and the bottom half of your body was smashed under the ball of her foot with every step. You knew this was what you signed up for when choosing to live with Quinn, but man you expected to have at least a bit of a break after the hours of ass squashing earlier that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a moment she reached the living room and plopped down onto the couch next to Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Quinn\u201d Morgan said. \u201cWhere\u2019s Hunter at?\u201d Quinn simply lifted her feet and plopped them on the ottoman in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI stepped on him accidentally in my room, he\u2019s right here between my toes. So what\u2019re we doing for dinner?\u201d Quinn said both these sentences with the exact same inflection, paying no special attention to you at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery gasped, \u201cQuinn come on can\u2019t you give the little guy a break? He\u2019s been through a lot today!\u201d Avery looked right at you, and was just about to reach out and save you, but you pried Quinn\u2019s massive toes apart using your upper body strength! Your lower half still being slightly crushed, you fluttered down onto the ottoman beneath you, coming to rest beside Quinn\u2019s foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m chillin, don\u2019t worry about me ladies!\u201d You said, dragging yourself away from the massive sole next to you while simultaneously putting on a sense of bravado as if you were in control of the situation the whole time. Both Avery and Morgan then chuckled, Quinn giving you a slight but still noticeable nod of approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo really, what are our dinner plans?\u201d You said.</span></div></div>",

How does the local pizza restaurant sound? I think it\u2019s called Pizza Palace?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a thumbs up. \u201cSounds good to me! I can always go for some pizza.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery burst into giggles. \u201cOMG! And, and, I bet you only eat, like, a tiny little bit of a slice! That\u2019s so adorable!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed, as you really did eat next to nothing compared to everyone around you whenever you went out. You looked back at your black-haired roomie. \u201cIs pizza alright with you, Quinn?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPredictably, Quinn shrugged. \u201cSure, can\u2019t complain. If it\u2019s what everyone else wants.\u201d Though her response had been traditionally apathetic, you caught the faint glint in her eyes and the rising curve in the corners of her mouth. She\u2019d never admit it, but you could tell that Quinn was head-over-heels for pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn shuffled away to grab some things, and Morgan followed suit. You moved to do the same, until you felt a soft, delicate hand wrap around you from behind and hoist you up into the air. A short gasp escaped your lips before you were whirled around to face the angelic smile of Avery, a playful expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Pizza Palace it is then, huh, Hunter? Gosh, I can not wait to see your adorbs face stuffed with gooey cheese!\u201d The pink-haired girl grinned from ear-to-ear, and her infectious energy rubbed off on you, just a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, it should be great.\u201d You agreed, and then paused. \u201cIs there\u2026uh\u2026any particular reason you picked me up to say that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery smirked in a mischievous manner. \u201cWell, eating out can be scary for tinies, I beat. Lots of big girls like me walking around everywhere. We need to make sure you don\u2019t get lost, cutie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Well, I appreciate that, Avery, but\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo! I\u2019ve got a special place for you, dude!\u201d Avery giggled, and then released her grip on you. Another startled cry strained out of your mouth as you fell, but it wasn\u2019t long before you impacted against Avery\u2019s soft, squishy left breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking your face up from Avery\u2019s boob, your face blushing deep red, you looked up at her in confusion. \u201cA-Avery! What are you doing? You don\u2019t have to carry me in your clea\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery silenced you by placing her index finger on your head and lightly pushing, smushing your lips flat. She then swiped across her breast, dragging your body forward and knocking you into the absolute abyss of her cleavage. Your limbs sprawled and flailed in a futile attempt to stop yourself from falling in. All you succeeded in doing, however, was uselessly slapping and ticking Avery\u2019s sensitive skin, earning a small smile and faint blush from the flirtatious giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one emphatic shake of her prodigious chest, Avery watched as your tiny body was enveloped in the jiggling of her breasts, and you disappeared from view deep into her cleavage. All that surrounded you was darkness and soft, hot flesh. Your body crumpled in on itself in the tight confines of the busty girl\u2019s cleavage, sounds of the outside world muffled. All you could clearly hear was Avery\u2019s ecstatic heartbeat, and your own troubled thoughts, torn between mild arousal and indignation at Avery\u2019s treatment of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill staring at her tits, and enjoying the feeling of you between them, Avery almost missed Quinn standing in the corner of the room. Looking up, Avery met Quinn\u2019s eye. The black-haired girl, who had witnessed the entire incident, rolled her eyes and looked back at her phone. Avery merely stuck out her tongue and winked, then strolled over to the front door, relishing the feeling of her new, adorable tiny roommate squeezed so intimately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was the last to the front door, and she looked at Quinn and Avery with a raised eyebrow. \u201cWhere\u2019s Hunter? One of you carrying him?\u201d She inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn lazily glanced at Avery, who stumbled a bit before recovering. \u201cUm\u2026yes! He\u2019s totes in my pocket. Yep!\u201d The enthusiastic girl gestured to the side pocket of her booty shorts, patting it affectionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan, having no reason to doubt her twin sister, merely nodded. \u201cAh, gotcha. At least he won\u2019t get lost that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the three girls (and you) left the apartment and headed out to Morgan\u2019s car. Avery slid neatly into the back seat while Quinn sat beside Morgan up front. Morgan turned on some catchy music and pulled out onto the road, driving off to Pizza Palace. It was a fifteen-minute drive, and the time passed by for the girls pretty easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed much slower for you. With each passing second, more and more sweat accumulated between Avery\u2019s succulent, shapely breasts, and that same sweat rolled right over you. To make matters worse, Morgan accidentally hit a pothole in the road that caused Avery\u2019s boobs to quake like crazy, and they heavy mounds of flesh mashed you tight, reducing you to a flattened smear on her tits. Mentally, you groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the girls pulled up to Pizza Palace, surprised to find it so packed. Getting out of the car first, Quinn walked off to request a booth, while Morgan and Avery took their time. Avery was second out of the car, and she was just about to dash off to the main entrance of the restaurant when Morgan grabbed her by the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAvery. Where is Hunter?\u201d Morgan said. \u201cAbout time to get him out of your pocket, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery paused for a moment, blinked, and then gasped. \u201cOh! Hunter! Totes slipped my mind, hee hee!\u201d She giggled, prompting a groan from Morgan. \u201cForgot he was in my pocket!\u201d Avery reached to her pocket to grab you, but came up empty. She checked her other pocket, but was similarly unsuccessful in retrieving you. Beginning to panic, Avery looked at her sister. Morgan merely raised an eyebrow, wondering what was taking so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the short span of the car ride, what Avery had done to you had completely flooded out of the ditzy giantess\u2019 mind. This was in part due to the pothole squashing you so flat between her boobs that she could no longer feel you. Thankfully, when Avery began looking herself over in search of where else she could\u2019ve put you, her scatterbrain reconnected the dots as soon as she glimpsed her abundant cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheepishly, Avery grimaced at Morgan and then stuck a hand down her cleavage. Morgan stared, wide-eyed, as her twin sister felt herself up looking for you, and finally hooked you on her fingernail and pulled you free. By this point, annoyance had overtaken surprise, and Morgan yanked you away from Avery. She began wiping you down with her shirt, trying to get the accumulated sweat off of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you, Avery.\u201d Morgan sighed, pushing past her demure-acting sister. \u201cOne day. LESS than one day, and you\u2019re making moves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery ran alongside Morgan as they entered Pizza Palace. \u201cHe\u2019s super adorbs, Morgan! How could I help myself with a hot little guy like him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan didn\u2019t dignify that with a response, so Avery grew quiet. The twins met up with Quinn and a harried looking waitress. The waitress was dressed in a red blouse and black slacks, an outfit that wouldn\u2019t have been flattering if it wasn\u2019t a size too small. As it was, the blouse and slacks pressed hard against the girl\u2019s decently curvy body, creating a surprisingly alluring visual. A small nametag pinned to her breast read \u201cLila\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLila brushed some of her long, frizzy brown hair out of her face, simultaneously rubbing sleep out of her eyes. \u201cYour table is\u2026*yawn*\u2026this way.\u201d She murmured, and then wandered off, the three girls following dutifully. As they walked, you finally finished reforming in Morgan\u2019s palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you took in the sights of Pizza Palace. It was pretty big for a pizza restaurant, and it was almost packed to max capacity. Over fifty patrons filled the tables and booths, and five other waitresses bussed busily from customer to customer. You could make out a small play place and a few arcade machines in one corner, as well as the door to the kitchen in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLila eventually gestured to an empty booth, and Quinn and Avery slid in, each girl taking a menu from Lila. Morgan was last, but before she sat, she gently dropped you onto the corner of the table. She then settled in, and picked up her own menu, and as you looked at Quinn and Avery, you found them both similarly consumed by reading their menus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a few minutes for drinks.\u201d Lila explained, and each of your new roommates nodded or uttered an appreciative \u2018thanks\u2019. However, before she stepped back from the table, Lila spotted you, and the brown-haired waitress frowned. Her overwhelming exhaustion was blurring her vision, to say nothing of the fact that she\u2019d forgotten her glasses at home, but she could\u2019ve sworn there was a bug on the table. Frowning, she swatted it aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you were in no way a bug, but the far-sighted, weary waitress didn\u2019t know that. You couldn\u2019t even cry out before her giant hand slapped you off the table and onto the floor. Your new roommates didn\u2019t notice a thing, too busy scanning their menus. You could only splat down onto the floor, flattening out a bit from the fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking yourself up, you looked and saw Lila take a step towards you, off to continue her waitress duties without a clue you were beneath her. As her black boot raised itself over you, you fought with all your might to move, before this little dinner excursion became a nightmare all onto itself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sadly, though you possessed the full motor functions needed to escape from Lila\u2019s boot in any other circumstance, the oblivious waitress simply wasn\u2019t giving you enough time to act. You\u2019d barely moved a muscle before her foot slammed down, and your miniscule body was smushed into a flat blob under her heel. Your body squelching barely made a noise, and as Lila walked off, both she and your three new roommates were totally unaware of the fate that had befallen you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach step Lila took only smashed your body into even more of a blob, and you were left utterly defenseless as you began to stick to the bottom of her boot. You had no idea where she was going, but as the soft carpet crashing into you was replaced with hard, smooth flooring, you had to assume she\u2019d entered the kitchen. This fact alone filled you with fear. A kitchen was never a place that a tiny like you would want to be without supervision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, fate wasn\u2019t giving you much of a choice in the matter, but it did throw you a bone, at the very least. Lila stopped for a second by the chef\u2019s counter, where there was a small, rough floor mat. Grinding her heels across the mat, Lila casually freed dirt and bits of food from the treads in her boots. She did this nearly a hundred times a day, so she spared no extra thought to the almost imperceptible feeling of a squishy blob rolling off her heel and onto the mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of this, you were saved, but in no less dangerous a situation. Lying flat on the ground, you worked overtime on focusing your body to reform, and watched as Lila shuffled away, no doubt headed to get the drink requests from your roommates. She was replaced a moment later by the Pizza Palace chef, a pleasantly attractive redhead who had an apron tied across her blouse. She, too, nearly stepped on you, but thankfully missed by a few inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPopping back to normal size, you figured that trying to escape through the kitchen by yourself was a fool-hardy effort. A cursory glance around helped you to spot no less than two other chefs and three other waitresses tromping around the place, heedless to what lie beneath their feet. A single misstep could get you crushed to another girl\u2019s shoe, and if they didn\u2019t wipe their feet like Lila had, you could be stuck for quite a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis left getting someone\u2019s attention as your primary choice, and seeing as how one of the chefs was right beside you, you picked her as your target. The only downside was that the kitchen was abuzz with noise, whether it was beeping ovens, hissing steam from grills, or employee\u2019s shouting orders. There was no way you\u2019d be heard from down on the ground, so you took a deep breath and began climbing the counter beside you, the one the chef was standing by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wood of the counter had a few chips and cracks in it, which was exactly what you knew you\u2019d need to scale it. Using these imperfections as your handholds, you were able to rely on your fairly fit body and high capacity for stamina to scramble up the side of the counter. Eventually, you flopped onto the countertop, took a second to wipe sweat from your brow, and then you hustled over to the chef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before you opened your mouth to speak, you hesitated, and that hesitation ended up costing you quite dearly. The chef had turned away from you, her hand resting right beside you. In her other hand was a gigantic glob of dough. On the counter around you was a rolling pan and a wooden pallet. The scent of dough and flour was overwhelming. Somehow, in all of your panic, you\u2019d yet to truly consider that the counter you were climbing was one where pizza was made. After all, you were smack in the middle of a hectic restaurant kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your same moment of hesitation, the chef turned back to face you, her hand gliding across the counter. As it did so, she accidentally back-handed you, flinging your miniature body backwards towards the center of the counter, beside the rolling pin. You collapsed onto your back, winded from the hit, and gasping for air so you could begin shouting. Looking up at the redheaded chef, you saw her gaze squarely locked on the electronic sign above you, which stated incoming orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026uh\u2026okay! Standard pepperoni! Easy peasy!\u201d The chef grinned with confidence. All while keeping her eyes on the electronic order sign, the hefted the chunky glob of dough up onto the counter, and let it fall from her hands, smacking down heavily. Of course, this also meant that it fell straight where you were, and with nowhere to run or escape to, you could only let out a strangled scream as you were buried under the mountain of dough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally looking down, the chef went to work, blissfully unaware of the extra ingredient she\u2019d just added to her pepperoni pizza recipe. With the effortless ease of a professional, the chef kneaded and shaped the dough, using the rolling pin to squeeze it across the counter into the perfect shape of a world-class Pizza Palace pizza. With the application of the rolling pin, your body was mashed and mangled beneath the dough, buried and out of sight. All your attempts at screaming were muffled beyond human hearing capability, and it was far to heavy and pressuring to wriggle free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, with the pizza set in its basic shape, the chef turned to fetch the toppings and ingredients, humming a happy little tune. Desperate to not succumb to this fate, you bit through the dough overtop of you, clawing your way to freedom. It was disgusting, and you felt ready to burst from fullness after just a few bites, but finally you freed your head from the doughy pizza prison. The bright kitchen lights temporarily blinded you, so you squinted and shouted to the heavens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPLEASE! HELP M\u2013\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cries were almost immediately silenced, as a heavy downpour of sticky, viscous red sauce rained from above, splattering onto the pizza. The sauce flooded into your mouth and soaked your head and hair, causing you to sputter and gag. It stung your eyes, but your arms were still too stuck to wipe away the sauce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing applying the sauce, the chef froze, and frowned. She leaned forward, frowned deeper, then glanced around. \u201cHuh\u2026could\u2019ve sworn I heard someone\u2026so weird!\u201d She sighed and laughed, turning to the next topping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeaving up sauce from your throat, you coughed rapidly and prepared to cry out again, efforts renewed by the knowledge that the chef could actually hear you. If you could just shout out again, you might genuinely be saved. However, before you could finish sputtering out the remnants of sauce clogging your throat, the chef returned with freshly sliced mozzarella, and rained it haphazardly across the surface of the pizza. Your only response was to widen your eyes and gurgle out an unheard cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat appeared to be the largest bit of cheese slapped right into your face, shoving you back down into the dough and burying you from view. It also indented the dough a bit, which allowed the swamp of sauce to flood around you, submerging you completely. It was like you were being entombed in sauce, and everything became darkness. Only the knowledge that tinies couldn\u2019t drown kept you from falling into utter despair at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that despair resurfaced a few minutes later, as you felt the chef lift her creation up with the wooden pallet, and carry you across the kitchen. As the humidity of your pizza prison increased tenfold, and you heard a muted metallic bang, you knew that you\u2019d been place inside of the oven. In seconds, the temperature began to rise by extreme degrees, and you couldn\u2019t help but exclaim in agony (which only earned you another mouthful of sauce pouring in).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe oven was hell; there was really no other delicate way to put it. The pizza remained in for twenty minutes, during which you sweat so much that your whole body felt dried of moisture. Your skin sizzled and had burned bright red, a fact which you only vaguely realized helped your miniscule tiny body to blend in even more with the sauce all around you. Your head was faint and foggy, and you teetered on the edge of passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely took note of the pizza being retrieved from the oven and placed back on the counter. It was hard to remain focus. All desire to break free had left you after the ordeal in the oven, and you wished only to sleep. You had long since lost the strength to claw or eat your way out, especially now that the sauce, cheese, and dough had solidified around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate clearly wanted to prolong this torture, and wasn\u2019t content to merely kill you. The redheaded chef, still humming her happy song, sliced the pizza into nice symmetrical slices, narrowly avoiding bisecting your body. She then grabbed a nearby carton of fries and box of chicken strips, prepared for her by one of the other Pizza Palace chefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got my next order?\u201d A voice said, and the chef turned to see Reagan, Pizza Palace\u2019s most experienced delivery worker. She had her motorcycle helmet under her arm, and her delivery bag slung over her shoulder. \u201cJust got back from a delivery, ready for the next one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you just like riding your motorcycle.\u201d The chef teased. \u201cBut, yes, I do have one ready.\u201d She reached for a to-go box, but stopped at the sight of Lila strolling back into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLila yawned, then spoke. \u201cIs there a pepperoni pizza ready to go for those three girls?\u201d She looked down at your pizza prison. \u201cOh. Yes there is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chef held up a hand. \u201cHold on, Lila. Reagan wanted this pizza. Her delivery is also important.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan shrugged. \u201cActually, give it to whoever. When was each order placed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chef tapped her chin. \u201cI\u2019ll have to check. Give me a second\u2026\u201d She said, looking at the electronic order sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you barely heard any of this conversation, some innate part of you knew that your immediate future was hanging in the balance.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your heart sank as you heard the chef say that your pizza would be going to Reagan\u2019s next delivery. You were going to end up at a complete stranger\u2019s house. This meant that not only would this stranger not be looking for a tiny man, but even if you did manage to escape this pizza prison, it would be much harder for you to get back to your roommates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the chef boxed up your pizza your fate was sealed, you felt like you wouldn\u2019t be getting back to your roommates any time soon. You could barely see before from the sauce and cheese covering you but the darkness inside the now closed box robbed you of what little sight you had. Your world shifted as the box was lifted and handed to Reagan, who you faintly heard thanking the chef. The box began to rock back and forth as Reagan walked out of the kitchen and through the restaurant towards the front door. You could hear the muffled sounds of the restaurant through the box, and you swear for a split second you heard Morgan say, \u201cHey guys, have you seen Hunter?\u201d<br>\r\nMorgan\u2019s voice disappeared as quickly as you heard it and you could only cry internally as it was too late, they wouldn\u2019t find you now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan swung the door open, holding it for a few customers who were just coming in, before sauntering over to her motorbike, several pizza boxes in hand. She had a few deliveries to do on this run and she was looking forward to having some more time riding her bike, not knowing about her tiny passenger sitting at the bottom of the pile of boxes she was carrying. If she knew you were in there she\u2019d have done everything in her power to get you out, she cared deeply about tiny guys. As if to emphasise this, she paused her walk briefly when she felt like there was gum stuck to her foot, she sat the pizza boxes down on her bike\u2019s seat and lifted her foot up to peel the tiny guy she had accidentally stepped on. She apologised profusely and ran back into Pizza Palace to hand him to the group of women she had held the door open for, who were now frantically searching for their tiny friend.<br>\r\nThat minor distraction out of the way she got back to her bike, secured the pizzas in the bag to keep them warm during the journey, and set off. <br>\r\nYou hoped that over the journey the constant motion would help to possibly dislodge you, but the stacked pizza boxes kept movement to a minimum. Also as the pizza cooled slightly, not a lot in part due to the heat sealed bag, the crust seemed to harden slightly, as did the cheese covering you. This made the surrounding pizza hold you in even more tightly. You sighed when you noticed this, it seemed that everything was going against you today, all you wanted was to have a nice dinner with your new roommates and get to know them better, but now it looked like you were destined to end up in the stomach of a random stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter around twenty minutes, with a few deliveries in between, you felt your pizza box lifted, and the familiar motion of Reagan carrying the box to the door where you were to be delivered to. You heard a feminine voice answer and thank Reagan, before you felt the pizza box shift as it changed hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pizza box was placed on a solid surface, presumably a table, before it was opened. Once your eyes adjusted to the change in light you looked up to the hungry face of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) ... Your sister Tracy, her and your mom ordered takeout and invited your Aunt Norah to join them.<br>\r\n2) ... A complete stranger<br>\r\n3) ... Someone else you recognise (writer\u2019s choice)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your reaction was just a bit too slow, unfortunately, and you found your efforts to scramble out of the way useless as Lila\u2019s black boot stomped down onto the ground. Your body was crushed paper thin under her heel, the tiny squelching noise you made inaudible due to the laughter, chatter, and music of the Pizza Palace. Lila didn\u2019t have a clue in the world she\u2019d stepped on you, and even if she had, she genuinely might\u2019ve been too exhausted to stop and peel you free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such, the weary waitress trotted off through the restaurant, in the direction of the play area near the back. She\u2019d been asked by her boss to tidy up some spilled snacks, as well as adjust the coin collector for one of the most popular games in Pizza Palace. This annoyed Lila to no end, but she wasn\u2019t about to talk back to her boss, as she needed this job too badly, even if it was a hellish, soul-sucking job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the arcade, Lila bent down and methodically scooped up the crumbs and food pieces left behind by careless patrons, yawning intermittently. You could do nothing but stay squished firmly under her shoe, your body having been squished over and over each time she took a step. Lila was far from a heavy girl, but her giant boot had still done quite a number on you. You still fought to reform, but it was mostly useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, it was useless until Lila approached the faulty arcade machine. It was a simple fix to adjust the coin collector and get the machine back up and running, but was Lila finished, she absentmindedly scraped her boot along the carpeted floor. Because you were flattened but not totally engrained in the treads of Lila\u2019s boot, your malleable body ripped free from her boot and was left behind on the ground as the titanic waitress took another step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to waste your chance, you focused all your efforts on reforming and managed to pop back into normal shape. As you did so, you noted that you were right beside one of those traditional car racing machines with the makeshift driver\u2019s seat and steering wheel. It was partnered with an identical racing machine, no doubt to enable two people to compete against each other in the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also noted a girl standing right beside the machine, with her back turned to you. With how loud the Pizza Palace was, you doubted she would hear you from the floor, but you guessed that climbing higher would allow her to hear you. You didn\u2019t know this stranger, but you were placing your bets on her being willing to carry you back to your roommates. It beat trying to walk all the way back through the crowded restaurant, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that plan in mind, you hopped up onto the machine and scrambled up into the seat of the driving chair. You then pushed your upper body strength to the limit and scaled the back of the seat, all the way up to the headrest. It was tiring, but you made it in less than two minutes. Taking one split second to catch your breath, you were about to speak when the unexpected happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl suddenly twisted her hand backwards, and her giant fingers slapped into you. The air was knocked out of your lungs and you fell backwards with a silent cry. Splatting down onto the hard plastic of the seat, your body flattened out. Groaning, you began trying to reform again, even as the girl above you stepped aside to reveal a second girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep! They just fixed the machine.\u201d The first girl, the one who had slapped you, said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that awesome, Zoe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second girl (Zoe, apparently) who had yet to fully enter your view, laughed confidently. \u201cSure is! God, I love this game. Ready to get totally wiped?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first girl rolled her eyes, but smiled. \u201cYou take this way too seriously, Zoe?\u201d Laughing, she walked out of your sight, and you could hear her sit down in the adjacent seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later, Zoe herself stepped forward, and she was quite the sight. Tall, with nicely tanned skin, and shoulder-length red hair. She was wearing a stylish hoodie and a flashy red miniskirt, both of which accentuated her rather shapely body. You took particular notice of her large, alluring rear end\u2026especially as she stepped with a leg on both sides of you, and you stared right up at her as she began to sit. The reality of your situation finally hit you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it hit you too late, and a much more tangible and painful force hit you a second after that. Zoe\u2019s big bubble butt pounded down onto the seat, utterly obliterating you. To make matters worse, her miniskirt flared out as she sat, revealing her creamy butt cheeks and barely-there thong to the private audience of one helplessly trapped tiny. Her bare left cheek crashed onto you, slamming your almost reformed body back down flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe\u2019s hefty derriere barely fit in the confines of the racing chair, so the red head wiggled a little to get more comfortable. This had the disastrous consequence of grinding her ass cheeks back and forth across the plastic, smearing your body side-to-side as she wiggled in place. You mentally cried out for her to stop, but your mute pleas fell on deaf ears as Zoe continued to shift around. Her smooth flesh ground into your face, smudging your malleable body into paste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe eventually settled down, but the damage was done, and you were much flatter and compressed than before. All sounds of the outside world were muffled, but you could distinctly make out Zoe\u2019s confident boasts as she started up a competitive race with her friend. The race lasted five minutes, and each time Zoe jerked the wheel, her whole body twisted, meaty butt cheeks digging into your flesh. Every time she slammed the brakes to drift, her ass clenched, more pressure squeezing into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skilled red head won by a landslide, and gave her friend a cocky grin after it was over. However, as her friend stood up, Zoe herself was stopped from standing by a timid looking girl who had watched the race from the sidelines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026d-do you think\u2026I-I could race you?\u201d The nervous girl inquired, stammering. \u201cI\u2019ll p-pay for your race\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe raised her eyebrows at the challenge, gave her friend a look, and then smiled at the nervous girl. \u201cHeck, why not? Sure thing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anxious girl smiled appreciatively, put in a dollar for her ride and one for Zoe, and then a second round of competition began. Second verse, same as the first, from your perspective. More crushing and squishing from the oblivious red head who had so thoroughly dominated you with her impeccable booty. There was nothing you could do by now to try and fight against her, as you were much to crumpled and pancaked to attempt reforming, let alone speaking or wiggling to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe won the second race as easily as the first, but again before she stood, the timid girl\u2019s mother approached. Caught off guard, Zoe listened to the motherly giantess explain how much she played the game when she was younger, and her confidence in besting Zoe. She even offered up a five-dollar bet. Eyes glinting with the promise of high stakes, Zoe eagerly too up her offer, and a third race began. Zoe\u2019s friend, meanwhile, wandered off to order pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus began the reign of the Racing Queen. The third match was the most intense yet, but eventually Zoe came out on top, eking out a first-place win by a hair. By this point, she was working up a hearty sweat from the pressure of maintaining her win streak, and that sweat was pooling around her doughy buttocks, creating a little swamp right where your tiny body was unfortunately wedged. You were thoroughly doused in sweat and the increasing stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling her moist ass brought a grimace to Zoe\u2019s face, but she merely lifted her ass off the seat for a moment and then clapped it back down. Her pillowy left butt check utterly demolished you upon landing, squishing your miniscule body firmly into its hot, fleshy embrace. You felt yourself stick to both it and the chair in equal measure, and you began to genuinely fear you\u2019d become a tattoo on either Zoe or the seat if this lasted any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, last longer it did, and for quite a while. Zoe performed twenty flawless races in a row, the stakes for each growing higher and higher as nearly everyone in the Pizza Palace sought out the Racing Queen to challenge her. Her friend stood diligently beside her and supplied her pizza slices in between races, and after an intense but exciting hour, Zoe had raked in one hundred dollars in winnings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the restaurant, Morgan was tearing her hair out looking for you, and was on the verge of tears. Trying to soothe her, Quinn and Avery promised that they\u2019d find you, but that Morgan needed to take a break. Apprehensive at first, Morgan eventually agreed, and she wandered off to calm her nerves. By chance, she ended up taking note of Zoe right as the red head was finishing another race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. I really like this game.\u201d Morgan said by way of introducing herself. Zoe\u2019s recent victim wandered off sadly, and Morgan ended up sliding into the second seat. Zoe gave her new opponent a wide grin, and once more absentmindedly wiggled her prodigious rear end in her seat. By this point, you were more of a smear than a man, having suffered under this blissfully unaware girl for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUp for a competitive race?\u201d Zoe offered to your beautiful roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan nodded, and smiled back. \u201cProbably what I need right now, yeah. Let\u2019s go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe caught the confident glint in Morgan\u2019s eye, and realized she had finally met a true rival. Steeling herself, she gripped the steering wheel tighter as the race began. Morgan did the same, totally oblivious as the how close her missing tiny roommate was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does the race go?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With your connection to the outside world completely cut off due to the crushing weight of your current captor. The only thing you knew about this girl was that her name was Zoe, she had a rather large, soft, butt, and she was evidently great at this stupid racing game. You didn\u2019t even know if your new roommates were looking for you or not. They could have easily gotten caught up in conversation, eaten some delicious pizza, then headed home without you. After all, you hadn\u2019t even lived for these three girls for a single night yet. You couldn\u2019t possibly expect them to keep your wellbeing as their main priority at all times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, almost as if fate was giving you just a taste of salvation, Zoe just then lifted her ass into the air. For her, she was merely airing out her now overwhelmingly sweaty ass cheeks that were beginning to stick to the firm, plastic seat. But for you it gave you the briefest connection back into the realm of normal people, and as she did though you heard a recognizable voice say,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Cruising through California racetrack on the hardest difficulty sound good?\u201d You couldn\u2019t believe your ears, but it was Morgan\u2019s voice! If you could have known how hard she was looking for you before you would have been even more grateful to your hopeful savior, but even being close to someone you knew gave you a flash of positivity in this otherwise depressing situation. However, before you could get too excited, Zoe dropped her rear a few inches back onto the firm seat, obliterating you once more. Once again, reality became muffled and your entire world was sweaty ass above you with unforgiving plastic beneath you. Your fate was in Morgan\u2019s hands entirely, and she didn\u2019t even know it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good to me,\u201d Zoe said while grinning. She adjusted her seat forward an inch to make the seat even more tight around her tall and voluptuous frame. This increased the pressure on you yet again, but gave her a bit more control that she felt like she might need to beat Morgan. The two beautiful giantesses watched their respective screens as the countdown to the start flashed, until finally the green light signaled the start and they both slammed their feet onto the pedals. It was clear the two girls were neck and neck in terms of skill with this game, keeping pace with each other almost exactly. Of course, you had no clue about the outcome of the race. Your only way of discerning any information was how harshly Zoe would lean onto one cheek or the other as she took sharp turns, either crushing you worse or giving you the briefest of respites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround two minutes of torture (for you) later and exhilarating fun for the girls, they were reaching the final stretch of the race. Zoe was actually in the lead by a few car lengths, feeling confident that she would keep her tremendous win streak alive. However, out of seemingly nowhere, Morgan took a sharp turn and jumped across an entire out-of-bounds section of the track! Zoe\u2019s jaw dropped as Morgan\u2019s car landed far and away ahead of hers. Zoe shifted gears in desperation, but it was too late. Morgan\u2019s car zoomed across the finish line first, with Zoe a second behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell yeah!\u201d Morgan exclaimed, pumping a fist in front of her, \u201cThat was a great race! I didn\u2019t tell ya this before but I have the console version of this game at home so I know all the shortcuts! You definitely would have had me if not for that!\u201d Having clearly enjoyed the competition, Morgan warmly talked to the girl beside her. Part of Zoe wanted to be mad about losing finally, but the overwhelming warmth and sincerity that Morgan was giving off mere seconds after seeming so competitive won her over. Zoe simply smiled back,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed, not a single other person in here could come close to beating me. I\u2019ve gotta give credit where credit\u2019s due, you\u2019re really good at the game.\u201d Zoe then stood up for the first time in over an hour. For a brief moment it felt like you would be torn in half, with your body\u2019s squishy characteristics being stuck equally to the girls damp ass flesh as well as the plastic chair. But after a brief tug, you popped free of the giantess\u2019s derriere and snapped back into being a flat sticker on the seat of the chair. You watched as her red miniskirt fluttered back down, just barely covering the butt cheeks that you had gotten to know so well. Shaking yourself out of the physical distress you felt, you finally realized that Morgan must have won! Looking upwards now, Zoe continued to talk, \u201cHere the Player 1 seat is all yours, you\u2019ve earned it! It\u2019s probably about time for me to get out of here anyway! Hopefully I see you again sometime, I\u2019d love to have a rematch!\u201d You then watched the girl walk away, taking a moment to appreciate how attractive she was. In your head you thought shallowly,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I\u2019m going to be squished left and right throughout time living on my own, I\u2019m at least glad it\u2019s underneath beautiful women like her or my roommates.\u201d You prided yourself upon being a positive person for the most part, despite finding yourself in a myriad of seemingly hopeless situations quite often due to your size. But of course as fate seemed to love to do to you, the second you thought about being thankful to be crushed by good looking girls, you saw Morgan\u2019s equally impressive ass stand up from the seat next to you. You saw that she had changed into ever so slightly less revealing athletic wear from earlier, but they still did nothing to hide her toned curves. You cried internally, assuming that once more you would be decimated under an unaware ass. At the very least this time you would be underneath someone you knew though. Ideally you would stick to her shorts, hitch a ride home, then unstick yourself when she changed later in the evening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready planning for more hours of pressure, you were confused when it didn\u2019t immediately come. You looked up to see not Morgan\u2019s buns, but her eyes, and they were staring right at you! Her face had a look of utter shock, as did yours. In this exact moment, a wave of relief washed over your body, not just for the current situation, but for the future too. Quinn\u2019s no-nonsense tough-love for tinies and Avery\u2019s overwhelming combination of flirtation and forgetfulness had led you to believe that you were going to end up crushed more often than not. But seeing how Morgan actually checked a seat before dropping her ass into it was a game-changer. Perhaps there was hope for you to live normally amongst these three girls after all! You knew that was a pipe dream, but the thoughtfulness of Morgan gave you just enough hope to keep that dream alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit, Hunter!? Were you under that girl the entire time!? Have you been here since we got here!?\u201d Morgan said down to you. You weren\u2019t sure if she actually expected a response, or if she was just thinking out loud. You wished desperately that you could respond to your new friend, but you couldn\u2019t. And at just that moment another relatively younger woman approached the racing game setup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I saw you beat that girl who was beating everyone, you up to race me?\u201d She said excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh actually I\u2019m just saving these seats for a moment, sorry. Maybe in a bit though!\u201d Morgan fumbled through her words slightly. In reality she loved competition and honestly did want to race this new girl. But her worry about your wellbeing was far more important at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually we have a policy here to not save seats on the games. You must either play or give the game up to whoever else wants it.\u201d The sleepy waitress from earlier approached the two. She really didn\u2019t want to get involved in a dispute of any kind, but once again she couldn\u2019t afford to lose her job for being caught not policing the rules. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan\u2019s mind raced with fear, she had no clue what to do. If she sat down and raced this girl, then she knew you would at least be safe, albeit crushed underneath her butt. Maybe she could beat this one girl super quick then work on freeing you. But part of her still would feel terribly guilty about crushing you intentionally. She thought briefly about texting Quinn or Avery to come and take the seat from her. It seemed like either her sister or her new roommate cared far less about squishing you than she did herself, so perhaps she would spare herself the agony of doing it herself. Lastly, her third option was to simply come clean to the waitress and the challenger about you. However she had no idea how Pizza Palace\u2019s policies towards tiny customers were. After so many years of society growing accustomed to tiny men, it was likely that they would be understanding, but some establishments still took advantage of the relatively relaxed policing towards the mistreatment of tinies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan\u2019s mind jumped through the options, until finally she decided...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As much as Morgan may have hated herself for considering it, she really didn't want to put you through the pain and torture of dealing with her ass, Avery might take it too far or even enjoy crushing Hunter, but Quinn on the other hand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked up, seeing her sister bouncing about from game to game excitedly, getting along with other people enjoying the arcade, and collecting whatever meager tickets her casual and playful enjoyment won her from each game. Quinn meanwhile, seemed utterly focused on the cyclone arcade game, up against a few other kids who were hoping to claim the now large jackpot waiting to be won. With a deep breath, and a concentrated look, Quinn smacked the button, hitting it right in the center and causing the ticket dispenser to shoot out her jackpot winnings, a small smirk on her face as she collected her winnings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quinn!\" Morgan called out to her, prompting her attention, albeit in an uninterested gaze. \"Come try out this racing game! It's really fun!\"<br>\r\n\"Sure, Jackpots really low now anyways...\" Quinn motioned to the Cyclone machine, before walking over with her tickets in hand. Morgan glanced down at you apologetically as she made way for Quinn. You did stick to her ass before, so with any luck...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn's intimidating shadow loomed over your squished frame as she came into your view. handing Morgan her tickets as she scooted into position to sit down, her jiggly ass filling your view before it came crashing down brutally and uncaring of your situation. Morgan couldn't help but frown, watching her curvy new roomie decimate her small new roomie by simply taking a seat, the leather seat giving out an audible, and almost mocking hissing sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, beneath the enormous ass of Quinn, you already felt the heat rise dramatically! (Not like it was all that cool from the brief moment of freedom from being beneath anyone's ass) and the heat only amped up further, along with excruciating pain as Quinn shifted her hips back and forth, getting comfy in the seat. Was getting stuck to Quinn's ass really the best option? You couldn't help but wonder if you had better chances staying on the seat... You could just barely hear the outside world as you lay helplessly smashed between the leather seat and the copious amounts of ass flesh above and around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan winced as she saw Quinn shift about, along with the accompanying sounds of her ass dragging against the leather seat of the game. Quinn then paid the obligatory token amount and began racing the challenger. Every now and then, Quinn would readjust her ass as she played, apparently unable to get comfortable in the seat (Probably because it was made with kids in mind) the faint sound of her now sweating ass peeling off the leather could be heard, before it would come crashing back down on top of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn kept her uncaring demeanor even when racing. Or perhaps it was a look of focus, it was hard to tell with her this early in their friendship, Morgan thought. She just hoped Quinn would be willing to peel you off her ass again like earlier, and not condemn you to a whole night of arcade games before helping you out. Morgan quickly came to determine that it was indeed focus that Quinn was expressing, as during the race, she effortlessly took the lead against the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Quinn beat the girl, crossing the finish line with a healthy lead. Another small smirk flashed on her face before vanishing completely. The challenging girl huffed slightly, Quinn's relaxed attitude and lack of any emotion certainly didn't make her loss any more easier to take. Quinn looked over to Morgan. <br>\r\n\"That was fun. What now?\"<br>\r\nShe put her hand on the armrest, going to lift herself from the now sweaty chair, having just rose from the seat when another girl ran over.<br>\r\n\"That was awesome!\" the new girl shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn opted to relax in her seat as she talked, dropping back in, causing the leather seat to hiss again.<br>\r\n\"Can you face me now? I just gotta try to beat you after that!\" She asked, and as she finished her sentence, some other girls, presumably her friends, came over, each seeming just as eager to take on the new Queen of the racing game. Morgan grimaced, this wasn't what she was hoping for at all, what was she going to do now!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn shifted her ass in the slightly slick seat, the friction once again burning you and smearing you beneath her ginormous cheeks as she briefly pondered the request before saying:</span></div></div>",

There were at least 6 people in line until Morgan could reach Quinn which was she thought it was a relief since she didn\u2019t really knew what to say to Quinn and while you were suffering it also seemed like Quinn found the comfiness you were looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Morgan, you know where hunger is ? I feel that it\u2019s time we go home and I haven\u2019t seen him in a while\u201d said Avery  as she found Morgan in the racing game line.<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah he\u2019s with me so you don\u2019t have to worry about anything, in fact. Why don\u2019t you go and turn on the car while I finish playing with Quinn and tell her is time to go home?\u201d Morgan said with a worriedly tone to Avery as she walked to the car but on the same time she was relieved since the line was dispersing for a reason that she really didn\u2019t cared and raced to Quinn avoiding the other people that she realized were groaning and pinching their noses but her attention quickly turned to saving hunter as she finally reached her roommate\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cQuinn! It\u2019s time for us to...Ugh, what is that stench?\u201d Said Avery gagging as she noticed a foul smell clinging in the air\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I\u2019m lactose intolerant and pizza plus a milkshake aren\u2019t exactly going to transform my ass into a can of air refreshers, I probably should\u2019ve mentioned that to hunter before he agreed to sleep in my room. I know I said I wanted him to learn to look out for himself but you can\u2019t really avoid a fart cloud on a room without windows, why don\u2019t she just finish this race and then we go home?\u201d said Quinn in her typical uncaring tone as you now understood why the line suddenly disappeared and felt even worse by thinking how she put you on an even worse situation.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah sure, but just this race and then you get up\u201d said Morgan pinching her nose without realizing that the race was at the beginning .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter four minutes of Morgan racing Quinn while also enduring the fart cloud that was still lingering around her she finally lost since her eyes were watering and you couldn\u2019t see that clearly.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay time to for you to get up and move that butt of yours to a real car seat\u201d said Morgan with a chuckle while still pinching her nose and as soon as Quinn got up looked if hunter was stuck to Quinn\u2019s ass or to the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily you were  still on the seat gasping for air which made Morgan feel even worse as she realized you were only breathing Quinn\u2019s gas during the whole race.<br>\r\n\u201cOmg hunter I\u2019m so sorry for put... ugh you stink hunter, but at least you\u2019re finally safe right? Said Morgan to you as she put you on her palm as far away from her face as possible since you still had the fart odor lines clinged you your body <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay Morgan,  bit let\u2019s just go home\u201c you said finally breathing clean air and reforming from your previous encounter with Quinn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car ride was quiet but enjoyable for Morgan who got away with her mistake and everything was going great, you four eventually arrived to the apartment and you were left alone with Quinn since you two slept on the same bedroom and everyone else went to sleep. You two chatted some time and wished to be as unaware of the previous situation as she was and eventually went to your bedroom were you both remembered she destroyed your bed in the morning.<br>\r\n\u201cLook you can sleep in my bed with me and don\u2019t worry, im practically a statue while sleeping so you don\u2019t have to fear me squashing you during the night\u201d Said Quinn not because she was sorry but because she was tired and didn\u2019t wanted you to bother her during her sleep, her saying how she didn\u2019t moved in her sleep comforted you that I you your previos situation<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Quinn\u201d you said as you both got into bed and slowly fall asleep until...<br>\r\nPBBBBBBRT<br>\r\n\u201cI apologize in advance dude, i\u2019m lactose intolerant and that restaurant gave me gas to beat the band, should\u2019ve mentioned that before you decided who you were going to sleep with huh?\u201d Said Quinn in a sleepy tone before quickly falling asleep and left you suffering since she slept with her butt pointed at your direction and with you being on the side facing the wall there wasn\u2019t anything you could do besides holding your breath as you heard her groaning in her sleep knowing well what It meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was still awake in her room and heard the fart that was still assaulting hunger which made her remember the whole situation she faced earlier, another huge fart made her wake up from her daydream and made her cringe by remembering the smell from earlier<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI already did everything I could for Hunter, this is their problem now\u201d said Morgan before falling asleep while hearing more blasts from Quinn\u2019s room and not hearing hunter groans<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I guess since we're all sort of strangers, except for you two...\" You said, gesturing to Morgan and Avery. \"...we should probably each spend some time hanging out with each other and getting to know one another.\" You shrugged. \"If that doesn't sound too dumb or corny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan shook her head and smiled. \"No, it sounds like a great idea, Hunter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave her a thumbs up, and inquired. \"Then how about you and I hang out the rest of the day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great to me!\" Morgan replied, gently lowering her palm back to the coffee table for you to hop on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you climbed up onto Morgan's outstretched hand, you caught sight of Avery's briefly sullen expression, as well as Quinn's trademark indifference. A moment later though, and Avery was back to her normal self, no doubt consoling herself with the fact that she'd hang out with you later. Jumping out of her seat, she grabbed Quinn's arm and practically dragged the black-haired giantess out of the living room. Quinn tried protesting, but the infectious giggles of Avery drowned her out. The two soon disappeared from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft alone with Morgan, the brown-haired girl stared at you caringly. \"What did you want to do, Hunter? Any ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed your chin. \"Well, how about we hang out in your room? You finished decorating it, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! That's a great idea!\" Morgan nodded, and began carefully walking out of the living room and upstairs. You were amazed by how deliberately and slowly she carried you, and it was genuinely hard to tell you were even moving if you closed your eyes and relaxed. Her soft palm was like a floating bed of wonder, whisking you away. Once upstairs, Morgan slipped through the first door and into her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan showed off her room, and it was basically what you expected from someone like her. Her bed was tucked in and straightened, her clothes were neatly stored away in dressers and in the closet, and one corner of her room was taken up by a organized collection of exercise weights and training props. One other corner of the room was barren. The entire room was decorated in shades of tan and brown, a very earthy and natural feel. There was also a TV with what looked like a gaming console hooked up to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour giantess guardian gently placed you down on the corner of her bed. \"Well, this is it. Nothing too special, but I'm still really looking forward to living here for the next few years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced around the room. \"Yeah, I mean, it's super well-organized. Very neat. I bet you never lose anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan smiled at your compliment, and moved to sit down. The sight of her descending gave you a brief moment of shock, which was entirely unjustified. Morgan was sitting on the opposite end of the bed, nowhere near you, and she was watching you the whole time. You were just jumpy around giant women, as you'd experienced your very fair share of mishaps over the course of your life. Still, it was a sight to behold, Morgan's firm butt pushing her compression shorts tightly against her as she bent down to sit, her weight displacing the mattress a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan stretched her arms after she sat. \"My room is tidy, sure...I only wish Avery and Quinn were the same. Have you looked in the kitchen and bathroom yet? Those places are practically a mess, and we just moved in hours ago.\" She huffed, and stuck out her lower lip in a faux pout. \"It's a little annoying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you wanted, I could help you clean up.\" You offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, thanks.\" Morgan grinned, the faintest trace of a blush in her cheeks. \"That's super considerate. But...I don't know. Maybe I'll just destress with a good exercise. Nothing helps me more than getting in the groove and sweating out my issues.\" She looked over to where her exercise equipment was stored in the corner. \"Or...you and me could do something else entirely. I have some game consoles and stuff.\" She glanced back at you. \"Honestly, you decide. I'm no good with so many choices.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis took you back a bit, but you didn't want to let your new roommate down, so you thought for a second before replying.</span></div></div>",

You don\u2019t like the idea of exercising, seeing me get all hot and sweaty?\u201d She teased, and you started to blush, which made her giggle. \u201dI\u2019m only kidding Hunter, but in all seriousness I will whip you into shape before long! In the meantime though I do think that your suggestion is better for getting to know each other.\u201d<br>\r\nWith that she stood up and walked across the room to her tv, turning it and the console on. This gave you a view of her firm glutes, tightly covered by her compression shorts. You couldn\u2019t help but stare, and you heard a giggle as you saw Morgan looking back at you with faux offended smile.<br>\r\n\u201cJust what were you looking at Hunter, whatever it was clearly was taking up all your attention,\u201d as she said this she wiggled her hips side to side, swaying her backside tantalisingly in front of you. She laughed as you went beet red in embarrassment at being caught. \u201cYou were so preoccupied with whatever it was that you didn\u2019t hear me ask which game you wanted to play.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, I won\u2019t really be able to play without a controller sized for me, I\u2019ve got one in my stuff but I\u2019ve not gotten around to unpacking yet. So I guess just pick what you want to play.\u201d You stammered out, still embarrassed.<br>\r\nMorgan selected a game and sauntered back over to the bed, with an extra sway in her step, clearly enjoying teasing you. She sat down on it before plucking you up off the bed and sitting you on her shoulder.<br>\r\n\u201cThere we go, I figure this way I\u2019ll be able to hear you better,\u201d she said to you with a warm smile, clearly finished teasing you for now.<br>\r\nFor the next hour or so you and Morgan chatted, getting to know each other while she played her game. She told you about the job she had just got at Workout World and you explained that you hadn\u2019t managed to secure work yet but you were looking. You explained about your mom and sister and she listened intently. You were feeling like you and Morgan were making a genuine connection and could end up as good friends. Just as you were about to ask her about her family you both heard the sound of the doorbell followed by Avery shouting that she would get it. The door opened and you heard an excited squeal from Avery followed by the sound of her running up the stairs before bursting through Morgan\u2019s door in excitement.<br>\r\n\u201cOur moms are here!\u201d She squealed before rushing back downstairs.<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow, I wasn\u2019t expecting a visit from them until tomorrow at earliest. I would have loved to have had the place clean before any of our parents visited but oh well,\u201d Morgan shrugged before smiling down at you. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll love them Hunter, they love tiny guys.\u201d<br>\r\nWith that she stood up, which as she did, she leaned forward. You started to slide forward, at risk of sliding down into her cavernous cleavage, pushed up by her tank top. However you managed to grasp onto a stray hair to keep yourself on your perch on her shoulder. She saw your struggle and apologised, picking you up and carrying you down on her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Morgan carried you down the stairs towards the living room you heard the sound of energetic conversation before Morgan rounded the corner and you saw it\u2019s source. Quinn was sitting in a corner, quiet, she was clearly overwhelmed by the sheer energy from the conversation between Avery and her parents. They were standing in the middle of the living room and their energetic conversation was accentuated by hand gestures and high pitched laughs from all three women. Morgan said hello and her two moms turned to face you, giving you a good look at them.<br>\r\nOn the left was a tall, slender woman with porcelain pale skin and platinum blonde hair so bright it was almost the colour of snow. She towered over all the other women in the room, you\u2019d guess she was around 6\u20192\u201d, and was dressed in a simple grey dress that accentuated her slim curves beautifully. She possessed a quite elegant appearance, almost royal.<br>\r\nOn the right was a woman almost exactly opposite of the woman on the left. She was of Half-Hispanic descent, with dark brown hair similar to Morgan and Avery. She was shorter than her wife, but had a lot more weight on her, with the majority of it seeming to go to her curves, giving her a very impressive hourglass figure.<br>\r\nBoth of their eyes lit up at the sight of their other daughter and they both let out a squeal as they rushed to embrace her. Morgan was forced to clench her fist tightly to keep a hold of you as she was embraced by both of her parents. <br>\r\n\u201cWoah, mom, mom let me go for two seconds! I\u2019ll give you guys a hug once I set Hunter down,\u201d her parents gave her a quizzical look as Morgan opened her palm, revealing your flattened form. Morgan gave you a sheepish smile at seeing how mangled her hand had left you after a few seconds. The taller parent gives you a look of fascinated curiosity whereas the shorter one spoke up.<br>\r\n\u201cAwww, sorry little guy. We didn\u2019t notice your cute little self, did we Lilyana,\u201d she looked to her wife, Lillyana, who responded.<br>\r\n\u201cNo we didn\u2019t Mariah, sorry little man,\u201d she spoke with a slight hint of an accent, maybe Russian? It was difficult to tell because it was faint.<br>\r\nMorgan quickly placed you down on the coffee table and hugged her parents. You saw Quinn give you a nod and a slight panicked look, she clearly wasn\u2019t prepared for the sheer amount of energy coming from the women in the room with her and was feeling a bit overwhelmed. Avery gave you a wink and a giggle before returning to conversation with her parents. Morgan\u2019s hand hadn\u2019t crushed you too badly so you popped back into shape fairly quickly. Before you could get your bearings you felt yourself scooped up in a pair of hands, turning to face the person who lifted you and seeing that it was none other than Mariah, the curvy Hispanic mother of the twins. Before you could even utter a word she brought you up to her lips, which embraced you in a series of kisses. Both Morgan and Avery\u2019s jaws dropped as you were thrust repeatedly into Mariah\u2019s plump, full lips.<br>\r\n\u201cMom!\u201d Morgan cried, embarrassed by her mother\u2019s sudden affectionate display towards you.<br>\r\n\u201cMwah, sorry dear but your little friend here is just too adorable for me to resist,\u201d as she said this you turned to see Morgan\u2019s mortified face, but was that a hint of jealousy you saw in her eyes? Maybe you were imagining things.<br>\r\nAfter that incident, everyone sat down and you stayed on the coffee table. Conversation flowed, even Quinn was dragged into the conversation now that the excited energy had died down a bit. Mariah and Lilyana were very curious about you and your life so far. You learned that Lilyana was a well-known event coordinator and party planner and Mariah owned a local burger joint called Sinclair Sandwiches. You had actually heard of Sinclair Sandwiches and you and your family had actually eaten there on occasion, a fact that Mariah was very happy about. Eventually the twins parents talked to Quinn about her job at Sanderson Beach as a lifeguard before turning to you.<br>\r\n\u201cSo do you have a job, little guy?\u201d Lilyana asked you.<br>\r\n\u201cNo actually, I have been looking for a job but I haven\u2019t managed to secure anything yet,\u201d you admitted, there was a lot of work for a tiny man like yourself but some of it was too dangerous for your liking.<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you are interested I have an opening for my personal assistant, would you be interested?\u201d Lilyana\u2019s proposition was tempting, although you weren\u2019t exactly sure how much you could do to help her in her job.<br>\r\n\u201cI could always use more help in the kitchen at the restaurant as well little guy, you\u2019d be more than welcome there,\u201d Mariah piped up.<br>\r\nAvery seemed very excited at the prospect of you working with one of her parents, Morgan looked happy at them offering as well, but you did feel like you saw a slight bit of concern on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you accept either of their offers?<br>\r\n1) You decide to become Lilyana\u2019s personal assistant.<br>\r\n2) You decide to go work at Sinclair Sandwiches.<br>\r\n3) You politely decline their offers, much to the two women\u2019s disappointment.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYou know what?\u201d You began. \u201cI actually think working as your assistant could be pretty beneficial! I think it\u2019d really help me to be more organized and responsible. If you\u2019ll have me, I\u2019m more than happy to help!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you hadn\u2019t thought it possible, Lilyana\u2019s face radiated even more beauty, as her sensual lips curled into a shining smile. \u201cI will absolutely accept your help, little one!\u201d She giggled melodically. \u201cYou will be very appreciated while aiding me with my tasks. I accept you, little one!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah didn\u2019t exactly hide her rejection, thrusting out her lip in an adorable pout, but it was quickly replaced with affection towards her spouse. She gave Lilyana a playfully bump with her butt and laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t work the tiny cutie too hard, babe! Sometimes it can be hard for even ME to keep up with your whirlwind work ethic!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery\u2019s head bobbled up and down energetically. \u201cOMG, this is way too cool! My new adorable roomie working as my mom\u2019s assistant! I totes need you to plan a big party for me and my friends sometime, once you\u2019re a pro!\u201d The pink-haired girl winked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good opportunity, huh, Hunter?\u201d Morgan asked. \u201cYou can trust my mom to treat you well and pay you fairly. Plus, the three of us can drop by and visit from time to time.\u201d She glanced at Quinn. \u201cEr\u2026not to impose, Quinn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour apathetic roommate shook her head, the faintest smile playing at the corners of her lips. \u2018No problem. That party idea Avery mentioned actually sounds fun\u2026I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilyana clapped her hands together. \u201cThen we have reached an agreement! You can start tomorrow, little one. Do not worry, I will take very good care of you. However, I do have high expectations of you.\u201d She kneeled before you and extended her thumb as a sign of an unstated work relationship beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, you weren\u2019t entirely sure what your job as a personal assistant was going to entail. You didn\u2019t know the first thing about event coordinating, and it wasn\u2019t as if you could carry anything for her at your diminutive size. Still, looking up at her towering, beautiful form, you felt compelled to push forward with this plan. The last thing you wanted was to upset Lilyana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long moment, you snapped yourself out of your thoughts and grasped Lilyana\u2019s entire thumb with your hands, shaking it up and down with a smile. Lilyana grinned, her countenance radiating like an angel\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI look forward to seeing you tomorrow, my new little assistant!\u201d She laughed lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe evening wasn\u2019t entirely uneventful, but that was to be expected in your hectic, accident-prone life. Lilyana stepped on you twice while walking back and forth between the living room and the kitchen, and Mariah plopped her shapely booty onto you because she\u2019d forgotten which seat you had taken, resulting in you spending nearly an hour squished under her thick derriere. Still, it could\u2019ve\u2019 been worse. Each woman apologized\u2026though you couldn\u2019t help but see a flash of something more in their eyes each time they discovered you and realized their blunder. They eventually left, with Lilyana promising to swing by in the morning and pick you up for your first day of work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Morgan woke you up and fixed you breakfast, and afterwards you cleaned yourself up and changed into fresh clothes. Lilyana arrived a few minutes earlier than she had stated, striding inside with an elegant demeanor and soft apology to Morgan for being early. While distracted, she spared no backwards look at the couch (which is where you were waiting for her to notice you), and instead began to sit down atop you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMrs. Sinclair, wait!\u201d You cried out, and you madly threw yourself out of her way, falling forward off the couch right as Lilyana\u2019s sculpted booty plopped onto the couch. You landed in a heap on the ground by her feet. Surprisingly, Lilyana heard you, but now had no idea where you had ended up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my! Little one, did I sit on you?\u201d Lilyana asked with worry. Standing up to check the couch, Lilyana shifted her feet as she turned, and in that one motion sealed your fate. As she twisted, her left heel dragged over your body, squashing you flat mercilessly. The sharp point of her heels tore your flimsy clothes to shreds, leaving you nude and flattened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, fate partially smiled on you, and Lilyana spotted your squished face sticking out from under her heel after a few minutes of searching. She quickly peeled you off and let you reform in her palm as she looked down at you with worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am so sorry, little one.\u201d Lilyana gushed, practically petting you with her finger in what you assumed was a gesture of kindness. \u201cI did not hear your cry until it was too late!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting to reform your head from under her finger, you managed to shout up to her. \u201cNothing\u2026I can\u2019t\u2026uh\u2026h-handle, boss!\u201d Your cheeks flushed brightly with embarrassment. \u201cI l-lost my clothes\u2026though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilyana withdrew her hand with a short gasp, which was quickly replaced by a soft giggle. You were now burning entirely red with awkwardness as you reformed in her palm. Desperate for literally anything to stop this terrible first impression, you scrambled for the tattered clothes lying around you (that weren\u2019t still stuck to the bottom of Lilyana\u2019s heels. Surprisingly, you managed to fashion a makeshift pair of shorts, so at least you had some modesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilyana\u2019s beautiful face split into a huge smile, and she nodded approvingly. \u201cAh, you are so quick with thinking of solutions! You are definitely going to be a perfect assistant!\u201d She cupped her hands around you to form a sort of barrier. \u201cNow, we must hurry. It is a busy day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course! I\u2019ll do whatever I need to, boss!\u201d You gave the elegant giantess a thumbs up, and then you and her were off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilyana carried you carefully out into her car, and set you down inside of the nearest cupholder. This was because the rest of her car was fit to burst at the seams with bags upon bags of party supplies and other such goods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she drove, Lilyana spared quick glances down at you. \u201cNow, little one, this will be a hectic day for your first as my assistant. Today is the bachelorette party of my client, a girl named Iris. It is a small party, but that does not make my planning duties any less essential. She informed me that there would be about eight guests in attendance. All of her bridesmaids.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a second to process all of that. \u201cUh\u2026okay. What do I need to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we shall have to see when we get to the venue. The party is being held at a luxury hotel about an hour from here. The bride-to-be and her bridesmaids rented out one of their dining rooms for the entire day. It is up to them what they want to do, but I did plan a full schedule of food, drink, and games.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scratched your head. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t know how much I can pitch in to help. But, if there\u2019s even a single thing you think of that I\u2019m suitable for, then I\u2019m all in!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilyana smiled warmly. \u201cI appreciate that, you adorable thing. I will try to make this day as fulfilling for you as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilyana then questioned you quite intensely about your life, though most of her questions seemed to focus on your squishiness and stretchiness. Still, she seemed genuinely curious and invested, so you couldn\u2019t refuse in telling her some stories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the two of you reached the hotel, and Lilyana put you back in the palm of her hand and carried you inside. The dining room was pretty spacious, with two long rows of tables, a fireplace, and a chandelier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilyana set you down on the nearest table, and then the two of you got to work. While Lilyana pushed the tables around to better utilize the space in the room, you put all of your admittedly-puny strength into arranging piles of napkins and other eating utensils, little decorative flowers, and a small chocolate bar in front of each of the bridesmaids seats. Only once did you fall of the table and end up under Lilyana\u2019s feet again, and she again found you after just a few minutes. You didn\u2019t even lose your shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner did Lilyana and you finish then the door swung open, and the eight bridesmaids walked in. Your jaw nearly hit the floor as the eight curvy giantesses skipped inside the room, smiling, laughing, and texting. They were each gorgeous and eye-catching, and you again wondered how so many incredibly attractive giantesses kept finding their way into your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne worried looking bridesmaid scurried up to you and Lilyana. Not even noticing you, she frowned at Lilyana. \u201cIris locked herself in the bathroom!\u201d The bridesmaid moaned. \u201cShe won\u2019t come out to the party without the comfy skirt she was going to wear, but she lost it an hour ago!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilyana pursed her lips. \u201cShe needs a new skirt, then?\u201d Her eyes flicked down to you, and an inquisitive glint shown in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bridesmaid looked at her other seven friends sheepishly. \u201cI\u2019d drive home to get Iris one of my own skirts, but I think the other girls will get restless without some entertainment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilyana nodded. \u201cYes, and I still need time to set up the food and drinks, so I can't do it right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spoke up confidently. \u201cDon\u2019t forget me! I\u2019ll help however you need me to!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilyana grinned at your response, and the bridesmaid finally took notice of you. Her eyes widened upon seeing you, and a tentative smile bloomed on her lips. A hint of something more flashed across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, my little assistant\u2026\u201d Lilyana began. \u201cThank you for volunteering. I\u2019ve got just the job for you!\u201d</span></div></div>",

There\u2019s something special about the feeling of making something for someone, and seeing them enjoy it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you hadn\u2019t thought it possible, Mariah\u2019s face radiated even more beauty, as her plump lips curled into a huge smile. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly right, cutie! That\u2019s the passion of being a chef!\u201d She laughed heartily. \u201cYou and I are going to get along splendidly, aren\u2019t we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA faint flash of rejection passed in Lilyana\u2019s icy blue eyes, but it was replaced quickly with affection towards her spouse. \u201cWell, I know that you\u2019ll be a perfect fit at my sweetheart\u2019s restaurant. They treat everyone like family there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah beamed proudly. \u201cThe Sinclair Sandwiches motto: scrumptious sandwiches and satisfied smiles!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery\u2019s head bobbled up and down energetically. \u201cOMG, this is way too cool! My new adorable roomie working at my mom\u2019s restaurant.

I actually kinda like burgers\u2026I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah clapped her hands together. \u201cThen it\u2019s decided! You can start tomorrow, cutie! Don\u2019t worry, I know you\u2019ll fit right in!\u201d She leaned over you and extended her thumb as a sign of an unstated work relationship beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, it was a struggle for you to tear your gaze from the woman\u2019s abundant cleavage, which was on full display as she bent over you. Her chest was massive, approximately the size of Quinn\u2019s unbelievably bountiful breasts, and Mariah\u2019s low-cut blouse left little to the imagination. The abyss of her cleavage practically beckoned you, her skin looking heavenly smooth and soft. It wasn\u2019t hard to see where Avery and Morgan got their killer looks from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long moment, though, you tore your gaze away and grasped Mariah\u2019s entire thumb with your hands, shaking it up and down with a smile. Mariah laughed, her eyes sparkling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to the Sinclair Sandwiches staff, little man!\u201d She grinned pleasantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe evening wasn\u2019t entirely uneventful, but that was to be expected in your hectic, accident-prone life. Lilyana stepped on you twice while walking back and forth between the living room and the kitchen, and Mariah plopped her shapely booty onto you because she\u2019d forgotten which seat you had taken, resulting in you spending nearly an hour squished under her thick derriere. Still, it could\u2019ve\u2019 been worse.

They eventually left, with Mariah promising to swing by in the morning and pick you up for your first day of work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Morgan woke you up and fixed you breakfast, and afterwards you cleaned yourself up and changed into fresh clothes. Mariah arrived a few minutes later than she had stated, bustling inside with a energetic attitude and a giggly apology to Morgan for being late. In her haste, she spared no backwards look at the couch (which is where you were waiting for her to notice you), and instead began to sit down atop you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMrs. Sinclair, wait!\u201d You cried out, madly dashing to the side to avoid the meteoric impact of Mariah\u2019s hefty ass crashing onto the couch. Surprisingly, the curvaceous giantess actually heard you, but fate still screwed you over anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh goodness, are you under me, little cutie?\u201d Mariah inquired aloud. Wanting to be cautious, the giantess woman shifted over a foot, and plopped down onto the other couch cushion instead. Of course, in your efforts to escape her falling butt, that\u2019s the exact same couch cushion you had attempted to escape to. Now, all you\u2019d done is slightly change the location of the inevitable, and you crumpled to paper under Mariah\u2019s plump booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, it took Mariah only a few minutes to recognize what she\u2019d done, and she soon had you peeled off her buttcheek and reforming in her palm. \u201cSo sorry about that, cutie. I thought I moved out of your way, but I guess I moved INTO it, huh? Gosh, it must be hard for you tinies, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce reformed, you stood up and waved confidently to Mariah. \u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing, boss! I can handle it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah laughed, a twinkle in her eyes. \u201cIs that so? You\u2019re gonna be a little trooper, aren\u2019t you. That\u2019s so adorable!\u201d She titled her hand suddenly, catching you off guard, but you quickly realized she was simply depositing you into her purse. \u201cStay safe in there, hun, and I\u2019ll take you back out when we get to the restaurant. It isn\u2019t too far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting until you got comfortable, Mariah flashed you a wink, said goodbye to Morgan, and strolled out of the apartment. She set her purse down in the passenger\u2019s seat of her car and drove off to Sinclair Sandwiches. True to her word, the drive wasn\u2019t much longer than fifteen minutes or so, and Mariah spent the entire time singing, her melodious voice enthralling. It was genuinely a pretty soothing car ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce at the restaurant, Mariah began heading inside, and you took the opportunity to climb onto the edge of her purse and peer at the restaurant. From the outside, it wasn\u2019t much, but it did have that \u2018local family-owned business\u2019 feeling to it. Just looking at the building made you feel warm and fuzzy, and a bit nostalgic. You weren\u2019t a professional designer, but there was definitely something in the construction of the place that made you feel happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside of the restaurant was even better. Pastel colors and happy clouds and sunshine decorations lined the walls and the ceiling. The irresistible aroma of freshly cooked burgers wafted through the air. A few ceiling fans spun slowly, generating a cool breeze and pushing the burger scent all through the restaurant. Soft jazz music played from a few speakers. It was just so overwhelmingly friendly and homey of an atmosphere you couldn\u2019t help but smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, in your dazed stupor, you didn\u2019t realize Mariah was sauntering so close to the counter as she walked briskly into the kitchen. Nor did you realize just how close to the lip of her purse you\u2019d climbed to get a better look. In the blink of an eye, Mariah lightly bumped her hip into the counter, let out a short gasp of surprise, and utterly failed to notice as your miniscule body flipped up and out of the purse and onto the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flopped and rolled to a stop, sitting up groggily and watching Mariah carry on further into the kitchen, towards a door in the back that was presumably a small office. You cursed your inattentiveness, as you were now effectively stuck her on the front counter until she came back for you, as it\u2019d take you nearly ten minutes to walk to her office on your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026ew, gross.\u201d A voice behind you said, the tone cold and disgusted. Whipping your head around, you found yourself staring at the pronounced chest of a towering giantess. She was wearing a bright pink and cheery restaurant uniform that was maybe a size too small, as it hugged her noticeably large breasts quite tightly, and two of the blouse\u2019s front buttons were strained to the seam, revealing a bit of her cleavage underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearing your eyes up to the girl\u2019s face, you saw a pretty, angular face framed by dark brown hair with a streak of blue, pale white skin, and angry hazel eyes. The girl\u2019s expression was one of utter disgust, her nose crinkled up and her lips pulled back in a sneer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026hello! I\u2019m the new employee here! My name is Hunter, and\u2013\u201d You began your introduction, but a loud scoff from the girl cut you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod, who let a tiny in here? Freakin\u2019 bugs.\u201d The girl rolled her eyes and raised her clenched fist above your body. \u201cSee you later, bug!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Wait! WAIT!\u201d You screamed, pathetically shielding yourself from the girl\u2019s sudden attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, your savior came through. Mariah appeared suddenly, catching the girl\u2019s hand. \u201cWait, Phoebe! That isn\u2019t a bug, it\u2019s our new adorable employee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl pulled her hand back from Mariah and frowned, eyeing you with contempt. \u201cYou seriously hired a tiny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah pouted. \u201cI know you find them a bit\u2026weird\u2026but try to like this one! He\u2019ll be a great addition to the team, I promise!\u201d<br>\r\nPhoebe brushed a strand of hair out of her eyes and glared at you. After a moment, cruel mischief danced in her eyes, and she smiled slightly. \u201cYeah\u2026maybe he will be fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah, oblivious to Phoebe\u2019s intentions, clapped her hands excitedly. \u201cOh, this is amazing. You and I will have to teach this cutie everything we know about working here, and soon, he\u2019ll be a perfect employee!\u201d Mariah looked down at you and beamed. \u201cReady to get started?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearing your eyes from Phoebe, who was still smiling eerily at you, you nodded shakily. Uh\u2026yep! Let\u2019s do this!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Get you used to where you\u2019ll be working,\u201d she seemed excited to have you on board. The same could not be said for Phoebe, who was still giving you looks of disgust and also wanting to mess with you.<br>\r\nMariah briskly walked into the kitchen, where you could see several people were already busy getting everything ready for opening.<br>\r\n\u201cOk little guy, this is the kitchen. I think we\u2019ll start you off in here today, but we can get to that in a little bit. Say hi to your cute new coworker ladies,\u201d as she said this, the kitchen staff paused what they were doing to look at you and when they saw you they all waved. Some said hello, others remarked at how cute they found you. At least everyone back here seemed nice.<br>\r\nWith that she moved through a side door into a small room with a few couches, a coffee table, and a countertop with a microwave and a coffee pot. It looked well decorated and cozy.<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the break room, I tried to make it as cozy as possible. I\u2019ll also see if I can get some stuff appropriate for your size on the counter top. Wouldn\u2019t want a cute little thing like yourself to have to share the couch with us big girls,\u201d she looked down at you with a warm expression. You appreciated the lengths she seemed to be going to to make your time working here easy. Although the way she seemed to fuss over you was a little embarrassing.<br>\r\nFinally Mariah walked through a door on the other side of the break room, leading into a small office space with two desks. You could see one of them, which was very disorganised and untidy, had a picture of Mariah and her family, pretty much giving away that this was her desk. The other was more organised, but was covered in various documents and invoices, however it was currently empty, it\u2019s occupant wasn\u2019t here yet.<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Stefanie\u2019s, our accountant, and my office. I\u2019m not in here very much, paperwork\u2019s not really my thing. I prefer to be in the kitchen making delicious food!\u201d You could tell from the way that Mariah excitedly talked about her job that she loved it very much.<br>\r\n\u201cSo, it\u2019ll take a few days for us to get you a uniform, we\u2019ve never had a little cutie like yourself before so we don\u2019t have any uniforms that\u2019ll fit you. For today I think the best thing is for you to be my adorable little assistant in the kitchen. We can maybe get you to do customer service another day, I\u2019m sure a little thing like yourself would be very popular with our customers but to start you off I think kitchen experience is better,\u201d you nodded as Mariah finished explaining things to you and she smiled warmly in return. <br>\r\n\u201cSounds good to me boss,\u201d you replied with confidence. In truth however you were incredibly nervous. A kitchen could be a dangerous place for someone your size, but you didn\u2019t want to disappoint your new boss on the first day, or Morgan and Avery for that matter either, they seemed pretty excited for you to work with their mom.<br>\r\nWith the tour over with Mariah sets you down on her desk. You try not to move too far just in case she loses you amongst all the stuff on her desk. After setting you down she went to grab her apron and started to look for her hairnet but after a few minutes of looking she let out a frustrated sigh.<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is my hairnet, I\u2019m sure I left it in this office before I left last night. What am I going to do, I can\u2019t cook with my hair down like this, I need to find something to hold my hair back,\u201d as she said this her eyes drifted to you with a pleading look that worried you. \u201cHey little guy, I need to ask you for a huge favour, I can\u2019t seem to find my hairnet, and I can\u2019t cook with my hair down like this. Would you be fine with me using you as a hair band for today, we can get to training you tomorrow?\u201d <br>\r\nAs you looked up at her warm, smiling face you struggled to find a reason to say no. Her low cut top displaying her abundant cleavage also distracted you from thinking of any reasons to say no.<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah sure, whatever you need, boss,\u201d you sheepishly smiled up to her, dreading this shift now that you were going to have to spend it as an object.<br>\r\n\u201cYay, oh thank you so much you little cutie. I don\u2019t know what I would have done without ya!\u201d Her relieved expression eased your apprehension about this situation, she wasn\u2019t doing this out of maliciousness, just that she needed help. Plus she was your boss so helping her out with this favour could only be a good thing, right?<br>\r\nAfter thanking you, Mariah quickly picked you up and began to stretch you out, before pulling her hair back into a bun and wrapping you around it, holding it in place.<br>\r\n\u201cThanks so much little guy, just hold out till the end of the shift and then I\u2019ll let you out ok?\u201d With that, Mariah quickly strode out into the kitchen.<br>\r\nThe rest of the day went by fairly uneventfully, you served as Mariah\u2019s hair tie well while she prepared countless delicious meals, all the while she was happily humming a song when she wasn\u2019t communicating with her staff. Her hair smelled fruity from the shampoo she must have washed it with, although towards the end the smell of grease and burgers began to overtake it. Other than that it was kind of boring. Mariah acknowledged you every now and then, asking how you were doing before realising you couldn\u2019t talk in your stretched out form and giggling to herself for her silliness.<br>\r\nEventually the day came to an end and, after serving her last burger of the day, Mariah went back into her office and took off her apron and then you. She smiled down at you, easing your fear that she may have forgotten you.<br>\r\n\u201cYou did great little guy. Tomorrow I think we\u2019ll get you to do some stuff in the kitchen though, I don\u2019t think you signed up to be my hair tie, but if you ever feel like a career change you\u2019re pretty good at it,\u201d she laughed at her own joke. \u201cAnyway they\u2019ll be almost ready to close up shop, let\u2019s get out of here, little guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Mariah drives you home and says she\u2019ll be back tomorrow to pick you up again at the same time.<br>\r\n2) Tomorrow is the day for giving the kitchen a deep clean before opening so you and Mariah will need to be in early, so she takes you home to spend the night with her and Lilyana.<br>\r\n3) She asks Phoebe to take you home as she has somewhere else to be. Will Phoebe take you home? </span></div></div>",

After locking up and saying goodbye to her staff, Mariah sauntered off towards her car. Looking down at your body, almost fully reformed, she smiled down at you.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re probably wondering why we closed so soon after the dinner rush tonight,\u201d as she said this you looked up, seeing that it was still fairly light out, you\u2019d guess it was only around 6pm. \u201cIt\u2019s to give my staff an early finish on a Wednesday, because tomorrow morning we need to be in bright and early for the kitchen\u2019s weekly deep clean, stuff that we just don\u2019t have time to do at closing or opening normally. So, so that we don\u2019t wake my daughters and Quinn up super early tomorrow, it\u2019s probably a good idea for you to sleep at mine and Lilyana\u2019s place tonight, that sound good to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, now fully reformed in your new boss\u2019s hand, thought for a moment. As much as you thought it would be a bit strange staying in the house of your new boss who you only just met yesterday, it would be more considerate for your new roommates if you avoided waking them up really early tomorrow. With your mind made up you looked back up to Mariah.<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing boss, sounds good to me, as long as it\u2019s not an issue for you and Lilyana?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs that\u2019s sweet of you to check it\u2019s fine but I\u2019m sure Lilyana would love to have a little cute thing like yourself around!\u201d Mariah calling you a \u201cthing\u201d was a little insulting but you decided to let it slide, you didn\u2019t want to get on your boss\u2019 bad side on your first day. Happy with your agreement, Mariah sent a text to Morgan to let her know you wouldn\u2019t be home tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah deposited you back into her purse, got in her car and started to drive home. The car journey was relatively quick, and before long you felt the purse being picked up once more, swaying slightly with every step Mariah took towards her house. You heard the sound of a door opening and then saw the purse open as Mariah plucked you out and deposited you in her open palm. <br>\r\n\u201cBabe I\u2019m home, and we\u2019ve got a little lodger for tonight!\u201d Mariah squealed out, clearly excited to have you staying with them tonight. As she shouted out you got a look at the hall of the fairly large house that Mariah and Lilyana lived in, it was beautifully decorated and spacious.<br>\r\nLilyana quickly strode out from the living room on your left, wearing a professional grey dress and nothing on her feet, glancing down at the floor you saw a pair of high heels sat near the door, obviously Lilyana had just recently got home as well. Lilyana\u2019s angelic face beamed a radiant smile when she saw her wife, which seemed to grow even wider when she spotted you standing on her wife\u2019s palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, my beautiful wife is home, and she brought a cute little man with her! How was your first day at your new job, little man?\u201d Lilyana approached as she said this. Now standing in front of her wife, who held you at around chest height, Lilyana towered high above you. Before you could answer Lilyana leaned forward and planted a kiss on Mariah\u2019s lips, leaning on the hand that was holding you and smushing you under her modest, yet still large enough to crush you, breasts. As Lilyana pulled back, both women looked down to Mariah\u2019s hand and saw you laying on it, flattened. Both women started to giggle, finding Lilyana\u2019s unintentional crushing of you hilarious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess the little guy\u2019s a bit to flat to talk right now, so I\u2019ll tell you. He didn\u2019t get a whole lot of training today because he was nice enough to fill in as my hair tie, since I think I left my hairnet here, it was so sweet of the little cutie. I don\u2019t know what I would have done without him,\u201d you felt yourself blush slightly at Mariah\u2019s praise.<br>\r\n\u201cReally, so the little man is happy to be turned into useful things, yes?\u201d Lilyana seemed to be directing this question to Mariah instead of you, which you found strange. You definitely wouldn\u2019t want to get turned into \u201cuseful things\u201d if you could help it, but you were too flat to voice that right now.<br>\r\n\u201cSeems to be, yeah. I think he\u2019s just happy to be helpful, the sweet little cutie that he is. Hopefully tomorrow I won\u2019t forget anything and he\u2019ll get some actual training in the kitchen, but I think he\u2019ll definitely be helpful with the weekly deep clean tomorrow,\u201d the two women walked into the living room as they talked, Mariah deposited your flattened form on a tan, cushioned footrest. You were slightly concerned at the colour of your current resting place, but then you looked around and realised with fear that all of the seating in this living room was tan. You just hoped your clothes would hold up through any further squishing you would receive tonight, otherwise being found would likely become an issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you reformed, the two women caught up about their days. Once you finally popped back into shape, Mariah turned to you. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just gonna go fix dinner. You two stay here and relax,\u201d with that Mariah sauntered off to the kitchen, wide hips swaying as she went. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were distracted watching Mariah leave, you felt two heavy thuds a few inches from your position. The cushion of the footrest indented slightly towards the two heavy objects that had landed close to you, causing you to stumble and have to catch yourself to avoid falling over. Turning around you were greeted with the pale soles of Lilyana, who had propped them up on the footrest, not really thinking about the fact that you were also occupying it. Her soles looked soft and well cared for, with a slight layer of sweat on them from wearing her heels all day. Her well pedicured toes stood high above you, you could see her toenails were painted with a deep ocean blue nail polish. Even Lilyana\u2019s feet were a vision of beauty. After taking in the intimidating view of her feet so close to you, they parted slightly and you could see Lilyana smiling at you from what seemed like, from your perspective, a great distance away. Her beautiful face radiating a friendly smile towards you.<br>\r\n\u201cWatch out little one, if you are not careful then you could get smushed under my foots,\u201d she let out a giggle, wiggling her toes playfully. \u201cIn fact, you got squashed twice by them yesterday, I could begin to think you enjoy them!\u201d<br>\r\nYou could tell that she was joking, you hoped. You nervously laughed in response, \u201cheh, yeah Mrs Sinclair. I\u2019ll be more careful in the future.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Lilyana talked for a few more minutes before Mariah returned from the kitchen.<br>\r\n\u201cDinner\u2019s on, it\u2019ll be half an hour or so, so we can just sit and watch some TV till it\u2019s ready,\u201d as Mariah walked past the footrest her shin bumped into it, hitting it hard enough to send you flying off it to the floor. You yet out a yelp as you hit the carpeted floor, but it was cushioned enough that you didn\u2019t flatten very much when you hit it, reforming in a few seconds. <br>\r\nMariah didn\u2019t seem to hear your cry of surprise, but Lilyana did. Her full lips pulled into a playful grin as she saw you on the floor. <br>\r\nYou looked up to see one of Lilyana\u2019s pristine feet descend towards you. Fully expecting to be crushed, you cried out to her to stop, but you were surprised when two of her toes clamped delicately around your body. Between her big and second toes, you smelled a fruity lotion that she must use to clean them, masking a faint hint of sweat. Lilyana carefully lifted you back up onto the footrest using her foot, depositing you back on the footrest safe and unsquished. She smiled down at you, giving you a gentle pat on the head with her big toe before giggling and placing her foot back where it was before. You were surprised at Lilyana\u2019s dexterity with her feet, she didn\u2019t even squish you at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next twenty minutes went without incident, as you sat in front of Lilyana\u2019s feet you all watched a sitcom about a tiny guy getting into various incidents with the unaware women in his life. You didn\u2019t find it particularly funny but Mariah and Lilyana found it hilarious. When the show reached a commercial break you felt the weight on the footrest behind you shift as Lilyana parted her feet to look at you again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, little one. Would you be happy to do me a small favour?\u201d you could see a small mischievous glint in her eyes that made you slightly uneasy about what she would ask. You glanced over to Mariah to see that she seemed to be awaiting your answer. Not wanting to disappoint your new boss, you opened your mouth to speak.<br>\r\n\u201cS-sure Mrs Sinclair, what can I help you with?\u201d you stammered out your answer, which both women seemed to find cute based off their giggles that followed it. Lilyana opened her mouth to voice her request...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) \u201cSince you and my feet seem to be becoming fast-friends, would you mind giving them a small massage? I was wearing uncomfortable shoes all day and they are hurting very much.\u201d <br>\r\n2) \u201cI have a pair of knee high boots that my darling Mariah thinks I look very nice in, but I cannot wear them because there is a tiny thing in it that I cannot see and is very annoying. If you could get it out I would have much appreciation.\u201d<br>\r\n3) \u201cCould you help my darling Mariah in the kitchen? She does not ask me to help because I am not very good with the cooking.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAlright little guy. I think the best thing to do on your first day is to get you familiar with working the register. Customer service will be a big part of your job here so I think we\u2019d be best to get that part first. I just know a little cutie like yourself will be popular with our customers!\u201d Mariah\u2019s smile beamed down at you and you couldn\u2019t help but smile in return, Mariah\u2019s energy and love for her job was infectious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good to me boss!\u201d Your smile faltered slightly when you looked to Mariah\u2019s right and saw Phoebe eying you maliciously. <br>\r\nSeeing your gaze drawn to Phoebe, but not the fear behind it, Mariah turned to your new coworker.<br>\r\n\u201cI think since our cute new employee will be manning the register with me overseeing him, you should probably work in the kitchen for today Phoebe,\u201d Mariah smiled to her employee, clearly unaware of the younger woman\u2019s desire to hurt you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem Mariah, I prefer kitchen duty anyway,\u201d Phoebe looked momentarily disappointed that she wouldn\u2019t be able to mess with you, before walking off to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhoebe is one of my best workers, I think you two will get along swimmingly!\u201d Looking up at Mariah\u2019s face, blissfully unaware of Phoebes attitude towards her, you doubted that very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah carried you over to the register and placed you down next to it. As she walked the short distance, she started speaking to you.<br>\r\n\u201cAlright little guy, I know you\u2019re probably thinking that there\u2019s not much you could do with a register since it\u2019s so much bigger than you, well you\u2019re in luck! We just got a new register system a few weeks ago, and they\u2019re touch screens! We can just lay the tablet down on the counter and you can just jump on the buttons to take peoples orders, isn\u2019t that cool?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Mrs Sinclair, how will I take peoples money?\u201d You were concerned on how effectively you\u2019d be able to do this part of the job just based off of handling normal sized money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw don\u2019t worry cutie. Most people play using a card or their phone anyway, but if you do get cash, just press this button on the screen,\u201d as she said this and pressed the button she was referring to, a drawer popped out from the counter behind you, looking over the edge it was maybe a 2 inch drop inch drop down there, and enough footholds in the counter for you to climb back up out of it. \u201cOnce that\u2019s open you can just drop the money in there, and there\u2019s another button here to close it. Neat, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of Mariah\u2019s statements eased your concerns slightly, and to be honest you were probably safer out here than in the kitchen. Any number of accidents could happen in there. You shuddered at the thought of getting trapped in a burger and served to an unaware customer, which was especially likely with Phoebe working in the kitchen as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds all good to me boss!\u201d You joked by giving a salute, which caused Mariah to giggle.<br>\r\n\u201cI think you\u2019ll be a wonderful addition to the Sinclair Sandwiches Team!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah picked you up and took you through to her back office to get your contract signed and order you a uniform that would fit you. In the meantime you had been asked to wear some clothes that matched the colours of the restaurant so you could be identified as staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright little guy, let\u2019s go take some people\u2019s orders! All you have to remember that the customer\u2019s experience here is the most important thing, we pride ourselves on our friendly and helpful staff. So as long as you remember that you\u2019ll do great.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nodded as Mariah picked you up to take you out front to start your shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been working at the register for the last three hours and it was going well. Every customer was being nice or at least patient with you, recognising that you would be a bit slower than their usual cashiers. Many women fawned over how cute you were, which made you attempt to focus on endearing their orders on the screen to hide your embarrassment.<br>\r\nThis was often helped by Mariah, who\u2019s friendly and exuberant personality took some of each customer\u2019s attention off of you. Although a lot of their conversations revolved around how adorable the women found you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings had been going smoothly, the morning rush having finished, and there would likely be an hour or so till the lunch rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright little guy, I think I\u2019ll take my lunch break now that it\u2019s gotten quiet, after I get back I\u2019ll cover the register so you can get yours,\u201d you started to get a little uneasy at the prospect of being left on your own, and you must have shown it in your expression because Mariah looked at you reassuringly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry cutie, it won\u2019t likely get busy again until after my break\u2019s over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah walked through to her office to enjoy her lunch, leaving you to your own devices. There were no customers waiting to be served, so you were left with nothing to do other than look around and watch the customers who were eating. The restaurant wasn\u2019t packed but there were a few tables still occupied, and observing them was one of the few things you could do while you waited for something else to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were looking around the seating area your eyes fell on a family consisting of a mother and two preteen girls. The girls were being incredibly loud and it appeared to be bothering some of the other customers, but the mother seemed disinterested, as she was absorbed by her phone. <br>\r\nYou watched as she, after tucking her phone into her bra, peeled back the top of her burger, removed the two pieces of bacon on the bun and ate them. She glanced around the restaurant and, convinced no ones as seen what she had done, got up and walked towards you, hamburger in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she approached, you took in her appearance. She was tall, you\u2019d guess maybe six feet tall, and her made-up, slightly snub-nosed  face was framed by a soccer mom styled blonde hair. She was wearing a low cut, dark grey T-shirt and a pair of tight jeans. Her generous breasts strained against the T-shirt, stretching the deep v-cut neckline to be more open than it should have been. Her tight jeans hugged her wide hips tightly, and based off of the looks you could see the male customers giving her as she walked by, her behind was as blessed as her bust was. Her T-shirt didn\u2019t go all the way down to her jeans, and in the gap in between them you could see a midriff that was just slightly further than what could be considered pudgy, her fairly prominent muffin top peeking over the rim of her jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe approached the counter with a mean look on her face that told you she was going to be trouble. She finally came to a stop as close to the counter as he could, her massive breasts leaving you in their shadow in a way that was very intimidating to someone of your size. You saw her forehead and eyes come into view as she looked down at you past her bust without bending over at all.<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, I asked for bacon on this burger and there\u2019s none on it. I want a refund.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up into the eyes of this gigantic woman looming over you, as she looked down on you with a sense of entitlement. It was obvious that she was simply doing this to get a free meal, and whether it was through stubborn stupidity or a loyalty to your new place of work, you decided to call her out on it.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry miss, but I just watched you take the bacon off yourself before you walked over here. I know there was bacon on your burger,\u201d you felt good telling this entitled woman no. It\u2019s likely that most people didn\u2019t have the courage to stand up to her, reinforcing this behaviour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you refused her, she leaned down towards the counter, her head now hovering directly over you. As she bent over, her pendulous breasts hanged in front of you, barely restricted by her top and bra that was clearly ill suited for such a heavy load. You couldn\u2019t help but stare at them as they hanged directly in front of you. She seemed to notice your stares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs so not just a rude employee, but a pervert as well! Listen here you little shit, there was no bacon and my burger and you are going to give me a refund NOW!\u201d As she raised her voice you couldn\u2019t help but shrink slightly at the forceful personality of this aggressive woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... Uh, Again, I\u2019m sorry miss but I know there was no problem with your order. I can\u2019t help you if there isn\u2019t a problem,\u201d you half pleaded with her, just wanting this situation to be over with. You silently hoped someone would come and support you, but it looked like you were the only person stupid enough to get into an argument with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bet your ass there\u2019s a problem. Do you bugs have less brainpower as well as less height or something? I. WANT. MY. REFUND! And I\u2019m not leaving until I get it,\u201d she was clearly trying to intimidate you, and it was working. \u201cI mean really, all I wanted to do was ask for a refund on my meal which wasn\u2019t made to my specifications and for my trouble I\u2019ve been objectified and called a liar! Someone really should teach you a lesson about manners!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were becoming increasingly worried that if someone didn\u2019t interfere, this woman was going to harm you in some way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) No one interferes, so the woman grabs you. She may decide to use you as a replacement for her too small bra, or add you as a topping to her burger.<br>\r\n2) Mariah intervenes, having heard the commotion, and believes the woman. She is very disappointed in you for being rude to a customer.<br>\r\n3) Mariah intervenes, having heard the commotion, and believes you. She handles the rude customer and your shift continues. </span></div></div>",

Hop on!\" She said, slapping her open palm down onto the coffee table, nearly squishing you in doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you climbed up onto Avery's outstretched hand, you caught sight of Morgan's somewhat reserved expression, as well as Quinn's trademark indifference. No doubt Morgan had a few reservations about you hanging out with her airheaded sister, but she smiled again a moment later. Standing up, Morgan offered her hand to Quinn, helping the black-haired giantess to her feet, and then the two girls strolled away into the kitchen, perhaps to talk for a bit while having a snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft alone with Avery, the pink-haired girl looked at you with adoring eyes. \"What'cha wanna do, Hunter?

You honestly weren't sure if this was any better than flying away, and could only look up uselessly at Avery's sexy, beaming face, as she was holding you too tightly to move. Were you getting in too deep and too fast with her? Hopefully not. Eventually, she reached her bedroom on the second floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery showed off her room, and it was right in the same ballpark as how you would've guessed. It was relatively organized, but filled to the brim with personal belongings. There were a large number of dressers and drawers for clothes, a sprawling make-up table, and even a full-size mannequin currently wearing a sparkly white dress. There was hardly any free space, and the whole room was colored in a wide assortment of rainbow hues, though mostly bright pinks, blues, and reds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the totes cute private quarters of Princess Avery!\" Avery declared dramatically, adopting a silly posh accent as she spoke. She finished with a flourishing spin, in which you finally slipped out of her grasp and fluttered down onto the corner of her bed, still slightly mushed. You sighed at the ditzyness of your new roommate, and began focusing on reforming, your limbs slowly inflating back to normal. As you reformed, you looked up at Avery finishing her twirl, only for the giantess to then back up towards you and begin to sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the second time in one day, an ass of meteoric proportions descending towards you from above, shadows falling over you. Though not comparable to Quinn's humongous derriere, Avery's was no less succulent nor threatening, most of the girl's tanned, curvy buttocks revealed because of her barely-there booty shorts. You only just had enough time to reform your arms and scramble away, crawling frantically as her booty plopped down onto the bed right where you had been. Even still, her bare thigh caught your right leg, pinning you in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Avery! Hey!\" You cried up at her, catching her attention. Glancing down at you, Avery blinked in surprise and then smiled sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops! How'd you end up there, cutie?\" Avery smirked, grabbing your upper body and yanking you out from under her thigh. She then held you in front of her beautiful face, leaving you to dangle as she kept smiling at you. Your legs reformed, and you wished she'd put you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could say so, she spoke first. \"So, like, what's the plan, man? Hee hee. We can do whatevs you want, Hunter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to drop the issue of being dangled like a doll for the moment, you thought about her question. Apparently, you took too long for her mile-a-minute attitude, because she began rambling again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, we could pull a prank on someone, that would be so funny!\" Avery smirked mischievously. \"I always pull pranks on Morgan, but now we've got Quinn to mess with! She seems like a totes tough nut to crack, so we need to be uber smart with her.\" Avery winked at you. \"But, you'll help out, right cutie? The pranks we could do with a squishy man like you...ooh!\" Avery looked absolutely ecstatic, and you didn't know whether to find that terrifying or endearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later, Avery glanced over to her closet, and frowned. \"Ah man, totally forgot about my missing box.\" She looked at you sadly, like a pouting puppy dog, and explained. \"One of my boxes of clothes got lost. It had some of my favorite, comfy stuff in it. Like thongs, and bras, and bikinis, and skirts, and stuff. Just the best, most cute outfits. It'll suck to replace those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to hear that.\" You said, and you sincerely meant it. Losing belongings was always a pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery smiled genuinely at that, perhaps the first smile that wasn't one of her giddy, energetic ones. A moment later though, and Avery began staring at you intently, her eyes focusing in on you to a degree that almost felt a bit scary. It was like she was analyzing you, and you could nearly make out the gears turning in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Avery's face broke into a huge, playful grin, and she blurted out her plans for spending the day with you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cOMG, Hunter! I totes thought of the absolute, best, funniest prank!\u201d Avery gushed excitedly. The pink-haired giantess bounced enthusiastically on her bed, and you really, really wished she would put you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to form a coherent thought despite all the shaking, you spoke up. \u201cW-well\u2026what kind of prank is it, Avery?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery\u2019s Cheshire grin was irresistibly cute, while still possessing a disconcertingly mischievous hint to it. \u201cWe gotta prank Quinn, little dude! You\u2019re totes perfect for it, so I was kinda thinking of some funny stuff to do, and then it hit me!\u201d The bubbly giantess paused for a moment, and bit her lip tentatively. Looking at you with downcast eyes, she curled her sensual lips into a pout. \u201cYou\u2019ll help me\u2026right, Hunter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a twenty-one-year-old man with minimal experience with giantesses outside of your immediate family, you were putty in her hands. Almost dreamily, you nodded and smiled. \u201cS-sure thing, Avery. Anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery\u2019s expression burst into joy, and she giggled happily. \u201cAw, thanks, cutie! Love ya so much!\u201d She exclaimed, then rushed you up towards her mouth before you could react. An attempt at crying out left you the instant Avery pressed you into her plush lips, embracing your entire body in an enveloping hug of pleasure. Rational thought left your mind as Avery\u2019s lips caressed your body, easily overtaking your one-inch form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was blissful, and far too short form your perspective, as Avery pulled you away after ten seconds of kissing, ending with a resounding \u2018smack\u2019 noise. You were coated in a bit of moisture from her lips, and practically panting for breath. Noting your obvious enjoyment of her kiss, Avery snickered playfully, a faint blush in her own cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere we go, cutie! Your reward for being such an adorable lil\u2019 trooper!\u201d Avery explained. \u201cBut, enough of messing around. Pranks are serious business, right? We don\u2019t cut corners around here!\u201d Avery wagged her finger. \u201cThis could be a little uncomfy for ya, Hunter, but totes worth it in the end. I hope!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout explaining herself further, Avery moved her palms together, angling you between them. Still riding the high of her kiss, you didn\u2019t process what was about to happen until it was too late. The ditzy giantess clapped her hands together, demolishing your tiny body and slamming you flatter than paper. By rubbing her palms in circles afterwards, Avery mashed your malleable body into a circular shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind was racing into overtime now at this drastic change in your situation, but Avery wasn\u2019t done yet. Powerless to fight her now that you were crushed, you could only grimace and blush further as Avery smoothed you out into a perfect circle, then effortlessly tore your clothes off with a single swipe of her well-manicured fingernails. You were left stark naked in her hand, a fact that brought a grin to Avery\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for taking this for the team, Hunter.\u201d Avery smiled playfully, flicking her eyes across your body. \u201cOMG, you are a looker, huh? Gawd, so cute!\u201d She winked at you, and then reigned herself back in. \u201cAnyway\u2026time to sneak into Quinn\u2019s room. I\u2019m hoping she\u2019s still downstairs, so we can be all quiet like ninjas! Uber pretty ninjas!\u201d She giggled with a lilt, and then crept out of her room and down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Quinn\u2019s room was empty, allowing Avery to waltz in unobstructed. As she entered the room, carefully maneuvering around the mess of clothes and belongings strewn about, she made her way to a dresser by the wall. On top of the dresser, there was a black bra, pair of panties, t-shirt, and shorts lying out. Avery came to a stop in front of the bra, and the smile on her face sent shivers of fear down your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkiedokie, Hunter! Here we are!\u201d Avery whispered excitedly. \u201cWhen we were moving in earlier, I totes saw Quinn set these clothes out all purposefully and stuff. It\u2019s gotta be what she\u2019s wearing tomorrow. SO! I\u2019m gonna stick you to her bra, where you can hide out or whatever, and then when she goes to put it on tomorrow, you can leap out and spook her! Or maybe tickle her! Or, or, or\u2026bite her, or something! Whatever you want, hee hee!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery, lost in her own imagined enjoyment of your future shenanigans, didn\u2019t feel your frantic, panicked wiggles and squirms of terror. She merely moved her hand over the inside of the left cup of Quinn\u2019s bra, and then dropped you inside. Your body sank into the cup, sliding down to the very bottom of the curve, and coming to rest. The sides of the cup arched up all around you, creating a funnel of vision that just barely revealed Avery\u2019s radiant face out of the top. You were remained of just how utterly massive Quinn\u2019s chest was, which brought equal feelings of anxiety and anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour partner-in-crime, however, frowned. \u201cUgh, wait. Your tone totally clashes with the bra. She\u2019ll she you right away. Plus, you look like you\u2019d slide around easily, not stick.\u201d Avery sighed, demonstrating surprising thoughtfulness. Unfortunately, that thoughtfulness continued, albeit down a dangerous path. \u201cGimme a sec, Hunter. Be back in a jiffy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery skipped away, leaving you all alone in Quinn\u2019s bra. Wanting no part in a prank this ill-conceived and intimate, you tried to reform. Alas, you made no progress by the time Avery returned. Helpless, you couldn\u2019t do a thing as she fished you out of the bra cup and laid you out on the dresser beside Quinn\u2019s delicates. In her hand was a small bottle of some sort of polish liquid, and in her other, a brush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you need a touch-up, mister!\u201d Avery giggled, trying and failing to sound serious. With an adorable look of concentration on her face (complete with tongue sticking out), Avery dipped the brush into the bottle, and then proceeded to paint all over your tiny body, vigorously and thoroughly. The polish was chillingly cold, freezing your skin, but you couldn\u2019t do much to stop Avery now. Any opportunity of convincing her to stop this ridiculous prank was long gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn minutes, your entire body, crushed into a small circle as it was, was perfectly and uniformly colored black. Avery hadn\u2019t missed a spot, and had even found polish with the same exact black consistency as Quinn\u2019s bra. Side-by-side, you realized that you matched it entirely, and that realization genuinely made your blood run cold. Did Avery even realize the position she was about to put you in? Probably not, knowing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery picked you up, smiling happily at her good job, then replaced you into the bra cup. This time, she applied extra pressure herself, rubbing you down in place. Her fingers massaged your body into the fabric of the bra cup, until you felt yourself firmly sticking in place. Actually, it felt more like the sticky polish that had painted you black was adhering to the fabric of the bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully (or perhaps not), Avery elaborated after she finished molding you into place. \u201cSo, this handy dandy polish stuff is totes super-sticky. Glues itself to pretty much anything. Now, you should be in no danger of slipping out or coming undone.\u201d Avery twirled a strand of her hair. \u201cActually, it could take some extreme measures to even get you out as well. Isn\u2019t that amazing? There\u2019s no way our prank can fail now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour world shattered at that last remark, as it fully dawned on you that Avery had just painted you to blend into a black bra perfectly, then essentially perma-glued you in place. With the polish already hardening, it sank in that you truly were now incapable of movement. On top of that, the polish coating sealed over your face, keeping you entirely flat and thus incapable of speech. How could you even prank Quinn, at this point? The only visible part of you was your miniscule, beady eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAirheaded Avery was oblivious to this though, and all she did was blow you a kiss, sauntered out of the room, and turn of the lights, leaving you well and truly alone. For the first hour you tried to reform just out of desperation, but it was hopeless. Avery had done far too good a job painting you and ironing you into place. You were locked into this now, whether you wanted to or not. In fact, it\u2019d take help from Avery, or perhaps Quinn, to even get you loose now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours passed with nothing but silence to keep you company. Meanwhile, Avery spent the rest of the day chatting and hanging out with Morgan and Quinn. She made up a lie about you being tired and resting in her room to cover for your disappearance. Your new roommates bought it, and no one thought twice about you that evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLate in the night, the lights flicked on as Quinn strolled into the room. You weren\u2019t able to glimpse her, but you could hear her stripping out of her clothes, doing one last check of her phone, and then climbing into bed. The lights went out again, and after a while, you could faintly hear soft breathing. Quinn was asleep. Taking her cue, you gave up your fruitless fights and allowed yourself to slip off to slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were awakened around eight o\u2019clock the next morning by the sound of Quinn moving around. The lights were on again, and after blinking to adjust your vision, you saw the utterly enrapturing sight of a topless Quinn standing beside her dresser. Thoughts of panic or unease fled your mind and were replaced by amazement and awe. Quinn\u2019s breasts were massive normally, but towering above you and fully nude, it was like gazing at a goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later, and Quinn angled herself to peer down at her bra. Miraculously, her eyes actually seemed to snap right onto your body, and a small frown crossed Quinn\u2019s face. At that moment, you suddenly realized that you weren\u2019t so sure you even wanted to be seen by her. How would she react? What would happen if she was annoyed? Or even angry?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Quinn\u2019s frown softened slightly, and you could see a glint of recognition in her eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cHunter.\u201d She said flatly before pausing, and after a few seconds of silence, during which she seemed to be thinking, although her neutral expression made it difficult to tell, she continued. \u201cI guess this was Avery\u2019s idea, since she covered for you last night, some kind of prank? I guess I\u2019ll need to try to get her back at some point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised how quickly she picked up on the situation, but that surprise was soon replaced with shock as she began to move the bra towards her titanic boobs. Wasn\u2019t she going to take you out first! Your eyes went wide with shock and fear at the rapidly approaching mammaries, and Quinn seemed to notice as she stopped moving the bra towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, what? You\u2019re on my bra, dude. The bra that I\u2019m planning on wearing, why are you surprised that I\u2019m going to put it on?\u201d Quinn looked slightly irritated by your interruptions of her morning. You tried your best to plead with her with you eyes, which she seemed to pick up on. \u201cHey dude, you\u2019re the one one that\u2019s on MY bra. You gotta be able to get yourself out of these kinds of situations. Plus, taking the time to peel you off of my bra would be an inconvenience I\u2019ve not got time for right now, I\u2019m meeting my mom to go shopping and I need to leave soon or I\u2019ll be late. She can be seriously overbearing and the last thing I need is her constant stream of texts when I\u2019m late.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, you were pulled towards Quinn\u2019s planetary left breast. The last thing you saw before everything went dark was the underside of Quinn\u2019s left breast rocketing towards your face, realising with fear that you were on the lower portion of the bra cup. You were pressed incredibly tightly into the soft skin of Quinn\u2019s boob, and you only felt the pressure increase as Quinn clasped it around her back. <br>\r\nFor a brief moment you thought that the pressure couldn\u2019t get much worse, and then Quinn let go of her breasts. As gravity took hold and her boobs dropped back towards her chest, the bra strained to support their mammoth weight. You were glued to the prt of the bra cup that took the most weight of her breast, and you could already feel your flattened form squashed even thinner under it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Quinn\u2019s bust settled into place after she released them, she focused her attention to getting dressed so she could go meet her mom. She thought for a moment that having you around her mom could prove dangerous, but as long as you were tucked in her bra, Quinn doubted her mom would even know you were there. She shrugged her shoulders and kept getting ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she moved around her room gathering clothes, her pendulous swayed and jiggled as she went, barely restricted by the tight bra due to their sheer size alone. Every movement caused your world to shift and sway, causing you both motion sickness and pain as the weight on top of you moved. <br>\r\nAfter a few moments Quinn was dressed in a simple band t-shirt and a pair of tight fitting jeans, along with a pair of converse. Glancing at herself one last time in the mirror, Quinn left her room to go grab breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was simply moving around her room, Quinn\u2019s titanic tit crushed you mercilessly under its weight, but as she started to walk down the stairs it became even worse. Every step gave a sense of weightlessness, before the mammary dropped hard and crushed you further into the fabric of the bra and the embrace of the squishy, pale flesh on top of you. Quinn\u2019s soft boob flesh would probably have been something you wouldn\u2019t have minded getting up close and personal with, but with its full weight bearing down on you it was far from enjoyable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn strolled into the kitchen and filled a bowl of cereal. Morgan was also sitting in the kitchen eating her breakfast, and she smiled as Quinn sat down across from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSleep well?\u201d Morgan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah pretty good,\u201d Quinn shrugged. \u201cAlthough I had an interesting surprise when I woke up this morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Morgan leaned forward, curious what her quiet new roommate was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI found Hunter, flattened out and painted black in the cup of my bra,\u201d Quinn\u2019s expression conveyed no annoyance or embarrassment, so Morgan was slightly confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn your bra? How\u2019d he get in there, I\u2019m guessing he didn\u2019t flatten him else out and put himself in there...\u201d Morgan trailed off as her eyes went wide with realisation. \u201cAvery! She did it didn\u2019t she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose so, some sort of prank I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it\u2019s a good thing you noticed him before you put it on, where is he now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s still in my bra. Didn\u2019t have time to get him out since I\u2019m meeting my mom in like...\u201d Quinn glanced at the clock, her eyes going wide. \u201cShit, I\u2019m going to be late!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly grabbing her bowl and putting it in the sink, Quinn hurried out of the kitchen towards the front door, bountiful chest bouncing as she went. <br>\r\nMorgan was left, mouth wide open in shock. She was shocked at Quinn\u2019s apparent apathy towards your plight, as well as Avery\u2019s boldness on the first day that everyone was living together. She silently hoped that the day wouldn\u2019t be too horrible for you as she watched Quinn leave, bubble butt bouncing as she went. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn passed Avery, who was coming down the stairs, as she was rushing towards the door. Avery looked to Quinn\u2019s chest, a vast valley of cleavage display as the collar of her t-shirt was stretched out by the size of her chest. Remembering your \u201cprank\u201d from the night before, Avery started giggling uncontrollably.<br>\r\nQuinn simply sighed, rolled her eyes, and rushed out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car journey to the mall was uneventful, the constant vibrations from the engine caused the flesh resting on top of you to jiggle constantly, battering your poor, flattened form over and over. The heat of her car was also causing her to sweat a bit, soaking you as your bodies absorbent properties caused it to greedily suck up all of the sweat from Quinn\u2019s underboob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn eventually reached the mall. After parking her car she walked towards the entrance and sent her mom a text saying that she had arrived. As she was distracted from texting she didn\u2019t notice Becky rushing towards her and embracing her daughter in a big hug.<br>\r\nYou were instantly flattened even thinner as Becky\u2019s massive breasts, even larger than Quinn\u2019s, collided with her daughter\u2019s prodigious chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom! You could have at least announced yourself before jumping on me like that!\u201d Quinn huffed, her frustration at her mom\u2019s overbearing nature making your presence in her bra slip her mind completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw my sweet angel, I\u2019m sorry. I was just so excited to see you! I didn\u2019t scare you, did I Quinnie?\u201d Becky smiled warmly at her precious daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d Quinn whispered indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay! Oh you have to tell me about your new roommates! Is your room nice? What\u2019s the area like?...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you listened to the muffled sounds of Quinn answering her mom\u2019s excited barrage of questions, you sighed, knowing that this was going to be a very long day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were blinded by the light as your bra prison was removed from Quinn\u2019s chest. Exposing your eyes to Quinn\u2019s staggeringly attractive naked body for the second time today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had just spent the last several hours buried under Quinn\u2019s heaving chest as she and her mom meandered around various stores shopping for clothes. Quinn seemed very unenthusiastic about most of them from what muffled conversation you made out from your position smushed face first into her boob. <br>\r\nNow that you were exposed to the outside world again you silently begged her to free you, but she didn\u2019t even glance at you as she sat the bra you were stuck to down on the edge of the bench of the changing booth she was in. You could just barely see over the sides of the bra cup that there was a fairly large pile of lingerie on the bench, so you deduced that she was buying underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn proceeded to try on underwear, while you admired her from the inside of her bra cup. Even after a full day of being crushed by her mountainous assets, you still couldn\u2019t get over just how attractive Quinn was. She was quite literally the most attractive woman you had ever seen.<br>\r\nWhile you were admiring her, Quinn\u2019s leg bumped into the bench you were perched on, causing you and the bra you were attached to to slip off of it and land on the floor, under the gap between Quinn\u2019s booth and the one next to her. Your bra cup landed facing up into the booth next to Quinn and you saw, for the first time, the massive form of Quinn\u2019s mother, Becky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family resemblance was obvious, but you had been wrong when you said that Quinn was the most attractive woman you had ever met, because Becky was somehow even more attractive! Her monolithic assets were even larger than Quinn\u2019s, and were on full display as she was also trying on underwear with a happy smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while her eyes drifted down to the black bra lying between her and her daughter\u2019s booths. You could see the gears turning in her head as she tried to figure out who\u2019s bra it was. You just hoped she didn\u2019t notice you, hiding in her daughter\u2019s bra wasn\u2019t exactly a great first impression, even if you were oblivious to her hatred of tinies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Becky decides that the black bra was one she picked up in the store and buys it. She doesn\u2019t notice you. You are taken home with Becky.<br>\r\n2) She doesn\u2019t see you, but realises it\u2019s probably Quinn\u2019s bra. She passes you back into Quinn\u2019s booth.<br>\r\n3) Becky sees you! She also realises that it\u2019s Quinn\u2019s bra, but decides the best way to get rid of you is too put the bra back on the rack in the store.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After an excruciatingly long second, Becky\u2019s gorgeous face finally broke into a somewhat hesitant smile, and the gargantuan woman leaned down to pick the bra up off of the ground. Her mammoth mammaries blocked her face entirely as she bent over to retrieve you, and as the bra was lifted off the ground, your view became entirely filled by the house-sized left breast of this impossibly curvaceous woman. She was going to put you on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an almost slow-mo sense of time, her milky smooth breast inched closer and closer to you, her perky nipple poise to nearly swallow you whole as it would crash directly into your body. However, at what felt like that last possible second, Becky hesitated, and withdrew the bra from her monumental chest. Her beautiful face was now back into a frown of concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm\u2026swear I saw something, actually..\u201d The black-haired giantess murmured softly, and her eyes meticulously scanned every single inch of the bra, until they finally settled on your body. You froze in intense fear, and that fear evolved into bloodcurdling panic as Becky\u2019s analytical frown morphed into a look of overwhelming anger and rage. She had definitely recognized you now, and for some reason or another, it seemed to have really pissed her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you currently remained oblivious to Becky\u2019s nature, having not gotten to know much about Quinn\u2019s personal like. As such, you didn\u2019t know that her mother despised and hated tinies with every fiber of her being. You didn\u2019t know that Becky had a habit out of disposing of tinies, because she saw them as bugs that were beneath her. Quinn hadn\u2019t yet divulged her repressed memories of losing precious tiny friends when she was younger, all because her vindictive mother found them to be freaks unworthy of associating with her innocent angel of a daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Becky\u2019s perspective, she could hardly believe her eyes. Though painted black to blend in, and thusly just about invisible, Becky could nonetheless make out the faint outline of a tiny embedded into the lower portion of the left cup of the bra. By squinting, she could make out the disgusting, perverted bugs terror-stricken face, and that sight gave her some small comfort. At least the bug knew enough to realize how badly he\u2019d screwed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was abundantly clear to Becky know that the bra she was holding was not her own, and she vaguely recalled seeing the black straps of her darling daughter\u2019s bra when they\u2019d entered the changing room together. However, this only made her rage boil twice as furiously, as now it was clear that some worthless, puny, degenerate tiny had broken into her daughter\u2019s new apartment, painted himself black as a disguise, and violated her chastity and modesty by tricking her into unknowingly wearing the bra he was glued to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason Becky\u2019s mind went to this conclusion was two-fold. One: Becky always and without fail thought the worst of tinies, never giving them a chance to explain themselves before administering her cruel judgment upon them. Two: Quinn, knowing this about her mother, had willingly withheld information about her new tiny roommate during their conversations all day. As such, Becky didn\u2019t know anyone named Hunter even existed. Though Quinn had done it to attempt to protect you, it was really screwing you now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you say something, mom?\u201d Quinn inquired from the adjacent stall, and Becky froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026nothing, Quinnie! Just thinking about which of these darling little outfits to take home with me!\u201d Becky replied with a cheery disposition that contrasted sharply with the malice glinting in her eyes that bored straight into your soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another moment of terrifying contemplation, Becky grinned from ear-to-ear, cruelty written on her gorgeous face for all to see. She\u2019d concocted a simple yet brilliantly effective plan for disposing of the wretched little tiny who\u2019d DARED to abuse and take advantage of her precious angel. She\u2019d also refrain from breathing a single word of her plan to Quinn. Though she loved her daughter dearly, the treatment of tinies was often a sticking point between them. Becky knew she\u2019d want to give the lecherous bug a fair chance at defending himself, which was a ludicrous notion in Becky\u2019s mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me for a second, Quinnie!\u201d Becky called happily. With haste, she threw on the red bra she\u2019d worn to the mall, slipped back into a blouse that barely contained her outrageous assets, and sauntered out into the store proper. With outside the exit of the changing room, there was a small bin labeled \u2018RETURN FOR RESHELVING\u2019. Smiling callously one last time at you, Becky slammed you down into the bin, pushing you deep under a veritable mountain of other clothing items. Sufficient treatment for a bug as far as Becky was concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky then, with a skip in her step, walked back into the changing room, gathered up her belongings, and put the clothes she was considering purchasing back into her shopping bag. Then, she enacted the final and most devious step in her plan. She\u2019d plucked an incredibly similar black bra from the store racks with the intention of trying it on, but now that she was still holding onto it, it aided her in sealing the deal on that foul little freak. All she had to do was use her manicured nails to slice the security and price tags off the bra, then stuff the tags into the nearest trash can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as inconspicuously as possible, Becky tossed the bra over the divider to her daughter, who let out a soft yelp but caught you deftly. Becky giggled. \u201cYou dropped this earlier, my angel! The bra you wore here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn, thrown off by her mother\u2019s unexpected toss, stammered out a reply. \u201cTh-thanks\u2026sorry about dropping them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem at all, Quinnie my angel!\u201d Becky said in a singsong manner. \u201cAll ready to check out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u2026\u201d Quinn trailed off, looking at the relatively small pile of clothing she had actually found that fit her and felt comfy. Shrugging, your roommate slipped the black bra on, once more not even bothering to glance at you. She wasn\u2019t mad at you, per say, but she was definitely a bit disappointed. Still, she had a feeling Avery had strong-armed you into the prank plan, so maybe she\u2019d help you free later in the day. Maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, if Quinn had actually bothered to check for you, she would\u2019ve found a totally empty area on her spotless black bra. In her rush to re-dress herself and still a bit off-kilter from Becky\u2019s bra toss, Quinn was none-the-wiser to how thoroughly she\u2019d stepped into her mother\u2019s trap. Becky was all-too-pleased with her performance at executing the tiny\u2019s deserved punishment, and only grinned wider as Quinn nonchalantly dumped her unwanted clothes into the \u2018RETURN FOR RESHELVING\u2019 bin on their way out of the changing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you were in a full-on panic mode, barely able to think straight as you fought desperately to reform. However, Avery had done far too good a job on sealing you in place, and you couldn\u2019t budge an inch. You actually began to wonder if you even could escape on your own, or if outside help was a necessity by now. Avery had described the black polish she\u2019d glued you with as being difficult to break free from. How could you find help now, alone as you were?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA full hour of quiet passed, and you made no progress in the slightest towards reforming. By this point, Quinn and Becky were chowing down on lunch in the food court, and planning on heading back to the apartment afterwards. Becky was on cloud nine at how successful she\u2019d been in defending her daughter from yet another tiny pervert, and Quinn firmly believed she still had you safely tucked away. You could only wallow in depression, and wonder why Becky had done something so horrible to you without even getting to know you first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, weight above you lifted, but it became almost instantly apparent that this spelled disaster instead of salvation. A store employee soon came into view, and the disinterested girl didn\u2019t even glance at your direction as she flipped the bra over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn. Stuck-up customers damaging the merchandise. Where the hell\u2019s the price tag and security tag?\u201d The girl groaned. Swearing under her breath, she tucked you under her arm and wandered off to the back room, allowing her fellow employee\u2019s to finish emptying and reshelving the items from the returns bin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back room, the employee typed away on her computer, and managed to come up with an inventory database that recorded all items the store owned. A few more clicks and she found the page for the same black bra manufacturing as the one you were stuck you. A few more seconds after that, and she\u2019d printed out another price tag and security tag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slapped the price tag onto the front of the right cup, and attached the security tag and plastic clip to one of the straps. Still complaining under her breath about all the extra work, the girl shuffled back into the store and into the lingerie department, heading far down the aisle to where the largest sizes were on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, the girl noticed an empty slot in the rack of black bras (left by the bra that Becky had taken just a while ago). Grabbing a spare hook, the employee hung up the bra and dropped the hook into place. You were now, completing against your will and with no way to fight against it, a part of the store\u2019s inventory, stuck up on the rack of black bras. The outside of the cups faced outward towards the aisle, so all you could do was face the bland wall, and no one would spot you by strolling by (though you were still, of course, practically invisible to all but the closest inspection).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow had your life come to this?</span></div></div>",

You wouldn\u2019t mind doing a favor for me, wouldya cutie?\u201d Avery asked with a lilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill hanging in the air between her fingers, you kind of felt like you didn\u2019t have much of a choice, but you still asked anyway. \u201cUm\u2026well it depends on what kind of favor, Avery.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery, still radiating mischief, but her lip cutely. Apparently even she was a tiny bit apprehensive of what she wanted to ask you. \u201cW-well\u2026basically I was thinking\u2026ya know?\u201d Avery hesitated, and sort of wiggled a little while seated, the dictionary definition of adorable anxiety. Though you were apprehensive of what this flirty, ditzy girl had planned, she was incredibly cute\u2026even if you could still picture yourself lying on the corner of her mattress, stuck under her while she was doing all this squirming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \u201cListen, Avery. No need to be scared. I am willing to help if you\u2019ll just explain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink-haired giantess\u2019 cheeks actually flushed red. \u201cO-oh, I\u2019m not scared\u2026just\u2026\u201d She put her finger to her chin. \u201cYou tiny cuties are all squishy and stretchy, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you saw that earlier today. When Quinn sat on me.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I mean\u2026like\u2026SUPER squishy and stretchy. Like, you can be molded and stuff?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small feeling of dread welled up inside of you, but you pushed on regardless. \u201cSure, yeah. It\u2019s kind of like our defensive mechanism. A tradeoff for being born like this.\u201d You admitted, even if you felt that being squishy and stretchy was often directly the cause of so much trauma and torment throughout your life. You refrained from telling this to Avery, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery perked up. \u201cAh! That\u2019s totes what I thought! So you\u2019d be willing to help me out with my favor then, right cutie?\u201d She leaned a little closer to you, winked flirtatiously, then exhaled. A cool, minty breath brushed past her luscious lips and over your tiny body, lightly blowing you in the wind. You momentarily lost all sense of self, the cool caress of Avery\u2019s breath tickling your body, her minty fresh scent overwhelmingly satisfying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a brief moment of lost composure, you nodded without even thinking. \u201cUh\u2026yeah, of course. I\u2019ll help you out, Avery.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery lit up like the night sky twinkling with stars, grinning widely and blissfully. \u201cAw! Thank you so much! You\u2019re a lifesaver, Hunter!\u201d Without warning, she puckered her lips and leaned just an inch closer, but it was enough. No time to brace yourself, Avery\u2019s plush lips made contact with your body, your miniscule frame utterly dwarfed by their magnitude. Though the kiss only lasted a second, it enveloped your entire being in a warm and stimulating embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour affectionate new roommate pulled back with a satisfied smile on her face. You had to take a deep breath after the kiss, both to get your lungs refilled and to calm yourself down. You really didn\u2019t want Avery to take note of what was going on in your pants right now, lest her endless teasing and flirting never cease. You also wiped away a trail of moist saliva left behind on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuirking her mouth to the side, Avery\u2019s blush lit up again. \u201cYa know, I might be falling in love, Hunter. You\u2019re totes my new bestie, that\u2019s for sure!\u201d The giantess giggled, and her harmonious voice filled you with an overwhelming sensation of happiness. It was like her own love and joy was washing over into you. It became harder and harder to want to resist her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you were snapped back to reality a second later, as Avery squeezed her palm tightly around your body, mashing you into a flat blob. It happened so quickly you didn\u2019t even process what had happened to you until the deed was done. One moment you were being held, teased, and kissed by your new gorgeous (if not airheaded) roommate, the next you were putty in her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at Avery in terror, your blood ran cold at the almost casual expression on her face, as if she didn\u2019t care what she had done to you. For a horrible moment, you thought Avery\u2019s nice and cute attitude was all an act, and her true colors were shining forth, but then you remembered that you\u2019d agreed to help with her favor. The favor she\u2019d requested right after asking you about your squish and stretchy nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to mentally scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlissfully unaware to your mute pleas, Avery began to methodically mold and squish your body, kneading you with her fingers. \u201cSo, basically, I gotta use your squishy and stretchiness, lil\u2019 guy! Ya know how I talked about my missing clothes? Some of those are super-duper important over the next few days, like, uber important. I totes can\u2019t buy new clothes this suddenly\u2026but I can absolutely ask my adorable new roommate to replace them! How awesome is that?\u201d Avery giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe full weight of her favor dawned on you, and you fought with every fiber of your being to break free from Avery\u2019s grip, or at least get your frustration with her across. She was planning on molding you into clothing, and then wear you! She hadn\u2019t even hinted at this being her end goal from the start, and you felt lied to and cheated. You never would\u2019ve agreed to this otherwise. Sadly, Avery was much to thorough with squashing your malleable body, and your attempts to squirm were useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been molded into clothing only twice before in your life, and both times had been incredibly humiliating and painful experiences. Your younger sister, Tracy, had once gotten angry at you as a kid, and had squished you into a hairband. This was before she\u2019d matured in her attitude, and became the loving sister you cherished so dearly. She was a little demon for a few years in elementary school, and this was during that time. She wore you to keep her hair in a ponytail for a week before your mother caught wind and freed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second time was at the hands of your mother, and was three times as bad. After being laid off from her job, she\u2019d come home at midnight from a night of drinking, and stumbled into your room mumbling about needing a new skirt. Drunk out of her mind, and giggling incessantly, your mother had grabbed you and stretched you to your limits, molding you into a simple but cute skirt, despite your protesting screams. Worse still, after collapsing into bed, your mom awoke the next morning with a raging hangover and no memories of the previous night. She\u2019d merely spotted her \"<i>new skirt</i>\", slipped it on, and went about her day. She wore you five times over a two-week period before finally realizing what she had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in no hurry to repeat these past traumas, but Avery was obviously oblivious to that as she kept working your body. Eventually, she hooked her perfectly manicured fingernails into your chest, and with a small flick of her wrist, tore your clothes right off. You were now fully naked in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery, for the only time since you\u2019d met her, demonstrated surprisingly reasonable (if no less frustrating) logic when speaking up. \u201cSo, your totes naked now. If you\u2019re, like, wondering why, it\u2019s \u2018cuz clothes would give you away to anyone looking at you! I mean, I asked you to be MY clothes, so you don\u2019t need your own! Duh!\u201d She finished with another giggle before clapping her hands together, making your body a perfectly flat shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wished you could convey to her how she had never once specifically asked you to be clothes for her, but it was far too late for that. Unless Morgan or Quinn walked in right now, saw what was going on, and stopped Avery, your fate was entirely in her gorgeous, scatterbrained hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s the plan, Hunter. I have a few options for you, so that\u2019s fun! One: I totes need a new thong, and I have a feeling you\u2019ll be an uber soft and comfy replacement for my old one. Two: I\u2019ve been wanting a new skirt. One that shows off my pretty legs and kinda like flows a bit, ya know?\u201d She said all this while stroking your body. As soon as you heard the word \u2018<i>skirt</i>\u2019, your blood ran cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd then third: I need a sock. And, you\u2019re probs like, what? A single sock? Yeah\u2026I totes ruined my other cute one by ripping it one a loose nail in my old house. Now I just have one little sock. Hee hee! I\u2019m such a klutz!\u201d Avery laughed, then lifted her foot above you and wriggled her toes. Her dainty, smooth foot smelled heavenly, but you had a horrible feeling it wouldn\u2019t be that way for extended periods of time. \u201cSo, yeah! Those are the options!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the ditz she had proven to be, the pink-haired giantess waited a minute, presumably for you to pick your option. It was only after your total inability to talk registered with the girl that she slapped her head and smiled sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you can\u2019t talk, huh? That\u2019s funny! Guess I\u2019ll pick for you!\u201d Avery wistfully tilted her head back and forth in an exaggerated show of thinking. You could only keep trembling with fear in her hand, your fate left fully to her. This favor had spiraled way out of control. Avery spoke up again. \u201cAnd, don\u2019t worry, lil\u2019 cutie. This\u2019ll only be for a few days, maybe a week at most. Then I can go shopping again. Also, this\u2019ll be the last time I talk to you until the favor is done! Can\u2019t be chattin\u2019 up my clothes, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flirty, horribly tone-deaf wink, and a last wave of horror hitting you, Avery reached a decision.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I think I'll make you into a thong. I figure that one should be the most fun for you.\" Avery said, giving you an exaggerated wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed internally at what you had just heard. You wanted to scream out loud, but Avery's squeezing hands had smushed your mouth away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's try this out...\" Avery's fingers jumped into action, gripping and tugging on your squishy form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a tiny person, you'd been stretched countless times, but it never got any easier. Your body desperately wanted to snap back into its natural form, but Avery's fingers easily overpowered your natural elasticity. It was hard to identify individual body parts at this point, but you felt your \"arms\" tugged in either direction, stretched wide like you were going to be hugging someone. Avery tied them together at the ends, ensuring the only thing you'd be hugging was her hips. Your legs came next, dragged down and then up to the arm knot, where they were tied as well. From there, the shape was mostly right, and Avery just went about final adjustments, ensuring you were the right size and smoothing out any bumps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tada!\" Avery said, presenting your now thongified form to the mirror. As your disorientation from being molded cleared, you got a good look at your new form. You were nearly completely indistinguishable from a real thong. The only giveaway was that your eyes were faintly visible in the spot where what was left of your face had ended up. Your panic only increased when you realized that that spot was right in the middle of the back of the thong, ensuring your face would be buried between her butt cheeks. This fact wasn't lost on Avery either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you're going to have a lot of booty in your future. Lucky you.\" Avery said with a giggle, bringing you down towards her feet. She couldn't wait any longer to put you on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringed as Avery's giant foot swung over you, reflexively terrified by the sight of giant soles after a life as a tiny man. But when her feet slipped through your holes, your priorities shifted to a much more pressing threat: Avery's gigantic ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get a good look Hunter. This booty is your responsibility now. I hope you can handle it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made one last attempt to scream, but your mouth was still squished. There was no way for you to communicate with Avery as she pulled you upwards, rushing you towards her looming butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe collision with her cheeks forced your body even thinner to squeeze in between them. The smooth butt flesh rubbed against your face as you were dragged deeper into the abyss of her crack. When she stopped pulling you up, you were in complete darkness. There was nothing butt walls of butt cheek in every direction as they molded around your new thong form. Meanwhile, you could feel a light tickle on your legs as she adjusted the front of the thong, dragging them against the short field of hair up front. Your only consolation was that she hadn't pulled you up any further. The last thing you needed was to be pushed up against your new roommate's asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooo, I was right, you make a super comfy thong Hunter.\" Avery said, completely unaware of how unpleasant this was for you. She looked at her ass in her mirror, eyes tracing along the thong as it disappeared between her butt cheeks. \"Cute too. Too bad no one will be able to see you under my clothes. Maybe when we get a beach day in I'll make you into a bikini bottom and show you off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was bad. Avery was already falling in love with your new thong form. Would she even turn you back? You'd decided she was a nice girl when you'd met her, but in truth you barely knew her. For all you knew, she could decide she'd rather have a pair of living underwear than a tiny roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink haired girl continued to prattle on: \"And I definitely can't tell Quinn and Morgan about this. If they knew how comfortable you were they'd probably want to wear you too, and then you'd never get a break. Plus, their butts aren't as cute as mine.\" Avery decided to emphasize this point by smacking her ass, causing her cheeks to collide as they reverberated from the impact. Your mouth had reformed enough to scream at this point, but there was nowhere for your screams to go. They just echoed around between Avery's butt cheeks, trapped in the abyss with you. \"Anyway, I'm sure this week before my new clothes arrive is going to fly by for both of us. And I can already tell you that even after my new thongs arrive, I'd be happy to wear you again if you get nostalgic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were relieved at least to hear that Avery still planned to turn you back at the end of the week. But the fact that she thought you might just want to be her thong again for fun showed that she had no idea what you were going through in her butt, which did not bode well for the upcoming week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to stop talking to you now Hunter, it's time for me to....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Go out dancing! (Avery is going out dancing with Morgan, maybe they convince Quinn to come as well)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Go to my exercise class with Morgan! (Spin class or Barre class, I don't want to do yoga since that comes up in Morgan's gym route)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Writer's Choice<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cIt\u2019s time for me to go out dancing!\u201d Avery proudly declared. \u201cMorgan and I have been dying to visit that new night club that opened up a few weeks back.\u201d The pink-haired giantess paused for a moment, then gasped. \u201cOMG! I can ask Quinn to come too! That\u2019d be totes awesome! The three of us\u2026and you, Hunter.\u201d Avery giggled, stroking your taut limbs hugging her hips. \u201cFor real though, last time talking to you, Hunter. See you in a week\u2026or so!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to her word this time, Avery immediately stopped mentioning you, and went about digging out an appropriately sexy outfit from her closet and drawers to wear to the night club. Her slightest shifts in movement caused you immeasurable discomfort, but it was slowly dawning on you that, unless a miracle saved you, your week of suffering with Avery was only going to get significantly worse from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ditzy girl eventually settled on a risqu\u00e9 pink miniskirt and matching halter top that showed off most of her lean stomach. She took another minute to touch up her make-up before dashing out of her room, practically skipping downstairs. You mentally groaned as her thick ass cheeks chewed up your malleable body, each step causing her booty to jiggle and squeeze into your elongated form. This was hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrolling into the living room, Avery found Morgan and Quinn, and she struck a dramatic pose and winked. \u201cWho's gonna hit up the club with me? Huh?\u201d She asked, excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked her twin in the eye for a second before sighing. \u201cOh, I totally forgot about that. You really want to do that tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery nodded happily. \u201cUh huh. It\u2019ll be kinda like a celebration for moving in. It\u2019ll totes be fun, too! Hee hee!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan rolled her eyes, but stood up from the couch and stretched. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll go. IF ONLY to stay sober and drive your sorry butt home when you get plastered. You drink way too much when we got out to clubs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery gave her sister a mischievous smirk, and didn\u2019t dispute her statement. She merely turned to Quinn and winked. \u201cI\u2019d love for you to come with, Quinn. Have some fun dancing and drinking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the mild surprise of the twins, Quinn nodded and also stood. \u201cSure, whatever. Sounds nice, I guess.\u201d She said, and with that being her only explanation, she walked away and up to her room. Morgan followed, and the two girls took about fifteen minutes to get ready. Avery passed the time by looking at her phone and pacing, her constant movement grinding her thick butt cheeks mercilessly against your body. You begged for her to stop, but your silent mental pleas obviously didn\u2019t reach her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan and Quinn returned, dressed for a night out. Morgan had changed into a simple but attractive red dress, and seemed to be slightly anxious about wearing one, as it wasn\u2019t too typical of her. On the subject of typical, Quinn had slipped into a black blouse and black skinny jeans. The simplicity of the outfit really fit her, as did the literal FIT of the clothes. Even Avery was ever-so-slightly taken aback by how snuggly Quinn\u2019s jeans hugged her shapely rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA possible flirtatious remark died on Avery\u2019s lips when Morgan cut her off. \u201cHunter is with you, right?\u201d She inquired, while beginning to walk outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery paled, but recovered quickly. \u201cUh\u2026no. No. He\u2019s upstairs. Didn\u2019t think a night club would be too safe, and he was really tired. Looked super cute all snuggled up on my bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan, approaching her car and not looking back at her twin, shrugged. \u201cAw, that\u2019s a shame. Oh well. Don\u2019t forget him when we get back.\u201d Just like that, Morgan dropped the issue. Had she seen the overtly conspicuous look on Avery\u2019s face, she\u2019d be more concerned, but she hadn\u2019t. As such, she had no reason to not trust her sister\u2019s words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn gave Avery a look with a raised eyebrow, but said nothing. The three roommates piled into Morgan\u2019s car and were off to the night club. You hadn\u2019t heard a word of any conversation while trapped deep in Avery\u2019s sweltering ass, as most sounds were muffled. However, it didn\u2019t take a genius to guess your surroundings as Avery plopped into the passenger\u2019s seat, her bubble butt compressing as she wiggled to get comfortable. Any spare space you had was gone in an instant, your entire being enveloped in slick ass flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride was not more than fifteen minutes, but it practically felt like an eternity to you. The faintest bump in the road caused crazy vibrations in Avery\u2019s doughy buttocks, which of course reverberated right back onto you. Not only was the tightness of your confines painful, the strain on your tiny limbs hugging Avery\u2019s wide hips tiring, and the ever-growing sweat and stench overwhelming, but this entire scenario was humiliating beyond belief. You were furious at Avery for using you like her own personal object, while at the same time acknowledging that she really was just an airheaded girl who didn\u2019t know how horribly she was truly treating you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the night club, the three girls hurried inside, and found the club to be packed to the brim with inebriated partiers and over-worked security guards. Avery, utilizing her rather lucrative salary as a model, purchased tickets with ease, and your giantess roommates eventually wormed their way through the crowd and found an empty booth to sit at and take stock of their bearings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was dark in the club, and the music was blaring loud and the lights were pulsing constantly. Even inside of Avery\u2019s butt, you could still hear the pounding of the dance music bass. Admittedly though, it was hard to focus on the music, as the more pressing issue was the heat. Inside the packed night club, the temperature had risen substantially, and this was reflected by copious amounts of sweat beginning to roll off Avery\u2019s buttocks and soaked your body. An unpleasant stench also built in intensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeedless to all of this, Avery waved to her sister and new friend, and then skipped off on her own, eventually finding her way to the bar. Throwing down some cash granted Avery a succulent alcoholic beverage which she drained in seconds, followed instantly by a refill. Avery was as lightweight as they came, and already feeling the effects of her sobriety flying out the window, Avery giggled and stumbled onto the dance floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy chance, the club had just begun to blare one of Avery\u2019s favorite songs. A dopey grin spreading on her beautiful face, Avery let loose an excited squeal that rang as a chorus with all of the other partiers. She then began to unleash herself on the dance floor, joining the rest of the club\u2019s patrons in jumping around, spinning in circles, and twerking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Avery rocketed into motion, your night became twice as horrible. The miniskirt she was wearing was sexy as hell, but hardly tight on the same level as Quinn\u2019s jeans. Because of this, Avery\u2019s might derriere swung side-to-side with her movements, jiggling and swaying like she did. Her butt cheeks clapped and slammed together in time with the music, crunching up your thong-shaped body and mashing you painfully, over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Avery\u2019s miniskirt had ridden up a bit, leaving a fair bit of her gorgeously eye-catching booty out for all to see (and it did draw quite a few eyes). Still, Avery was too far gone to care, and she merely laughed gleefully as she continued dancing. With each movement, your body was drawn up more and more into the embrace of her buttcheeks, sweat, stench, and darkness becoming your entire world. Your visual human features were also beginning to fade due to the constant smearing and smashing of your battered, bruised form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour, Avery stumbled in a haze back to the bar and chugged another alcoholic drink. She felt as light as a feather, and happier than she\u2019d been in weeks. Dreamily, she sighed, wishing that her adorable new roommate had come along to the club instead of staying at the apartment (because yes, of course airheaded, scatterbrained Avery had already forgotten what she\u2019d done to you because of her inebriation, believing her own made-up excuse for you instead of remembering the truth).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Avery figured she could just find someone else to flirt with, or else dance until she dropped from exhaustion. Requesting a fourth drink, Avery absentmindedly scratched at her butt, and hiked her thong up just a bit more. It was slick with seat, but still comfy and supportive. Of course, Avery had no clue in the world that adjusting her underwear so casually only truly succeeded in mashing your face up into her asshole, wedging you in the darkest, deepest part of her booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing her drink, Avery grinned lazily. This was such a great night!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Avery tilted her glass upside down as she took down the drink in one go. Savoring the sweet flavor of the cocktail, she took an extra beat before lowering the glass from her face. When she did she saw the familiar faces of Morgan and Quinn!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeyyy guys! This place is awesome, right!?\u201d Avery exclaimed, throwing an arm around the neck of both her sister and her new friend. \u201cI love the music and lights, it\u2019s sooooo much fun in here! I wish Hunter could be with us though it would be so cute to dance with the little guy! But a place like this probably wouldn\u2019t be safe for him.\u201d Avery drunkenly lamented not having you with her, having completely forgotten that you were practically vacuumed between her ass cheeks at that very moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan grimaced upon hearing Avery speak. She could tell that her sister wasn\u2019t quite trashed enough to be slurring her speech, but clearly Avery was fairly intoxicated based on how loudly she was talking and how much she was leaning on both Quinn and herself. Knowing that a lecture about trying to remain somewhat sober was futile at this point, Morgan simply chuckled at her sister\u2019s chaotic nature before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAvery, we\u2019ve been trying to find you to tell you that Hunter could have come with us! This is a mixed club designed specially for both tinies and regular sized girls!\u201d Morgan said and Avery opened her mouth wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhhh shit, really!? I haven\u2019t been paying any attention!\u201d Avery said while lifting her left pump and turning her foot so she could see the sole. Avery was a carefree girl without a doubt, but she still felt remorse as she expected to see the squished bodies of a number of tiny guys underneath her shoe. To her surprise she didn\u2019t see a single one! And as she shifted her weight, now leaning onto Quinn to check the sole of her other shoe, Morgan spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you airhead, they aren\u2019t just walking around on the ground. In what world would they just force the little dudes to dance around the feet of clueless drunk girls like you, huh?\u201d Morgan poked fun at her twin. \u201cThey have elevated dance floors that sit a few feet off of the ground and these cool tubes that the guys can walk through to get in between them! They\u2019re kind of like hamster tubes\u2026 not that I\u2019m saying men are like pets or anything! That\u2019s just what the tubes reminded me of\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery took no notice of her sister putting her foot in her mouth at the end, being far too enthralled by the stuff she said before. She finally unlatched her arms from Quinn and Morgan, standing up on her own two feet before scanning the room. She looked closer at what she previously thought were little waist height bar tables, and saw tons of guys dancing on them! Thinking back for a second she definitely remembered dropping off an empty glass of hers on one of those \u201ctables\u201d earlier and hoped that not too many guys were hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you ask me I think jumping through all these hoops for tiny guys is kind of lame.\u201d Quinn piped up, slightly more emphatically than she normally talked. Both Morgan and Avery turned to look at the typically apathetic girl as she actually seemed to take a stand on something. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough world for guys nowadays, and don\u2019t get me wrong I wouldn\u2019t wish for anything bad to happen to them, but if they get used to getting special treatment like this\u201d she said while gesturing towards the elevated dance floors, \u201cthen they might not be tough enough to stay safe when have to actually fend for themselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked understandingly at her new roommate. Quinn seemed standoffish at first glance, but she could tell that behind that exterior was a caring person at the end of the day. Even if her direct interactions with tiny guys seemed a bit cold and unhelpful at times, they seemed to come from a good place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery on the other hand, had completely zoned out half way through Quinn\u2019s dialogue. Her eyes were locked firmly on the closest table of guys, sparkling with anticipation about the fun she could have with them. If she was flirtatious when she was sober, she basically turned into a wrecking ball of flaunted sexuality when she was drunk. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go take a closer look!\u201d She exclaimed before skipping off in the direction of the guys. Avery bumped into a number of girls on her way, hardly realizing how clumsily she was moving. Luckily for her nobody took issue with her jostled movements, assuming (correctly) that she was too drunk to know any better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour reality, meanwhile, was pretty much the same as it had been since the moment that Avery slid your incredibly stretched out body between her jiggly cheeks. The only unfortunate way you could tell the passage of time was by the ever increasing amount of sweat cascading down her crack and being easily soaked up by you. You could only hear the thumping bass line of the night club\u2019s music, or more specifically feel it as it reverberated through Avery\u2019s soft flesh around you. At this point you wished that you could just detach your arms from your legs and come apart just to escape this situation, but the strong knots that connected your limbs as well as the pressure of her cheeks being smashed together by her tight skirt prevented any sort of agency on your part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven considering this possibility made you feel a twinge of guilt, however, knowing that you would feel bad leaving Avery commando when she specifically needed underwear. Catching yourself thinking this, you mentally slapped yourself back to reality. By no means did you want to act as her underwear, but your naturally empathetic and caring nature quite often led you to being forced into situations such as these. Sometimes you wished you could just put your foot down and stand up for yourself, but as a single step taken by Avery mashed your entire body between her cheeks, you reconsidered acting so bold when you had so little power due to your stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to you, that step that Avery took was the first step in a beeline straight towards the nearest elevated platform for tiny guys. She walked away from Quinn and Morgan without a word, leaving Morgan rolling her eyes at how airheaded her twin could be. Morgan was torn between looking after her clearly hammered sister and hanging out with her new friend, ultimately deciding to stay with Quinn and watch over Avery from afar. Unfortunately, leaving this ditzy bombshell unsupervised was quite the risky choice, as after a moment Avery reached the platform of guys and bent over to get a closer look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeyyyy guys, you\u2019ve got quite a nice view from down there huh?\u201d Avery said flirtatiously. \u201cYou guys won\u2019t mind if I dance around you, right?\u201d she concluded before standing back up to her full height. The height of the table left the \u201cdance floor\u201d sitting right below the cheeks of Avery\u2019s moderately tall 5\u20198\u201d frame. As she turned around there wasn\u2019t a single guy who could take his eyes off of the large beauty. Half of them out of attraction to the bubbly goddess, and half out of pure fear upon seeing her round buttocks, having slowly but surely been sliding out of the bottom of her too-small pink miniskirt over the course of the night. She backed up a step more, the backs of her thick thighs now touching the edge of the platform as her bubble butt blocked out half of the light from the ceiling. Without realizing it, even the slightest amount of weight that Avery\u2019s drunken body was putting on the platform had crushed the makeshift railing that ran along the edge, and sent a few guys jumping towards the center for safety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn on the other hand was slowly sipping her drink while observing the rest of the night club. She didn\u2019t outwardly show it, but she honestly was having fun. As she scanned the club, she slowly took a few steps to the side and found what she assumed to be a railing to rest on behind her. Lifting her butt slightly she leaned most of her weight onto the it, she relaxed and continued to sip her drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderneath the comically curvaceous girl, tiny guys were running to each end in absolute fear as their passage tube threatened to collapse at any moment. Two planet sized ass cheeks clad in skin tight black denim caved the top half of the tube inward, threatening to shatter the entire structure without anyone (normal-sized, that is) even noticing a thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan, unfortunately, noticed both conundrums at the same time. First seeing her twin sister clumsily shaking her ass above a mob of tiny at-risk guys sent her into crisis aversion mode. But as she looked back towards Quinn to ask for help in dealing with Avery, she noticed as well the bent passageway that Quinn\u2019s massive ass was threatening to utterly demolish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor you, you were once more cast into a jiggly hell. Avery\u2019s sloppy dance moves were shaking her ass more and more, causing her skirt to ride up until essentially her entire bare butt was visible for all to see. The guys beneath her demonstrated a combined feeling of attraction and utter terror, something you were quite familiar with, knowing that one clumsy movement could lead to the crushing of dozens of them. Meanwhile, those near Quinn were in equally dire circumstances. Some tried to funnel into the tube off of the platform, but they could see the titanic body of Quinn causing their only escape path to crumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one and only silver lining to this hellish situation was that with Avery\u2019s whole ass on display for the world, people could clearly see the minuscule tan thong that was struggling to contain the woman\u2019s fantastic curves. Since the approval of Baker\u2019s law and increased usage of guys like you as articles of clothing, tiny men often felt a brotherly obligation to pay attention to the clothing that regular sized women were wearing just in case someone was being used against their will. More often than not the other tiny dude couldn\u2019t do a thing about it, but at the very least they could alert someone with more authority to do so. You could only pray that this would happen to you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Morgan and I signed up for a spin class today, so it looks like you're coming with us!\" Avery announced. She was thrilled that she had such a comfy pair of panties for what would no doubt be a butt focused workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMMMMPHHHHH! MMMMHHH!\" You tried to cry out as you heard Avery's suggestion, but your mouth was too squished to form words. Though it's not like anyone would be able to hear you from here anyway. Your tiny lungs couldn't create a sound loud enough to escape the black hole of Avery's gigantic rump. Unless Morgan or Quinn stopped her, it sounded like you were about to be a pair of workout panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of your mounting unhappiness, Avery pulled out a pair of black Lululemon leggings and stepped into them. All of Avery's clothes were either right or revealing, unfortunately for you exercise necessitated she go with tight. The leggings slid up her legs without too much difficulty, but the shelf of her ass proved a bit of a barrier. She had to hop up and down a few times to pull the leggings up over her butt. Every time she did, you were smacked in the face by the clap of her bouncing cheeks. Finally, she managed to pull them up, sealing you in her ass with the tight black fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so lucky that we met you today, otherwise I'd have to wear some regular panties and I'd totally have panty lines. But I can't see your outline at all!\" Avery continued, inspecting her butt in the mirror. And it was no wonder that she couldn't see you, you were completely buried between her ass cheeks. \"Anyway, I'm gonna finish getting ready. I'll have to stop talking to you until I take you off later. Thanks again for volunteering to be my thong! Oh, and try not to ride up too much. The exercise bike always gives me a wedgie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou panicked in the darkness of her butt at her latest revelation, wondering what it was going to be like to experience a wedgie from the underwear's perspective. What did she expect you to do? No matter how much you wished you could, you couldn't prevent yourself from doing anything. For all intents and purposes, you might as well have been a regular thing, albeit an extremely comfy one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Avery pulled on a tank top and slipped into her sneakers, finishing her workout outfit. Barely even thinking about something as inconsequential as her panties, she headed downstairs to meet Morgan. You were battered by her butt cheeks as ran down the stairs, butt bouncing along behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to go?\" Morgan asked. She was already standing by the front door. Not having to make herself a new thong had saved her some time getting ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" Avery replied enthusiastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Hunter? Did you make him comfy in your room?\" Morgan asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery laughed. \"Oh he's super comfy, don't worry about that.\" At least, he was comfortable for her as a thong. She didn't know what it felt like to be squeezed between her ass cheeks, but considering how sexy her ass was, she imagined Hunter was doing ok back there. He wouldn't have volunteered to help her out if he couldn't handle her booty, right? She walked out to the car chatting with Morgan, and once again Hunter slipped from her mind. He really felt just like panties, which were something she didn't think about as she went about her day. Only when she sat down in the car did she remember him again. When her ass hit the seat, she felt her thong ride up a bit. She sighed. She'd hoped that with Hunter serving as her panties, she wouldn't have to worry about that. Then again, it was his first day on the job. He was probably just still learning how to do his job right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, all Hunter was learning was how much petite little Avery actually weighed when she sat down. Her butt cheeks flattened under the weight of her body, squeezing him upward and inwards, forcing him deeper into her crack. His arms strained as they stretched tighter around her hips, still squeezing her in a forced hug. His struggle went unnoticed though. Above, he could hear the inane conversations between the sisters, unaware of the torment he was experiencing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived at the gym, Avery practically skipped into the locker room, loving the comfort she was getting from her roommate turned panties. The difference between him and regular fabric was night and day, and she knew it would be a big improvement when she got on a bike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since when are you excited for a spin class?\" Morgan asked, confused by her sister's pep. Avery wasn't someone who liked to sweat, and would have stuck to yoga if that was enough to keep her body in modeling shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery turned to her sister and smiled before replying:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. \"Well, I have Hunter helping me out today. He makes a super comfy thong.\" (Avery mentions you without even thinking about it)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. \"I just have a lot of energy today!\" (Avery keeps your presence a secret)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.

Doesn\u2019t bother me, Hunter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave her a somewhat surprised thumbs up, and inquired. \u201cThen how about you and I hang out the rest of the day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, whatever you want.\u201d Quinn replied, placing her palm on the coffee table and motioning for you to climb on. \u201cNormally I\u2019d tell you to carry yourself, but this\u2019ll be quicker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you contemplated Quinn\u2019s still slightly puzzling way of treating you and climbed onto her outstretched hand, you caught sight of Avery\u2019s briefly sullen expression, as well as a subdued frown on Morgan\u2019s face. No doubt Avery had been wanting to spend all day with you, and Morgan was still a bit apprehensive of Quinn\u2019s treatment of you. Still, a moment later, and Avery cheered back up as she began to engage her twin sister in conversation, discussing trips to the beach and the mall that everyone could go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft alone (more-or-less) with Quinn, the black-haired girl stared at you inquisitively. \u201cSo, what specifically did you want to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed your chin. \u201cWell, how about we hang out in your room? You finished decorating it, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026yeah, sure.\u201d Quinn answered, surprisingly seeming to wince a bit at your question. Still, she stood up and walked at a steady pace out of the room and upstairs. You nearly jostled off of her palm, and had to grip her thumb to keep steady. However, as soon as you balanced yourself out, you found the short trip quite enjoyable. It made you wonder if Quinn knew she was walking at exactly the right speed to keep you safe, after briefly forcing you to steady yourself. It wasn\u2019t long before the two of you reached her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn's room was not at all like you expected, and it really caught you off guard. You anticipated the fact that everything would be mostly colored in black, gray, and purple colors, but what you didn't expect was for it to be so messy. She had plain style bed, dressers, and closet, but the floor of her room was covered with clothes strewn all about. Barely a trace of the carpet could be seen with how cluttered the room was. You'd be hard pressed to believe she had only just moved in hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting you down on the corner of her bed, Quinn put her hands on her hips. \"Yeah, it's a mess, I know. I have a hard time...feeling like I need to tidy up. Still, it's comfy, I guess.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026it probably makes me come off as uncaring. It just doesn\u2019t bother me, usually. I mean, I know where everything is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced around her room, taking in the sight of everything looking so messy. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a unique style.\u201d You admitted with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat\u2019s that mean? You DO think I\u2019m lazy, don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held up your hands, defensively. \u201cNo, no! I didn\u2019t say that! Who am I to judge what your room looks like? My own room fits entirely in a single duffel bag.\u201d You smiled, sheepishly. \u201cI think it\u2019s just fine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn paused for a second, then granted you the smallest sliver of a smile. \u201c\u2026thanks.\u201d After that, she turned behind her to pull over a spare chair to sit on. Though you tried to fight it, your eyes were drawn inexorably right to her prodigious backside as she presented it to you. Her ass was unfathomably huge, larger than almost any you\u2019d seen before (granted, your exposure to females was limited mostly to close family). The way were perfectly sculpted derriere pulled tight against her leggings was worthy of worship, even if that same booty had demolished you pretty thoroughly all afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished grabbing her chair, Quinn sank down into it, then looked at you thoughtfully. \u201cYou know, you remind me so much of Caleb.\u201d She mused, softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou titled your head in confusion. \u201cCaleb? Who\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne of my best friends growing up. He was a tiny, just like you. We were inseparable.\u201d She had a distant expression on her face. \u201cIt was crazy how much he looked out for me. Really dependable guy, considering he had to struggle with\u2026everything you tinies go through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you say \u2018were\u2019? What happened?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn blinked in surprise. \u201cO-oh, nothing. He just moved away with his family five years ago.\u201d She paused. \u201cThat was the last time I ever saw him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned, sympathetically. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that.\u201d You said, earning yourself another barely perceptible smile from the black-haired giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, you felt that perhaps you were understanding Quinn just a little bit better. If you reminded her so much of her old tiny friend, you had to wonder if Quinn\u2019s way of treating you came from years of close friendship with tinies. Perhaps she was trying to toughen you up, make you stronger and more dependable by treating you a bit indifferently earlier. Some form of \u2018tough love\u2019?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, there was a lull in the conversation, and you found Quinn looking at you almost expectantly. Realizing that she was waiting for you to suggest something to do, you quickly wracked your brain for any ideas.</span></div></div>",

Hope you don't mind. </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You could not think of something to continue the conversation to save your life. You just couldn't keep your eyes off Quinn. \"Sigh. I was actually enjoying that conversation, but it's clear you have something else on your mind now. Makes no difference to me.\u201d Quinn said, falling back on to her bed. \" I'm gonna take a nap\", she turned to look you straight in the eyes,  \"DON'T wake me up, and DON'T go perving about, got it <b>Roomie</b>?\" You gulp audibly and nod your head vigorously to get the point across. You're still sore over that little accident earlier, you'd hate her to have a reason to make your new life here difficult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now you just felt bad. She was just starting to open up a little, and of course you somehow managed to mess it up. By some form of word association, your attention turned to the rest of the room. There was hardly a square inch of space not covered with some article of clothing or other personal belonging. Then a thought hit you, organize the room to apologize and show good will. Your sister used to be a similar situation. Just like Quinn she wasn't lazy, just didn't mind the mess and didn't have a set system. If you could help your sister, you could surely handle this. Just don't touch any unmentionables. Easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For nearly 3 hours you were at it, dragging items back and forth across the room.  You could honestly say you had never worked so hard in your life or that you had really outdone yourself considering how much stuff you moved around, across carpet no less. Now three boxes, ones you tilted on their sides and pulled the now folded clothes into, sat practically full, while things like magazines were stacked against the wall. Surprisingly, Quinn stayed asleep the whole time. All that was left was the closet. You shimmied through the half open door and wonder in. There are a few posters that apparently were never put up, few books, a face down red lifeguard swimsuit that had the writing, \"Sanderson Beach\" which had to have been from a few years ago given it's a bit on the smaller side. You noticed something poking out from under the swimsuit. It was long, thin, about as wide as you, and a deep shade of purple. You pull it out with enough force that when it comes undone, you're flung against the door. You open your eyes and go beet red. It's an amethyst thong.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get out of here!\" You thought aloud, but a moment too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you doing with those, PERV?!\" Quinn shouted. Uh oh. She was awake.</span></div></div>",

As she lifted you up past each part of her monolithic form you couldn\u2019t help but admire how hot she was. You chastised yourself, her thinking you were a perv was exactly why she was so angry with you, proving her right would not help you in the slightest. <br>\r\nAs you were brought up to her eye level you could see that her expression had changed from her usual apathy to cold rage.<br>\r\n\u201cCare to explain yourself Hunter,\u201d her eyes narrowed.<br>\r\n\u201cI-I was just cleaning up a bit in here, trying to be helpful,\u201d the words you stammered out in fear of your giant roommate were the truth , although the way you said them was not convincing in the slightest if the lack of change in Quinn\u2019s expression was anything to go by.<br>\r\n\u201cOh really, so of all the things in my room you could have thought to \u201chelp\u201d me by tidying up, you chose to go rooting around my underwear. Yeah sure Hunter, totally believe you,\u201d she seemed to be getting angrier as the conversation went on. \u201cYou know Hunter, you seemed like a pretty nice guy earlier, and I was starting to think we could be good friends, but now it just seems like you\u2019re a little perv and a liar, and I hate both of those things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to walk towards the door, roughly opening it. And tossing you outside of her room, the impact with the floor flattening you. <br>\r\n\u201cStay out of my way for the rest of the day, because if your pervy ass gets in my way and I step on you I won\u2019t just not acknowledge you, I\u2019ll actively make your life hell,\u201d and with that she slammed the door closed. You figured you would need to figure out a way of making up with Quinn, but it was probably better to leave it a day or so. Best to just focus on reforming for now.<br>\r\nYou focused your efforts on reforming you quickly managed to make some progress, reforming your arms and torso within a few minutes. However as you were doing this you became aware of the thudding approach of footsteps.<br>\r\nYou looked up just in time to see Avery practically skipping along the hall towards you, not looking down at the floor as she was under the impression you were safe with Quinn. You couldn\u2019t even let out a scream, since your mouth hadn\u2019t reformed yet, as her foot steamrolled you without her even noticing you. Thankfully you didn\u2019t stick to her foot as it lifted off of you, you remained stuck to the floor. Not only was all of your work reforming undone, but you were crushed even worse than before. <br>\r\nYou once again focused your efforts on reforming, much slower than last time but there weren\u2019t any more interruptions until you were almost fully reformed, only your left leg remained flat. You saw a shadow cast over you and looked up to see...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) ... the sole of Avery\u2019s foot again, she still hasn\u2019t noticed you and you\u2019re not sure you\u2019ll get away from this one not stuck to the sole of her foot.<br>\r\n2) ... Quinn opening her door, looking directly at you. Has she calmed down since she threw you out or is she going to make good on her threat?<br>\r\n3) ... Morgan\u2019s concerned face looking down at you. Maybe she can help you make up with Quinn after you explain what happened. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When a shadow was cast over you, you panicked, thinking it was either an unaware Avery walking back down the hall to crush you again without noticing. Or even worse would have been Quinn after her threat. When you looked up and saw that it was Morgan and she was looking straight at you, a wave of relief washed over you.<br>\r\nAs you looked up into the face of Morgan, her brow furrowed in concern and her eyes displaying a compassion that you were glad to see in your current state. <br>\r\n\u201cHunter, what happened? Here let\u2019s get you off the floor and take you to my room.\u201d<br>\r\nMorgan picked at your one deformed leg, almost effortlessly peeling it off the floor, a feat that would have taken you a few minutes at least she managed in a few seconds, before picking you up and placing you in her palm.<br>\r\nAs Morgan carried you into her room, you saw it was very neat and orderly. Very much a contrast from Quinn\u2019s room. There was some exercise equipment in the corner, there was a lot of space in this room and you mentally noted to ask Morgan if you could room with her since there looked to be a lot of space for you in here. Morgan placed you down on her bed and gently sat down next to you, making sure to displace you as little as she could, you appreciated her care when she was dealing with you.<br>\r\n\u201cSo what happened Hunter? Last I saw you were going to Quinn\u2019s room with her to get to know each other better, how did you end up squished on the floor outside her room?\u201d Morgan looked at you, confused, but also kind of worried.<br>\r\n\u201c...Quinn might be a bit mad at me right now,\u201d you replied, sheepishly.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me what happened so we can see if this can be fixed, wouldn\u2019t want any bad blood between any of us on the first day,\u201d Morgan\u2019s reply was empathetic, but also curious. You proceeded to tell her the whole story. Including the accidental grabbing of Quinn\u2019s thong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Hunter if that\u2019s all that happened then it sounds like a simple misunderstanding to me,\u201d Morgan looked at you warmly, although there was a hint of scepticism in her eyes, maybe she didn\u2019t 100% believe you but she seemed on board. \u201cI\u2019ll take you to her room, maybe with me there we can get her to hear you out.\u201d<br>\r\nWith that Morgan picked you up carried you back down the hall before knocking on Quinn\u2019s door. After a few seconds the door swung open and Quinn was standing there, changed into a set of pyjamas that looked like they were supposed to be baggy, but on a woman much less endowed than she was. They were stretched tight across her hips and chest, they were baggy around the midsection and legs however so it was a very strange contrast. She seemed slightly confused to see Morgan at her door, but her face shifted to a cold expression when she looked down at her palm and saw you.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the pervert doing here,\u201d she said coldly, not even asking you directly. She was Directing the question to Morgan, not even sparing you a glance after her first look at you.<br>\r\n\u201cNow Quinn, Hunter just told me his side of this and it sounds like a misunderstanding to me, just please hear him out,\u201d Morgan pleaded with her.<br>\r\n\u201cHe already told me his little fiction, but if you want him to waste his time go on,\u201d Quinn shrugged her shoulders nonchalantly, seemingly being down with the subject but only really not closing the door on you because of Morgan. She looked down at you impatiently.<br>\r\n\u201cQuinn, every word I told you was true. I had cleaned up a load of other stuff before I got anywhere near your thong. The problem with how I delivered that information is that I was scared. You\u2019ve got to admit you can be pretty terrifying!\u201d<br>\r\nAs you finished explaining to Quinn, you looked up into her apathetic, neutral expression, hoping for even the slightest shift to show you what she was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Quinn takes on board what you said, and the two of you make up.<br>\r\n2) Quinn is still on the fence, so you offer to do something for her to help make it up to her.<br>\r\n3) She\u2019s still mad, and slams the door in your face.</span></div></div>",

In your life being a tiny, even though you couldn't be killed, you can easily say you have looked death in the eyes multiple times. Wether it was something like the time the neighbor's dog mistook you for her chew toy for an afternoon or like the time your mother gave you a bath in the sink and forgot to take you out before undoing the drain and you spent nearly three days in city pipes before you were rescued by an employee at the filtration plant. The point is that every thought you had of what Quinn might do to you dwarfed it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I seriously can't believe what I'm looking at. Are you serious right now? We met each other and then not even twenty-four hours later your touching my... my... UNDERWEAR! I told you NOT to go perving around and you can't even do that! Oh... If you thought I was a tough before, I plan on making your life <b>UNBEARABLE</b>! I bet you didn't move when I sat on you earlier because you enjoyed every last second of it and when I got up, you just wanted more, didn't you? You only wanted to get to know me to satisfy your own disgusting needs!\" Tears started forming in her eyes. \"I actually thought you and I could become pretty good friends, but now I see you're only interested in <b>literally</b> getting in girl's pants! In the end, you are exactly like Caleb, just a perving wolf in sheep's clothing that never cared about me as an actual person!\" She screamed, tears now streaming down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tilted your head down and clench your fist and murmur, \"you're wrong\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn stopped and put her hand to her ear. \"I'm sorry, did you say something, <b>little</b> guy? You'll have to speak up for me to hear you from all the way down there.\" She tried to say in a mocking tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swing your head up to look her in the eyes and screamed at the top of your lungs, \"I SAID THAT YOU'RE F***ING WRONG!!! You want to know who I am and see me stand up for myself, then listen to me HERE and NOW!\" <br>\r\nThis snaps her attention straight to you. She takes a deep breath and sits down on the ground to show you have her full attention then gestures you to speak with tears still in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's clear I don't know anywhere near as much about you or your past to fix this problem completely, so I'm just going to focus on what I do know. First off, I need to legitimately apologize to you for staring earlier. It was wrong and degrading considering you want to treat me as an equal despite my faults just for me not to treat you the same. I hope you can forgive me.\" You bow your head but rise back up to see her face had not changed in the slightest. You take this as a sign to continue.<br>\r\n \"Second is yes, yes I am perverted, not to a point of creepiness mind you, but yes I admit that I am a little... perverted.\" Both you and her stumble at this actually being addressed. You blush, but continue. \"I did enjoy what happened earlier for the wrong reasons and then chose to stare regardless of consequences. My entire life up til now was just been my mom and my sister, so I this is honestly the first time I have ever been in a room with no one I'm related to, so I'm still a bit new to these feelings. I felt so terrible for staring after you decided to open up to me a little, that I spent the time you were asleep to help organize your room to apologize.\" You gesture for her to see the room and she is dumbfounded.<br>\r\n \"I did everything but your unmentionables and the closet, which is why I'm in here. I didn't come in here to perv and I may not know the whole story and you may not believe me, but I do care about you even though I barely know you.\" You turned to the door to see Avery and Morgan quickly hide after being caught eavesdropping.<br>\r\n\"I just want you to know, you don't need to forgive me or even acknowledge me after this, just that I'm sorry for any pain and confusion I caused you.\" You pass her and walk out, passing the sisters who barreled into Quinn's room clearly to get the whole story. You walk down the hall, feeling like you want to curl up and cry as you hear Quinn in her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"He went and did all this.\"</span></span></div></div>",

Since then, you had been self-loathing underneath the couch in the main room. Avery and Morgan had spent most of their free time trying to coax you out. However, whether it was Morgan's offer of a delicious meal or Avery's sunny disposition, nothing moved you from your spot  They had given up on trying to snap Quinn out of the trance she had been in since the morning afterwards. She would wake up, get ready for work, leave without having breakfast at home, and return to her room the moment she came home. For you, it was disturbingly quiet, and you've turned to talking to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really screwed up this time, idiot. Nothing is available to move into for at least a month, and more importantly, you had the bearings to go through a beautiful girl's personal stuff, but you're not man enough to apologize. She treated you as an equal, and you make her cry. Wonderful.\" You sigh, laying your head down on a dust bunny you had been using as a makeshift pillow. \"She'd probably turn me into a rag doll after what happened.\" You fall asleep with the sensation that you're being watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You awaken after the best sleep you've had under the couch. That is until you realize you're no longer under the couch. The ground was soft, there was sun in your eyes, and there was the familiar feeling you were being watched again although it felt nowhere near as cold as before. You're back in Quinn's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"About time you decided to wake up.\" A voice called out from behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You tense up when you put a name to the voice as a shadow begins to block the sunlight entering through the window. Quinn appears out of your peripheral vision, propping herself up on her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Emotions and words begin tripping over each other and all that manages to escape your mouth is a very feeble \"Hello.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis evokes a small laugh from the black-haired giantess. \"Calm down, you're not in trouble dude. I was out having a drink and came home late. I realized you were hurting as much as me after our spat and wanted to make peace with you. I came over to the couch and found you asleep, alongside a giant spider set on making you it's midnight snack. Killed it and decided that I could keep an eye on you if you slept in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave her a heartfelt thanks as well as try and steer the conversation toward your apology. She realizes this and stops you. \"I'm the one who needs to apologize. It's just...when I found you in my closet, it brought back memories of a time I would have rather left to be forgotten.\" She sighed and sank back into the bed, causing you to lose your footing. She chucked at this and continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb was a guy that I could've easily called my best friend and my first love, at least on the outside. Well, to make a long and painful story short, I opened my heart to a schmuck and had it broken when the person I would have spent the rest of my life with was never there in the first place. He never cared about me, just my body. He decided to start taking candid photos of me around the house and stealing my underwear because I wasn't ready to go \"all the way\" with him. After I found him out, admittedly, I went ballistic and managed to brake his arm. His parents decided to move after that, and I never heard from him again.\" She finished, wiping tears from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned, hearing this painful story from someone who didn't deserve to be hurt. You walk up to her and place your hands on her arm. This surprised her slightly. \"I closed myself off and gained a bit of weight afterwards so something like that wouldn't happen again. But you're not like Caleb.\" She slowly moved the arm you were hugging towards her body and returned the hug, pushing you up against her right breast. \"I'm sorry Hunter, hope you and I can just hug it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You begin to blush, noticing she wasn't wearing a bra under her t-shirt, \"Sure Quinn, and thanks for trusting me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking around at the overwhelmingly messy room, part of you wanted to offer to help her clean it up a bit. But quickly you shook that idea off. First off, lugging just one of her socks to the empty clothes hamper in the corner of the room would take you no less than 15 minutes. If you could even do it successfully in the first place. And second, you didn\u2019t want to seem too judgmental of your new roommate\u2019s messy habits so quickly. After all, the clothes being strewn about hadn\u2019t been an issue for you\u2026 at least thus far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, with every mysterious word that left Quinn\u2019s mouth you felt yourself becoming more and more intrigued by her. Having your first few hours with the girl be spent with her knowingly compressing you into the second dimension underneath her ass caused you great fear initially. But your interactions with her since then have made it seem like even that action wasn\u2019t out of spite, malice, or even apathy towards you like you thought. It was almost like Quinn believed in your ability to handle yourself even more than you believed in it yourself! This combined with what she said about her old friend Caleb made you desperately want to get to know this girl on a deeper level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s good to hear you have some experience dealing with tiny guys, Quinn. Not gonna lie, my heart nearly stopped when I first figured out that I had chosen to live with three regular sized girls earlier, but from the looks of it none of you seem like the type to do anything too harsh to me!\u201d You nervously said up to Quinn. Part of you kicked yourself for being so forthright about your fears so quickly, but Quinn\u2019s light chuckle and smirk reassured you that it wasn\u2019t too much information too quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, see Hunter, you\u2019re partly right there,\u201d she responded before leaning down, showing you a generous amount of cleavage without even realizing it, \u201cbut I wouldn\u2019t get too cocky.\u201d You raised an eyebrow suspiciously as she continued, \u201cI\u2019m not going to be looking to do anything to you\u2026 but at the same time I\u2019m not going to be looking to not do anything to you either. Whether I notice you or not, if you find yourself between my foot and somewhere it\u2019s stepping, my butt and somewhere it\u2019s sitting, or anything else like that, you gotta be able to take care of yourself, got it!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of her speech, Quinn was looking directly into your eyes as you returned the gesture. Her tone indicated the usual deadpan sarcasm with which she typically spoke, but despite this you could clearly tell that she meant every one of her words from the bottom of her heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to lighten the mood slightly without seeming like you were just avoiding the topic, you retorted, \u201cOh don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve had more than my fair share of experiences with surviving situations like that! I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m pretty tough by now.\u201d You bluffed slightly. While the mere fact that you were alive and free to live a somewhat normal life at that exact moment meant that you hadn\u2019t had it as rough as some other tiny guys, you still knew deep down that your wellbeing was quite often out of your hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrowing up it was just me, my mom Helen, and my younger sister Tracy for as long as I can remember.\u201d You began to think back, Quinn relaxing a bit in her seat after her earlier words to you. You could tell from the get go that she at least cared enough about you to listen to you talk, a fact that you made sure to never take for granted when dealing with giant girls. \u201cMy mom was, and still is, in fact, one of the hardest working people I\u2019ve ever known. She took good care of us without a doubt, but she was practically always working. The number one rule we had to follow was to never interfere with her work. Any time that either my sister or I would, she wasn\u2019t afraid to get strict with us\u2026 to say the least. Beyond that, I lost track of how many times that she had to go away on business trips, leaving just Tracy and I to fend for ourselves sometimes, and other times calling on our Aunt Norah to house-sit for some of her longer trips.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn looked intrigued, \u201cWell at least you always had your sister to look after one another. You two probably became super close huh? And that stinks that your mom was away so often though\u2026 I would have killed for some space from my mom growing up.\u201d Quinn muttered the last half of her response to herself, just barely loud enough for you to hear. You wanted to ask her more about that, but once more you stopped yourself. You figured that she would tell you whenever she felt comfortable enough, and for that reason you decided not to pry further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, kind of. Tracy and I are good friends now, but throughout middle and high school it\u2019s safe to say she went through a bit of an angsty streak.\u201d You responded, looking down for a moment. Quinn was careful not to express too much emotion like usual, but you could still tell that she truly cared about what you were saying, so you continued. \u201cYeah, for some reason she felt like I was mom\u2019s favorite or something, and was always looking to get me back for that for some reason. As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t buy it. I frequently found myself at the mercy of her pretty mean-spirited pranks, or worse yet when she would try to set me up to get in trouble with our mom\u2026 but either way I always made it out in one piece!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn smirked slightly, she knew you were downplaying the severity of what you were telling her without a doubt, but at the same time it seemed like she somewhat respected your attempt to seem tough. She then perked up her head, \u201cWhat about your Aunt then, Norah was her name? Surely she had to have provided a bit of a buffer between you and your sister during those years when she would look after you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled back, \u201cOnce again, kind of,\u201d you said with a chuckle. \u201cWhen Tracy would mess with me around my mom, she had to be a little bit more tactical and sly about it, since she too would get in trouble if she was caught doing it. Whenever Norah would look after us, she never felt right punishing either one of us harshly, since we weren\u2019t her kids after all. That meant that almost no matter what Tracy did to me, Norah would let her off no more than a slap on the wrists. On top of that, Norah was a pretty colossal airhead at times, she would frequently forget about me entirely, leave my fate in the hands of my sister, or simply not realize how much damage that she could do to me with her body. Plus, there was the added threat of Norah\u2019s job. She was actually a tiny-specific job recruiter. I think she may even still be now. But either way, she was in charge of seeking out job-hunting guys like myself for positions in all kinds of fields of work. In all honesty I respected her for trying to help us dudes out like that\u2026 I just wished that she would have looked more carefully into some of the jobs that she was hired to do the recruiting for. There were a couple of times where she begged me to fill an emergency job listing when she couldn\u2019t find anyone else, and I don\u2019t think that she knew just what she was sending me into\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn\u2019s eyebrows raised at the information that you gave her. From the sound of it, none of the three women who you interacted with most growing up were the type to coddle you or wait on your every need. This made her partly respect you for surviving such an upbringing, but deep down she did empathize with the hardships that you must have faced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of you felt like again this was a lot to dump on someone you just met, but at the same time you felt an instant connection with Quinn. Deep down you wanted to know more about her, and you figured that if you shared enough of your past with her, then perhaps she would do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Quinn, what out of all that do ya wanna hear about?\u201d You said confidently up to her. Some of these memories were a bit traumatic for sure, but at this point you felt comfortable enough to share them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Quinn ask about?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWell, let\u2019s hear a bit more about your immediate family. Tracy and\u2026Helen, right?\u201d Quinn inquired, impressively recalling your mom\u2019s name. \u201cI wonder how much they\u2019re like my own mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded happily. \u201cSure, I can talk about them. Most of the crazy stories from my life are about the two of them anyway, so I\u2019ve got a nearly limitless supply of tales.\u201d You said this last bit in an over-the-top old narrator voice, causing Quinn to roll her eyes and smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou dork.\u201d The black-haired giantess said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a moment to clear your throat, you began. \u201cWell, as I\u2019ve mentioned, hardly a day went by from the time Tracy was in sixth grade up to senior year where she wouldn\u2019t bully me in some way. It was light teasing one day, and then down-right torment the next. I\u2019ve forgiven her by now, of course\u2026pretty hard not to with Tracy\u2019s ceaseless apologies\u2026but she was directly responsible for a lot of bad memories in the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn raised a finger inquisitively. \u201cHold up. I\u2019m actually curious what brought about her change. Why did she begin treating you differently?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quirked your mouth to the side. \u201cWell, I actually didn\u2019t learn that myself for a few years, until Tracy told me herself. Since I\u2019m a year older than her, I graduated and headed off to college when her senior year began. Tracy told me that, without me around, she quickly began to miss me. Then, seeing my mother constantly on edge with worry over my safety while I was at college by myself, Tracy realized how much she missed me for ME, not just to bully me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think some introspection on Tracy\u2019s part made her realize how dumb her perceived mistreatment was. Her persecution complex kinda fell apart as she matured, and this was the final nail in the coffin. I mean, I\u2019m her brother, and somewhere deep inside of her she always loved me as family should. I wish she\u2019d had the realization earlier in her life, as it would\u2019ve saved me a lot of trouble, but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou trailed off, and Quinn picked up the slack. \u201cYeah, Hunter, that sucks. At least it worked out in the end between you and her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt did. She\u2019s pretty much my best friend now.\u201d You nodded. \u201cBut as for past events\u2026uh\u2026I\u2019ll start off with a simple one. When I was in tenth grade, I won an award for math score achievements, but Tracy lost out to one of her classmates to win her own award. As such, her persecution complex convinced her that I was to blame for her missing out on an award, and that meant she felt compelled to bully me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe took an interesting approach though. Grabbing me up when my mom wasn\u2019t looking, Tracy smushed me up into a blob, and then dripped some lemon juice from our kitchen onto me. Popping me into her mouth before heading out to catch the bus, Tracy proceeded to use me as her gum for the entire day. It was a blur of crushing, smashing, and gnashing for hours on end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnfortunately, it didn\u2019t take Tracy long to realize the cruel genius of her plan. Because tiny guys like me are much more absorbent when squished, my body totally soaked in the lemon juice, thus retaining its taste and flavor through the whole day. And\u2026uh\u2026the next day. And the next. Tracy used me as her gum for five straight days, smiling the whole time at how tasty I was to her. It only ended when she slipped up by mentioning me on the phone with her friend when my mom was in earshot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing your story was finished, Quinn winced. \u201cGum? That\u2019s awful, Hunter. How could Tracy treat you like that, her own brother?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou forced a laugh. \u201cWell, it was hardly the worst thing she ever did to me. Not even close.\u201d Quinn\u2019s eyes narrowed tensely, and you backtracked. \u201cI-I mean, she didn\u2019t get off scot-free. My mom forced her to scrub the bathroom with a toothbrush every night for a week, which caused her to have to cancel a party she was planning on going to.\u201d You paused, and frowned. \u201cOf course, my mom also punished me for missing class, even though it was Tracy\u2019s fault. And, Tracy saw her own punishment as my fault, so she had it out for me the next few weeks too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s nuts.\u201d Quinn shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got that right.\u201d You stated. \u201cThe cycle of bullying and punishment was and endless dance between Tracy, my mom, and I.\u201d You rubbed your chin. \u201cBut, I don\u2019t want you to think we were an awful family either, Quinn. For all the bad memories, there were plenty of times where my family and I all got along great. I\u2019ve got a bunch of treasured memories somewhere in my ol\u2019 noggin!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn smirked again. \u201cWhat, like vacations and trips? Stuff like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour demeanor faded just a bit. \u201cUh, not always. I meant hanging out at home, or things like that. Not to say our family vacations and trips weren\u2019t great, but\u2026let\u2019s just say the risk of danger to someone like me was increased by about a thousand during those times.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn\u2019s eyed widened. \u201cOh, shit, really? I guess that makes sense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced over at Quinn\u2019s clock on the wall, seeing that there was still plenty of time left in the day. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll stop beating around the bush. Guess I can tell you a more specific, longer story.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Realizing that it would be a fairly unique tale to tell your new friend, you proposed the idea. \u201cWell, I actually could tell about this one time where I accidentally ended up tagging along with my mom on one of her business trips.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAccidentally? How\u2019d that play out?\u201d Quinn inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled lightly. \u201cAbout as well as you might imagine. Basically\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(FLASHBACK BEGIN)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been pretty much just a normal week of July, of which you\u2019d spent most of that time trying (and frequently failing) to avoid Tracy, and catching up on TV shows you\u2019d missed during the school year. It was the summer between your ninth and tenth grade. Just a day prior, your mother had revealed she was leaving on another sudden business trip, lasting from Friday to Sunday. She\u2019d informed your younger sister that she was in charge of keeping you safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy didn\u2019t take that too well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut MOM!\u201d Tracy whined, stomping her foot once for emphasis. \u201cI was gonna hang out with Lindsey all weekend! We\u2019ve had these plans for over a month!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sweetie, but this is how it is with my job. As a consultant, I always have to be on call at any moment. I\u2019ll make it up to you when I get back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister sneered. \u201cBut why can\u2019t Hunter just hang out by himself all weekend? He\u2019s practically an adult.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen patted her daughter on the shoulder. \u201cAnd he\u2019s also an inch tall. All it would take is one tiny accident without your supervision, and we could lose him. You need to stay home and look after him. Don\u2019t baby him, but check in on him at least a few times a day.\u201d She paused. \u201cSpeaking of, he\u2019s still asleep, isn\u2019t he?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout faltering a beat, Tracy nodded. \u201cYeah, I think. Haven\u2019t seen him all day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother sighed. \u201cOh well. Tell him I say goodbye. I\u2019m going to run to the bathroom once more, and then I\u2019m off.\u201d She turned from Tracy and gestured to her already packed suitcase. \u201cCould you make sure each pocket is zipped up nice and tight?\u201d<br>\r\nTracy groaned, but nodded. \u201cSure, mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen wandered off to the bedroom, and Tracy waited until she heard the door shut before swearing under her breath. Angrily, she tore off the hairtie she\u2019d been wearing, which of course was actually your squished, molded body. Glaring at your flattened form, your giantess sister frowned\u2026until her expression morphed into one of inspiration, her eyes darting back and forth between you and Helen\u2019s suitcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Tracy grinned, and leaned over you. \u201cYa know what, Hunter? I\u2019m not putting my plans on hold just to look after you all weekend. Why don\u2019t you take a nice little trip instead?\u201d Tracy smirked, and mimed blowing you a kiss before angling her palm and letting your papery body roll off her hand and into the main pouch of the suitcase. You couldn\u2019t do a thing to slow your descent, and merely glimpsed a final sight of your sister\u2019s mean-spirited grin before everything became darkness as she zipped up the suitcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reformed fairly quickly, but not enough to do anything about the fate Tracy had bestowed upon you. As your mother returned from the bathroom and grabbed her suitcase to begin rolling it, you toppled over, falling deeper into the piles of clothes all around you. Slipping deeper into the suitcase, your attempts at crying out to get her attention were useless, as your voice was nowhere near loud enough to penetrate outside the mound of clothes and the walls of the suitcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugging Tracy goodbye, Helen strolled out to her car, tossing the suitcase into the backseat before driving off. The simple act of tossing her suitcase into the car caused all her clothes inside to bounce around wildly, and your miniscule body was tossed around like a toy, banging into the sides of the suitcase and ending up buried under even more clothes. Your body was squished slightly, but at least the soft fabrics surrounded you comforted your experience somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not to say that you felt mentally comfortable at all. Because of Tracy\u2019s grudge against you, and her general selfishness, you were now ripped from your relaxing home and helplessly being taken along on your mother\u2019s business trip. You had no idea where Helen was heading, how long it would take for her to get there, or if she\u2019d even find you once there. On top of that, you were already fearing whatever punishment Helen would dole out, as you knew from experiencing that her \u201cstrict but fair\u201d nature would take no mercy on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the moment, though, there was nothing you could do but wait. Straining your ears to hear, you could just barely make out the sounds of a typical airport, and from the shaking of your suitcase prison, you knew your mom had just checked in her baggage. Everything around you fell sideways, crushing you more in the shift of the clothes pile, and you guessed you were now on the luggage conveyor belt rumbling along to the plane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few hours were a blur of noises, motion, and unsettling silence. Your suitcase was eventually loaded onto the plane, tossed inside and stacked. It took over an hour for the plane to board and take off, and then the actual plane flight was a few hours at least. You didn\u2019t know for sure, because you eventually drifted off to sleep (having given up on trying to reform with the weight of the clothes crushing you down), and you regained consciousness right around the time your mom made it to her hotel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began mentally bracing yourself as Helen rolled the suitcase towards the elevator and up to her room. You needed to prepare to reform and get her attention, lest your situation spiral into even further chaos than it was already shaping up to be. You took a deep breath, and finally felt the entire suitcase shake and tilt as your mom laid it out on her hotel bed, and began to unzip the central pouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTraces of light shone down from the room into the deepest crevices of the suitcase, where you were currently located. You could hear your mom softly mumbling to herself as she systematically removed one item from her suitcase after another, no doubt taking mental inventory. Craning your head back, you could see some of the clothing around you, which consisted of multiple business blouses and skirts, an alluring formal dress, and a surprisingly revealing one-piece bikini. You tried to ignore the frilly panties and bras you could feel touching you from all sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long last, your mom retrieved the pair of panties covering you up, revealing you to the world and momentarily blinding you from the light. Having managed to reform, you blinked rapidly to clear your sight, and soon found yourself staring up at your mother\u2019s giant face. She was peering down at you quizzically, which then morphed into surprise, and finally landed on annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026what are you doing in here, Hunter?\u201d Helen asked, flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced. \u201cU-uh\u2026just hanging out, mom. It was\u2026um\u2026comfy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom wasn\u2019t amused by your attempt to lighten the mood, and she pinched your chest and lifted you out of her suitcase. \u201cSo\u2026you thought my lingerie was comfortable? Is that what you\u2019re trying to say, Hunter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face flushed. \u201cN-no, no! I was just\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen sighed. \u201cTrying to lighten the mood, right? Let me guess\u2026Tracy threw you in here to avoid looking after you all weekend. That sound correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened. \u201cYeah, pretty much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother dropped you onto the desk beside the room\u2019s TV and ran her hands through her hair. \u201cThat girl is grounded for a month when I get back. I really don\u2019t have time to look after you this weekend. I have a meeting tonight with some company managers, and then I\u2019m spending all day tomorrow with our client. Some rich heiress wants a sponsorship with our company, and I have to liaison with her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked dumbly, having only caught some of what your mom had just said. Reading your blank expression, Helen groaned. \u201cOh, Hunter\u2026I\u2019m saying that I\u2019m too busy to keep a close eye on you. It just can\u2019t happen\u2026\u201d She paused, and sat back on her bed. \u201cWell, I suppose that I could\u2026hmm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I can do anything to help, I will!\u201d You offered enthusiastically, earning an eye roll from your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just want out of punishment, don\u2019t you?\u201d Helen inferred. \u201cStill, I guess I DO have a few options as for what to do with you. Hmm.\u201d Your mom rubbed her chin while staring intently at you, and you felt a small shiver go down your spine. Something about the look in her eyes, while kind and caring and loving, had the same hint of danger you sensed from Tracy frequently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had the sinking feeling you weren\u2019t getting out of your mom\u2019s business trip unscathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(FLASHBACK CONTINUES)</span></div></div>",

So I think we can start your punishment for inconveniencing me early and I\u2019ll just mold you into something I can wear to keep you with me,\u201d your mom was clearly irritated by having to accommodate you unexpectedly, based on the flat tone of her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut mom, I\u2019ll be fine in here all weekend...\u201d a small scowl from Helen was all that was needed to shut you up, knowing better than to try and debate her on this. You silently cursed your mom\u2019s sense of \u201cfairness\u201d when it came to punishments. Sure, your prescence here was an extra worry for her, but it was Tracy\u2019s fault! Why were you getting punished? Still though, if you argued further, you\u2019d just be giving Helen a reason to extend your punishment further than just this weekend, so you kept your mouth shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, as I was saying, I\u2019ll need to mold you into something I can wear that isn\u2019t too visible, since none of my clothes are tan and you would clash with their colours,\u201d she brainstormed for a brief moment before you saw her eyes light up with that dangerous glint you saw earlier, you nervously gulped in anticipation. \u201cI\u2019ll have to mold you into underwear for the weekend. Nothing else will work, a tan bra would show through some of my blouses and I don\u2019t plan on wearing socks with the shoes I\u2019m wearing,\u201d you sighed as she finished speaking, already hating this idea. As she saw your reaction to the idea of serving as her underwear, she flatly continued. \u201cUnless you\u2019d rather be my insole for the weekend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing her say that shut you up, as much as serving as underwear would be bad, filling in as an insole would definitely be worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBear in mind that this is a punishment, Hunter. You\u2019re not supposed to enjoy it.\u201d With that said Helen grabbed you and started to flatten you out before you could respond. She stretched your limbs out and tied them together to form the loops of your new underwear form. Within a few moments Helen had sculpted your malleable body into the rudimentary shape of a pair of underwear. Since she was only using her hands to do it, you weren\u2019t perfectly underwear shaped, but you were close enough in Helen\u2019s eyes. She had shaped you in a way where your face would be on the back end, but facing outwards, so you would possibly get some respite from her grinding ass cheeks, but your more cynical side told you it probably wouldn\u2019t matter very much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that\u2019s out of the way I don\u2019t have too long until my meeting with the company managers starts, so I\u2019m just going to have to get dressed quickly,\u201d she looked down to you. Still clearly irritated at you being here and not at home. \u201cYou\u2019ll get a break tomorrow, the heiress that I\u2019m meeting with insists that our meeting be by the pool, she can\u2019t have her beauty regimen interrupted, so I\u2019ll probably just keep you in my bag while I\u2019m meeting with her or something since I won\u2019t be needing underwear when I\u2019m wearing a bikini.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom nonchalantly dropped you to the floor, and you heard the rustling sound of her getting undressed. From your position, face down on the floor, you thankfully couldn\u2019t see anything. You heard her mumbling to herself about which clothes would be best to wear to her meeting for a while before she seemed to go silent, clearly having picked out an outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly felt Helen\u2019s feet slide through your loops that your bound arms and legs formed and you began to slide upwards as she grabbed your arms and dragged you up her legs. Helen was not a skinny woman, and she had clearly not stretched you out enough to be an easy fit on her, so your ascent began to slow as you started to raise up past her thighs. After a few seconds of struggling, Helen\u2019s pulling on you stretched your arms and legs out enough to rocket you up past her meaty thighs and ample ass cheeks in one swift, painful (for you), pull. <br>\r\nEven though your arms and legs now fit around Helen\u2019s hips your body was not as adequately stretched out, your torso rocketed up between her butt cheeks, now almost completely hidden from the outside world. Helen grimaced seeing the state of your stretched out form, but shrugged.<br>\r\n\u201cHe is being punished, so if it\u2019s a bit uncomfortable for him then it\u2019s a better punishment,\u201d she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter securing you around her backside, Helen glanced at the clock, panicking now that she could see how much time she spent making sure you were secure and that she was now very likely going to be late. With a glance of annoyance in the mirror at your thin, stretched out face, slowly sinking between her cheeks and out of view, she rushed to get ready. Helen quickly got the dressed, fixed her makeup, and left to go to her first meeting of a very busy weekend for her, and now also for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Helen rushed to get to her meeting, which was only a few blocks away from her hotel, you were ground relentlessly between her rapidly moving buns. Between the rapid motion and the fact that you had been molded into underwear that was probably a size too small for her, you were very quickly being pulled into the depths of her asscrack. You were beginning to resemble more of a thong than a regular pair of underwear. Your mother noticed none of this however, as she was in too much of a rush to get to her meeting. <br>\r\nHer rush was also causing a massive amount of sweat to build up around you, your body\u2019s absorbent qualities greedily drawing in all of the sweat, preventing Helen\u2019s normally very sweaty behind from being anywhere near as bad as it would normally be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen hurried into the meeting room, flustered. With a quick, quiet apology, she quickly took her seat. All thoughts of you had slipped her mind. She was too focused on her meeting. You were painfully compressed as Helen\u2019s hefty backside squeezed into the chair, her monumental cheeks collapsing in on you and crushing the air out of your already compressed lungs.<br>\r\nYou internally sighed, knowing that this was going to be a long weekend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke to the the soothing sensation of the air conditioning of your mothers room, now that she was taking you off. You had just spent the last 16 hours compressed between Helen\u2019s butt cheeks as she went from meeting to meeting, had dinner with one of her bosses, and finally went to bed still wearing you, too tired to even take you off. <br>\r\nAs you hit the floor between your mother\u2019s feet, she plucked you up in her hand and lifted you to her face. Her face, now in view, had the same disciplinarian expression you were used to when she was carrying out her punishments.<br>\r\n\u201cSo Hunter, your first shift as my underwear is over, you can have a break now. I\u2019m going to go for a shower and then I\u2019ve got to get to the rooftop pool where I\u2019m meeting with a client. Since I won\u2019t need underwear when I\u2019m in a swimsuit, you can rest in my bag,\u201d Helen regarded you with little pity for your situation, as far as she was concerned this was the best way to teach you a lesson about interfering with her job. She almost got into a lot of trouble for being late to her first meeting, so she was still slightly irritated with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe casually dropped you on the bed, face up. You watched her wide hips sway as she walked to the bathroom with a small amount of fear, knowing you\u2019d be wrapped around them at least once more before you were freed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter around half an hour you were deposited in your mother\u2019s bag by her, now clad in a surprisingly revealing blue one piece bikini. With you secure, Helen headed up to the rooftop pool and found two loungers, her client had wanted to keep their meeting casual. This meeting was to secure a sponsorship from her company on this clients new reality tv show, where she share as a house with ten tiny men for a few weeks. She waited for a few moments before she spotted her client and grimaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle Abernant was the daughter of a multi-billionaire, Mr Arthur Abernant. As expected she was a spoiled brat and Helen hated dealing with her, but Danielle seemed to have taken a liking to her, enjoying that your mother basically did all the work for her in all of their business dealings.<br>\r\nAs she strutted past the pool towards your mother, many heads turned to ogle her. Tanned skin and prominent curves were on full display in her very revealing two piece tan bikini. Her piercing blue eyes were hidden behind a pair of sunglasses probably worth more than your mom\u2019s car, which were framed by long flowing platinum blonde hair which went down past her shoulders. She was a vision of beauty and she knew it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Helen!\u201d The heiress squealed and Helen groaned internally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Miss Abernant, I have all of the documents here. So we can get on with the details of your sponsorship,\u201d Helen simply wanted to get this over with so she could get on with her other work, but deep down she knew that this wouldn\u2019t go quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, always so professional Helen!\u201d Danielle\u2019s full, plump lips parted into a pout. \u201cLearn to let go a little and have some fun! We can get to the boring paperwork later.\u201d<br>\r\nDanielle looked to a passing waiter and snapped her fingers, demanding two margaritas for herself and Helen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing all this from inside your mother\u2019s bag, you had a bad feeling this girl would cause you trouble in one way or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Danielle\u2019s skimpy thong bikini is broken by her monumental hips, and some way or another she spots you in Helen\u2019s bag and demands to wear you for the rest of their meeting or she\u2019ll cancel the sponsorship deal. <br>\r\n2) Danielle and your mother get very drunk together. In her hungover state the next morning, Helen forgets that you are her thong!<br>\r\n3) Writer\u2019s choice.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From your slightly folded up position in your mother\u2019s bag, you could only listen to the carefree attitude of this woman that Helen referred to as an heiress earlier that day. From the sound of the conversation, she must have ordered a few tropical drinks for herself and your mother, clearly not intent on taking a break from her lavish lifestyle for even a second. It sounded quite nice to be honest. Enjoying a relaxing day in the sun, drinking drinks, just enjoying a day as a normal person was tragically something that didn\u2019t come often to tiny guys like you. Instead, all thanks to the vendetta your sister held against you, you had to spend the entire previous day wedged between your own mom\u2019s ass cheeks, getting battered and sweat-soaked as more time went on. Even the break you were receiving now wasn\u2019t really a break, you were still immobilized and trapped in the dark of Helen\u2019s purse. Your only solace was knowing that your mom was a fair woman at the end of the day, and Tracy would get her punishment as well when the two of you returned from this trip. Of course, Tracy\u2019s punishment would end up being something infuriatingly normal, such as getting grounded, but at least it was something. Suddenly you were awoken from your daydream as the slightly nasally and haughty voice of the presumed heiress rung out once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Helen, you got any gum in here? That drink had kind of a funky aftertaste.\u201d Danielle said before opening up your mom\u2019s purse without even waiting for a response. She really was a spoiled brat after all. Immediately light flooded into your eyes, blinding you briefly as you adjusted your vision from the dark. What you couldn\u2019t see was Danielle\u2019s eyes lighting up as she reached in with one exquisitely manicured finger and lifted you up into the air by one of the \u201cstraps\u201d that consisted of two of your limbs tied together. \u201cHelen! You dirty girl, what do we have here? Let me guess, an intern got a little cheeky with you so you\u2019re letting him get some of your cheeks in return!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes finally adjusted to the light and you saw the radiant beauty of this woman holding you up in the air like no more than an object. Her looks seemed perfectly crafted, without a doubt a mixture of unmatched genetics as well as some likely expensive procedures. Either way, she was stunning, but the type of stunning that struck fear into your heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 uhh, yeah you got it, an intern. But I\u2019m only keeping him like that for the day. It\u2019s mostly a threat, I didn\u2019t plan on actually wearing him. Just teaching him a bit of a lesson.\u201d Helen responded. She went along with the heiress\u2019s assumption, preferring that excuse over having to explain the complicated situation with her own son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gleam of mischief flashed through Danielle\u2019s eyes as she clearly came up with a plan. With the hand that wasn\u2019t currently holding you she reached down and deftly hooked one sharpened, manicured nail into her tan swimsuit bottom, tearing it along the seam! \u201cOh no, Helen! It seems like something has happened to my swimsuit bottom! Oh if someone catches a picture of me naked in public that would certainly be a blow to my image\u2026 or moreso a blow to any companies trying to sponsor me, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother\u2019s expression looked panicked immediately. While you almost never saw her look this flustered, when it came to her job she refused to let a single thing go wrong if she had anything to say about it. Briefly, her eyes locked on with yours, giving you a look of sympathy, as despite her calculated dishing out of punishment, she still was your mother at the end of the day. But her desire to land this sponsorship unfortunately won out over your wellbeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then it\u2019s your lucky day, Danielle, slide the guy on, he deserves it anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I like to hear.\u201d The heiress grinned, simply tearing the rest of her clearly expensive but now ruined bikini bottom away before roughly shimmying you up her thick thighs without even standing up from the lounge chair she was on. You cried as you felt your skin rub against this overly tanned goddess\u2019s smooth, oiled flesh. But after a moment this sensation was replaced by a much more familiar one, your torso rocketing up between a woman\u2019s ass cheeks. With a grunt Danielle slung you up into her crack, your arms tied around her hips and your legs squished just wide enough to cover her frontside. You were comically small, just as you were on your mother mere hours ago, and your relatively pale skin stuck out as an off white on this bronzed goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee this is why I like you Helen. We don\u2019t hate tiny guys or anything, but we understand as two strong, beautiful women that if a tiny can make our lives easier then why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to use them to do so?\u201d Danielle said, while simultaneously signaling to the nearest poolside waitress that she was ready for another drink. Helen nervously looked down at the heiress\u2019s lower body, torn between empathy for her son and concern for possibly angering such a high profile client.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, meanwhile, couldn\u2019t believe what your mother just did. Not only did she lie about who you were, but she knowingly allowed you to be worn by this stranger. You thought you were at least going to get a brief respite from being ass floss for a curvaceous woman, but it seemed like once again fate had other plans. Danielle flexed her cheeks unknowingly, absolutely devastating your body with an unconscious action and you mentally groaned. Unfortunately, you knew that your mom would likely go to the ends of the earth to keep a client happy, so your hope for the future was slim to none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Helen decide to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Come clean and tell Danielle that the thong is actually you, asking her to take you off and get a new one. Danielle begrudgingly accepts but only on the terms that you come be one of the 10 tiny guys to star with her in her game show! Which unfortunately Helen agrees to\u2026<br>\r\n2) Come clean and tell Danielle, but Danielle simply refuses.<br>\r\n3) Keep quiet about you and casually try to prevent too much torture.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSo, I\u2019m just really curious about this Norah person.\u201d Quinn said, finally deciding on a conversation topic. \u201cLike, I get that she\u2019s your aunt, but you\u2019re being a little cagey about what it was like to actually be around her. Seems like it might\u2019ve been a mix of good and bad, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed shortly. \u201cYeah, you kind of hit the nail on the head, Quinn. Aunt Norah was really a handful. It\u2019s been about a year now since I\u2019ve last seen her. The last time was when she came over for a surprise visit during Christmas time, and stayed a week. I spent Christmas day sloshing away in her stomach after she swallowed me with her eggnog, and that was hardly the only incident that week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yikes.\u201d Quinn\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou did mention she was pretty airheaded, didn\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was putting it lightly, for her sake.\u201d You groaned. \u201cNorah\u2019s a total scatterbrain. I\u2019ll be sitting on the couch, she\u2019ll see me and say hello, turn around and notice her favorite show is on, and then sit down to watch it for three hours\u2026right on top of me! Even then, I\u2019m lucky if she realizes what she\u2019s done when she finally does stand up, or if I\u2019m glued to her butt for the foreseeable future.\u201d You gave Quinn a sidelong look. \u201cAnd of course, if we\u2019re talking six or more years ago, Tracy would\u2019ve let it all happen with a quiet smirk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn tapped her chin thoughtfully. \u201cNorah and your sister put you through the ringer, huh? Gotta say, it\u2019s impressive you survived through it all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \u201cGuess you could say I learned from every experience. Certainly there are some experiences that I wish I could burn from my brain, though.\u201d You forced out a laugh. \u201cIn my worst nightmares, I can still remember Norah believing Tracy back in middle school, when she squished up my body and said I was a \u2018new, special toe cleaner\u2019. Norah used me to pick out lint and toe jam from her disgusting feet for a week\u2026before throwing me in the trash where I barely escaped before being taken out to the curb.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn gaped, but said nothing for a moment. Finally, she frowned. \u201cAnd can you tell me more about that\u2026tiny recruiter\u2026thing? Her job, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, and it was a cushy one that let her mostly work from home.\u201d You explained. \u201cBasically, Norah was assigned a sheet of tiny-specific job postings, and then needed to recruit tinies to fill the spots as quickly as possible. It wasn\u2019t too hard for her. Tiny-exclusive jobs pay really well, usually because of the danger involved, and Norah\u2019s exuberance was hard to turn down. She\u2019s also\u2026and I mean this from a purely factual standpoint, not anything weird\u2026really attractive given her age. Most tinies would fall head over heels to make her happy by saying yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe trouble was, given her penchant for being forgetful and oblivious, Norah would almost never explain the jobs clearly or fully. She probably just didn\u2019t get how awful some tasks could be when you\u2019re just one inch. She\u2019d also overestimate herself sometimes, and come up short with approaching deadlines. That\u2019s where she\u2019d come and rope me into a job, promising double pay and that they would only be for a week or so.\u201d You paused. \u201cHowever, one week of serving as a head executive\u2019s \u2018stress toy\u2019 felt like an eternity when I did it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis last statement drew ire from Quinn, and a flash of anger danced in her eyes. \u201cOne of her recruiting jobs was to sell yourself as a stress toy?\u201d The black-haired giantess asked moodily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep. And there were plenty that were so much worse. Again, Norah was kind of too dumb to realize what she was coercing so many tinies into, so I can\u2019t be too mad at her specifically. Those are still some bad memories of mine.\u201d You stopped for a second and then smiled wistfully. \u201cThat sums up Norah, actually. A decent bit of good wrapped up in a whole lot of bad. Add in Tracy during her torment years, and you\u2019ve hit peak awful.\u201d You chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn shook her head, overwhelmed by the sheer craziness of your life. Even still, you could see the intrigue dancing in her eyes now that her anger had cooled, and sure enough, a minute later, she was ready to hear some more specific stories.</span></div></div>",

Basically\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(FLASHBACK BEGIN)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the summer between tenth and eleventh grade, in the middle of blistering August. By this point of the summer, you\u2019d finished all of your preparatory assigned work for the upcoming school year, so you were totally free for the remaining ten days of your break. As such, you spent most of your time sprawled out on the couch lazily watching TV. It was easy living, perhaps a bit boring, but definitely relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn this particular day, you\u2019d made sure to avoid the havoc hurricane that was Aunt Norah. She\u2019d arrived the day prior, showing up minutes before your mom headed out on another of her seemingly endless business trips. Norah hadn\u2019t been in the house for more than five minutes before she\u2019d plopped her gargantuan buttocks onto your tiny body, not noticing you on the chair she\u2019d claimed as her own. Of course, Tracy had let her sit there for over an hour before letting slip your whereabouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah had given her trademark quick apology, laughing as she did so, and though you knew she meant well, you knew it was safer for you to just distance yourself from her as much as possible. This morning she was sequestered away in a side room, probably in the middle of one of her daily yoga sessions. She hadn\u2019t crushed or smushed you yet, and you were determined to keep it that way by maintaining a healthy distance from your airheaded aunt, all day if need be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, your younger sister walking by, sparing a quick sidelong glance at you before she approached the room Norah was in. Opening the door, Tracy was hit by an overwhelming wave of heat, and she gasped for breath. Even from across the room on the couch, you could feel the hot temperatures of the room hit your face, and could hardly imagine what Norah was doing in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Tracy spoke for you, poking her head into the room. \u201cAunt Norah, what are you doing? Why is it so freakin\u2019 hot in here?\u201d Tracy laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re sweating up a storm!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah\u2019s hearty laugh floated all the way from the room to your ears. \u201cOh, good morning, Tracy, dear! I wanted to switch up my morning yoga by trying out something I saw online. It\u2019s called hot yoga, I think. The point is to work up a crazy sweat.\u201d<br>\r\nTracy wrinkled up her nose. \u201cReally? That seems kinda gross.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah laughed again; her voice tinged with a hint of exhaustion. \u201cIt is, but it truly does feel good to get it all out, you know? It\u2019s why I closed all the windows in this room, turned off the AC, and brought in that heater in the corner. The hotter the better\u2026or so I read.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, you do you, Aunt Norah.\u201d Tracy giggled, moving to step back and close the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wait!\u201d Norah called out. \u201cIf you could do one quick thing for me, dear? I forgot a sweat rag, and I sure as heck will need one by the time I\u2019m down. Preferably sooner. Could you get one for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy nodded, not at all surprised her scatterbrained aunt would forget something so crucial for morning exercise. \u201cSure thing, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re an angel, Tracy!\u201d Were Norah\u2019s last words before Tracy closed the door and walked back towards you, moving to pass through the living room and towards the bathroom to procure a washcloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her way, she glanced over at you again, and stopped in her tracks. Your younger sister paused while staring at you, frowning. An expression danced in her eyes, one of curiosity and inquisitiveness, a look which you failed to notice as you\u2019d gone back to happily watching TV. You didn\u2019t so much as glance the huge grin which began to grow on Tracy\u2019s face, nor the malicious glint in her eyes as she sauntered over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when Tracy was directly beside you, towering above you that you noticed her. Taking your eyes off the TV, you craned your neck all the way back to peer up at your giantess sister, her smirk on full display. Feeling incredibly uneasy, you tried to play it cool and hopefully diffuse any situation that may be brewing. You had no idea what her plans were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026hey, Tracy.\u201d You said, as casually as possible, though your voice still wavered. Tracy grinned wider, seemingly pleased that you were so on-edge around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Hunter? Finished all your schoolwork for the first day of class in a week and a half?\u201d Tracy asked, almost friendly, though her unsettling grin remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped. \u201cY-yeah\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! Doing anything today?\u201d Tracy put her hands on her hips and leaned just a little closer to you. You subconsciously drew into yourself a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026no?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy clapped her hands together. \u201cAwesome! Then you\u2019ll be perfect for this!\u201d Your younger sister clapped again\u2026although this time, it consisted of her slapping her palms down onto the couch, and crushing you flat.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Peeling your squished form off of the couch, Tracy effortlessly picked your clothes off with her fingernail and flicked the remnants of fabric scraps into the trash can. With you naked, she was easily able to stretch and mold your body, contorting your malleable form into a roughly rectangular shape about a foot long. She then used her thumb to press into your face and harshly smear your facial features into an unrecognizable blob, your vision blurring as she did so, and your mouth morphing into a useless lump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, Tracy strolled back over to Norah\u2019s exercise room, opened the door, and held you out like she was presenting a gift. \u201cGot you that sweat rag, Aunt Norah! Sorry it took me a minute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, it\u2019s no problem at all, dear. You\u2019re so nice, Tracy.\u201d Norah gushed, stepping off her yoga mat to grab you. As soon as she approached, you could see the blurry image of her smile warmly at your sister, and not even spare you a second glance as she grabbed you with her slimy hand and clenched you tightly. Only Tracy glanced at you for a lightning quick second, smirking as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah threw you over her shoulder as she returned to the center of the room. Looking over her shoulder at Tracy, she cocked her head quizzically to the side. \u201cThis sweat rag feels quite odd, don\u2019t you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy, ever quick on her feet, smile easily. \u201cOh, I think it\u2019s one of my mom\u2019s specially ordered rags. Supposed to be comfy but also super absorbent? I think that\u2019s what it is, I grabbed it from a stack in the bathroom.\u201d The lie came out smoothly, and Norah nodded innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that right?\u201d Your aunt chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ll put it to the test, then!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy grinned, half genuinely and half maliciously. Her plan would\u2019ve been ruined if Norah had called her out on the lie, as excellent as it was. Thankfully for Tracy, her plan was flawless. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you to it!\u201d Your cruel sister giggled, then excused herself, closing the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah went back to some simple stretches, leaving you lying over her shoulder. The tiny, cramped room was unbelievably hot, the unbearable temperatures nearly searing. You were sweating buckets in seconds, as was your aunt, and Norah\u2019s sweat mixed with your own to create a fearsome bog of disgusting stench. You fought to squirm to alert Norah, but you were too thoroughly crushed by Tracy to move. Similarly, you found reforming equally challenging, and you were still a flat, vaguely washcloth shape five minutes later, when\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, goodness. That was very exhausting!\u201d Norah sighed aloud, as she reached for you. Your blood ran cold as her hot fingers touched your body and dragged you off her shoulder. You gave one last, futile attempt to wiggle, but it was no use. All you could do in those last moments was look through smeared eyes at your curvaceous giantess aunt, who was clad in a tight sports bra and form-fitting compression shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later, Norah slammed you into her taut abdomen, pressing you firmly into her sweat-slicked skin. You winced from the impact, and double-so once your titanic aunt began scraping you up and down her tummy, using your absorbent body to gather up every remaining bit of sweat from her. You wished you could stop it, but your body\u2019s natural processes greedily sucked up all of Norah\u2019s sweat like a good little sweat rag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpressed at the \u2018specially ordered rag\u2019 Tracy had given her, Norah smiled appreciatively as she continued to rub you all over her body. She wedged you down her cleavage, rummaging you around her sizable tits until you\u2019d sopped up all their collected sweat. Norah then dragged you up and down her toned legs, going so far as to clean between her toes and under her soles with your face, forcing you to taste every inch of her dirty and sweaty body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast of all, Norah smiled sheepishly, silently glad that Tracy was in the other room, and stripped out of her compression shorts. It took her a minute to wiggle the skintight shorts off of her booty, but she finally did so, filling the room with an extra pungent odor. Mentally screaming at your aunt, begging her to stop, you braced for impact as Norah slammed your beaten, abused body into her tight butt cheeks (as she had been wearing nothing underneath her shorts).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrubbing you dutifully into her cheeks, Norah decimated your body with sweat and stench in equal measure. She rubbed you in methodical circles around her plump cheeks, humming a little tune as she did so. Your body contorted and squished as she did so, amazing Norah even further. She couldn\u2019t believe that this new sweat rag could be stretched into whatever shape best cleaned her at any given moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to test this great new sweat rag to its limits, Norah twisted your head and your feet, pulling you taut into a skinnier, lengthier rope-like form. This caught you off guard, until you were hit with an earth-shattering realization, and your world crashed down around you. You fought with every fiber of your being to stop your oblivious aunt, but it was no use at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWielding you like string, Norah proceeded to wedge your body into her sweltering, sweat coated butt crack. Using you like you were nothing more than floss, Norah dragged you up and down the inside of her crack, forcing you deeper into her as she did so. Blushing at the pleasantly ticklish sensation, Norah was none-the-wiser to what she was truly doing as she forced her tiny nephew deep into her meaty ass, forcing your body to soak up every last drop of gross sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was finally done, Norah retrieved you from the depths of darkness, and daintily held you by two pinched fingers. You were soaked to the point of dripping with Norah\u2019s sweat, your body caked with stench and dirt. You were barely hanging on mentally, fighting the urge to pass out. Through your one barely visible eye you glanced at your aunt, begging her to see you. Instead, she merely crinkled her nose and chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did quite a number on you, huh? Goodness!\u201d Norah smiled. \u201cStill, what an amazing rag! I\u2019ll have to use you again sometime!\u201d<br>\r\nWithout another thought, Norah dropped you onto the floor on top of her previously discarded compression shorts. Seconds later, she unhooked her well-worn sports bra and dropped it down over you, squishing you out of sight. A minute later you felt a sense of weightlessness as Norah hefted you and her gross clothes off the ground, and she sauntered out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy, watching TV in the same spot you\u2019d been, gaped at her aunt as she left the room. \u201cAunt Norah! What if Hunter was out here?\u201d Your sister cried with surprise, gesturing to your aunt\u2019s totally naked form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah blinked in confusion, and then gasped. \u201cMy goodness, that totally slipped my mind! I\u2019m sorry.\u201d She blushed in embarrassment. \u201cWhere is Hunter, if I may ask? Haven\u2019t seen him today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister swore under her breath, not meaning to bring you up. \u201cHe\u2019s\u2026uh\u2026still asleep, I think. I haven\u2019t seen him today either.\u201d<br>\r\nNorah puzzled this over in her mind for half a second before nodding, satisfied. \u201cOkay. After I shower, we can just have an aunt and niece day! We\u2019ll let Hunter sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds amazing, Aunt Norah.\u201d Tracy grinned. She then leaned forward eagerly. \u201cHow was that special little rag?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA blessing!\u201d Norah sighed with delight. \u201cNever used such a great rag in my life. I\u2019m throwing it in the wash now with my clothes. If you\u2019ll let me, I\u2019d love to use it more this week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy nodded enthusiastically. \u201cOf course. Put that silly thing through as much as you want to. It is its purpose, after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA normal person might\u2019ve been confused by your sister\u2019s confusingly specific wording, but Norah merely chuckled and shuffled off to the laundry room. Not wasting a second, she tossed you and her workout clothes into the washer, poured in detergent, and went to take her well-deserved shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(FLASHBACK END)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grimaced. \u201cNorah held true to her hopes. After the wash cycle, I was still the exact same rag-shape, just sparkly clean. Tracy found me first, gloated about how good of a rag I was, then kept me pinned under a box all night so I couldn\u2019t reform. Norah used me just as horribly the next morning, and then for every morning after that. Five straight days of wiping her whole body clean of sweat and grime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn, enraptured, was practically whispering. \u201cH-how did you finally stop it all?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed a small smile. \u201cI actually managed to, just barely, wiggle myself partially out from under Tracy\u2019s box the final night. Because of that, I could reform my arm. When Norah went to use me the next morning, I waved frantically to her, she noticed, and then that was it. She let me reform, apologized for what she\u2019d unknowingly done, and treated me to ice cream that night. It worked out in the end, I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour black-haired roommate ran her hand through her hair. \u201cWow, dude. That\u2019s pretty crazy. You have HOW many stories just like this one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHundreds.\u201d You admitted. \u201cSpeaking of which\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSpeaking of which, I honestly can\u2019t oversell it enough how clueless Norah could be with me. I knew at the end of the day she never wanted anything bad for me, but that being said it seemed like she almost never made a single effort to look out for me either. Looking back on it now I can\u2019t find myself being too mad about any of it. She had a good heart deep down, even if that good heart was hidden behind some stupidly big boobs and a completely empty head\u2026\u201d You said to Quinn, chuckling briefly as you parsed through the limitless reserve of insane stories you had involving your aunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn found herself lightening up a bit as well. She seemed to be naturally on guard at first, almost as if she expected any stories about your past to end horribly. You took a moment to wonder why she seemed to think that way, but brushed it off. After all, like you said, you lived to tell these tales so when all was said and done you could only really laugh at these stories yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me just run you through a typical day when it was just me, my sister, and my aunt\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(COMMENCE FLASHBACK)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Tracy, give him to me. I know you two can get really into your cute little prank wars with each other, but eventually you guys gotta learn to live together!\u201d Norah said, leaning over your sister who was at that moment sitting on the couch, preparing to watch a movie. Tracy rolled her eyes and spit you out of her mouth into your aunt\u2019s open palm. As you laid there for a second, your body covered in spit, mangled by the past few minutes of chomping, you mentally critiqued Norah\u2019s usage of the term \u201cprank war\u201d to describe how Tracy treated you. If anything, it was a one-sided prank annihilation at best, and at worst it was a genuine daily effort of Tracy\u2019s to make your life miserable. You were 17 at the time, and Tracy was 16, she had been messing with you to this extent for years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Aunt Norah, can\u2019t we mess with him just a bit!? He gets it so easy most of the time! Plus it\u2019s so funny!\u201d Tracy practically pleaded with Norah. This was a development you never fully got used to when forced to interact with these two. Tracy would not only trick Norah into squashing you flat, eating you, using you as an inanimate object, whatever, but on top of that she would actively try to persuade Norah to openly torture you the same way that she would! Luckily Norah never seemed to be convinced in the least to go to the dark side with Tracy. If she did, you might as well have kissed your entire life goodbye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh honey, I understand how you can find some of the situations your big brother gets in as funny, but you gotta give him a break sometimes!\u201d Norah said, giving her typical half-hearted lesson to her niece, which you knew full well went in one ear and out the other. As she finished her sentence, you felt yourself be lowered down onto the couch beside your sister. Your still-reforming body was incapable of movement, forcing you to glance around up at your sister then back up at your Aunt. Norah turned around to grab a bowl of popcorn and as soon as you saw her tremendous, leggings covered ass  presented in front of you, you knew where this situation was going. Norah resumed talking, while slowly squatting her ass exactly where she had just put you. Once again, your mind was boggled at just how forgetful this woman could be. \u201cJust because he\u2019s so teeny tiny and can get squashed silly by us doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s right. He\u2019s still a person after all, you gotta give him a little respec\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSQUISH<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shit\u201d Norah said. \u201cDid you hear that when I sat down?\u201d Norah continued puzzled, lifting her ass up and slamming it down a few more times. Each time she dropped her weight onto you, you let out a subtle yet still barely audible squish, getting progressively less audible as she flattened you into a 2D form. You were absolutely decimated in an instant without your airheaded aunt realizing a single thing. Your body, now completely compressed underneath the large woman\u2019s rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy looked at her Aunt with her eyes wide open, the corners of her mouth beginning to crack into a huge smile as her ditzy aunt continued to bounce in place, clueless in regard to the torture she was putting you through. In all honesty, Tracy never got used to just how much of a space-cadet Norah could be either. Your sister desperately wanted to play coy and act like she didn\u2019t know what was going on. But seeing you get smashed so easily by the woman who was just defending you won her over in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahahaha! Oh my god, nice one Norah!\u201d Tracy burst into uproarious laughter, unable to contain how hilarious she found the situation to be. Figuring the cat was out of the bag at this point she continued, \u201cI knew you would come around eventually! You really got Hunter good! Respect.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah\u2019s eyes shot open as she realized what she had done. Quickly she stood up and peered over her shoulder. Sadly upon standing up her leggings-clad asscheeks slammed together, sealing you from the waist up into her crack. But luckily for you, your only moderately flattened legs stuck out, looking pretty much like two loose pieces of thread fluttering in the air. Norah thankfully saw the minuscule sight of your lower body sticking out from her comically large rear end, and after a moment of fumbling she grabbed them between her thumb and forefinger, yanking you forcefully back into the light of day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy, meanwhile, was beside herself with laughter. Even though she could never get Norah to willingly torture you like this, seeing how much devastation that the airheaded aunt could create without even realizing it was an endless source of entertainment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s really not funny, Tracy! And don\u2019t say good one like I did this on purpose!\u201d Norah exclaimed. The genuine concern in her voice always prevented you from being too infuriated by the constant mishaps you had with Norah, but nevertheless you never understood why she let Tracy get away with so much. It almost seemed like Norah was too caught up in the situation itself to even think about punishing your sister, despite her outright admitting how much she enjoyed watching you suffer. \u201cOh Hunter, I\u2019m so sorry, here let me put you on the coffee table so you can recover. I honestly feel like I\u2019m so clueless sometimes I don\u2019t know how you put up with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah\u2019s apology struck you as usual, and as your giantess aunt lowered you onto the coffee table, you focused all of your efforts on reforming. Alarmingly, you saw that Norah placed you directly in front of herself, on the edge of the table closest to her. From your flattened perspective, you saw the caring face of your aunt then turn back to Tracy. Acting immediately as if she had moved on from what just happened, Norah said, \u201cOkay let\u2019s press play now that we\u2019re all ready!\u201d One of Norah\u2019s hands reached for the remote, while the other reached into the bowl of popcorn that she had just transferred to her lap mere seconds before. She pressed play on the movie and sat deeper into the couch, compressing the cushion further beneath her sizable weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo more than 30 seconds must have passed by before Norah was entranced in the opening scene of the movie. Without a second thought, she lifted her feet up into the edge of the coffee table, resting just her toes on the edge as if she was gripping it. Of course, this was exactly where she herself had placed you no more than one minute beforehand. And as you saw her massive, calloused toes, each one of them dwarfing your one inch tall, still mangled body, you could only cry. Her right big toe mashed your entire body beneath its weight, before beginning to unconsciously lift and slam into you over and over again. Norah was simply drumming her toes unconsciously as the thrilling opening scene sucked her in. Tracy looked down to see how you were doing, but when she saw Norah\u2019s feet exactly where you were she once again couldn\u2019t control her laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah looked at her niece confused as nothing funny was happening in the movie, before she then followed Tracy\u2019s eyeline right back to her own two feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shoot\u2026\u201d Norah said, lifting her toes up and seeing your minuscule, one inch body, stuck to the underside of her big toe, fluttering in the wind like a defective sticker\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(END FLASHBACK)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoooooly shit, dude. That\u2019s an average day with Norah and Tracy? I can\u2019t even imagine what an especially eventful day would be like. So at best you were accidentally crushed nearly every waking moment, and at worst you were condemned to use as a sweat rag! I\u2019m honestly a bit impressed you turned out so normal after all of that.\u201d Quinn\u2019s response to her story felt good to hear. Sharing these bizarre events with people often felt risky to you, as you always feared that they might assume something must have been wrong with you personally to always be involved in stuff like that. But thankfully Quinn seemed like she was genuinely understanding, even if it was underneath a rather distant and aloof exterior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, that\u2019s pretty much the gist of it. Pretty insane huh? That reminds me\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Well, Norah and Tracy were eating ice cream, and you were nibbling on a single sprinkle which to you as an appropriately sized sugary treat. In all honesty you didn\u2019t mind it. After all it was certainly better than attempting to somehow share a regular size dessert with either your mischievous sister or clueless aunt. Both of those options would have likely ended up with you taking a one way trip through someone\u2019s digestive system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up in response to Tracy\u2019s vague question and immediately saw who she was talking about. Whitney Mason, your dream girl (at least at that point in time) seemed to be taking a break to tie her shoe during a jog. Your eyes shot open with fear. Word must have spread around the school about your failed attempt at asking her out. In reality, it could have gone a lot worse. Being rejected never felt great, but this time you had to admit that she handled it well. You thought back to when you mustered up the confidence to ask her on a date, and she respectfully declined. No squishing, no demeaning, all in all you couldn\u2019t say you were mad at this girl at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you looked back up at your conniving little sister you couldn\u2019t help but worry about how she was going to twist this situation to end up badly for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s that, dear?\u201d Norah responded happily eating the last bite of her dessert, some food still in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to jump at the opportunity to clear the air before Tracy could manipulate the circumstances, but her giant voice overpowered yours effortlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNorah, Hunter tried to ask that girl out on a date last week and she embarrassed him in front of the whole school! She called him a loser and a weakling and lots of other stuff! She said there wasn\u2019t a chance in hell that he could even survive dating her!\u201d Tracy fabricated a lie on the spot, as she was so talented at doing. You desperately wanted to interject once more, but it was far too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately a vindictive passion burned in the eyes of your aunt. Even though she was the cause of nearly constant physical torture for you, there was no questioning the fact that she loved and cared about both you and Tracy. So in her mind, hearing these disrespectful words being thrown around about her favorite nephew set her off to a point of no return. Norah quickly grabbed your body from off of her thigh, pulverizing the sprinkle that you were eating without even noticing she did it, as well as squeezing you carelessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Hunter, I want to have a word with this girl!\u201d You were shaken too and fro in Norah\u2019s tight palm as she strutted aggressively towards this unsuspecting young woman. Tracy, meanwhile reclined on her seat on the bench and prepared to watch the show that she had expertly orchestrated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a moment\u2019s time the two of you reached Whitney, and Norah loudly spoke to the girl, who was just standing up from tying her shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me! Are you the girl who turned down my nephew!?\u201d Norah exclaimed as she held you up and opened up her palm in an attempt to show you to Whitney. Tragically, in her rage she had been gripping you far too tightly, as on Norah\u2019s palm sat a slightly off-colored smear with splotches of blue and white made up of your clothes. Luckily for Norah, Whitney was not as airheaded as she was, and she obviously remembered the slightly awkward interaction you two had previously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my\u2026 I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s nothing personal I jus\u2026\u201d Whitney tried to explain as you felt yourself flush with embarrassment. If your cheeks had been decipherable from the rest of your body at that moment you were sure they would have been beet red. But of course, Norah interjected once more. Far too fired up to listen to this reasonable girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think he\u2019s too weak to survive dating you?!\u201d Norah repeated Tracy\u2019s lie from moments beforehand. Once more you couldn\u2019t believe how gullible your aunt was when it came to Tracy\u2019s made up stories. The embarrassment you felt at that moment was boundless and you were internally screaming at Norah to stop, but of course no sound came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Norah did next took you, Whitney, and possibly even herself off guard, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cIf he\u2019s so weak then why can I do this!?\u201d In a surprisingly deft motion, Norah scraped your flattened form off of her palm, dangling you between the pointer finger and thumb of her other hand, before dragging you through the air, stopping right next to a sight that you could draw from memory at this point: her enormous leggings-clad ass. In the next instant she shoved you firmly between her cheeks, already noticeably sweaty from just a simple outing with you two. You were plunged into the earthy-smelling pressurized darkness of her crack before you could even process what was happening. It would be an overstatement to say that you were used to this at this point in your life, as you never fully got used to the insurmountable assault on your senses of touch and smell whenever she did this. But the added bonus of realizing that your aunt had just shoved you deep into her ass in full view of a girl you had a crush on made the situation exponentially worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as if hearing your thoughts about just how south this interaction had gone, Norah doubled down on her exhibition and grabbed a gargantuan cheek in each hand. She then violently kneaded her buns together, multiplying the pressure tremendously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney looked on in horror at this older woman, aggressively smashing her ass cheeks together in an effort to make some sort of point that she didn\u2019t understand. In all honesty she felt bad for you. Even though she didn\u2019t have romantic feelings for you, she wasn\u2019t a bad person by any means, and seeing any tiny guy go through this level of torture wasn\u2019t something she was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more moments passed of this ludicrous spectacle before finally Norah reached back between her cheeks to fish you out. She fumbled around with her fingers for a moment, slamming into you body repeatedly, squishing you further into the cleft of her ass. But unfortunately for her, the aggressive technique with which she mashed your body up had gotten you plastered to a degree that would typically take hours of confinement to reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shoot shoot shoot\u2026\u201d she whispered quietly to herself, now trying to look over her shoulder at her own ass. Unsurprisingly, her rear was far too big and you were far too deep in it to be seen. Her initial plan was to pull you out and demonstrate how tough you were by showing that you could handle such a beating. But of course, her plan backfired. Thinking on her feet for a moment, Norah quickly turned around and grabbed a cheek in each hand, spreading them out as she bent over slightly. Whitney\u2019s eyes opened even wider with equal parts empathy and disgust as she saw your flattened, tan splotch of a body standing out clearly from the black abyss of the fabric of Norah\u2019s leggings. Now turning over her shoulder once again, Norah tried to keep her plan going, \u201cSee, he\u2019s fine! I mean, he\u2019s a little stuck but he\u2019s completely fine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the bench that you desperately wished you two had never left, Tracy was absolutely doubled over with laughter. Tears were streaming down her face as she watched the absurd display that Norah put on, and put you through. You, meanwhile, had somehow maintained your sense of sight enough to see the beautiful face of your crush with the never-ending walls of Norah\u2019s ass in your periphery. You never imagined in a million years that you would see Whitney\u2019s face practically framed by black leggings and butt cheeks, but the moment that you did you knew that any shot you had with her was long gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(END FLASHBACK)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, now that\u2019s rough. I take it she didn\u2019t go out with you after that? Or does she like to see potential boyfriends while they\u2019re crushed in between their aunt\u2019s ass cheeks?\u201d Quinn said with the dry wit that you were beginning to like more and more as you talked to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 no. Safe to say I didn\u2019t have much luck with girls of any kind as long as either Tracy and or Norah had something to do about it.\u201d You retorted, laughing a bit at the absurdity of that memory, even though it was pretty horrifically embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn cracked the slightest of smiles as she kept talking, \u201cAlright well...</span></div></div>",

I can\u2019t begin to imagine that she was very good at her job.\u201d Quinn said bemused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, well honestly it would depend on who you were asking. According to me? Of course not. But unfortunately for many of my employers I was the ideal employee. After all, even if I disagreed with something Norah had signed me up for, I still felt like I owed it to her and whoever hired me to at least try my best.\u201d You responded. Quinn raised her eyebrows, impressed slightly by your honorable attitude towards what must have been terrible situations for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay I\u2019ll start you off with one of the more normal ones to ease you into this whole chapter of my life\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(BEGIN FLASHBACK)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDirector of Sales?! Like a real job?!\u201d You said in an exasperated tone up to Norah, you currently standing on the center console of the giantess\u2019s car as she drove you to your first day. You couldn\u2019t believe your ears when you heard the job that your aunt was offering you at that moment. At this point in time you were 19 years old and had just finished your first year of college. In all honesty you were looking into actual internships as opposed to spending another summer doing random odd jobs with Norah. But for once it seemed like she had brought you a real opportunity! You continued, \u201cJust regular sales, right? I\u2019m not going to be selling myself as a towel or clothing or an insole or something insane like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah cocked one eyebrow in confusion. \u201cOf course not! I\u2019m really sorry about some misunderstandings for jobs in the past but this one is legit! The current director is going on an impromptu month long vacation for some reason! He said he desperately needed it and the company wanted someone to fill in! I know you think you\u2019re underqualified but the listing specifically said that people of any experience could fill the role! So consider this one as payback for helping you out so much with jobs in the past!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah\u2019s words of encouragement actually encouraged you for once. And considering that you had now spent more than 5 minutes without being squished by her in one way or another you actually felt enthusiasm towards this opportunity. You wondered briefly why the current director had decided to go on vacation all of the sudden, but you quickly brushed that thought aside as the two of you pulled into the parking lot. Looking out the front windshield you saw a towering skyscraper looming above you. It looked classy and professional, essentially the opposite of how most of your previous stints with Norah had gone. Quickly Norah parked the car, shot you a confident smile, and grabbed you rather gently for once as the two of you headed towards the front doors of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the direction of the desk attendant and then a subsequent lengthy elevator ride, the doors finally opened onto one of the top floors of the building! The space was rather open, with only another set of large doors separating what seemed to be a large private office from the waiting room you were currently in. To your side seemed to be a smaller desk, littered with papers and an overall sense of messiness that the rest of the building did not exude. Moreover, a chair seemed to be pulled out and left askew behind the desk, almost as if someone had left mere moments before. Norah simply walked ahead, opening the double doors into an elegantly furnished private office. You fully expected to see some bigshot lady executive sitting in that room, waiting to greet you. But when you two scanned the room, both of your eyes landed on a tiny man, just like you, only a fair bit older and wearing what looked like an expensive suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh you must be my replacement! Hunter, was it? Please miss you can place him on the desk with me, I\u2019ll give him a quick prep session then I\u2019ll be headed to Barbados!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing! Norah said, somehow still maintaining an air of composure and competence that you had rarely seen from the woman in your life. If this was any other moment that you had been around Norah then you would have already been squashed flat by now, and the other tiny guy wouldn\u2019t have stated three dimensional for much longer either. She took a few steps forward and deposited you on the desk, next to the sharp dressed guy, before speaking again. \u201cI actually have to run, I\u2019m meeting my sister for an exercise class. Good luck Hunter!\u201d She said as she quickly turned around and walked out of the room. You saw the man beside you look intently at Norah\u2019s massive backside as she strutted out of the room, clearly not knowing the immeasurable amount of torture that it could put out. As your aunt closed the doors behind her, it was just you and the executive standing next to each other. Immediately a new sense of nervousness hit you. Not the typical nerves about getting squished or used in one way or another, but an actually typical nervousness that came with getting hired for a job you were severely underqualified for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were about to ask him any sort of question about the actual work you would be doing, the chipper attitude with which he addressed you and Norah moments before faded in an instant as his shoulders slumped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen up, kid. Just try your best with the actual work, I don\u2019t care if you make a single sale while I\u2019m gone. If you do, hurray, if you don\u2019t who gives a shit. I just need a break from that girl\u2026 that goddamned idiot.\u201d He said, confusing you greatly, before turning and looking you dead in the eyes. The grave look on his face honestly scared you as he continued, \u201cMy new assistant, Grace, is without exaggeration, the most oblivious airhead I have ever dealt with in my entire life. And I know what you\u2019re thinking already, but I can\u2019t fire her because she\u2019s the daughter of one of my lifelong friends\u2026 I used to love this job, but she makes it a living hell. I can\u2019t get through a single workday in one piece. I just need a break from it all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy ended his monologue and you didn\u2019t know what to say. He had an assistant after all, could her being a little forgetful or dumb really be that bad? Once again you were about to ask him more about both the job and now this wildcard girl but just then the door swung open! And through those doors walked what could only be described as an angel come to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman was strikingly tall, first of all, likely standing around 5\u201910\u201d if not taller. She had feathered long blonde hair that was parted down the center, cascading and framing her face perfectly. On that face was a pair of oversized, thick rimmed glasses that almost looked fake, like a nerd costume put on by the most popular girl in a cheesy movie. Her face was slender, with a radiant white smile shining through. Your eyes then practically popped open as your sight was drawn to her body. She was wearing a tight white button down shirt, with said buttons holding on for dear life behind the tremendous breasts that threatened their integrity. The shirt was tucked into a decidedly not-safe-for-work length black pencil skirt that showed off nearly all of her long, tanned legs. Not to mention an oversized yet firm ass that you could quite literally see from the front. Finally, a pair of open toed black heels added an extra three inches of unnecessary height to the woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were flabbergasted. While a few women in your life had her assets beat in terms of sheer size, such as Norah, your mother Helen, and now your new roommate Quinn. This woman\u2019s ratio of breasts and butt to waist was on another level. For all intents and purposes, she looked like a porn star more than an office assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Mister Sebastian!\u201d She chirped giddily as she walked into the room, and you realized up until that moment that you hadn\u2019t even received his name either. You waited a brief second for either her to greet you or Sebastian to introduce you, but before either of those things could happen you saw the large coffee cup that Grace was holding head straight for your position before slamming on top of your body, squishing you flat onto the desk as well as burning you beneath warm cardboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrace! Didn\u2019t I tell you to get me a tiny size cup from downstairs? Also pick up that cup right now my replacement is under it!\u201d Grace\u2019s eyes widened with surprise as she took a moment to process even this simplest of requests, before finally lifting the coffee cup to reveal your now reddened, slightly twitching form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhmygosh I\u2019m so sorry! Please forgive me I didn\u2019t mean to!\u201d The goddess of a woman bent down and scooped you up briefly, blowing air over your body in an attempt to cool you like some sort of fresh pastry or something. To be honest you quickly forgot about the airhead\u2019s blunder, as the sight of her gorgeous face trying to help you overwhelmed your senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrace, his name is Hunter, treat him with the same respect that you treat me with until I get back. Got it?\u201d Grace simply turned and looked between you two before smiling for a moment. \u201cAlso I have to get out of here rather quickly so if you don\u2019t mind getting me on that elevator I can be on my way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace looked back at the elevator she came up in, the doors just starting to close from when she stepped off less than a minute ago. \u201cOh, okay I got it!\u201d She said in an instant, dropping you about a foot carelessly onto the desk before scooping up your predecessor in her hands. In a move that both shocked and amazed you, Grace reached her hand back and hurled Sebastian as hard as she could down the hall and into the elevator doors just before they closed! You could only watch as he flattened immediately against the back wall before fluttering down to the ground like a piece of paper. You prayed that nobody else in the building would be getting on that elevator before he reached the ground floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNailed it!\u201d She said happily as she turned back to you and enchanted you with her smile again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does your \u201cnormal\u201d job go with this ditz of an assistant?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAlright well, did you ever attempt to get Tracy back for these pranks?\u201d Quinn asked with interest. \u201cI sure hope you didn\u2019t just take it all without fighting back.\u201d The black-haired giantess paused for a moment. \u201cLet me rephrase that. Makes me sound like I love violence. I just mean\u2026did you ever try to give her a taste of her own medicine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded without hesitation. \u201cOh sure, tons of times.\u201d Quinn\u2019s eyebrows raised at that, and you hastily backtracked. \u201cI-I mean, I was young, and she was young. Of course we weren\u2019t mature enough to hold back. So yeah, I managed to prank her on several occasions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Can you tell me about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced. \u201cSure\u2026but the stories really aren\u2019t much different from what I\u2019ve already talked about. See, even if I could get the drop on Tracy, figuratively speaking, it would never last long. Tracy was a cruel genius when it came to tormenting me, and it\u2019d take her seconds at most to turn my prank right back around against me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn huffed a laugh. \u201cSounds rough dude\u2026BUT\u2026I am still interested, if you\u2019re willing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged. \u201cWhy not? This is fun, to let all this out. Here\u2019s a story I just remembered\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(FLASHBACK BEGIN)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in seventh grade, and Tracy was in sixth grade (making you 12 and Tracy 11). The two of you attended Templeton Secondary School, which was a massive and sprawling school complex that comprised both middle and high schools into one giant building. This meant that students from sixth grade to twelfth grade all stayed under one roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy had made a promise to you the night before. Right as you were going to head to sleep, Tracy snuck into your room and explained that the chairs in her first period class had recently been replaced by uncomfortable plastic seats. Tracy promised she\u2019d steal you and use you as a squishy seat covering all day so that she\u2019d be more comfy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of that, a very Tracy-like idea popped into your mind, and you set to work. Sneaking into your mother\u2019s room, you managed to steal a tiny little sewing needle, only about half an inch long. You then hid the needle in your backpack, and went back to bed. Tracy was insistent on using you as a cushy seat, you\u2019d give her a stabby little surprise in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, Tracy put on a good show of taking you carefully to school in front of your mom. She even refrained from squishing you all the way through the bus ride to Templeton, and carried you dutifully to the hallway juncture where she would normally set you down. However, owing to her promise, Tracy instead clenched her fist around you and skipped off to her first-period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the classroom, Tracy said good morning to her homeroom teacher, Miss Carlisle. Miss Carlisle, a peppy thirty-year old woman, was known throughout Templeton for her compassion, tough-but-fair discipline, and alluring good looks. Though she dressed in modest skirts and blouses, Miss Carlisle\u2019s pronounced curves were still accentuated, and it was clear that she was oblivious to how many stares she drew from male and female students alike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass was about to begin, so Tracy scurried over to her seat as Miss Carlisle rose from her desk to close the door. Making sure no one was looking, Tracy sneered at you and then dropped you from where she held you onto her chair. The height of the fall squished you a fair bit, and you fumbled to pull the needle from your backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yanked the needle from your backpack and thrust it up into the air, grinning as you saw Tracy had already turned her back to you. As her petite frame descended down onto you, you were filled with a sense of victory that you hadn\u2019t felt in a long time. Even as Tracy\u2019s butt made contact and crushed you flat, you were still happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantaneously, Tracy let out a yelp and bolted upright, launching out of her seat. As she did so, she banged her knee onto her desk, spilling her papers onto the floor. On top of that, Miss Carlisle had been in the middle of speaking, and her speech was interrupted by Tracy\u2019s outburst. All eyes in the room turned on her, and her face flushed as red as a ripe tomato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Carlisle quirked her mouth. \u201cTracy? Some reason for crying out, dear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister hunched her shoulders inward, the perfect picture of ashamed embarrassment. \u201cI-I sat on something\u2026I think.\u201d She replied, her voice small and wavering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly sympathetic, Miss Carlisle offered her a gentle smile. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, sweetheart. Just don\u2019t interrupt again, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes Miss Carlisle.\u201d Tracy stammered, and a few students around her chuckled. Wishing she could curl up and cry, Tracy finally looked down to see what she\u2019d ended up sitting on, and spotted a tan glob and a miniscule needle. Though initially confused, she finally recognized what she was looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d never forget the expression she made at that moment, a look of such primal fury and promise of revenge that your cocky victory drained up into paralyzing fear in an instant. Your blood ran even colder as Tracy\u2019s mouth curled into a sadistic smile, and you could see the gears of cruelty turning in her head. It was obvious you\u2019d screwed up in trying to one-up her at her own game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill too crushed to move, you were helpless as Tracy scooped you and the needle up into her hand. Without any other student seeing what she\u2019d done, Tracy slipped you into her tight jean pocket, keeping you flat and secure. She then settled into her seat, willed her embarrassment to go away, and allowed the rest of the class to pass like normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sprung her revenge on you when the period ended. After this many weeks of school, Tracy had Miss Carlisle\u2019s daily routine memorized. After first period, Miss Carlisle always went to the bathroom before returning to teach second period. On top of that, Tracy had her as a teacher for two periods in a row. This allowed her the perfect opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Carlisle and the other students left the room, and when the coast was clear, Tracy dashed up to her teacher\u2019s desk and around to the plush comfy chair Miss Carlisle had to herself. Retrieving you from her pocket, she slapped you down onto the chair\u2019s cushion, facing up, and then stuck the needle into your mangled hands, forcing you to hold it straight up. Tracy\u2019s intent for you became clear all together, and you fought madly to wiggle and squirm free, but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour demonic sister merely blew you a mock kiss and then strolled away, at the same moment Miss Carlisle returned from the bathroom. Sparing a smile at Tracy, the giantess teacher was looking anywhere but down at her chair, and soon she was standing right above you. Your twelve-year-old brain was momentarily overwhelmed by peering up your curvy teacher\u2019s skirt, but as she began to sit, you went straight back to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Carlisle plopped into her seat, the needle did its job, and she hopped right back up with a startled yelp. Glancing down at her chair, she frowned in confusion at the mushed blob and tiny needle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing her chance, Tracy piped up. \u201cOh no! Miss Carlisle! Did he get you too?\u201d She asked with feigned concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher frowned, looked at Tracy, then back at you. Recognition shown in her eyes. \u201cHunter Woods? Is that you?\u201d She flicked the needle aside, then put her hands on her hips. \u201cYoung man! I can\u2019t believe you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister fought her smile down. \u201cIt was him who pricked me earlier. I didn\u2019t say anything, because I know that he can just be a troublemaker from time to time. But now that he\u2019s done it twice\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe definitely needs discipline.\u201d Miss Carlisle nodded sagely, and Tracy filled with glee. \u201cNow, young man, I understand kids will be kids, but pricking your teacher with a needle cannot go unpunished. One needs to learn their lesson and act more mature, whether they are tiny or not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntensely curious, but trying not to be conspicuous, Tracy spoke up tentatively. \u201cWhat are you going to do to him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Carlisle winked at Tracy. \u201cWell, he\u2019s already on my chair. I figure staying there for a class period is punishment enough.\u201d She braced herself. \u201cOf course, it is still MY chair too, so\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, Miss Carlisle sat again, and her prodigious posterior slammed onto your tiny body, decimating you. With a small wiggle, the giantess teacher got a bit more comfortable, and also smeared you beneath her shapely booty. You groaned internally as your body flattened out more and more from the pressure, the heat already rising to unbearable levels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHardly keeping her Cheshire grin in check, Tracy slipped back to her seat, supremely satisfied that she\u2019d put you in your place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(FLASHBACK END)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that did come right back on you, didn\u2019t it?\u201d Quinn said with a light chuckle. You couldn\u2019t help but also laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it through, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d You shook your head. \u201cIt didn\u2019t even stop there, really. Thanks to some more manipulation from Tracy, Miss Carlisle totally forgot about me stuck under her butt, and stayed sitting on me all day. And the next day. And the day after that. It was day four of being pounded under her butt that she happened to spot me by chance. She apologized profusely and promised to give me an A on the upcoming test if I didn\u2019t tell my mom about what she\u2019d unintentionally done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn stretched her arms and yawned. \u201cYeesh. Tracy was a little menace, that\u2019s for sure. I really hope she\u2019s improved like you say she has.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \u201cOh, she has, seriously. She\u2019s such a great and supportive friend now. But since we\u2019re talking about past Tracy\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"This reminds me of another time I tried to get back at Tracy!\" You said pounding a fist into your open palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn rolled her eyes dramatically before replying, \"If that last story reminded you of something, I doubt this one has a happier ending...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a nervous laugh before scratching the back of your head, \"Yeah...I guess not, but it was really good in theory!\" You began tapping your chin in an attempt to recall how you came up with the brilliant plan to begin with. \"Let's see...it all started with Tracy watching one of her dumb shows...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Flashback Start)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a sweltering summer afternoon just after you had finished up your 9th grade and you and Tracy had seemingly called a ceasefire in order to peacefully beat the heat inside. With school out and hardly anything else going on on this drab day, the both of you had found yourselves situated in front of the TV passing the time. Just because you weren't at each other's throats with trying to torment each other didn't mean Tracy didn't have the upper hand though. When Tracy wanted the TV, and your mom was out of town, that meant Tracy got to pick what you watched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis afternoon was unfortunately one of those times as your mom had, as per usual, left Norah to watch after you two while she attended to business abroad. Besides being stepped on when Norah first arrived though, you'd thankfully managed to stay out of her crushing embrace. You weren't sure how long it would be until Tracy attempted to change that, but as long as she was kept even mildly entertained you figured you didn't have too much to worry about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting atop the arm rest, your job was to keep that entertainment in tact. When Tracy wanted the volume up, you were to hop right onto the remote and turn it up. If she wanted the channel changed, you'd better be on it, pronto. You'd tried resisting her commands in the past, but that resulted in Tracy merely lifting up the remote, and letting it leisurely fall right onto you, easily smothering your one-inch form and keeping it planted until she picked the remote up again. This was, without saying, only when she was being efficient in her taking care of you. God forbid she was feeling especially mischievous, or you may end up down on the floor between her restlessly playful feet or even worse, crushed underneath her butt where you wouldn't be able to see or hear the TV at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo this meant that today was another day of dutifully manning the remote while Tracy flipped, or had you flip, through channels. Nothing seemed to keep her attention long, or maybe she just loved watching you scramble across the wide remote. Finally settling on a lame sitcom she adored, and you despised, you took a moment to rest as Tracy sipped on a soda and let out a satisfied \"ah\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday's antics on the show were as cheesy as ever, with one of the side characters returning from her teaching job with a seat cushion glued to her backside. She lamented on that one of her damned students had \"accidentally\" left a glob of glue on her chair and she was none the wiser when she sat down. This resulted in Tracy nearly chocking on her drink as soda nearly came out of her nose. You rolled her eyes at how easily amused she was, even for her age, when a light bulb went off in your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day the stars seemed to align perfectly. Norah had just belted out that she was going to run, literally you assumed as she usually did, to the store to grab some things for the both of you, and Tracy was up in her room where she had been most of the day. This was the perfect set-up you needed to get some surprise payback on your devilish little sis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite the hassle, but you had actually managed to lug a tiny, single use, bottle of super glue up onto the family couch. The plan was so simple. Pour every last bit of the glue out onto the cushion, wait for Tracy to inevitably come down and take a seat, and then laugh as she's either glued to the whole couch, or at the very least trapped with a cushion attached to her butt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were already trembling with excitement, imagining the flush red look of embarrassment and rage on her face when she realizes shes been had by her little bug-brother. Without wasting another second, you hastily poured out the gray goopy fluid until it formed a dense puddle. Needing to dispose of the evidence, you pushed the empty bottle from the ledge of the couch, hoping it would roll itself under, before taking a step back to admire your handiwork when...*splish*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down only to see your right foot thoroughly entrenched in the thick liquid. You grabbed at your knee in an attempt to pull your leg free but only succeeded in knocking yourself off balance as you fell backwards. Trying to do a sit-up proved futile and soon you threw your arms down in frustration...only for them to get locked in the hazy goop as well. You strained your eyes to see your whole body was covered in the dense gray glue, and you knew immediately your plan had been a catastrophic failure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn awful and anxiety inducing thirty minutes passed with your body slowly wearing itself out as you struggled against your overwhelming powerful prison. Why did you have to use the damn super glue? Regular glue would've gotten the job done, and you probably would've never gotten into this mess. Just as your sorrow reached it peak, it transformed into fear as the ground shook as the only person it could be pranced down the stairs. You had a mix of terror and excitement as you wondered if your plan would at least work, but you got your answer when Tracy arrived at the couch and stepped on something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! What the hell was that?\" Tracy asked aloud with definite annoyance. Grabbing the bottle that she had totally flattened under her pink-socked foot, Tracy read the label slowly to herself in a whisper before looking around. You meekly let out a \"Hey, Trace...\" as her eyes met yours and her lips warped into a wicked smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. My. God. Don't tell me. Please don't tell me you really thought you could prank me or something with this glue,\" Tracy's mouth was hanging open in a mix of shock and joy at your hilarious failure. The pitiful pout on your face was all the answer she needed, \"Oh, you DID! And you got the idea from the show yesterday didn't you! OH that is just too good!\" Tracy wiped a tear from her eye as she bounced evilly above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, it was a dumb idea, but at least it was funny. Can't you check the label and try and get me out of here? I'm sorry...\" You tried to plead but you weren't sure your words were registering at all as Tracy's face went red in a totally opposite way of what you had intended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh not a chance, Hunter. You even used a gray glue on our gray couch! You're such a dope! I can barely see your little face down there!\" Tracy did want to check out the label, just to see if there was anything else she could torment you with. And as usual, luck was right on her side as her face somehow beamed even brighter. \"Oh, get this. I bet you didn't even read the back where it lists the solvent. SALIVA! HAH! That is too perfect! Just right for a gross bug like you, though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy loomed her face until it was a centimeter from your own. Each word she spoke down to you bathed you in a thick smog of her breath. \"I bet you'd kill for me to just let a drop of spit slide down my tongue onto you? Wouldn't you, little Hunter?\" Her lips were all consuming in your vision and you winced as their plump exterior parted to allow her tongue to hang loose over your helpless body. \"Well, go ahead, beg to be set free. BEG me to drool <i>all over</i> your pathetic body!\" Tracy was playfully hanging her tongue down over you and you hated how it truly was taunting you as a savior. Her hot breath's sultry and overpowering in their presence, forcing you to breath in her humid air as it left moisture on your face and dampened your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NEVER!\" You cried out, hoping it wasn't your last word. Tracy simply closed her mouth, a bit surprised, and retreated her face from your own, returning the air to a decent temperature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. Fine. Suit yourself, little bro. Oh but one last thing before I leave you as a couch stain...\" Tracy squeezed the bottle in her grip with fervor, allowing one minuscule drop to fly loose, right onto your poor exposed mouth. \"There. Now you can't free yourself and no one has to listen to your whiney voice anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the front door flew open, and in stumbled Norah, plopping her bags down on the ground and wiping fresh sweat from her brow. Tracy quickly slid the bottle, the only evidence of your location, into her pocket. \"Would you mind unloading these, dear? I'm <i>exhausted</i>!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Aunt Norah!\" Tracy winked at you before skipping away cutely and joining Norah in grabbing the bags. \"Why don't you just go rest on the couch? I think that movie you love is starting soon!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really?! Thanks, honey, I appreciate it!\" Norah slid off her beat-up running shoes before walking on over to the couch. The squelching sound her socked feet were making on the hardwood floor was making you wince as you worried you knew what was coming next. You fought with renewed vigor but the glue, and Tracy's fresh addition, was way too strong. You gulped as you wondered if you should have taken Tracy's offer after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat appeared in your vision next is what truly made your heart sink. It was none other than Norah's booty of course, a sight you recognized better than the palm of your own hand, but it was what was plastered on it that made your blood cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray spandex. Norah's gigantic, plump and juicy rear was covered in a visibly damp layer of gray leggings. You peered down and saw the still wet glue all over yourself and prayed for any kind of mercy. But all you received was the muggy and hot embrace of Norah's rear as she got comfy in the coincidental spot you happened to be.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite seeming quite tired a half hour ago, Quinn was right up in your face, her giant ass on the edge of her seat waiting to find out what happened next. \"So? Did Norah stop or did she sit on the glue...I mean you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a step back, enjoying the fact she was captivated but still needing your space to breathe. \"I'm getting there! But yes let's just say she sat on the glue...and me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn's eyes bulged open, thoroughly entertained but also sympathetic, \"And? Did your plan work?! Was she attached to the couch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down at your feet in embarrassment, \"Well...not exactly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Flashback Resume)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah fell back onto the couch, thoroughly exhausted from running the five miles to the neighborhood grocer and then walking the bags all the way back. She was proud of her little workout, but definitely began to regret it when the summer heat started to make her sweat profusely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her haste to get off her feet, Norah didn't spare a glance at the seat below, not that she usually did anyways. With an audible gust of air flying out from beneath her, Norah slammed down onto your defenseless body, your struggles against your glue muzzle failing to produce a peep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPropping her feet on the coffee table, Norah let all her weight rest firmly on her ass as she grabbed for the remote and flipped to look for a movie she adored. Norah felt a small urge to hit the shower first as her womanly body odor was definitely noticeable, and she didn't want to gross up the house by dripping sweat all over the furniture. But before she could make up her mind, her air headed attention span came into play as she saw what was on the TV. \"Oh you were right, honey! I do love this film!\"  Filled with glee, Norah wiggled her booty a bit just to settle in and turned the volume up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the glue you were trapped in gush against Norah's gray leggings-clad butt, either that or it was the sweat she had worked up pouring out of her crack as Norah's hips expanded when she bent over to sit. You cursed yourself for trying this plan in the first place, but mostly you cursed Tracy for leaving you to be sat on by Norah, especially since she knew how bad Norah's swamp ass was! Of course you had to lay the glue down dead-center on the couch cushion as well, so you were forced right up onto Norah's crack and subjected to all the lovely odor and pressure that accompanied it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too, Norah! Mind if I join you?\" Tracy had skipped back into the room, finished with her unloading and a malicious glint in her eye as she noticed where Norah had planted herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! I'd love that!\" Norah was elated to bond a bit with the usually distant Tracy, \"Just sit on the other end of the couch, I don't want you to have to smell what the summer heat does to me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy laughed at Norah before thinking of a way to gain brownie points and torment you at the same time, \"Oh, no problem. Besides, you don't smell at all! Could probably even wear that outfit again before it needs a wash!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah raised her eyebrows in surprise but trusted her angelic niece instantly. \"You think? If you say so...\" Tracy crinkled her cute nose a bit against the smell of Norah's salty sweat, but it was sooo worth it knowing how close you were to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movie lasted a whole two hours before the credits ran. You prayed Norah would get up before the glue managed to dry but when she tried to get a sports drink from the fridge, Tracy jumped up to get it for her. This led to Norah simply becoming more grateful to have such a great niece, and her thoughts on you were completely out of mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the movie had totally concluded however, Norah rose from the couch. You felt your body pull and you wondered how the results of your plan were finally going to work out. It would be some small conciliation if Norah was stuck to the couch, and maybe you'd even get discovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Norah stood, she felt a small bit of sticky resistance, but as her huge ass rose it easily won the tug of war and snapped the glue free from the couch cushion. Now you were spread out hugging the back of Norah's booty, with a firm layer of gray glue holding you in place. Not to mention due to your perfect placement of the glue, you were right in Norah's crack area, and you gulped knowing when Norah started walking, you'd be in for some rough grinding if this pair of tights was anything like her others that chewed her crack into a tight wedgie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Did I sit in something?\" You felt Norah's hand swiping at your back, your face still hugging tight against her butt. Feeling a rough patch on her butt, Norah continued scratching at the weird tiny bump, trying to decipher what it was. \"Do you see anything, Tracy?\" Norah slightly bent over, allowing Tracy full view of your prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy got a good look at you, or rather, the gray outline your body had made on the back of her aunt's pants. She couldn't help but snicker as she saw the definitive sweat stains that lined straight down Norah's crack, with your body fitting right in the center. \"Oh, I don't know, it doesn't look like anything to me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah wasn't fully satisfied, but shrugged it off anyways. \"Alright, dear. Probably just one of Hunter's little jokes don't you think?\" Tracy immediately agreed with a hearty laugh, and with that Norah made her way up the stairs to finally get that shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeeling your leggings off her taut rear, you could only hear Norah's voice as she examined them. \"Well, Tracy did say they're good for another wear...\" Norah said, uncaringly letting them fall to the floor in a sweaty heap and kicking them aside with her foot as she walked her naked body off to get a nice hot and relaxing shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were frozen solid in your glue prison, the only thing you could feel being the harsh glue on your back and the sickly damp feeling of fabric, still tainted with the potent scent of their owner. You heard Norah speaking out a few times, and of course felt her powerful steps around the room, but for the most part you simply laid in silence, in fear, or slept. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two days passed and finally Norah picked up the leggings that housed you. It was another bright and beautiful day and Norah couldn't think of anything she'd rather do than get outside on the patio and go through some yoga poses. You winced as you felt the fibers you were glued to stretch to the point of tearing, your flattened body going with it, as Norah pulled you over her <i>gargantuan </i>rear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs energetic and aloof as ever, Norah bounced her way down the stairs and outside, you bouncing right along with her, each step causing her cheeks to rub against you affectionately, pushing you deeper and deeper into your aunt's cavernous crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah burst onto the patio, taking in the heat and basking in the suns warmth as she smiled and flayed her yoga mat out. It was another beautiful day, and that meant another great day of exercise and relaxation with her loving niece and nephew. Norah actually pondered where you were for a moment, when with perfect timing Tracy poked her head outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting some rays, Norah?\" She cheerily called, breaking Norah from her thought and having her turn to address her niece. Tracy managed to notice Norah was wearing a familiar pair of gray tights, and she knew you were totally still affixed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You betcha! Care to join me, or do you think Hunter might?\" Norah responded, always eager to include anyone who wanted in on her daily yoga practices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm I'll pass today, and I think Hunter's still asleep. I'm sure he'd have <b>LOVED </b>to though!\" Tracy giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah had a slight frown before flipping it right back into her optimistic self. \"Alright, suit yourself! And don't worry about him, I'll get him to myself one of these days!\" Norah and Tracy shared a laugh before Tracy went back inside. The irony of her statement was clear to everyone but herself, as you were truly all Norah's at this exact moment and most of the time she was around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Norah lunged into her first pose, she took a deep breath and savored the bright sun basking her in it's warmth and causing her to begin to bead up already. You were also beading up, and basking in warmth, but conversely were trapped in complete <b>darkness</b>. Norah's hugging cheeks kept a firm hold of you as she kept her glutes flexed to maintain balance, ensuring not a single bit of sunlight reached you, only Norah's body heat which radiated at a force that to you was quite a bit more intense than sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point, when Norah took a seat on her mat, she felt that same strange bump in her rear. She tried her hardest to grind it away, but that didn't seem to work at all. These leggings were one of her favorites, she thought they really complimented her curves, and she was getting ticked off at the idea they had a blemish. Not for a second did the thought the bump was her little nephew cross her mind, but she was just annoyed her pants might be ruined!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a typical sweaty and fulfilling yoga sesh in the sun, Norah made her way inside and stripped her pants off. Honestly she was eager to finally see what the heck was prodding her ass the whole time, and when she got a close look, she was shocked. The color was the exact same, but the texture was off, and that made her peer further to see the minuscule bit of your head that wasn't coated in glue, sticking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, Hunter is that you? How on Earth did you get in the bump ruining my favorite leggings?!\" You were ecstatic Norah was talking to you, but frustrated with her clearly mistaken wording. \"What is this gunk anyways? Some kind of glue?\" Norah was actually getting annoyed, not realizing the absolute torment she had put you through with her ass on this over-worn, sweaty pair of leggings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the commotion, Tracy poked her meddling head in, seeing Norah staring down at her leggings and realizing the gig is up. \"What's up?\" Tracy casually asked, feigning innocence as usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your brother's glued onto the bottom of my leggings!\" Norah lamented, \"How could this have happened? And on my favoritest leggings no less!\" Norah asked half expecting you to answer and half just complaining aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, Hunter is doing this again?\" Tracy spoke pinching her temple with her fingers. Norah's statement had just given her an amazing idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing what? He's done this before?!\" Norah asked totally bewildered but glad Tracy had some answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yea, he thinks it's a funny prank to get glue on people's clothes and ruin them. He always accidentally gets stuck though. It's pretty funny how he always messes it up.\" Tracy lied straight through her teeth, knowing Norah wouldn't question it for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Is this true, Hunter? I can't believe you! I've been nothing but nice to you these past two weeks and this is how you repay me?\" Norah was tapping her foot angrily before she sheepishly had a realization. \"Well...besides stepping on you and taking you running...but that was an accident! And besides, <i><b>I</b></i> found you didn't I?\" Tracy shot Norah a disapproving look causing her to add in a whisper, \"<i>A few days later...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you going to do with your leggings now? I bet they're not too comfy anymore\" Tracy asked, bringing attention away from you and more so to the all important leggings. You'd roll your eyes if you could. Instead you were flabbergasted at the conversation unfolding. As if you'd attach yourself to the hell that was Norah's gross rear on purpose!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, I don't know. Is there any way to get the glue off? I can barely feel it, but it's still a pain.\" Norah sighed, hoping her helpful niece would have an answer since she's dealt with Hunter's <i>troublesome </i>nature in the past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy merely shrugged. \"Beats me, I bet Mom knows. You could ask her when she gets back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah agreed, satisfied she'd get her answer tomorrow when her sister returned. With that she dropped the leggings to the floor and pulled them right back around her hefty rear. \"Well alright, I hope you're right and she does know, because I'm not about to give up a pair of <i>sexy</i> leggings!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to scream \"WHAT ABOUT ME?!\" but it seemed Tracy beat you to it, asking, in a much less caring way, \"Wait, you're going to keep wearing them? What about Hunter? Is this your way of punishing him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah clicked her tongue disapprovingly before replying, \"No, dear. It's not my place to punish the little guy, even if he wronged me this time. Mostly right now I just want to make sure he doesn't get lonely all alone up here. Not to mention we both know my forgetful nature. This is the least I can do to make sure we don't lose him! He may have been a tiny jerk but that doesn't mean I don't still love him.\" Norah gave her rear an affectionate rub, hoping her message passed through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart would've been warmed by Norah's thoughtfulness, but instead you were too distracted by the potent odor that clung to your prison. Did this mean she wasn't going to wash you? And she was going to keep wearing you? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus, they're still my favorite!\" As usual Norah's good intentions combined with her selfish ones spelled doom for you as the ladies went about their day, you kept with Norah, or rather her booty, all day. Tracy even opted to ask Norah to show her some yoga moves, just so Norah would work up an extra sweat while she had you in her possession. After an evening run, you'd truly faded from Norah's mind entirely, as predicted. As she leaped into bed, she couldn't even feel the formerly bothersome bump on her ass, her powerful butt and exercise routine must have ground it to dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy smiled as she walked into the kitchen the next morning, seeing the same gray leggings adorned by her curvy redheaded aunt. \"Sleep well, auntie?\" she asked grabbing a bowl from the cupboard for cereal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a baby!\" Norah replied, her same chipper self. \"Unfortunately you know I'm headed home today. I really hope your brother turns up so I can say goodbye!\" Norah said clasping her hands together lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, Norah, did you forget he's stuck to your pants?\" Tracy wanted to let Norah forget but she was more curious if Norah actually had forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah peered over her shoulder, grabbing the cleft of her ass and feeling around. \"Oh...uh...ummmm...of course not! That's why I'm still wearing him of course! Yes, don't worry, Hunter, I haven't forgotten!\" Norah's probing hand finally landed on you and gave you an \"\"affectionate\"\" press that really just crammed you up against your aunt's back door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides that awful torment, your aunt's awful lying did nothing but make you worry. One day and she had forgotten the entire reason she was wearing the same dirty pair of leggings. You just prayed your mom would set the record straight and listen to your explanation for once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact, I was just about to call your mother about him! Yep, just about to! So I'll do that real quick!\" Your body flew along with Norah as she rushed out of the room. Her ass chewing you as usual with each step she took up the stairs. Plopping her ass on her bedroom mattress, Norah dialed up your mom while you felt her whole body weight crushing you once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later and you heard, \"Hey sis!\" as Norah's voice pierced your prison and you prayed she'd get to mentioning you. \"I'm doing great, how are you?\" Norah chirped happily. You winced...Please, Norah. Come through just this once. \"Oh why did I call? Oh well...<i>uhhhh</i>\" It's not like she forgot already was it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Norah manage to mention your predicament?</span></div></div>",

According to me? Of course not. But unfortunately for many of my employers I was the ideal employee. After all, even if I disagreed with something Norah had signed me up for, I still felt like I owed it to her and whoever hired me to at least try my best.\u201d You responded. Quinn raised her eyebrows, impressed slightly by your honorable attitude towards what must have been terrible situations for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay I\u2019ll start you off with one of the more normal ones to ease you into this whole chapter of my life\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(BEGIN FLASHBACK)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDirector of Sales?! Like a real job?!\u201d You said in an exasperated tone up to Norah, you currently standing on the center console of the giantess\u2019s car as she drove you to your first day. You couldn\u2019t believe your ears when you heard the job that your aunt was offering you at that moment. At this point in time you were 19 years old and had just finished your first year of college. In all honesty you were looking into actual internships as opposed to spending another summer doing random odd jobs with Norah. But for once it seemed like she had brought you a real opportunity! You continued, \u201cJust regular sales, right? I\u2019m not going to be selling myself as a towel or clothing or an insole or something insane like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah cocked one eyebrow in confusion. \u201cOf course not! I\u2019m really sorry about some misunderstandings for jobs in the past but this one is legit! The current director is going on an impromptu month long vacation for some reason! He said he desperately needed it and the company wanted someone to fill in! I know you think you\u2019re underqualified but the listing specifically said that people of any experience could fill the role! So consider this one as payback for helping you out so much with jobs in the past!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah\u2019s words of encouragement actually encouraged you for once. And considering that you had now spent more than 5 minutes without being squished by her in one way or another you actually felt enthusiasm towards this opportunity. You wondered briefly why the current director had decided to go on vacation all of the sudden, but you quickly brushed that thought aside as the two of you pulled into the parking lot. Looking out the front windshield you saw a towering skyscraper looming above you. It looked classy and professional, essentially the opposite of how most of your previous stints with Norah had gone. Quickly Norah parked the car, shot you a confident smile, and grabbed you rather gently for once as the two of you headed towards the front doors of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the direction of the desk attendant and then a subsequent lengthy elevator ride, the doors finally opened onto one of the top floors of the building! The space was rather open, with only another set of large doors separating what seemed to be a large private office from the waiting room you were currently in. To your side seemed to be a smaller desk, littered with papers and an overall sense of messiness that the rest of the building did not exude. Moreover, a chair seemed to be pulled out and left askew behind the desk, almost as if someone had left mere moments before. Norah simply walked ahead, opening the double doors into an elegantly furnished private office. You fully expected to see some bigshot lady executive sitting in that room, waiting to greet you. But when you two scanned the room, both of your eyes landed on a tiny man, just like you, only a fair bit older and wearing what looked like an expensive suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh you must be my replacement! Hunter, was it? Please miss you can place him on the desk with me, I\u2019ll give him a quick prep session then I\u2019ll be headed to Barbados!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing! Norah said, somehow still maintaining an air of composure and competence that you had rarely seen from the woman in your life. If this was any other moment that you had been around Norah then you would have already been squashed flat by now, and the other tiny guy wouldn\u2019t have stated three dimensional for much longer either. She took a few steps forward and deposited you on the desk, next to the sharp dressed guy, before speaking again. \u201cI actually have to run, I\u2019m meeting my sister for an exercise class. Good luck Hunter!\u201d She said as she quickly turned around and walked out of the room. You saw the man beside you look intently at Norah\u2019s massive backside as she strutted out of the room, clearly not knowing the immeasurable amount of torture that it could put out. As your aunt closed the doors behind her, it was just you and the executive standing next to each other. Immediately a new sense of nervousness hit you. Not the typical nerves about getting squished or used in one way or another, but an actually typical nervousness that came with getting hired for a job you were severely underqualified for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were about to ask him any sort of question about the actual work you would be doing, the chipper attitude with which he addressed you and Norah moments before faded in an instant as his shoulders slumped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen up, kid. Just try your best with the actual work, I don\u2019t care if you make a single sale while I\u2019m gone. If you do, hurray, if you don\u2019t who gives a shit. I just need a break from that girl\u2026 that goddamned idiot.\u201d He said, confusing you greatly, before turning and looking you dead in the eyes. The grave look on his face honestly scared you as he continued, \u201cMy new assistant, Grace, is without exaggeration, the most oblivious airhead I have ever dealt with in my entire life. And I know what you\u2019re thinking already, but I can\u2019t fire her because she\u2019s the daughter of one of my lifelong friends\u2026 I used to love this job, but she makes it a living hell. I can\u2019t get through a single workday in one piece. I just need a break from it all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy ended his monologue and you didn\u2019t know what to say. He had an assistant after all, could her being a little forgetful or dumb really be that bad? Once again you were about to ask him more about both the job and now this wildcard girl but just then the door swung open! And through those doors walked what could only be described as an angel come to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman was strikingly tall, first of all, likely standing around 5\u201910\u201d if not taller. She had feathered long blonde hair that was parted down the center, cascading and framing her face perfectly. On that face was a pair of oversized, thick rimmed glasses that almost looked fake, like a nerd costume put on by the most popular girl in a cheesy movie. Her face was slender, with a radiant white smile shining through. Your eyes then practically popped open as your sight was drawn to her body. She was wearing a tight white button down shirt, with said buttons holding on for dear life behind the tremendous breasts that threatened their integrity. The shirt was tucked into a decidedly not-safe-for-work length black pencil skirt that showed off nearly all of her long, tanned legs. Not to mention an oversized yet firm ass that you could quite literally see from the front. Finally, a pair of open toed black heels added an extra three inches of unnecessary height to the woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were flabbergasted. While a few women in your life had her assets beat in terms of sheer size, such as Norah, your mother Helen, and now your new roommate Quinn. This woman\u2019s ratio of breasts and butt to waist was on another level. For all intents and purposes, she looked like a porn star more than an office assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Mister Sebastian!\u201d She chirped giddily as she walked into the room, and you realized up until that moment that you hadn\u2019t even received his name either. You waited a brief second for either her to greet you or Sebastian to introduce you, but before either of those things could happen you saw the large coffee cup that Grace was holding head straight for your position before slamming on top of your body, squishing you flat onto the desk as well as burning you beneath warm cardboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrace! Didn\u2019t I tell you to get me a tiny size cup from downstairs? Also pick up that cup right now my replacement is under it!\u201d Grace\u2019s eyes widened with surprise as she took a moment to process even this simplest of requests, before finally lifting the coffee cup to reveal your now reddened, slightly twitching form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhmygosh I\u2019m so sorry! Please forgive me I didn\u2019t mean to!\u201d The goddess of a woman bent down and scooped you up briefly, blowing air over your body in an attempt to cool you like some sort of fresh pastry or something. To be honest you quickly forgot about the airhead\u2019s blunder, as the sight of her gorgeous face trying to help you overwhelmed your senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrace, his name is Hunter, treat him with the same respect that you treat me with until I get back. Got it?\u201d Grace simply turned and looked between you two before smiling for a moment. \u201cAlso I have to get out of here rather quickly so if you don\u2019t mind getting me on that elevator I can be on my way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace looked back at the elevator she came up in, the doors just starting to close from when she stepped off less than a minute ago. \u201cOh, okay I got it!\u201d She said in an instant, dropping you about a foot carelessly onto the desk before scooping up your predecessor in her hands. In a move that both shocked and amazed you, Grace reached her hand back and hurled Sebastian as hard as she could down the hall and into the elevator doors just before they closed! You could only watch as he flattened immediately against the back wall before fluttering down to the ground like a piece of paper. You prayed that nobody else in the building would be getting on that elevator before he reached the ground floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNailed it!\u201d She said happily as she turned back to you and enchanted you with her smile again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does your \u201cnormal\u201d job go with this ditz of an assistant?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"...That story isn't even over yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn's mouth hung open as she couldn't believe this awful tale could somehow keep going. Consumed with curiosity, your giantess roommate's expression alone urged you to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, I actually made a sincere mistake by being a little too relaxed after the fact...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Flashback Continued)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter resting in your room and getting your first good night's sleep not consumed entirely by struggling to reform form under the weight of Tracy's box, that evening Norah had prepared you a nice tiny cup of ice cream as a sort of apology. Or so you had thought it was for an apology...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnocking on your door, your aunt soon let herself in, shot glass of frozen dairy in one hand and a well sized bowl in her other. \"Hey Hunter, you doing okay?\" Norah spoke into the room aimlessly not having spotted you yet. You felt familiar light tremors as she made her way to your bed before promptly turning and presenting her massive ass right in front of you as she prepared to sit. Dodging your way out from under your clueless aunt, you were left panting from the sudden sprint as she plopped herself down heavily onto your mattress, the sudden weight indent causing your tiny body to fling into the air slightly and land up on your pillow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the speck of movement, Norah actually spotted you and quickly flashed a bright grin, \"Ah, there you are!\" Handing you over your portion of ice cream, she plucked you up and set you down in her warm lap before she began digging into her own and you sat in comfortable silence as you enjoyed your treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, thanks aunt Norah. Mom hardly ever lets us have ice cream. Mostly since Tracy is always acting out though!\" Norah chuckled at your unfortunate truth before responding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's nothing, sweetie. After all you deserve a nice little reward after working so hard all week!\" To Norah your week as her sweat rag really was just like a bit of work since she usually rented out guys into similar jobs all the time. Usually not as hands on and gross but Norah figured you were family so this was a clear exception where you didn't mind getting a bit dirty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only you'd known this was how her mind was working you could've expressed that that somehow makes it even worse but instead you just happily took your compliment and attempted to kindly retort, \"Ha, I think you unfortunately were the one working Norah. Working out that is...I was just along for the difficult ride!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBursting into laughter at your lackadaisical response, Norah lost herself and a globule of ice cream dropped off her spoon into her lap, right onto you. You yelped out from the freezing cold fluid washing over your body as you started to shiver. Norah actually took notice of what had happened however and put her bowl down to try and help you out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh geez, I'm awfully sorry, dear. Looks like I'm a bit clumsy this evening! Let me clean you up!\" Not seeing any napkins, you expected Norah to take you to the bathroom to wash you off when she plucked you from her thigh and dangled you in front of her face. You were shaking from the cold in her grip as you saw her open her mouth. Expecting she would say something, you were distinctly mistaken as her tongue rolled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressing her tiny nephew into her soft tongue, Norah couldn't help but release a pleased sigh as she tasted the vanilla goodness. Making sure she thoroughly cleaned you up, she was relentless with her probing tongue as it lapped up the ice cream off you, Norah's soft grip being the only thing stopping you from being flung up with it deep into Norah's humid and hot mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to be thorough for your sake, Norah held you by your feet and wrapped her lips around you. Pulling you through with a smack, your aunt sucked the remaining cream off you before blasting you with sweet smelling hot breath as she let loose an \"Ahhhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, hon. Anyways, where were we?\" Placing your wet and dizzy form back on her thigh, Norah simply went back to her ice cream as she hummed in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's right, your talent! Well listen, sweetie, I really appreciated your help this week. If this ice cream makes up for it then I'm more than happy to trade!\" Smiling warmly down at you, you were still dizzy from your tongue bath and were trying to collect yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh, sure aunt Norah...no problem...\" You managed to get out before regaining your composure and setting your focus back on your ice cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half hour later and after a pleasant and decently normal chat, Norah placed you down on your pillow and gave you a quick kiss goodnight. \"Thanks again, Hunter. It makes me all fuzzy inside knowing I have such a kind and accommodating nephew!\" You blushed dark red as you accepted your praise. You weren't sure why she chose the word accommodating but it was a compliment nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving you to sleep, you got your first good night's sleep in a week...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following morning you awoke as actual light streamed it's way through your window. This was far more preferable than the first light you get being from Norah taking off your weighted box and grabbing you up to \"assist\" her. Hoping down from your bed, you stretched your arms out and pondered that it's a beautiful new day with infinite possibilities. So long as you could avoid Norah's carefree body and Tracy's nonstop tricks. Hearing your stomach growl, you knew it was time to head for breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking the trek through your homes vast hallway, you soon felt an all too familiar booming coming from right behind you. Looking up right at the last second, you saw the all too familiar malicious face of your sister right before her socked foot blocked it out. You spent an extra long second beneath her musty and honestly somewhat damp foot before she left you behind a flattened sticker on the floor. \"Watch where you're going, bro!\" Tracy mocked as she stuck her tongue out and skipped her way to the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuming with anger but more focused on reforming, you struggled against your flattened body as best as you could. Right as you were making some decent progress though, you unfortunately heard the skin-crawling familiar sound of sweat-slicked feet smacking against hardwood. You strained your eyes to see the blurry yet distinct shape of your aunt's curvy form walking right towards you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Norah!\" You shouted right as her sole compressed down on you. Looking left and right quizzically, Norah could've sworn someone had called out for her. Shrugging, Norah took another step only to feel your most intense screams as a light tickle on the bottom of her foot. Turning her foot over, you were shocked to see not an apologetic, sheepish expression. But rather one of excitement painted onto Norah's face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, good morning Hunter! You're up bright and early for yoga as expected!\" Peeling you free from her foot, Norah looked down at your mildly flattened body with discontent. \"Not the best job on getting in shape though, I guess I can help with that!\" Getting to work with a few harsh stretches, Norah easily had returned you into a flat rectangle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go, good as new and ready for action!\" Norah was beaming as she let you hang in her grip as she walked on towards your home's empty room, which was quickly becoming Norah's makeshift yoga studio. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing by Tracy at the dining table munching on her cereal, even Tracy raised an eyebrow at you and couldn't help but call out, \"Uhhh, whatcha got there aunt Norah?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding you up confused, Norah simply stated matter-of-factly, \"My specialty rag, Hunter of course. You didn't ask this at all the past few days but now you're curious? You can be so silly, Tracy!\" Tracy's jaw fell open as she saw Norah shake her head disapprovingly at her before turning on her heel and heading with you straight into her sweltering studio of doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwinging you around her neck as usual, Norah headed straight for the room's heater and flipped it on. As it whirred to life you were struggling to reform your mouth to ask what the hell was happening. In response to your thoughts somehow, Norah broke the silence actually speaking to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to respect your initiative Hunter, being all flat and waiting for me right outside my bedroom like that. But still, five days in exchange for one tiny shot glass of ice cream? You must weirdly love ice cream to do that!\" You struggled to pop open your flattened mouth as hard as you could but only managed to get out a few muffled moans. Noticing this against her neck, Norah took you in her hands and looked at you puzzled, \"Or you just love being useful for your sweet aunt? I get that I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the room heated up, Norah jumped right into her routine with assistant in tow. You couldn't believe you were somehow in this same situation. You had to find some kind of way to set this straight before Norah made use of you for another grueling five whole days! As sweat began to rain free down Norah's neck onto your exposed form, you cried out for mercy from your oblivious aunt as she lunged through pose after pose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling your restrained mumbles against her, your aunt retrieved you from her neck only to dunk you into her chest as your first exercise of the day. Swabbing thoroughly, your aunt retrieved you only to jokingly but sternly set you straight. \"Now Hunter I need you to respect my practice. That means no talking,\" she said as she spotted your face and scrubbed it away with her thumb. \"And also no buzzing,\" as she said that she laid you flat on her yoga mat and cast a heart shaped shadow over you. You watched the sky fall as her titanic rear end squashed you under the otherworldly weight of her ass. Rubbing back and forth firmly, Norah had cemented away your ability to speak out against her now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Grinding away on your poor body, Norah let out a pleased sigh as she resumed her concentration. With her handy nephew along with her, she could finally enjoy the benefits of hot yoga without the annoying consequence of getting soaked. Not to mention it was a little fun to be able to share the experience with someone else. Maybe you'd even learn a thing or two about yoga in the process!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah wasn't wrong as you pretty much knew most of her routine by now. Unfortunately for you, she seemed as carefree as ever to use you as nothing more than a rag all throughout the experience. After Norah had silenced you by taking a seat down on your face, your body quickly stuck to the back of this ditzy broad's butt and you were forced to wiggle and flex along with each subtle movement of Norah's ass as you accompanied her as a second skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis worked well for her for a while as she enjoyed the extra cushioning, but eventually she was once again dripping all over her mat. Peeling you free from her ass, Norah casually wiped you along from her forehead down to her waist without needing to interrupt her practice by speaking to you. Finished drying herself as much as she could, which was unfortunately still pretty wet, she dropped your body to the floor where she stood atop you like you were just some addition to the mat itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling your plush body squish beneath her soles, Norah was beginning to feel the true benefits to your form. Not only were you naturally absorbent which was ludicrously helpful to her, but you were also extra soft and squishy which was a <i>huge </i>help for something like yoga where you were basically on the floor barring a thin mat of rubber. Grinning with satisfaction, she couldn't help but wiggle her toes excitedly atop you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt this wiggling as a battering of heavy blows as sweaty balls of flesh drummed into your face. You would gag if you could as you got a full taste of the salty residue they were splashing down onto you. You were forced to look up between the spaces of her toes to see the intimidating full height of Norah, her face easily blocked out by her prestigious chest. You winced through blurred vision as Norah lunged into another pose, her movement allowing a few more sticky droplets to cascade off her body onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally finished with her routine, Norah was panting and thoroughly soaked even with your assistance. \"Phew, it's never easy, is it honey?\" Norah wasn't exactly expecting a response as she was busy stroking you up and down each underarm before moving on to the next soaked body part. After an eternal five minutes of cleaning up Norah's latest lather, she tried holding you from each side and wringing out her gross sweat, only to have nothing come out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling up a storm, Norah laughed out, \"Still thirsty, huh?\" and you were placed on the floor. Watching Norah struggle out of her painted on compression shorts, you knew what was coming next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarelessly stripping free from her spandex restraints, Norah let her shorts and bra hit the ground beside you with a squelch. You tried to shield your eyes from your aunt's shining with sweat body as usual, but you noticed her face was extra red this time. \"I'm sorry but the worst is next, Hunter. You probably know this is the spot that I need you the most!\" Picking you up and swinging you around to face her swell of a rear she teased you along her cheeks before running you up and down her crack slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you <i>love </i>to help out, and this spot really is where I need the most help, so actually I guess this spot isn't the worst, it's the best!\" With renewed vigor and a newfound lack of guilt, Norah finally plunged you beneath the surface of her crack to attack her rivers of accumulated sweat directly. You tried to let out a scream as your senses were assaulted by Norah's overwhelming ass sweat but you didn't even let out a peep. Norah had done too much damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally felt your body pop free from the steaming cavern of Norah's walloping booty and tried to heave a sigh of relief. Only to have Norah plunge you back in even deeper than before! Wiping methodically all around, Norah wanted to make sure you got to every last drop she had worked up. After all, what kind of aunt would she be if she didn't allow you to utilize your utmost potential? Finally feeling decently cleaned up, Norah removed your battered and filthy form from her rear before discarding you among her other sopping garments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarried through your home in Norah's arms, you feared you knew exactly where Norah was taking you. Even though she knew you were her nephew, was she still going to wash you amongst her clothes? As she dumped you into the washer, you saw her start to close the lid before you saw her appear startled by something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Hunter, that's right!\" Thank god she had remembered you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again for today! You really are such a godsend! Does today count as like, day one or day zero? Oh well, we'll figure it out!\" With that you saw her turn her back on you and you were cast into blackness as she closed the lid. \"Or maybe I should be saying you're welcome...?\" Norah mumbled as she headed off to the shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later and light shone on you as Tracy's bratty face appeared above you. Restraining a chorus of laughter, Tracy just bellowed at you, \"How the hell did you get yourself into this one, Hunter? I mean really, you had your chance, and you blew it!\" Tracy had already picked you up and began placing you under the box once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this is all I have to do to keep you out of my hair from now on, I'm much obliged to help!\" Tracy let the box fall with a smack, this time ensuring no loose limbs were sticking free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following morning, Norah knew right where to find you! \"Sure is sweet of you to make sure you stay flat by sleeping under this box, hon! That's the kind of attitude that will take you really far in my profession!\" Swinging you in her stride, Norah carried you off towards another day of torture. This time Norah ran you through the usual works, and you felt as helpless and worn out as ever, as did she! However notably Norah simply tossed you into the washer with a \"Thanks!\" before heading about her day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Norah just gave you a casual good morning, and after that she seemed to fall silent in focus. Tossed without a care afterwards, you wondered when this would finally stop. The irony of that statement was that Norah seemed to particularly be enjoying these yoga sessions and began throwing in an extra one in the evening. She did have the free time after all since she was just looking after Tracy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the days droned on Norah spoke to you less and less. One session went by without even a word, and you worried Norah was beginning to forget you were even a person and not an extra special yoga rag. After a grueling SIX days under Norah she finally seemed to recall who you were and asked Tracy how long it had been with you in towel form. You did have some sort of deal after all, she was just a bit hazy with her memory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure it's been about three days, so I'd say you have another seven before he wants some kind of reward.\" Tracy lied through her teeth to which Norah accepted without question. You tried to scream and protest with every fiber of your being, but Norah didn't feel a thing and merely tucked half of you into her waistband to carry. Taking you into the sweltering studio once more, Norah decided she'd really push herself to her limits while she was here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an excruciating two weeks of nonstop sweat, stench, crushing, and being squished into Norah, Tracy finally popped her head into the steamy studio one day and called out, struggling to restrain her coughing and hold her breath, \"Hey Norah, Mom just called! She'll be back tomorrow and said you can head out whenever!\" Portions of your soaked tan body were splayed out under Norah's thick ass as she responded, \"Thanks, dear, I'll probably get out of here this evening then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a week since Norah had even uttered a word to you, and whenever her eyes laid upon you, they were only filled with a gaze that conveyed her feelings of utility to you and not one of recognition. As Norah scrubbed you against each of her slick, sweaty soles at the end of that day's session, she felt a weird nagging in the back of her head that she was overlooking something. Whatever it was, she had the overwhelming sudden hunger for some ice cream as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, after a particularly long and grueling session, Norah was packing her things away when she came upon your tan and flattened form. Gazing up at this uncaring gorgeous face, you prayed for some kind of recognition that this airhead would remember who you were!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith steadfast resolve, Norah decided your fate by...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Norah held you up in front of her face. She had her head cocked slightly to the side and you saw a haze stirring in her eyes as she curiously stared at you. Why was she looking at you like this? If she was heading home it was time for you to be free from this duty as a living sweat rag. Or at the very least she could leave you in the washer, tucked in a drawer, or hell you'd even be fine with her giving you to Tracy; anything was better than having her not recognize you and somehow end up extending this torture. Thankfully she seemed to have a moment of clarity as her expression lit up and she looked at you fondly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh, and how could I forget you?\" Norah chuckled to herself, you weren't sure if she was laughing at how she had totally forgotten you a moment ago or if she was just laughing because her own nephew was a towel in the palm of her hand. Unfortunately Norah's next words revealed it was neither: \"I don't know how I'd do yoga without it! Such an absorbent little thing...\". It? A thing?! Sure it had been two whole weeks but it was Norah's job to be looking after the two of you while she was here! All she had done was put you in more trouble! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying you down amongst her clothes, Norah was pressing down on you and all her belongings trying to get the bag to zip shut. You heard her begin cursing under her breath as her palm smooshed you down into a pair of her underwear. \"Stupid thing...everything fit in here on my way over...what gives?!\" Just at that moment, Tracy walked by Norah's guest room and saw her struggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup, Aunt Norah?\" Tracy asked as innocently as ever. Wearing a frilly skirt she truly was as cute as could be, a true angel in the eyes of your aunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah wiped a droplet of sweat from her forehead, \"I can't close this dang suitcase! I hardly had any trouble getting it closed at home!\" Norah gave it another annoyed push before plopping down on the bed next to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy was taping her chin curiously, then she saw your tan form squished and laying amongst a loose sock and a pile of underwear. A vibrant mischievous grin stretched across her supposedly innocent face. As you saw her approach you, you prayed that just this one time she'd show you a little mercy. Instead she did a twirl that lifted her skirt from the gust of wind and fell backwards. You saw nothing but a pair of pink and white striped panties painted on your sister's butt before it splatted down onto you. She huffed while hopping up and down for a moment, knocking the wind clear out of you. Norah was merely giggling watching the small girl make little progress. \"Now there's an idea, but let me show you how it's done!\" you heard Norah boom out and your eyes shot open in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah got up from the bed and let Tracy hop down before presenting her gigantic butt to you. It was wobbling and shaking menacingly even within the confines of Norah's tight leggings as Norah teased it against the suitcase a few times in preparation of something. \"Here goes nothing!\" She called before jumping and falling onto you. Not only was Norah far, far heavier than Tracy, she also had yet to shower or even change since that final yoga session this evening. So when Norah was grabbing the suitcase on each side and pulling herself into it with a determined rub down, you felt the life being squeezed from your body and were forced to endure the toxic taste and smell too. With a little help from Tracy, Norah's butt bomb had truly sealed the deal in trapping you in her suitcase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy took one last look at you in the shape of Norah's ass print before taking a gamble and pointing at you. \"Taking mom's special towel home, are ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah smacked her forehead, \"Oh THAT'S where I got it! Oh, no. You don't think she'll miss it do you, dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy pondered how much her mom would investigate your disappearance, and answered Norah's question with complete honesty, \"Probably, but it'll be our secret, kay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah pinched Tracy's cheek lightly and said \"You're such a sweetheart, you know that. Thank goodness too, I really didn't want to part with this little rag. Nothing like it has been able to keep up with my yoga, it's like it was <i>made</i> for <i>me</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the strong pressure from the suitcase but it wasn't anything you couldn't handle. You sighed a breath of relief to be free from Norah's ass for a moment before you remembered where you were and why you were there. You were headed to Norah's house. And she had no idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis prompted a new round of struggling and fighting but Norah and Tracy didn't notice a thing as Tracy carried you out to Norah's car. Tossing you into her trunk and brushing her hands from a job well done, Norah gave Tracy a huge hug and kiss before heading towards her car door. \"Oh wait a second, where the heck is Hunter? I feel just <i>awful </i>leaving without giving him a goodbye kiss!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy bit her lip nervously, this was exactly what she was afraid of. Luckily she was ready, \"I'm pretty sure he's been away at a friend's or something. Such a shame he's not here to see you off, he <b>loves </b>your kisses!\" Tracy couldn't help but snicker recalling your detailed description of how overpowering and nauseating an Aunt Norah kiss was and how you avoided them at all costs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww that's a shame, I felt like he was <i>right </i>with us these past few weeks but I suppose looking back I can't really place how.\" Norah's face clouded for a moment before she cheered up, \"Oh well! I'll just give him double kisses next time I see him! Love ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you could have heard a fraction of that conversation you would have cried out. But all you felt was the vibration of the car as it roared to life and Norah pulled out of your driveway. Tracy waved her car goodbye before breaking into a gut-busting laughing spree. You let loose a blood-curdling scream as every second of Norah's foot on the gas was another bit you were further from your home. From the place people knew who you were. Where people actually looked out for you, checking where they step and sit. Norah had none of these attributes. This could be a long trip from home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter three quiet hours in the trunk of Norah's car, you felt the engine shut off and a moment later you were hoisted up in her arms. Getting into her home, Norah deposited her suitcase lazily at the foot of her bed before leaving it there to get a midnight snack. She truly left a little too late and after a long drive her stomach was growling. \"Hmmmmmm...want something...sweet!\" Norah mused as she popped open her freezer. Spotting exactly what her stomach was calling for, Norah got a bowl and took a big scoop out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sweet and creamy flavors of the vanilla ice cream danced on her tongue, Norah felt some kind of tickle in the back of her mind. Was she forgetting something? As she took another large glob into her mouth, the tiny form of her nephew popped into her mind. She gushed, sweet ice cream and thoughts of such a sweet and helpful little guy swimming in her head. A hot wave of passion rose up her body as a ridiculous thought rolled through her mind...if only Hunter could come stay with her for some time. Sure her place was smaller than yours, but did it really matter to him? (Of course it did since it increased your chance of run-ins with clueless Norah). Licking the last drops from her bowl with her pointer finger, she sucked off the last of the sweet cream with a final thought that she'd propose the idea to your mom next time she was asked to babysit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWashing her bowl and putting it away, Norah clicked her tongue savoring the aftertaste and having funny afterthoughts of her last idea. Suddenly Norah's heart beat accelerated at the thought of Hunter joining her for one of her yoga sessions. She bet you'd be so ridiculously accommodating you might even volunteer to wipe the sweat off her. To act as a...sweat...rag...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah raced up the stairs. It couldn't really be true, right? Tracy said he had been at a friend's house. But the pieces seemed to fit, the ice cream, the yoga, her thoughts of you. Prying open her suitcase she was feeling a turbulent mix of emotions. She wanted to see her favorite tiny nephew but also was worried he'd be upset if he truly had been her towel all that time. A tiny part of her was actually hoping she didn't have to make that grueling drive back to her sisters house too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight shone on you and Norah practically ripped her suitcase open. \"Hunter?! Are you in here?!\" You saw her face painted with a kind of anxious smile that made you wonder just what she was thinking...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSo, I\u2019m curious about Norah\u2019s job. What other kind of jobs did she have you fill in?\u201d You could see in her eyes that \u201ccurious\u201d could probably have been replaced with \u201cangry\u201d. Obviously Quinn cared a lot about people\u2019s treatment of tinies, and hearing about Norah, unintentionally or otherwise, taking advantage of tiny guys seemed to make her pretty mad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sure Quinn, let me think,\u201d you put your hand on your chin and started to think, before thinking of a good one. \u201cOk, before I start this one I\u2019ll remind you that most of what I went through on these jobs was not entirely Norah\u2019s fault, she didn\u2019t really know what she was getting me into most of the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn simply shrugged and stared at you expectantly. Clearly your reminder didn\u2019t really sway her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, so it all started when I was 16, after I had promised myself I wouldn\u2019t help Norah out with these jobs anymore, she came to me with a listing she urgently needed to fill.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(FLASHBACK START)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Aunt Norah, I\u2019m sorry but I just don\u2019t want to help out with this anymore! The last job you sent me on ended up with me being turned into a professional volleyball player\u2019s insole for three weeks!\u201d You whined up to Norah from your position on her open palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Hunter, if YOU don\u2019t do this then I look bad to my bosses! I really need your help here,\u201d Norah whined, pouting and gave you her best puppy-dog eyes. \u201cI know the last job was horrible for you, but this one\u2019s nothing like that! It\u2019s just a cleaning job at a bowling alley, I swear no one will use you as clothing on this one. Plus the pay is super good, and on such short notice I can get you paid double! Please, please, please Hunter. I really need your help on this one!\u201d<br>\r\nNorah didn\u2019t happen to mention that her commission for this job would be much higher than what you\u2019d be making on it, even with the double pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah\u2019s pleading, along with her puppy-dog eyes, eventually wore you down. \u201cFine! I\u2019ll do this one for you Aunt Norah, but only if you promise I won\u2019t have to go near anyone\u2019s feet for this one, I still get shivers whenever mom walks past me in bare feet after the last job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh thank you so much Hunter! You\u2019re really saving my ass here. I promise you won\u2019t have to go anywhere near feet, or anything associated with feet, it\u2019s just a cleaning job,\u201d Norah\u2019s smile beamed down towards you. She finished with a smirk. \u201cI mean, come on. I\u2019m not a complete scatterbrain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe is a complete scatterbrain,\u201d you thought to yourself, enraged. <br>\r\nSomehow Norah had managed to misread \u201cbowling alley shoe cleaner\u201d, to just \u201cbowling alley cleaner\u201d. She had just convinced you to sign up to clean stinking bowling shoes for a week! On top of that, your work contract stipulated that you would stay on the premises for the whole week, so Norah had just dumped you on the counter and had just left you as you were going over the details in your head! You had no way of getting out of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the swinging door closed behind your aunt as she left to go finish her morning jog, you were left to look up at the sneering face of your new boss for the week, Abby. <br>\r\nAbby was a short, thin woman who possessed a frame some would probably call cute. She was still massive in comparison to you, like every woman you encountered, but she did tower over you slightly less than most women. Her black hair was pulled back in a ponytail, and her brown eyes were framed by a pair of large, square glasses. Her freckled face was currently pulled into a sneer that told you she probably didn\u2019t like tiny guys such as yourself very much. No wonder Norah told you their last cleaner just didn\u2019t turn up one day, with a boss like Abby you didn\u2019t even want to turn up on the first day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope you do a better job than the last guy,\u201d Abby looked down at you with her pointed nose held high in the air.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure a little bug like yourself will feel right at home in amongst the shoes of us regular people. Well at least, you better be, because that\u2019s where you\u2019ll be sleeping while you\u2019re working here.\u201d <br>\r\nAs she chuckled at her mean-spirited taunting, you stood there, flabbergasted. She actually expected you to sleep in the shoes that have been worn by probably hundreds of people? Norah owed you big time when you got out of here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo there\u2019s a small bucket and cloth down there for you, as well as a tap designed for someone your size to use, so there is no need for you to bother me while you\u2019re here. If you happen to be in a shoe when I rent it out to someone it\u2019s on you to get back out and continue working. I\u2019m not paying you to lay about in a shoe that\u2019s being used, so if I find out that you have been I\u2019ll dock your pay for that day, got it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou little things are only useful for certain things and this is one of them, so don\u2019t mess it up or I won\u2019t hesitate to find another use for you for the week, a few of the older shoes could use a new insole, and maybe I just \u201cforget\u201d about doing that and tell Norah that you just left without any warning,\u201d as she finished her threats you were genuinely terrified, you had never met a woman who had such an open disdain for tiny guys like this. What had Norah roped you into? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG-Got it B-Boss,\u201d you stammered out, wanting nothing more than to get your head down and get this week over with as soon as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, finally Norah has found a little bug who knows his place,\u201d Abby smiled down at you, seemingly content with your subservience. She roughly pinched your torso between two fingers and carried you behind the counter to the shoes rack. Even from this height and distance you could see the small bridges and ladders that were placed throughout the massive rack of shoes specifically for tiny guys such as yourself to move around between the shoes. You saw a small water tap and pump for cleaning products, as well as a small bucket and cloth at the bottom of the rack. Most importantly, however, you could almost see a literal cloud of stench and sweat rising off of the shoes lined out on the rack, there were hundreds of pairs of varying sizes. This would be a difficult, long week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you gathered your cleaning equipment, although calling a small piece of rag and a tiny sized bucket filled with water and cleaning products \u201cequipment\u201d may have been a stretch, you mentally prepared yourself for a week of nothing but smelling the stench of old foot sweat. Lowering yourself into the first shoe your senses were assaulted by what smelled like years worth of wear on these shoes. This was going to be a long week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour days had passed. You had cleaned so many shoes you had lost count, and you were convinced you would never get the smell of feet out of your clothes, or even your own skin for that matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby fed you once a day, leaving a small corner of a sandwich on the ground near the water tap. Otherwise she interacted with you very little, except to occasionally throw out a belittling taunt every once in a while when there weren\u2019t customers. <br>\r\nOn occasion Abby would come by to inspect a shoe after she had saw you crawl out of it, clearly checking your work, before staring down at you with a neutral expression before grunting and placing it back on the rack, never actually commenting on the quality of your work. You assumed this meant it was good because she hadn\u2019t made good on her threat to turn you into an insole yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a few close calls on the first night, almost getting trapped in a shoe that Abby was fetching for a customer, but you always managed to get out in time before Abby had picked it up each time. After that you learned to try and clean the extremely large or small shoes during busy times since they were less likely to be picked. <br>\r\nBy this point you were incredibly tired and aching, it was gruelling work having to clean the shoes for the entirety of the bowling alley\u2019s opening hours and the smell of feet constantly surrounding you made it difficult to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just hoped you could get through the next few days without incident, then Norah would pick you up and you could get out of here with some compensation for your suffering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) You find the old cleaner, engrained into one of the insoles of the most used pair on the rack.<br>\r\n2) Abby decides that you have done a bad job today, you spend the rest of your time in this job as an insole.<br>\r\n3) Abby thinks you\u2019re doing a good job, she has you clean her shoes as well.</span></div></div>",

If you\u2019re sure, then that\u2019s okay, but\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m good.\u201d Quinn interrupted, though you could tell it was from nervousness and not from being rude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking your cue, you sat back and smiled at your beautiful giantess roommate. \u201cAlright. Go ahead!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black-haired girl\u2019s lips curled up into a smile that vanished as soon as it appeared. \u201cSure. Well, basically, my childhood was pretty simple. I\u2019m an only child, so it was just me and my mom for\u2026well\u2026as long as I can remember. No clue when dad skipped out, but I must\u2019ve been only a few months old. Mom always said it was because he wanted a boy, not a \u2018weak little girl\u2019, in his words.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to hear that, Quinn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn shrugged, with only a faint wetness in her eye telling you how she really felt. \u201cIt\u2019s whatever. Anyway, my mom\u2026uh, her name is Becky, by the way. She had to care for me all by herself, but she caught a lucky break when she started up an online retailer website with one of her good friends. She and her friend would buy stuff from all over, and sell it for a few bucks cheaper online. However, they\u2019d ship it all across the country, so they\u2019d earn back a profit from shipping costs added onto the customer\u2019s totals.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn was rambling by this point, and sensing that she was, she stopped herself to breath and blush ever-so-slightly. You smiled gently, amused by seeing a different side of Quinn from her normally apathetic behavior. It was clear that she held great respect and love for her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResuming, Quinn cleared her throat. \u201cBasically, it wasn\u2019t long before her store was getting revenue from ads, and gaining traction. Blah blah. It\u2019s now pretty popular, and my mom soon became the manager instead of a direct buyer and supplier. She\u2019s actually got a small team of people who do the daily work. She pretty much just lives her own personal life each and every day, save for a few meetings or phone calls each week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, suitably impressed. \u201cWow, that\u2019s great. What\u2019s the website called?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s, uh, called Shipping Hero. The motto is \u2018finding the heroic deals, and shipping them to wherever you may be\u2019. Tacky, right?\u201d Quinn rolled her eyes as she spoke, but you gaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way. Tracy and I used to use that site all the time. That\u2019s crazy?\u201d You laughed, and Quinn actually chuckled a bit too. A moment later, you motioned for Quinn to continued. \u201cOkay, so, your mom\u2019s job was awesome, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh.\u201d Quinn said, while reaching for her phone. \u201cIt meant she had pretty much everyday free to baby me and dote on me like I was a little kid. I mean, yeah, I guess I was at one point, but she is still way too clingy and lovey-dovey. It\u2019s exhausting.\u201d Quinn scrolled around on her phone. \u201cLike, see, look at this, Hunter. Our last vacation to the local amusement park. Can you believe her?\u201d Quinn leaned forward in her seat and shoved the phone towards you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to take a step back to fully analyze the photo, as it was practically a movie theater screen at your size. Glancing over the photo, you were about to respond to Quinn when your jaw dropped. The picture showed Quinn and a woman who looked startlingly similar to her beside a cardboard cutout of an animal mascot. Quinn was wincing from embarrassment, while the older woman was grinning like a child, while also clad in a t-shirt that read \u201cMy Daughter Is a Sweet Angel\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis humorous aspect contrasted sharply with the woman\u2019s outrageously pronounced curves. Surpassing even Quinn, the woman\u2019s breasts stretched her too-tight top to the extreme, and you could plainly see her abundantly large rear end even from the front. Her hourglass figure was immaculate and hard to look away from, and it now made perfect sense where Quinn had inherited her own blessedly bountiful body from. Some strand of curviness genes clearly ran in the Wallace family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearing your eyes from Quinn\u2019s mother, you met your roommate\u2019s gaze and laughed. \u201cShe seems like an awesome woman!\u201d<br>\r\nThough intended as a light-hearted remark, Quinn\u2019s face feel. \u201cYou\u2019d actually hate her, Hunter. Or rather\u2026I guess she\u2019d hate you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused, confused. \u201cWhat do you mean, Quinn? Does she warm up slowly to strangers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour titanic new friend laughed humorlessly. \u201cNo, I wish. Truthfully, she despises tinies. Finds them distasteful and gross. She\u2019s said so herself, word for word. She never told me why she hated tinies so strongly\u2026but god she made it really damn clear with her actions. The things I\u2019ve seen her do\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn trailed off, and your blood ran cold. There was a haunted look in Quinn\u2019s eye, and a part of you didn\u2019t want her to elaborate on whatever memories she was reliving. The other part of you knew that Quinn should, so that she could get it off her chest and allow total transparency between her and yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing, Quinn looked at you and sighed. \u201cSee, I used to have a lot of tiny friends. As in, way more than my normal-sized friends. I spent everyday hanging out with the tinies from my neighborhood and school. Trouble was, my doting and clingy mother was never far off, and when she\u2019d find out about my tiny friends\u2026it wasn\u2019t long before I\u2019d never see them again. And if it wasn\u2019t my mom, it was just fate itself screwing over every single tiny I\u2019ve ever known. Wasn\u2019t long before I had no more friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hardly knew what to say, and could only gently rest your hand on Quinn\u2019s thumb (as her hand holding the phone was still lying on the bed beside you. Touched by your gesture, Quinn spared you a quick smile before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of the reason I care so much about you guys being strong and capable.\u201d Quinn elaborated. \u201cI\u2019ve seen too many people treat you like, frankly, pieces of shit. It HURTS, watching it happen, but I can\u2019t save every tiny, and god help me if I make things worse by trying. What I CAN do, though, is treat you like equals, with respect and dignity, and help you to get tougher all on your own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a whole new side of Quinn, and you were floored. Someone who had seemed like a cut-and-dry case of nonchalant emo girl had broken into a million pieces, revealing the caring girl with forward-thinking ideas and a traumatic past dueling inside of her. Your new roommate was the single most incredible and interesting person you\u2019d ever met in your life, and you felt a rush of awe and something a little bit more as you looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long moment of silence hung in the air, before Quinn coughed and refocused herself. \u201cUm, anyway\u2026ask away, Hunter. I\u2019ll tell whatever stories you want, the good and bad. Shoot.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI was wondering if you could tell me more about what exactly it is that your mom had done to tinies in the past?\u201d <br>\r\nAs you asked this you saw a brief look of confusion flash across Quinn\u2019s face.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you want to know that? I wouldn\u2019t think you\u2019d want to hear about the horrible things she does to people like you,\u201d the look of confusion only lasted a second, going back to her usual neutral expression fairly quickly.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess it just seems like you\u2019re not the kind of person who would talk about this kind of stuff normally. I think it would be good for you to get it out,\u201d what you said to Quinn was true, but since this was Quinn\u2019s mom, you also wanted to get information so you knew what to avoid if she ever came over while you were here. \u201cIt\u2019s not good to keep this sort of stuff to yourself, it would maybe be good for you to talk about it.\u201d<br>\r\nQuinn\u2019s cheeks blushed slightly and she showed a faint smile before quietly uttering a soft \u201cthanks\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shifted uncomfortably, seeming reluctant to talk about it.<br>\r\n\u201cQuinn, we don\u2019t have to talk about it if you don\u2019t want to. If I overstepped we can talk about something-\u201c you were cut off again as Quinn\u2019s nervous talking interrupted you again.<br>\r\n\u201cNo I\u2019m good, it\u2019s fine... I\u2019m just trying to think of where to start.\u201d <br>\r\nShe sat there for a few moments, trying to figure out where to start. Suddenly she seemed to think of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk so... as I said I had a lot of tiny friends growing up. My mom was usually very discreet in how she got rid of them, most of the time I suspected she had done something to them but there was never any evidence,\u201d she sighed, obviously thinking about all the friends she had lost. \u201cUntil one time that I had two friends over, they were brothers, twins. Their names were Jack and Henry. This was when I was around fourteen. We were in my room, just chatting, when I suddenly needed to use the bathroom. On the way out I noticed my mom standing in the hall, in hindsight she was probably eavesdropping on us. I don\u2019t know why, but I noticed at the time that she was standing barefoot.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo I go and use the bathroom, I\u2019m only in there for five minutes at most. When I come out my mom was waiting outside. She said that Jack and Harry\u2019s parents had showed up and they had left. I had thought it was strange but I just shrugged and took her word for it. Just as I walked past I happened to glance down and see that she was wearing a pair of tan socks. I had thought it was strange but didn\u2019t realise what had actually happened till after I walked into my room and sat down.\u201d She paused, clearly collecting herself. You put your hand on her thumb reassuringly once again, which got another small smile from her.<br>\r\n\u201cSo I rushed downstairs to confront her about it... but once I got downstairs I saw her pulling on some running shoes over my friends. I actually saw one of their faces on the sole of her foot! I was in so much shock I couldn\u2019t say anything. She turned to look at me and got this huge smile on her face, she said something along the lines of \u201coh my sweet little angel, you look more beautiful every day\u201d before hugging me,\u201d she almost seemed to gag at the thought of her mother\u2019s shower of affection. \u201cI couldn\u2019t bring myself to confront her, she was being so doting and loving, I couldn\u2019t start a fight with her about it. She was one of the few people I was really close to at that time, I didn\u2019t want to risk that. So I didn\u2019t do anything, and she went off on a run, she must have ditched them somewhere because I never saw her wearing them again, and I didn\u2019t see them ever again. They could still be out somewhere because I was too afraid to ruin my relationship with my mom, as well as all the other tiny guys she\u2019s gotten rid of over the years.\u201d<br>\r\nA single tear rolled its way down Quinn\u2019s pale cheek, and there was a faint wetness in her eyes. She obviously felt incredibly guilty about it. Still holding your hands on her thumb, you looked up to your giantess roommate.<br>\r\n\u201cQuinn, none of that was your fault. Your mom made those choices, it\u2019s perfectly understandable to not want to jeopardise your relationship with her since it\u2019s obvious you two were really close. Please don\u2019t blame yourself,\u201d she hung her head low even as you said this. \u201cJust give me a warning whenever she comes over so I can find a good hiding place.\u201d <br>\r\nYou thought ending with a lighthearted joke would be best to cheer her up, and you did get a faint chuckle out of her.<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Hunter.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at you with a slightly more serious face.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you warning before she comes over if she ever does, I haven\u2019t told her where I live yet but I imagine she\u2019ll find out eventually. So I\u2019ll give you a few tips on her behaviour around tiny guys. She will act innocent and sweet when me or any other people her size are around. She usually crushes tinies on purpose but will pass it off as an accident. I\u2019d also guess that she\u2019d try to hide you on herself somewhere the instant she\u2019s alone, because whenever a friend disappeared it was usually after I\u2019d left them alone. I also don\u2019t have any evidence for this but I\u2019m sure she probably used Shipping Hero to get rid of some of them, but I can\u2019t say for sure. So if she ever comes here I\u2019ll make sure either me, Morgan or Avery will be with you at all times,\u201d she didn\u2019t smile down at you, but you could tell from her eyes that she was trying to reassure you. \u201cNormally I\u2019d be inclined to let you fend for yourself, but I\u2019ve lost too many friends to her to let that happen.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Quinn, and for my part I\u2019ll try to keep a low profile when she\u2019s around,\u201d you smile up to her.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah that\u2019s probably best.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? <br>\r\n1) You and Quinn continue to talk.<br>\r\n2) Morgan and Avery want to do something as a group.<br>\r\n3) There\u2019s a knock at the door, Becky has tracked Quinn down and come to visit.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Quinn wiped her eyes with the sleeve of her sweater, before sniffing and attempting to keep her neutral expression.<br>\r\nYou smiled, amused by Quinn\u2019s determination too keep up her apathetic appearance despite having just had a very deep conversation with you and having already shed tears in front of you. The more time that you spent with Quinn, the more interesting she became to you. <br>\r\nYou felt that, despite having had an incredibly deep and revealing conversation with her, there was still much more to learn about her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were about to open your mouth to continue conversing with her, Quinn stood up.<br>\r\n\u201cWant to go and see what Morgan and Avery are up to?\u201d She looked down at you, her face once again completely neutral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were slightly disappointed that you wouldn\u2019t be able to continue your one on one conversation with Quinn, but you shrugged, you would be able to continue it another time.<br>\r\n\u201cSure, sounds good to me,\u201d you gave her a thumbs up and Quinn lowered her palm, gesturing for you to hop on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both made your way downstairs to the living room, where Morgan and Avery were sitting watching tv. Morgan was sat on a reclining chair whereas Avery was sprawled out across the couch.<br>\r\nAs you both entered the twins heads turned to look at you. Avery sat up straight, making space for both you and Quinn on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, looks like the two lovebirds have decided to join us Morgan. Did you two enjoy your alone time?\u201d Avery teased. \u201cI bet Hunter\u2019s a totes amazing kisser. Am<br>\r\nI right Quinn?\u201d<br>\r\nAs Avery finished speaking she jokingly started to make kissing noises while giggling at Quinn. Quinn\u2019s face blushed faintly and you could see her normally neutral expression begin to turn to embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what? No... I- We didn\u2019t do... we just- ugh!\u201d Quinn huffed in frustration at her stammering, before Avery burst into laughter at the normally calm and collected woman\u2019s obvious embarrassment at her teasing. Even Morgan was suppressing a giggle. You glanced back towards Quinn with a smile, her adorable reaction to a fairly lighthearted joke by Avery was something you found incredibly endearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, and still blushing heavily, Quinn walked over to the couch. She sat on the far side from Avery, depositing you on the middle cushion between them. Normally this couch would be large enough for three normal sized people to sit on, but with Quinn\u2019s massive hips taking up more than just her cushion, you doubted three people would fit on it currently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of you spent the next hour watching TV and chatting. Quinn was slow to join in on the conversation, still recovering from her embarrassment, but Avery\u2019s exuberant personality more than filled that void. <br>\r\nYou all talked about plans that you each had for the next few days, got to know each other better, and discussed dinner plans. You weren\u2019t squished at all since you had plenty of space between Avery and Quinn\u2019s thighs, having almost a full couch cushion to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation was interrupted by the sound of the doorbell. Everyone looked around confused, before Morgan shrugged and got up to go and answer the door. A few moments passed during which you and Avery talked about her job. Your conversation was interrupted by a woman\u2019s voice, shouting in excitement.<br>\r\n\u201cQuinnie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you turned towards the door and saw Morgan, who looked shocked at both the appearance and sudden outburst of the woman who had just walked into the room with her. Dressed in a simple blue top, a short black skirt and a pair of tan tights was Quinn\u2019s mother, Becky. <br>\r\nThe picture that Quinn had shown you did not do her appearance justice, she was a vision of beauty. Her enormous curves were almost comical in comparison to Morgan, who was already curvy in her own right, making Becky\u2019s curves all the more impressive. You could see Avery\u2019s jaw drop as she took in Becky\u2019s impressive form, the pink haired girl\u2019s shock and amazement written all over her face.<br>\r\nThe voluptuous woman was almost bouncing in excitement at seeing her daughter, who\u2019s eyes were widened in surprise at her mom\u2019s unexpected visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom... What are you doing here? I hadn\u2019t told you where I lived yet, how\u2019d you find out?\u201d Quinn seemed more puzzled than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t worry about that sweetie, all that matters is that I\u2019m here and we can celebrate your first day in your new apartment!\u201d Becky squealed in excitement before rushing towards Quinn and embracing her in a big hug, kissing her on the cheek repeatedly despite her daughters struggles. After a few moments of showering affection on her daughter, Becky slid off of the top of her daughter onto the couch next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou witnessed Becky\u2019s display of affection before you were cast in the shadow of her meteoric backside descending towards you rapidly. Her skirt, which barely covered any of her mammoth, tights covered backside, fluttered upwards, revealing the whole of her titanic rear. You could barely process what was happening before your entire world was taken up by the crushing sensation of Becky\u2019s ass grinding you into the couch. <br>\r\nAvery was pushed over towards the arm rest as all available space was taken up by Becky\u2019s wide hips shimmying to get comfortable. <br>\r\n\u201cOh sorry dear, I was so excited to see my little angel that I forgot how much space I can take up,\u201d Becky turned to Avery apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo probs Mrs Wallace! I\u2019m Avery,\u201d as Avery introduced herself, Quinn quickly realised where you were and her eyes went wide in panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... mom, could you... stand up please,\u201d normally Quinn wouldn\u2019t be struggling to find the right words when speaking to Becky, but this was a delicate situation and you were potentially in a lot of danger if she couldn\u2019t get you away from her mom. \u201cYou\u2019re sitting on my other roommate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Sorry Quinnie, but I think I\u2019d have noticed if I had sat on a whole other person,\u201d Becky giggled at what she assumed was a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo uh... my other roommate isn\u2019t a normal sized person... He\u2019s a tiny guy,\u201d Quinn winced as she said the words, knowing that her mom wouldn\u2019t be pleased that she was roommates with what she viewed to be vermin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh I see. Sorry Quinnie,\u201d without a break in her cheery expression, Becky stood up, revealing your poor crumpled form stuck to the couch cushion. Your tiny body had been utterly obliterated by the meteoric impact Becky\u2019s ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn rapidly peeled you off of the cushion, giving you a concerned look as she did so. You both knew the danger that Becky presented to you, Quinn was actually surprised her mom had stood up to let you go. Worse still, Avery and Morgan were completely unaware of Becky\u2019s opinion of tiny guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that Quinnie, you know how hard it can be for me to see what\u2019s underneath my tush,\u201d she looked at Quinn with care as she said this, but as her eyes glanced down at you they conveyed a threat that you seemed to be the only one to pick up on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn set your slowly reforming body down on the coffee table, since there wasn\u2019t anymore space for you left on the couch. Conversation picked back up again, mostly Becky getting to know Morgan and Avery while also bragging about how amazing she thought Quinn was, much to Quinn\u2019s embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short while you reformed and attempted to join back in the conversation. However, every time you spoke up, Becky seemed to just talk louder and more energetically, drowning out your tiny voice with ease. Whenever she would do this, she would wait till the conversation was no longer focused on her, after which she would glance down at you with disdain. Her expression never shifted from her warm, motherly smile, but you could see the malice in her eyes. <br>\r\nYou also noticed that your roommates, especially Avery and Morgan, seemed to be looking at you less and less as the conversation was going on. You could tell that Becky was trying to divert everyone\u2019s attention away from you, and apart from Quinn\u2019s occasional glance towards you, she seemed to be succeeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Becky\u2019s plan proceed how she wants?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Yes, and Becky manages to isolate you from your roommates.<br>\r\n2) No, and as the conversation progresses, Becky offers to buy everyone dinner.<br>\r\n3) She manages to crush you when she thinks no one is looking, but Quinn spots her doing it. </span></div></div>",

As she did so, she bumped into the coffee table, jostling it and knocking you flat onto your face. Without even a glance backward, Morgan led Avery around the couch and towards the kitchen, pausing by the door. If there was any clear evidence that you\u2019d slipped their minds since Becky\u2019s arrival, that was it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be much more than some lasagna and garlic bread, but you are more than welcome to stay with us for dinner, Miss Wallace.\u201d Morgan offered, and Becky smiled warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s so kind of you dear!\u201d She put a hand to her abundant chest. \u201cI\u2019d be delighted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan nodded, then glanced at Quinn. \u201cWe might actually need your help too, Quinn. We\u2019re a bit behind schedule as is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn paused for a second, and glanced uneasily at you down on the table. \u201cUh\u2026s-sure. Give me a sec.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problemo, Quinno!\u201d Avery lilted with a smile, before disappearing into the kitchen with her twin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to leave you alone with her mother for even a second, Quinn started to stand up, while also reaching for you. However, before she could secure you in her grasp, Becky\u2019s hand shot out and lightly gripped her daughter\u2019s wrist, stopping her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuinn, darling. Go help your friends.\u201d Becky smiled pleasantly. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve hardly let this poor little guy get a single word in during our conversation. Please allow me to get to\u2026know him a little better.\u201d Becky\u2019s expression was nothing but happy and sincere, but even from your perspective down on the table, you could see the glint of ill-intent in Becky\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only assume that Quinn saw it too, but unfortunately, Quinn clearly hadn\u2019t fully conquered her past trauma with her tiny-hating mother. You could practically see the indecision all over Quinn\u2019s face, as she mentally wrestled with the prospects of standing up to her mother. Finally, the fear of damaging one of the few precious relationships she held close to her heart won out, and Quinn relented, withdrawing her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith just another quick glance at you, Quinn shuffled out of the room, and vanished into the kitchen with the Sinclair sisters. All alone in the living room with Becky, you dragged your gaze from the room where your three roommates had gone off to, and over to the absurdly curvaceous and gorgeous form of Becky, who towered far above you even while seated. Her smile remained, but it had taken on a decidedly less friendly appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, you frantically tried to establish some friendly groundwork. Perhaps prove you weren\u2019t just some lay about, perverted tiny. You stammered out a greeting. \u201cUm\u2026hello! My name is Hunter Woods. Don\u2019t know if anyone said it yet! Heh. Uh\u2026nice to meet you, Miss\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t address me by name, bug.\u201d Becky sneered, the blunt coldness of her voice physically shocking you. It was so jarringly different from her clingy and sweet persona from just a minute ago. How could this woman possess two starkly different personalities and portray them both with sincerity? Why did the simple fact of being tiny generate this aura of malice from her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paled, blood running cold. \u201cUh\u2026should I call you something else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky rolled her eyes with annoyance. \u201cUgh, I hate hearing you little bugs talk. Your tinny voices are so grating. Can\u2019t you all just be like other bugs and stay silent?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer overbearing nastiness was beginning to egg you own, and you couldn\u2019t stop yourself from showing some backbone. \u201cHey, tinies are people too. Can you please be a bit nicer? I\u2019m just being friendly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHah! Is that right?\u201d Becky scoffed a harsh laugh, then leaned over you. The shadow her body cast over you enshrouded you in darkness, and your bravado started to shrivel up. \u201cLet me make your pathetic little position clear, bug, by getting two things straight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ticked off one of her fingers. \u201cOne: tinies are not people. They are annoying little nuisances that make real people\u2019s lives inconvenient. Don\u2019t you know what else in the world is an inch tall and squishes pathetically? Bugs! And what are bugs fit for? Being trampled underfoot without a second thought!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky grinned smugly, then ticked another finger off. \u201cTwo: there is no such thing as a tiny being friendly. All tinies are two-faced liars and degenerates. They are perverted little monsters that flaunt their vulnerability and freakish genetics to get sympathy from the bleeding hearts of politicians. All these tiny-rights laws were made by people who don\u2019t know the truth. Not like I do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer impassioned speech, delivered at a quiet but powerful whisper, had completely taken you off guard. Even Quinn\u2019s warning about her mother\u2019s hatred of tinies hadn\u2019t prepared you for as angry a viewpoint as this. Becky\u2019s face was filled with malice and contempt, and just the way she looked at you made it clear that she saw you as sub-human. Beneath her, and hardly worth her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, as she was talking about \u2018knowing the truth about tinies\u2019, there was a small sign of grief in her eyes. Though you could only make an inference, you began to wonder if it was possible that all of Becky\u2019s rage against tinies had been born so long time ago in the past, involving a traumatic incident with a tiny (or a group of tinies). Did she have some sort of past memory that was twisting her current actions in such a way as this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo afraid to ask, you could only stutter out a helpless decree. \u201cI-I don\u2019t know\u2026what to say, ma\u2019am. I don\u2019t a-agree with you. I think I\u2019m a pretty normal guy just trying to live my life. Finding a home with my new roommates is my perfect chance to get a new start on life and really come into my own. Also, meeting Quinn has\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky had looked supremely disinterested in your rebuttal, up until you mentioned Quinn\u2019s name. Snapping to attention, Becky grinned like a shark securing its prey. \u201cAh! There it is! My precious daughter, my sweet little angel, my Quinnie! You perverted little freaks just want to take advantage of her, abuse her, satisfy yourselves with her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gaped. \u201cWhat? No! Of course not! I consider Quinn to be a great friend!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky waved a hand dismissively. \u201cDon\u2019t lie, because it won\u2019t work on me. I already told you that I know the truth about tinies.\u201d She groaned, and ran a hand through her hair. \u201cDamn. I\u2019ve gotten softer on the bugs. I would\u2019ve never had a conversation with someone like you back in the day. My Quinnie hanging out near a tiny? Bam. Molded into a thong and donated to the local thrift shop. My sweet angel brings a tiny friend home for a playdate? That tiny finds a new permanent home in my underwear drawer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to shake with panic, and glanced nervously between Becky and the kitchen door. All you could hear from the kitchen were laughs and the sound of the oven. Your three roommates were probably having a blast bustling around to whip up dinner, all while you were being berated and insulted by this clearly devout tiny-hater. You seriously doubted a single thing you could say at this point would soothe her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, you took the only option left. You opened your mouth and shouted. \u201cQUINN! PLEASE\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the first syllable left your mouth, Becky rammed her fist down onto the coffee table, splattering your body effortlessly into a mashed blob. Your cry for help died in your throat, and you could just barely hear the sound of boisterous giggling from the kitchen, courtesy of Avery. Her laughter easily drowned out what little cry you had been able to shout before Becky\u2019s intervention, and your roommates remained blissfully unaware of the vengeful mother taking action in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky stood up from the couch as she peeled you from the table, and deposited your crumpled body in her palm. Grimacing down at you with sheer disdain, she sighed. \u201cAnd now, I have the annoying task of finding a suitable way to dispose of you. A fittingly humiliating end to a bug like yourself. Serious enough that maybe, just maybe, you learn your place.\u201d She sighed wistfully. \u201cAt the very least, you won\u2019t ever be able to manipulate my Quinnie ever again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to absentmindedly squeeze and squish your body between her fingers, using you like a makeshift stress toy, as she ran ideas through her head. Try as you might to wiggle or squirm, it was absolutely impossible to escape her grasp now. She had you all to herself, and if some stray miracle didn\u2019t occur now, you genuinely began to fear for your fate. Whatever plan she settled on would not be pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough her exact reasonings for despising tinies were still a mystery to you, it was one-hundred percent clear that you would never, ever receive mercy from Becky Wallace.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHey, I actually have a question for each of you.\u201d You said after a moment. Seeing each of your new roommates look a bit more intently at you after saying that froze you up for a second, and you coughed awkwardly. \u201cI-it\u2019s a little\u2026strange, I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan smiled calmingly. \u201cGo on. You don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to judge you, or anything, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery cheerfully grinned. \u201cAsk away, little buddy! We\u2019d do anything for our tiny new roommate!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn motioned with her head for you to continue. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cleared your throat. \u201cWell, just like you three, I\u2019ve now graduated college. I have a degree in Communications, but honestly, it\u2019s not my passion. I guess I don\u2019t really have a direction in life. I consider myself pretty competent, especially for a tiny, but I don\u2019t have a clue what my future has in store for me.\u201d You paused to shuffle your feet awkwardly. \u201cBasically, I wanted to hear about the jobs that you three have. Maybe that would give me some ideas.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cOh. Is that all? Were you thinking of maybe tagging along with us to our jobs and applying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery practically squealed with delight at the very thought. \u201cEee! That\u2019s so cute!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn nodded approvingly. \u201cMakes sense. Good idea, Hunter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d You replied to Quinn, before looking at Morgan. \u201cMorgan, could you start?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, totally.\u201d The dark brown-haired girl said. \u201cSo, I\u2019ve been working as an assistant employee at this local gym for a little while now. It\u2019s called \u2018Workout World\u2019. It\u2019s your standard gym, with a whole bunch of exercise machines and weights and what-not. We also have a few rooms in the back for special daily and weekly classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter working at the gym for a while, I was just recently promoted. I now teach a weekly yoga class starting\u2026tomorrow, I guess\u2026and I\u2019m really pumped about that. Might have trouble reigning myself in.\u201d Morgan sheepishly smiled, admitting to her intensive workout routine. \u201cBut yeah, other than that I just do odds and ends jobs at the gym. Cleaning, registering new members, helping people with troublesome machines. That sort of thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotcha!\u201d You said, giving her a thumbs up. \u201cThank you for being so thorough. How about you, Avery?\u201d You asked, turning to the pink-haired giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery grinned wildly. \u201cOkay, so like, I have the best job in the world. I\u2019m totally pretty, right?\u201d Avery struck a pose and giggled, earning a nod from you and Quinn, and an eye roll from Morgan. \u201cApparently, other people totes think so too, because I got recruited right out of high school to be a model! And, and, and\u2026\u201d Avery nearly hyperventilated. \u201c\u2026I just landed the biggest gig of my life. I\u2019m going to be a featured model for Starlight Studios!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a nerd and don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d Avery stuck out her tongue at Morgan playfully. \u201c\u2026Starlight Studios is a really huge photo agency near here. I\u2019ve been there a few weeks, and it\u2019s uber heaven! I can just wear cute outfits all day, pose for the camera, and come home with so much dough! Best of all, there totes aren\u2019t any tiny models working at the studios, so you\u2019d have a hella easy time getting hired!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a moment to take all that in, then nodded. \u201cUh\u2026thanks Avery. That sounds like a lot of fun. What about you, Quinn?\u201d You inquired, looking at last to your final roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black-haired girl shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not much, really. Nothing special. I wanted to get outside and around people a bit more, so I applied as a lifeguard at the beach near here. \u2018Sanderson Beach\u2019, heard of it? Anyway, they picked me. I\u2019ve been working there for a month now. It\u2019s not too bad, I guess, though the sun is hell on my skin. I have to put sunscreen on twice a day, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026yeah, it\u2019s as simple as it sounds. I\u2019m either assigned to sit in one of the lifeguard towers and look out over the beach for any signs of trouble, or I patrol the sands, up and down the beach, and help people that way. Boring, but the right kind of boring.\u201d She paused. \u201cAnd it feels good to help people out\u2026sometimes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded appreciatively. \u201cOkay, thank you, Quinn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan leaned forward in her seat, a glimmer of hopefulness shining in her eyes. \u201cRealistically, Hunter, you could only take one job. So, who do you want to go into work with tomorrow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery also leaned forward in her seat, though much more dramatically than her twin, and her breasts threatened to spill from her top. It was hard not to look. \u201cYeah, yeah! Who do you wanna tag along with, cutie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn made no attempt to lean in, but she did raise her eyebrow questioningly. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter to me who you go with.\u201d She said nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, you could feel that this was a tremendously important moment, and so you really stopped to think about it. Who did you want to go with, and what job were you looking to pursue?</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cActually, I think that working at the gym would be a pretty easy job for me to handle.\u201d You reasoned. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s probably a lot I could do there that might help out. And I mean, I\u2019m pretty fit for a tiny. I could help show people how to do stretches and stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan smiled warmly. \u201cI agree! \u2018Workout World\u2019 having a tiny fitness instructor helping out would be amazing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell that Avery was pretty upset that you hadn\u2019t picked her, and Quinn seemed mostly indifferent like normal, but with a twinge of disappointment on her face. However, there really was no way around it. It\u2019d be impossible for you to balance three jobs at once. You just decided that you would need to hang out with them later to make it up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day passed by fairly uneventfully. The four of you spend time hanging around and chatting in the living room, eventually transitioning into watching a movie. The movie came after dinner, which was efficiently prepared by Morgan and served by Quinn. It was really just a few frozen meals heated up, but it was still a meaningful gesture and a tasty experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the movie finished, it was nearing ten o\u2019clock at night, and each of the girls meandered upstairs to their rooms. Surprisingly, they each seemed to have forgotten about you, and left you all by yourself on the couch in the living room. You couldn\u2019t really blame them, as this was only the first night for the three girls living under the same roof as a tiny like yourself. Your existence hadn\u2019t become fully routine for them yet. Thankfully, it wasn\u2019t too cold in the living room, and the couch cushion was nice and comfy, so you easily fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke to Morgan standing above you, gently saying your name to ease you out of slumber land. Giggling at your messy hair and bleary expression, Morgan carried you into the bathroom where you freshened up, and then into the kitchen. She fixed herself some cereal, making sure to give you a few crunchy pieces and a bottle cap filled with milk to serve as your own breakfast. It was incredible how good of a caretaker she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, you both got changed into fresh sets of clothes, and you had to fight not to stare too much as Morgan returned from her bedroom wearing only a dark blue sports bra and matching compression shorts. Her clothing left most of her smooth, toned body on full display, while also highlighting and accentuating her sculpted curves. She was like a goddess of fitness, the ideal vision of physical perfection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour staring did not go unnoticed, and Morgan playfully flicked you for ogling her, before picking you up again. Saying goodbye to Quinn, who was eating her own breakfast (Avery was apparently still asleep upstairs), you and Morgan left the apartment. Morgan only took a small bag of spare clothes and a water bottle with her. She walked straight out to her car, and slid inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDepositing you gently in the passenger\u2019s seat, you held onto the tethered seat belt to anchor yourself, and then the two of you were off. It was only a twenty-minute drive to \u201cWorkout World\u201d, and you passed the time chatting with Morgan. She was the only girl you\u2019d ever met outside of your family who treated you respectfully and sincerely, and earnestly treated you like a normal human being. It was an amazing feeling, and a flutter went off in your chest each time she smiled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling up to \u201cWorkout World\u201d, Morgan parked her car, scooped you into her palm, grabbed her bag, and then headed inside. As she approached the gym, you noted that it didn\u2019t look particularly too crazy from the outside. Just a run-of-the-mill gym, but perhaps a bit bigger than normal. It looked like it stretched back for a while, taking up a decent amount of space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis observation was explained when Morgan walked through the door. Exercise machines as far as the eye could see stretched in all directions. Bikes, treadmills, rowing machines, elliptical machines, stair walkers, and more. One whole wall was taken up by a wide array of exercise mats, jump ropes, yoga balls, weights, and other assorted workout props. In the far back, you could see the doors leading to those exercise class rooms Morgan had mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour giantess carrier approached the front desk, where a brilliantly smiling receptionist was waiting. The receptionist stood as Morgan approached, and you verbally choked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist (who appeared to be in her thirties), was dressed in the same attire as Morgan, a sports bra and compression shorts. This indicated she was also a fitness instructor. However, due to being older and more mature, her more developed body strained at the seams of the sports bra and shorts, threatening to snap the fabric at any second. It was an incredibly risqu\u00e9 outfit choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, it would\u2019ve been under normal circumstances. Glancing around the gym, which already had quite a few people in it, you didn\u2019t see a single guy. There were giantesses of all ages, but no men to be seen. Was this a female only gym, or just a random coincidence?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Miss Mayfield.\u201d Morgan waved to the receptionist. It was then that you noted the receptionist\u2019s nametag, pinned proudly to her right breast. It read: \u2018Heather Mayfield, Workout World Director\u2019. Apparently, she was the big boss around here, but it was hard to fully believe that. Something about her aforementioned revealing clothing, and her mane of wavy blonde hair and young-looking face felt out of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMah stars, Morgan!\u201d Heather clapped her hands together and grinned. \u201cIs that a darlin\u2019 lil\u2019 tiny in yer hand?\u201d She asked, pointing to you. Her southern drawl was unexpected, but her tone was light and airy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d Morgan nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s my new roommate, Hunter. He was wondering if he could apply for a job here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather beamed at you and Morgan. \u201cWhy, I reckon\u2019 he can, honey! Shoot, ah\u2019ll draw up the contract fer ya\u2019ll right now!\u201d The buxom woman bent over to dig around in her desk for a paper and pen, and you couldn\u2019t help but notice the pendulum swaying motion of her tits as she did so. It was difficult to imagine this curvy woman leading any fitness classes. She reminded you of your own mother, actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she stood back up, contract in hand. Placing it proudly on the desk in front of you, you hopped down from Morgan\u2019s hand and read it carefully. Everything seemed to be in order, so with some help from Morgan, it only took you a minute to sign your name. You were now an official member of the \u2018Workout World\u2019 team. That was easy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling down at you in a friendly manner, Morgan gave you a thumbs up, then returned her attention to her boss. \u201cSo, Miss Mayfield, what\u2019s on my agenda today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather waved dismissively at Morgan. \u201cMorgan, honey, ah told ya to call me Heather. But, anywho, yer main job today is to teach that yoga class. \u2018Sides that, just help out \u2018til yer shift ends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what should I do Miss\u2026er\u2026Heather?\u201d You spoke up, striking a confident pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather laughed uproariously at your show of bravado, infectiously guffawing for a solid thirty seconds before calming down. \u201cYou, lil\u2019 mister, have a special task fer yer first day. Ready fer it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded enthusiastically, and Heather cleared her throat before continuing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cThere are two big thangs every gym employee needs ta know!\u201d Heather smiled warmly at you, but with an earnest and serious look in her eye. \u201cOne: Ya gotta know yer stuff. How else can ya help out? Two: Ya gotta be all comfy-like around strangers. I\u2019m expectin\u2019 ya\u2019ll to help anyone in need, and ya have ta be ready fer that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded vigorously. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sure I can handle that, Heather!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather\u2019s intensity eased up a little. \u201cI know ya can, little guy. I believe in ya, Hunter. Tha\u2019s why yer first task is ta co-teach with my darlin\u2019 Morgan. Both of ya can work together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis surprised you slightly, but also made a reasonable amount of sense. You just hoped Morgan wouldn\u2019t feel like you were intruding on her personal class. \u201cO-of course, Heather. I\u2019d be glad to help Morgan out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather grinned. \u201cGlad to hear it, honey. Off ya go, now! Reckon\u2019 yer class is startin\u2019 any minute now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, you and Morgan were off. Morgan placed you back in her hand, and you held on nice and tight as she walked quickly towards the back of the Workout World gym, towards one of the side rooms. Slipping inside, you found the room empty of people, but filled with a surplus of exercise gear and supplies. About twenty, tan-colored yoga mats were spread out in rows facing a singular red yoga mat (presumably Morgan\u2019s).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Hunter, first day on the job! It\u2019s pretty awesome that we\u2019ll be co-teaching.\u201d She said, beaming at you. This alleviated your earlier worry. \u201cThough, you might want to let me field day one, and just copy my movements. Honestly, can\u2019t imagine that you\u2019ll be too much help for people behind the first row.\u201d The dark brown-haired giantess smiled sheepishly at you. \u201cMaybe later on we can have you walk around with the girls for more focused help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused. \u201cThe girls? And the guys too, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan actually blushed, faintly. \u201cUh\u2026no. No, sorry Hunter. This class is entirely female. You\u2019ll be the only guy.\u201d She admitted, and try as you might, you couldn\u2019t help but let your jaw drop open. This brought Morgan\u2019s teasing nature back, and she smirked playfully. \u201cWon\u2019t be a problem, will it, Hunter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cU-uh\u2026nope! N-no problem, Miss Sinclair.\u201d You hastily saluted, hoping comedy would detract from your obvious fantasizing about this upcoming class. It apparently worked, as Morgan rolled her eyes at your antics and dropped the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also dropped you, though quite gently, squatting down to the floor and depositing you onto her red yoga mat. The view of the class was significantly different from such an angle, as was the view of your beautifully, revealingly dressed roommate and co-teacher. Half of Morgan\u2019s face was blocked by her breasts from the vantage you were now at. It was very, very hard to not stare at her toned, lithe figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching your eye, Morgan motioned to the mats spread across the floor. \u201cIf you\u2019re curious why no one is here, that\u2019s because everyone usually shows up right as the class starts.\u201d Morgan shrugged. \u201cIt makes sense to not show up early. I mean, we stretch and do warm-ups in class, so what could you even accomplish by coming early?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I suppose!\u201d You said, raising your voice just a bit so that she could hear you without bending back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t stop me from doing a few quick stretches to limber up!\u201d Morgan smiled, and instantly launched into a few toe-touching and yoga posing warm-ups. You decided to follow suit, copying her movements as best you could, albeit on a one-inch scale. Morgan was a master, but you found her moves so succinct and smooth that even you could keep up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, it was hard not to notice how close her left foot kept drifting towards your body on some of her stretches. Her toes, sliding along the yoga mat, came quite close to making you uncomfortable, as you knew it would only take a slight shift on Morgan\u2019s part to bury you completely under them. Glancing up at Morgan, you noted a content but focused expression on her face, and realized that she really did zone out while exercising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, and the rest of the class arrived almost simultaneously, proving Morgan correct. Your own fantasies were also instantly confirmed, as it seemed that every single woman entering the class was utterly and unfathomably beautiful. Curvy, lean, beautiful, and alluring, each new girl caused your jaw to drop even further. This was to say nothing of how their tight workout clothing drew your eyes to them even more. Some girls wore yoga pants or tank tops, and some had booty shorts and sports bras even skimpier than Morgan\u2019s own revealing attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last girl in the room closed the door, and noticed that the last empty yoga mat was right in front of Morgan. Cutting through the room, she smiled politely at Morgan and took up position on the mat. However, as she steadied herself, her gaze locked right onto you, your miniscule form still down at Morgan\u2019s feet. You gave her a wave, trying to appear confident. The girl raised her eyebrows, then smiled flirtatiously and gave you a wink. THAT certainly was a little foreboding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl had pretty long black hair that was tied back in a messy ponytail, and judging from the shape of her eyes and face, and her tanned skin tone, she was of some Asian descent. She was a fairly curvaceous giantess, but her eye-catching curves were exasperated further by her one-size too small tank top and ludicrously minimalistic booty shorts. At the point they were at, they looked more like panties, revealing her long legs all the way up to her crotch, and most of her ass, if you had to guess. She almost certainly had nothing but a thong on underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept staring at you with a seductive grin, but broke her gaze when Morgan spoke up. \u201cAlright, girls! My name is Morgan Sinclair, but you can just call me Morgan. This marks the first day of our all-encompassing exercise class. Over the next few months, we\u2019re going to be doing everything you\u2019ve ever imagined goes on inside a gym, and much more. Stretches, poses, usage of equipment and machines\u2026you name it. It WILL be exhausting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThankfully, I\u2019m not the one who has to lead you through this alone. Joining me in this endeavor of teaching the class is my good friend, Hunter. In case you don\u2019t see him\u2026he\u2019s down by my feet.\u201d As one, all twenty girls taking the class peered down at Morgan\u2019s feet, and locked eyes with you. Any speech you had prepared died on your lips as twenty beautiful, sexily dressed giantesses stared at you intently. Some had looks of surprise, others happy expressions, a few matched the flirtatiousness of the girl in front of you, and a few even looked disgusted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan drew eyes back to her. \u201cYes, he\u2019s a tiny, and by extension, a guy. There will not be any other guys in this class, as Hunter is the exception. He just joined as an employee of this gym, and needs all the experience he can get. He\u2019ll help all of you out, just make sure to treat him nicely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stammered out a welcome. \u201cI-I look forward\u2026to h-helping!\u201d Your feeble reply was so quiet that no one in the class seemed to even hear it, not even Morgan, who was already pushing out with her introductory spiel. Only the girl in front of you, her eyes constantly flicking down to you, seemed to pick up on your pathetic statement. She flashed you a quick smile and another wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan went around the room asking everyone to give their name, their estimated level of exercise experience, and one fun fact about them. You lost track of names almost immediately, even though Morgan demonstrated enviably capability in memorizing everyone\u2019s name. To your credit, you were still distracted by the girl in front of you, who kept doing seemingly absentminded things like adjusting her tank top or picking at her shorts. However, from the way she never tore her gaze from you, you knew all her casually seductive actions were on purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was last to enter, she was last to introduce herself, and your flirtatious terrorizer smiled broadly to the class. \u201cSup everyone! My name is Aoi, and I\u2019m stoked for this class. My level of exercise is\u2026probably moderate? I do a lot of stretches and yoga, but not much else. A fun fact would be that I find tinies to be the cutest little things! Lucky me, huh?\u201d Aoi gestured to you, and you flushed bright red. A few other girls, and even Morgan, laughed. It was clear that Morgan took Aoi\u2019s statement as lighthearted teasing and nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan gave her class a thumbs up. \u201cAlright, that\u2019s all the boring stuff out of the way! Ready to get into it, girls?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chorus of cheers and shouts answered her, and Morgan prepared to launch into the starting warmups. You did so too, but not without catching Aoi\u2019s eye on last time. The flirty and mischievous glint in Aoi\u2019s eye told you everything. Getting a good exercise was now second priority to her. Having fun with you was her only true goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, you could only hope that Morgan could keep Aoi and the other girls at bay for this first day. Of course, it she got lost in the rhythm of exercise, you\u2019d be practically gone from her world, and left alone to defend yourself. Truly, what had you gotten yourself into?</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWe\u2019re going to start with a few standard standing exercises. Get the blood flowing in our arms a bit.\u201d Morgan explained to the class, then effortlessly switched into holding her arms by her chest and twisting her torso side-to-side. Her motions were slow but deliberate, stretching her muscles nicely while also serving as any easy example for everyone in the class to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mirrored your giantess co-teacher\u2019s display without a problem, and you could only hope the rest of the class would be this easy. As it was, only the first row of girls actually paid you any mind, and even then, Aoi was the only girl to stare at you consistently, her attention seemingly unable to lock onto anything but you. You faltered a bit, under her flirtatiously predatory gaze, but kept up with Morgan\u2019s pace, determined not to fail at your first ever class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan moved on to arm windmills and shoulder stretches, with you and the rest of the class following suit. One of the girls even asked if some light music could be turned on, and after Morgan agreed, soft peppy rock music filtered through the room, helping everyone to get into the mood. You would\u2019ve considered it fun if it wasn\u2019t for Aoi\u2019s continual sultry winks. Truthfully though, it was pretty much heaven, guiding a group of curvaceous beauties through their exercise routines. You couldn\u2019t complain TOO much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good ten minutes or so, Morgan clapped her hands to draw everyone\u2019s attention. \u201cAlright, great job so far, ladies! This is awesome, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Morgan clenched her fist excitedly, earning a few smiles and laughs from the class. It was hard for anyone to resist being drawn up into Morgan\u2019s whirlwind of excitement and passion for exercise. \u201cTime for some stretches for our legs, and then the crazy stuff will come next!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan, without hesitation, plopped down onto her yoga mat, firm buttocks clapping onto the ground. She wasn\u2019t that close to hitting you, but the sight still chilled your blood, and your legs wobbled from the vibrations of her impact. Of course, you straight up fell onto your back as the other giantesses in the class sat down at once, their combined weight hitting the floor causing a veritable earthquake from your perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking yourself up, you caught the eye of Aoi, who was looking at you with a grin, clearly amused by seeing you topple over. Worse still, as Morgan stretched her legs out in front of her to set the example for the class, Aoi did so as well. In a flash, her right foot kicked out towards you, stopping right before coming into contact with your body. You flinched and let out a tiny, almost inaudible cry, and were left with the black-haired girl\u2019s foot hanging precariously over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were just about to crawl back to a safe distance when Morgan spoke up, momentarily distracting you. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s start with some simple stretches. Lean forward and touch your toes, if you can. Some of you more endowed girls might not make it, but any amount of stretching helps.\u201d This statement caused a bit of embarrassed blushing from the aforementioned top-heavy students, but everyone still followed along to the best of their ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being quite abundantly blessed in the chest department herself, Aoi demonstrated unfathomable flexibility by easily leaning all the way forward, bending her back to touch her toes with ease. As she did so, she peered down at you, her smug grin only growing in size as she noticed your horribly failed attempts to avert your gaze from the abyss of her cleavage. Truly, her breasts looked fit to pop right out of her size-too-small top from the simple movements of her leaning forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistracted by Aoi, you missed a girl a little ways to your left, also in the front row, who was visibly struggling with keeping up with Morgan. She\u2019d been one of the girls Morgan had been speaking to earlier, and her astronomically gargantuan breasts were comical in scale, and utterly hindering her movements. Thankfully, Morgan caught sight of her struggle, but you mentally chastised yourself for letting Aoi distract you from your job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s alright.\u201d Morgan said to the girl, focusing all her attention on her. \u201cEasy, slow movements. I know it can be tricky.\u201d Morgan\u2019s tone was soft and soothing, full of encouragement, and the girl (who had looked fit to cry any moment), blushed and gave Morgan a grateful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was going on, mischievous thoughts were spiraling around in Aoi\u2019s head, and seeing Morgan totally absorbed in helping the other girl, she sprang at her golden opportunity. Tilting her foot ever-so-slightly, she was able to press against your head, nearly knocking you off balance. Before you could cry out, Aoi\u2019s bare toes wiggled and lashed out, scrunching your head tightly into a viper-like embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely able to keep her smile hidden, Aoi methodically massaged her toes against your head, crumpling up your squishy body more and more into the crevices of her toes. You fought fiercely against the busty Asian giantesses unexpected attack, but your pitiful slaps against her soft flesh were futile. Soon, she\u2019d bundled your body into a lump, tucked away under her clenched toes and totally hidden from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo less than a second later, Morgan drew her attention back to the class at large, sparing a smile to Aoi (who in turn grinned innocently at her teacher), and then Morgan finished her reps of toe touching. Utterly oblivious to what had occurred, her exercise-focused brain kept her from remembering you, as it instead devoted all of her mental power to running this class perfectly and helping everyone out. You were the least of her concerns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan cleared her throat. \u201cAlright, girls! One more quick stretch for our backs. Tuck your legs underneath yourselves and sit back on your feet. Then, we\u2019ll be leaning forward to try and touch our heads to the yoga mats. Only a few reps of this!\u201d Morgan gave her class a confident thumbs up and then demonstrated the pose. The endowed class members frowned a bit, but followed instructions best they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flexible girls took eagerly to this stretch, Aoi included. In fact, Aoi was riding on cloud nine, hardly able to believe her luck in landing such a perfect routine. The stars had aligned in such a way that playtime with the adorable tiny teacher she\u2019d just snatched off the floor was going to be oh-so-much fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightning fast, Aoi tucked her legs under herself in a kneeling pose, and unfurled her toes. Your mangled body was given only seconds to unfurl a bit from the release of pressure. Spots of dirt and a thing layer of sweat had already rubbed off onto you, and you blinked rapidly to clear your vision. Facing up to the ceiling while lying on Aoi\u2019s foot, you caught a brief glimpse of her gorgeous face displaying a full grin of mischief, before the flirtatious giantess sat back onto her feet\u2026and onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thick, meaty ass filled your entire vision as she sat, deeply tanned flesh nearly on full display as her ludicrously immodest booty shorts had wedged up into her butt crack. With the weight of a meteor from the heavens, Aoi\u2019s plump booty crashed down onto her feet, and right onto your defenseless body. Offering no resistance, your malleable form squelched under her, flattening out into a paper-thin disc against the girl\u2019s exposed left cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoi bit her lip softly as she sat back on her feet, just barely hearing the sound of you squishing to her ass, but also knowing no one else in the class could hear it. She had you all to herself, and she was going to savor every moment she had with the hottie tiny she\u2019d landed as a teacher. Already, her mind was swirling with ideas for how to sneak you back home with her for more fun times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kneeling and bending forward exercise only lasted three minutes or so in total, but it felt like an eternity with Aoi\u2019s immense weight crushing down on you the entire time. Each passing second stuck you more and more to her bare flesh, especially as her continued stretching brought on a fresh layer of sticky sweat to her smooth skin. Smushed face first into her butt, you stuck to her like glue, and began to wonder how hard it\u2019d be to get free once given the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, your heart shattered into pieces a moment later, as through a veil of muffled noises, you just barely picked up Morgan declaring, \u201cOkay, class! Legs back out front, we\u2019re moving onto sit-ups!\u201d Your eyes widened and your blood ran cold, and you could\u2019ve sworn you heard your current captor let out a quiet, pleased chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, seconds later and Aoi unfurled her legs and stretched them out in front of her, while simultaneously allowing her bodacious buttocks to clap down onto the yoga mat. If you\u2019d been crushed before, this was three times as hellish. Your body screamed in discomfort as Aoi\u2019s plush cheeks squashed into the yoga mat, spreading out from the pressure, and conformed around your body like a vice. The heat and sweat doubled, and you began sticking to her skin twice as fast. Now, no sounds could be heard from outside this booty prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse, as soon as Aoi began her sit-ups, her ass gradually ground against the yoga mat in a methodical back and forth motion. Each sit-up scraped her cheeks against you, smearing you into her doughy ass cheek. You felt your body begin to lose its consistency as you were forcefully ironed onto the Asian giantess\u2019 prodigious derriere. You were quickly reduced to not more than sticker on her butt, and if your predicament continued, you\u2019d be a simple little tattoo on her flesh before long.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAlright guys just a few more sit-ups and we\u2019re done!\u201d Morgan exclaimed excitedly to her class. Every one of the women in the class appreciated the upbeat energy and reassurance that Morgan offered as a teacher. Well everyone who could hear it at least. You, meanwhile, were decimated underneath the moderately fit girls sizable ass, only capable of hearing muffled words from your roommate. It seemed like each sit-up from Aoi turned up some metaphorical thermostat of the temperature under her buns, as sure enough her sweat continued to build. The combined pressure of this girl\u2019s warm, jiggly flesh from above and the firm, grippy material of the yoga mat beneath you was torturous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright done! Go ahead and stand up ladies! Take 30 seconds to catch your breath then we\u2019re going to face the opposite direction and start on some Good Mornings!\u201d Morgan said exuberantly once more. Aoi breathed a sigh of relief, she wasn\u2019t painfully out of shape by any means but nevertheless the class was tough. As she finished her last rep she let her back fall onto the ground while her whole body compressed into the mat. Momentarily caught up in the actual exercise, Aoi then remembered the tiny cute guy that she snatched up with her feet then united with her buns. She lifted her head to scan her soles, not spotting you, then smiling deeply as she realized that you had to have ended up stuck to her large ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow finally standing up, Aoi turned around to check out her nearly entirely exposed buns in the floor-to-ceiling mirror on the opposite wall. There she saw your one-inch frame plastered spread eagle on her skin. Thankfully your clothes hadn\u2019t been ripped off quite yet, as they were typically so prone to destruction underneath a giant girl like this. So in addition to the difference in skin tone between you two, your white workout shirt and black shorts stuck out clear as day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoi grinned smugly, just knowing in her mind that you must have been loving every second of this. To anyone else, including yourself,  Aoi\u2019s actions towards you would have been seen as essentially torture, but to the girl herself she honestly believed that this was her idea of flirting. In reality, the giantess had a (somewhat deserved) inflated ego about how irresistible she was to tiny guys like you, and she was simply this forward with her attempts at picking you up. Content with how the situation was progressing, she jiggled her ass ever so slightly to entice you even further. From your perspective, it merely sent waves of nauseating movement through the glutes that you were stuck to, not nearly as attractive as the girl wanted to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this slight moment of showing off from Aoi caught one more person\u2019s eye as well, Morgan! After all, the two were at max a few feet away from each other thanks to her position in the class, so when the Asian giantess spun around to check herself out so clearly, Morgan\u2019s vision locked squarely onto you. Her eyes went wide with realization as she looked down onto her own mat next to her, of course not seeing a thing. She panicked briefly and scolded herself for getting so caught up in the class that she had forgotten all about you. Deciding that she had to be up front and direct for your own safety, Morgan leaned forward and cleared her throat to get the attention of this mischievous student. But just as she did so the door to the workout class swung open, causing Morgan\u2019s view to turn towards it. Standing there was none other than your and her boss, Heather!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShoot, don\u2019t mind me! I\u2019m sure you\u2019re doin a bang-up job here Morgan, I\u2019m just checkin on our new hire!\u201d Heather exclaimed in her admittedly charming southern accent accent. As she walked up beside Morgan, she expected to see you at the head of the class, but when she didn\u2019t she furrowed her eyebrows in confusion. Scanning the room, it didn\u2019t take her long at all to land on the nearly naked girl in the front row. There she too, saw you plastered to this girl\u2019s bubble butt clearly. She then raised her eyebrows in surprise and exclaimed, \u201cWell butter my buns and call me a biscuit! Did he mean to latch onto those buns right there!?\u201d Your boss practically shouted, pointing you out in front of the entire class. All of the women either looked directly at you or at the girl\u2019s reflection in the mirror. A roar of laughter broke out from some women, others giggling slightly, others still putting on a look of disgust at what they considered to be an invasion of Aoi\u2019s privacy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless you were incredibly embarrassed. Nine times out of ten you would want as many girls to notice you as possible when you were stuck in a situation like this. But now was not one of those times. You wanted to prove to Morgan and Heather that you could be a capable employee at the gym, but with your current status as butt sticker you weren\u2019t too sure that the message was being sent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan, meanwhile, was feeling incredibly guilty on her own behalf. She felt like she should have been looking after you, and now thanks to her inattentiveness you were literally the laughing stock of the class. She grimaced visibly, before the gears started to turn in her head. Morgan was no ditz by any means, so thinking on her feet wasn\u2019t much of a challenge to her. In a snap she thought of a way to redirect the situation and hopefully earn you a bit of respect back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! He actually did mean to be there!\u201d Morgan responded enthusiastically, thinking on the fly. Everyone else in the class looked at her incredulously, Heather and Aoi included. \u201cHunter told me before the class started that he would try this technique as a way of teaching the girls to have a mind-muscle connection to specific parts of their body!\u201d She wavered slightly, wondering if the direction she was taking this was actually a good idea or not, but she continued on nevertheless. \u201cHe squished himself against Aoi\u2019s butt so that when we do our Good Mornings next he can wiggle and remind her to activate her glutes, since they\u2019re the most important muscle for the exercise! It\u2019s kind of genius if you ask me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt clearly didn\u2019t take much to convince Heather, since her eyes lit up with excitement upon hearing Morgan\u2019s explanation. \u201cOh dearie me he is already going above and beyond my high expectations for him, wow! How is it working so far, miss?\u201d She gestured at Aoi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoi knew full well that her instructor was lying through her teeth, but nevertheless she knew this was a golden opportunity for her to keep on \u201cflirting\u201d with you without fear of getting in trouble for it. \u201cOh yeah, he\u2019s a miracle worker! I never want to take him off! My workout feels so much more efficient with him back there.\u201d She said, flexing each of her cheeks powerfully as she spoke, eliciting a few more giggles from other girls in the class, even from Heather herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if\u2019n ya don\u2019t mind then I\u2019d sure love to stick around and watch him work for a min!\u201d Heather said, already pulling a chair up to sit in. She was overwhelmingly friendly of course, but she was still the boss at the end of the day and knew Morgan wouldn\u2019t have a problem with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh sure, no problem!\u201d Morgan said a bit nervously. She looked at you once again and reconsidered her actions yet again. She had saved your reputation as an employee, yes, but at the cost of subjecting you to further torture at the fate of this sweaty, scantily clad girl. \u201cAlright ladies, break time is over, we\u2019re going for a minute straight of slow, controlled Good Mornings.\u201d All of the girls in the class began to slowly bend over at the waist. Once again, the more well-endowed women of the class had a bit of trouble with their balance, prompting some quick adjustments from Morgan. But all the while she couldn\u2019t help but empathize with you, watching as your sticker-like body stretched as Aoi bent over, and jiggled when she stood up. Hang in there, Hunter she thought to herself, then shifting her focus back to the class as a whole. Your wellbeing was important to her, of course, but she also took great pride in teaching an effective workout class. Especially with her boss watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat befalls you as the class continues?</span></div></div>",

Every chance she got, the mischievous Asian giantess glanced at the mirrors lining the walls, looking right at your spread-eagled body stretch and contort as Aoi flexed her ass. It was hilarious and adorable, and Aoi was on cloud nine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan, meanwhile, found it difficult to keep demonstrating the technique while avoiding staring at you. You looked so diminutive and helpless on the curvaceous girl\u2019s globe-like butt cheek, so much of her ass exposed thanks to her skimpy as hell booty shorts. Your new roommate could tell how sweaty and flattened you were, yet couldn\u2019t do a thing about it. Especially not with Heather watching the class with rapt attention, a happy, na\u00efve smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Good Morning stretches finished, Morgan snapped her attention from Aoi\u2019s bubble butt and your predicament, and addressed the class. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s keep up the pace. You girls are doing amazing, so next up is squats. Let\u2019s see a good thirty or so, at least!\u201d Morgan declared, earning enthusiastic cheers and quiet groans in equal measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when Morgan caught sight of Aoi\u2019s triumphant grin that the brown-haired fitness teacher felt a sinking feeling in her gut. Sure enough, the playful Asian giantess began easily conquering the squats, dipping very low to the ground with each one. At the same time, her massive derriere clenched tight as Aoi thrust it out, and Morgan could only watch with a small frown as you were pulled even tighter against your flirtatious captor\u2019s thick ass cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her chair, Heather frowned a tiny bit. \u201cMorgan, darlin\u2019\u2026is lil\u2019 Hunter doin\u2019 the thang? Tha\u2019 mind an\u2019 muscle connector thang you were mentionin\u2019?\u201d The somewhat scatterbrained blonde leaned forward. \u201cAh can\u2019t quite make it out\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan winced, and so did you. Exhausted as you were because of Aoi\u2019s treatment of you, you realized that holding up your end of Morgan\u2019s lie was essentially to staying in Heather\u2019s good graces. Mustering what small strength you still had within you, you began twitching and vibrating to the best of your ability. With all your strength, all you could manage was a small jiggle of Aoi\u2019s plump left cheek, but it was enough to catch Heather\u2019s eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh! There it is! What a quaint lil\u2019 idea!\u201d Heather beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan fidgeted with her hands. \u201cUh\u2026yup! Hunter\u2019s pretty smart, isn\u2019t he?\u201d With an internal groan, she forced a smile towards Aoi. \u201cH-how\u2019s he\u2026feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoi grinned radiantly. \u201cJust perfect, ma\u2019am! I love the little guy to death! In fact, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt this motivated to exercise in my life!\u201d Aoi giggled, and reached and hand back to gently rub your body. To Heather, it looked like a simple show of affectionate acknowledgment. Morgan though, could clearly see Aoi lightly press her fingers into your squished body, jamming your head just a bit more into her doughy flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather stood from her chair and moved towards the door. \u201cWell, thanks for lettin\u2019 me into yer class for a bit! You should get \u2018em off their feet for a while, darlin\u2019, after the squats. Maybe some seated splits? Jus\u2019 a thought!\u201d With a parting wave, your boss strolled from the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan paled at the suggestion of more seated exercises, her compassionate brain instantly thinking of what that would put you through. However, before she could say anything, Aoi beat her to it. Having just finished her thirty squats, Aoi wiped some sweat from her brow, inconspicuously slapped her hands against her butt (and of course you, by extension), and spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI second the seated squats, ma\u2019am!\u201d Aoi stated, taking the initiative by hopping right down onto the ground, plopping her meaty buns into place on her yoga mat. There was a faint but audible squelching noise as her swelteringly sweaty ass cheeks clapped into place, and Morgan couldn\u2019t help but wince, especially as Aoi\u2019s fleshy cheeks jiggled and wobbled before settling. She couldn\u2019t even see you anymore, and could only imagine you buried under all of the Asian giantess\u2019 weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Morgan could snap out of her daze, the rest of the class (assuming that Heather\u2019s word was law) followed Aoi\u2019s preemptive beginning by sitting back down and stretching their legs out. Your new roommate, despite being the class teacher, found herself the last person to actually join in the exercise. Glumly, she sank to the floor into a perfect split. Aoi had absolutely outsmarted her, and Morgan knew she couldn\u2019t backtrack now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStuck as you were in your own hell, you didn\u2019t know how this mental war going on. Your entire world was Aoi\u2019s ass cheek now, and it was utterly dominating you in every conceivable way. You were caked in a heavy layer of sweat, which was now gluing you firmly to the buttery smooth skin of Aoi\u2019s left cheek. The girl\u2019s full weight bearing down on you flattened your already stretched thin body even more, on top of making it difficult to breathe and utterly impossible to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing to reign supreme in the flexibility department, Aoi stretched her legs out as far to the side as possible, only taking a second to match Morgan\u2019s perfect split. However, as she did so, her booty dragged and wiggled across the yoga mat, smearing you incessantly. By the time she held the perfect pose, Aoi\u2019s ass had smudged you into closer to a blobby human shape than a defined spread-eagle pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this torment was taking its toll on you, both mentally but especially physically. Though your clothes were still intact for the moment, they were just about all that remained which distinguished you as human. With all the smearing and grinding Aoi was subjecting you to, your body was so glued to her flesh that you were about fused with it, akin to a living tattoo. Even your skin tone was beginning to match her darker tan color, a byproduct of being engrained into her ass. With a bit more effort on her part, Aoi could permanently entrap you in her booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy coincidence or the malice of fate, the entire rest of the class was spent doing seated exercises. You suffered in the sweltering abyss of hell that was being trapped under Aoi for over an hour until the class ended. Your mind was a hazy mess, all of the pounding and grinding Aoi did for that last hour blurring together into an indiscernible torment. By the time Aoi finally peeled her grossly sweaty yet alluring sexy rear end off the yoga mat, you couldn\u2019t feel a difference between your body and her butt cheek at all. The fleshy mound had just about totally claimed you in its warm, doughy embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother tragic event had occurred in that last hour, namely Morgan accepting that freeing you from Aoi would be impossible until after the class. However, what this meant was that Morgan allowed herself to push thoughts of worry for you aside, and focus on teaching to the best of her ability. As she embraced her role and got back into the swing of steady exercise, you slipped further and further from her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, as class ended, eight different girls rushed up to Morgan, bombarding her with equal measures of praise for her teaching skill, and questions about specific poses. With a confident grin, Morgan answered each of their questions in turn, and didn\u2019t notice a single thing as Aoi, mischievous grin on full display, packed up her belongings and slipped out of the room. Each step she took gratuitously shaking her thick glutes, and bouncing you up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoi took a moment to catch her breath, and then sped off towards the gym\u2019s exit. Though she desperately wanted a shower, getting home with you in tow was her primary goal. Aoi could hardly wait to get home and play with you further, imaging the wonderful things she could do with her new tiny boyfriend. In her somewhat off-kilter mind, she was still flirting with you, and she justified that an adorable tiny would obviously be thrilled to love her back. It didn\u2019t click in her mind that maybe a tiny wouldn\u2019t like being dominated by sweat and pain for two hours, and end up as a living ass tattoo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she crossed halfway to the exit, the classroom door swung open, and Morgan raced out. Aoi froze hearing the sound, and spun around instantly, trying to hide her gigantic booty and you from Morgan\u2019s gaze. She managed a pleasant smile as Morgan shouted to her from the door, and said...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAoi!\u201d You felt the cheek you were attached to clench in fear and anticipation as the voice of your roommate and source of salvation rang out. Firmly attached as you were it felt like you were being scrunched up as well, but the pain was well worth it to be saved from whatever this crazy girl had intended for you. Already you could feel your clouded thoughts beginning to clear as you focused on how you would go about separating yourself from the well-padded derriere. Of course you\u2019d probably end up leaving most of the work to Morgan as she- \u201cSee you next week!\u201d \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 What?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, Morgan was an exercise fanatic through and through, and once she was in the zone, it was difficult for her to focus on anything that wasn\u2019t exercise or exercise related. Her first, and so far only, thought on seeing Aoi slip from the room was that she needed to encourage the girl to come back next week. After all, exercise was a lot of fun by yourself, but it was even better when it was enjoyed together. Although her twin did her part to stay fit, Avery wasn\u2019t the kind to enjoy sweating it up with her big sister, so the brunette was always keen to make and keep the acquaintance of people she could work out with. The Asian girl had caught her interest, though she couldn\u2019t quite remember why, just that it would be great if she kept coming to the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, Aoi was ecstatic as she smiled widely and waved back at her newfound yoga instructor. \u201cYeah, sure thing! Wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world!\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure if the other girl had forgotten about you, or had just come to recognise the special bond that was forming, but either way it didn\u2019t really matter. She got to keep her new little boyfriend with her and couldn\u2019t be any happier about it. Waiting for the extra second it took for Morgan to shoot her a thumbs-up and then turn to address another girl, your would-be girlfriend spun back around and practically skipped out the door into the parking lot beyond, an oblivious Heather too busy on the phone to even notice her passing by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, on the other hand, were devastated as you heard the exchange and felt your captor beginning to move once more. If your face hadn\u2019t been so thoroughly smeared into Aoi\u2019s sweaty skin you would have cried at the sheer injustice of having been forgotten so easily, like you didn\u2019t matter. On the car ride over you had thought that you and Morgan were really beginning to bond. She had seemed so careful with you throughout the morning, and she had even spoken on your behalf with Heather. You had deluded yourself into thinking that the two of you were already friends despite what limited time had passed, and had even dared to think that there could maybe be something more. Yet the foolishness of such thoughts had now been laid bare. The brunette had forgotten you because you were nothing but an acquaintance to her, and now you were left to the whims of Aoi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite your morbid thoughts, the reality was that Morgan would remember you. Soon, in fact. And when she did she would do what she could to save you as any friend would. But by then it would be too late and, unable to see anything but the ass before you, you wouldn\u2019t even know she had tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you lamented your fate, Aoi made a beeline for her car, a small two-seater that was her most treasured possession. Well, second most treasured now, after her new little butt buddy. For you the rhythmic clench and unclench of walking paused momentarily as there was the click of the car door unlocking then a quick little jiggle as your curvy tormentor swung around and the grip of gravity as she plopped down into the cushioned seat. The impact wasn\u2019t so bad this time, softer then dropping onto a yoga mat, which would have been a pleasant surprise if only you didn\u2019t feel every undulation of the cheek above travel through own body, indicating the sheer degree to which you had become attached. Worse was the knowledge from years of experience that you were now beneath the driver of a car, which meant that this crazy girl was really going to take you with her to god knows where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly shutting her door and keying the ignition, Aoi shifted into reverse in the same fluid motion and wasted no time in getting her car into motion. Had she looked back to the gym she would have seen the front doors spring open as Morgan rushed outside and looked around desperately for any sign of the girl who had stolen her roommate, but as it was she spared not a single glance as she pulled out onto the street, just one car among many quickly lost among the late-morning traffic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfident that she had made her escape, the tanned girl allowed herself to relax, giving a happy little bounce in her seat as she celebrated her success. For you these were hammering blows even against the plush fabric of the car seat, each producing a wet squish as Aoi\u2019s sweaty ass squeezed the residue of her workout onto your defenceless body. Ordinarily you might have expected the sweat to help loosen your bond, but hundreds of reps had ironed you on so thoroughly that it felt more like your buxom captor was sweating through you than onto you. It wasn\u2019t the first time you\u2019d been attached to someone this badly, but remembering how badly those other times had gone for you didn\u2019t exactly put you at ease. You would very much not like to be stuck here for that long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to your unhappy thoughts, Aoi took the opportunity to finally address you directly, now that she had finally given the two of you a chance to be alone without that Morgan girl interrupting. \u201cEnjoying yourself back there little guy? I know you are.\u201d Though her words were flirtatious she retained the upbeat tone she had used in class, focused on letting you know that she wanted this as badly as you did. \u201cI know how much guys like you like this sort of thing so don\u2019t even try to hide it okay? Here.\u201d There was a click as she flicked a switch. \u201cLet me give you the full experience.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to scream. First, to voice your incredulity that this girl could actually believe that you enjoyed this kind of treatment. Second, to protest as the seat beneath you began to rapidly warm. It seemed Aoi had decided that spending hours being pounded and stretched across her sweating buttocks wasn\u2019t enough of an \u2018experience\u2019 for you, and was now focused on straight-up melting you into a new tattoo as she turned her seat warmer to its maximum setting. Within seconds you could feel your form distorting even more, made all the worse as your misguided paramour began rubbing her buttocks back and forth across the seat, smearing you further as she cooed softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest Hunter, you\u2019re not exactly my first experience, though I guess maybe you could tell that already.\u201d Aoi giggled, realising that the nature of her flirtations had probably already made it clear that she knew what guys like you liked. \u201cMy last little boyfriend had to leave unexpectedly, but I know it\u2019s going to be different this time. You\u2019re such an industrious little guy that you even went and got a job. I just know we\u2019re going to get on great.\u201d People often said she was a lot to handle, and Aoi had wondered before if maybe her last boyfriend just hadn\u2019t felt he was adequate enough for her. It would have been a silly thought for him to have. She got just as much joy out of playing with tinies as they inevitably got from playing with her. There was no need for anyone to feel inadequate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would have been nice if you could dissuade this crazy chick from her flagrant misunderstandings, but you were too busy trying to maintain your sense of self as she continued to wiggle about and smear you between her now even sweatier cheek and the burning seat below. You could feel the fabric of your clothing beginning to catch on the polyester seat covers as your body continued to melt into the undulating flesh of Aoi\u2019s buttocks, and you feared if this continued you really were going to become a tattoo, or even worse, just a slight discolouration on an otherwise flawless ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would take nearly fifteen minutes for the tanned girl to reach her home, and by the time she pulled into a park and switched off the heater you\u2019d been reduced to a largely delirious mass of twisted flesh just barely distinguishable from the flesh above. You had dimly perceived Aoi continuing to talk to you throughout the trip, but eventually tuned out her words as she continued to talk as if the two of you were embarking on some joint enterprise, rather than a one-sided kidnapping. There had been mention of introducing you to\u2026 someone, but you hadn\u2019t caught it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Aoi killed the ignition she took a moment to calm herself before opening the door, almost signing in relief as the cool air hit her skin. She was always willing to go the extra mile for a cute guy like you, but she would be glad to be out from the heated car and maybe get a chance for an actual shower. There were, after all, lots of other ways for the two of you to have fun. By now the buxom girl was sweaty enough that she had to practically peel herself from the seat, and if she noticed when a few strips of white cloth were left behind she didn\u2019t mention it, just reaching back to give her now naked friend a firm squeeze and a quick slap for good measure before sauntering to her front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to resist as you are carried along with the bouncing booty of your tormentor, you could only listen in as a door swung open and Aoi called a greeting as she walked in to meet her\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>[This chapter was written in collaboration with Brucasco]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAunt Minami, I\u2019m home!\u201d Aoi\u2019s chipper tone said nothing of the tiny guy she had trapped against her butt as she entered her home\u2019s kitchen and found her aunt mid-way through the process of preparing a smoothie, the older woman raising a slim eyebrow at how sweaty her niece was but otherwise seeming unperturbed. \u201cWelcome back dear. You\u2019re home sooner than I expected, but if you\u2019re that damp I guess you got a decent work-out in.\u201d She smirked as the younger girl stuck her tongue out in response but smiled genuinely a moment later, switching from teasing to caring in an instant. \u201cThere\u2019s some cold water in the fridge. Cool yourself off before you faint okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomentarily putting you out of her mind, Aoi offered a quick thanks before bouncing over to the fridge to relieve her thirst, giving you your first chance to see Minami head on as your would-be suitor searched for some water and a snack. You guessed that she must have been the younger sister of one of Aoi\u2019s parents since she looked much like you would expect Aoi might look if she had another ten or so years to mature. Leaning against the kitchen counter, her large curves were barely contained by a pair of skinny jeans and a tight t-shirt through which you could see the outline of a lacy bra. Full lips parted slightly as she took a sip of her drink, and you were momentarily reminded of the younger Aunt Norah from your childhood. Just something about that effortless sensuality, which once had been your only relief after hours or days of oblivious usage by your mother\u2019s sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally, if you were capable of it right now you suspect you would have gulped audibly at the sight of such a beautiful woman who wasn\u2019t related to you. For the briefest moment you wondered if maybe being stuck in this house wouldn\u2019t be so bad. As problematic as she had proven, you had to admit that Aoi was an attractive girl, and it did seem that her mistreatment of you was a result of being generally misguided in relation to tinies, rather than harbouring actual malice towards your kind. If anything Minami was even more attractive than her niece, and as of yet seemed the caring type. If you could just get the younger of the two to understand your predicament, or maybe get the chance to explain things to the aunt, you felt you wouldn\u2019t necessarily be opposed to such company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you contemplated your future, Minami glanced over as her niece bent down to rummage around in the freezer for some ice. Placing her drink back on the counter, she was about to make a tongue-in-cheek comment about Aoi\u2019s shorts having been transformed into effectively a thong when her eyes suddenly focused on an odd discolouration on the younger girl\u2019s left butt cheek. Concerned, she leveraged herself into a standing position and turned to face the two of you fully. \u201cAoi, did you sit on something at the gym? It looks like your booty has picked up a passenger there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of you believed that this was your chance of salvation. That you were about to be swept to safety by this beautiful woman who would keep you safe from her niece and return you home, though perhaps not without the promise of a future visit. Most of you though, was unsurprised as you were instead whipped around in a dizzying arc as Aoi spun to face Minami with a gasp of remembrance and an enthusiastic grin as she was reminded of your location. A moment later your world went dark as a hand descended to massage the cheek and you, palm pressing you deep into the still-heated flesh while fingers pressed and prodded at your edges in a tortuous embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWholly convinced that you were as into this as her, Aoi bit back a moan as she assaulted you, the expression not lost on her aunt, who raised her eyebrow again in question. Smiling broadly, the Asian girl spilled her guts with enthusiasm. \u201cYou won\u2019t believe it but that yoga class had a cute little instructor. He was there to help us by stimulating our muscles, but let\u2019s just say he stimulated a lot more than that in me.\u201d She giggled, watching the knowing smirk cross Minami\u2019s lips. \u201cI made my move, and he totally fell for my charms of course, so he ended up coming back home with me.\u201d By this point, she had convinced herself that everything she said was true, even Morgan\u2019s attempt at covering for you with your boss having been assimilated into her own self-fulfilling narrative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you couldn\u2019t she her any more, the happy squeal that Minami emitted told you all that you needed to know about whose side she was on. Your world was rocked as the older woman threw her arms around her niece, now heedless of the sweat. Though Aoi\u2019s return embrace freed you from direct attack, her aunt\u2019s words ensured that any sense of comfort was short-lived. \u201cHehe. You really have a gift when it comes to the little guys don\u2019t you? First Timmy, now this little guy as well.\u201d Placing her chin on the younger girl\u2019s shoulder she smiled down at the smear that she now knew to be a tiny. \u201cMe thinks you should share with your favourite aunt. I always liked keeping little Tim company when you\u2019d bring him around, and you know he enjoyed playing with me as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving expected that response, Aoi just chuckled as she leant into the hug. \u201cWell I can tell you he\u2019s a real go-getter. Got himself a job and everything. So I\u2019m sure he\u2019s got the strength to go around if you know what I mean.\u201d She pulled back slightly and fixed a mock-serious glare on her face. \u201cBut just keep in mind he\u2019s my boyfriend okay.\u201d The glare slipped as she smirked. \u201cYou know sometimes you had me concerned that Timmy was more into you than me. I lost count of the number of times he decided to spend a day in your shoes, or somehow snuck his way into your booty or cleavage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinami blushed and finally pulled back from the hug, hands subconsciously wiping off her arms where some of Aoi\u2019s excess sweat had settled. \u201cAs I told you back then, those where just some games he liked to play. He probably just didn\u2019t want me to be lonely.\u201d Recovering somewhat, she giggled as she placed her hands on her hips and pouted cutely. \u201cDon\u2019t pretend you didn\u2019t have way more fun that the little guy than I ever did. He explored parts of you that he never did with me, and sometimes he\u2019d keep it up for days before we were able to retrieve him. Really, he was such a sweetie.\u201d She sighed regretfully, joined by Aoi as they both reflected on a past now lost to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were terrified as you heard these oblivious women go on about their adventures with the diminutive Tim. Though you had never met him, your own experiences allowed you to easily read between the lines and glimpse what had really happened here. A tiny, probably no more willing than yourself, caught up in the lustful delusions of a then-teenager and her twenty-something aunt. Most likely, neither Aoi nor Minami had ever asked Tim for an actual explanation of how he had ended up underfoot, beneath their butts or anywhere else, merely assuming that he was where he wanted to be, rather than a persistent victim of misfortune. You could only hope that his current lack of presence meant he had moved onto greener pastures, rather than some yet greater misfortune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeedless of your thoughts, Aoi turned to once again present you to her aunt in all of your squished glory, and this time you were less enamoured with the looming woman, whose eyes lit up as they landed upon you. Words from above didn\u2019t exactly put you at ease. \u201cCan you maybe help me peel him off. I like him playing with my butt but he has so much more to experience you know.\u201d Minami evidentially agreed since she wasted no time moving in, her tongue sticking out cutely as she placed one hand on her niece\u2019s back, and with the other attempted to retrieve you from your perch. She did think it was nice of you to want to be so close to Aoi, but if she was honest she wanted you free so that she could spend some time with you herself, maybe even win you over to her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs Minami successful in freeing you, or are you going to be spending more time with Aoi\u2019s ass?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>[This chapter was written in collaboration with Brucasco]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinami\u2019s nails scraped at the edges of your body for a moment, at first seeming to transition from the heated flesh of your paramour to your own twisted form without resistance, before finally catching an edge. A vice-like grip compressed the mangled remains of your foot, before with a wet slurp you were pulled bodily from your prison. Your head was the last part of you to come free, Aoi\u2019s booty seeming reluctant to part with you fully as a last few drops of sweat were squeezed into you before you were finally pulled away entirely, rebounding into the cupped hands of this new threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more mature woman raised her cupped hands until you were mere inches from her full lips, which shifted into a sultry smile as you slowly began to reform. Her warm breath washed over you and a faint flush crossed her cheeks, eyes shining with fascination as you twisted and shuddered. As distracting as it was to be this close to a beautiful, and clearly interested, woman, you put all of your effort into reforming as quickly as possible, hoping against hope that if you could just get the chance to communicate you could at least talk Minami out of buying into her niece\u2019s self-serving delusions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you were starting to look a bit more human, Minami began to speak, likely not noticing that your mouth itself was still too squished to offer a response. \u201cHey there little guy. Welcome to my home.\u201d Her voice came out as a soft coo, words washing over you in heated waves. \u201cI\u2019m always happy to have little cuties like you over, so feel free to come by anytime okay?\u201d She giggled and shot you a wink, lowering her hands slightly until you suddenly found yourself pressed against the overwhelming expanse of her chest, nearly crushed flat against her left breast. \u201cYou can even stay forever if you want, and that\u2019s even if our darling little Aoi decides to strike out on her own.\u201d Despite the giggle, the sultriness of her voice was unmistakable, and you knew she wasn\u2019t joking. Peering up as best you could, you were met with a lustful gaze that this time made you gulp for real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently as oblivious to her aunt\u2019s feelings as she was to yours, Aoi simply laughed at the older woman\u2019s words, playfully shoving Minami and setting off a wave of motion that vibrated through you as well. \u201cVery funny. Now put him down, I can barely see him against your boobies.\u201d Though visibly reluctant to do so, Minami eventually complied, finally giving you a chance to breath properly as she released you from her chest and carefully lowered you to the nearby table, though not without running a single finger up the length your spine in parting, sending a shiver through you. Dropping to all fours, you drew a deep breath through a half-flattened throat before rolling onto your back in relief. Then your eyes bugged out as you looked up at what awaited you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrowded around the table\u2019s edge, Aoi and Minami loomed over you like two goddesses preparing to pass judgement on a tiny sinner. Full chests bumped together softly as they pushed against each other in a silent battle to be closest to their prize, setting off ripples of motion that drew your gaze even as you fought to form intelligent thought. A scant few inches away the tops of their thighs were pressed against the table, the swell of their buttocks only made more prominent as they were squished together, and as much as you tried to block it out you could literally smell their arousal. In a vain attempt to keep your sanity, you tried to focus on their faces, only to produce another audible gulp as you saw lips chewed nervously and twin sets of eyes shining with barely contained desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that this was a situation in which you had to tread carefully, you slowly rose to your feet, clearing your throat as your eyes flicked from one expectant face to another. Your first instinct was simply to call out to Minami that her niece had kidnapped you without your consent, and that you wanted no part of this, but you worried that such would only incite her anger. Worst, she may simply think you were confused, and endeavour to convince you of your true intent. No, you figured your best course of action was to be reasonable and friendly, until such time as you could find safe harbour with someone you knew would listen to your properly. \u201cUm, hello, Ms Minami. My name is Hunter. Thank you for welcoming me to your home.\u201d The bright smile you received in response made you hope that you may yet escape this situation amicably. \u201cRegretfully, I won\u2019t be intruding for long today since I do need to head home before my roommates start to worry about me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour host\u2019s face fell at that, eyes visibly drooping in disappointment, though not in anger or frustration, and for a single glorious moment you believed that your plan had worked. Unfortunately that delicate moment was shattered as Aoi laughed warmly, dismissing your concerns with a wave of her hand. \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about them Hunter. I know what worry-warts roommates can be, but I\u2019m telling you they\u2019ll be just fine.\u201d The Asian girl looked over to her aunt, her happy smile wiping away the older woman\u2019s frown in an instant. \u201cRemember how Tim\u2019s roommate used to chase after me whenever he went missing? She freaked out so much but he was always fine in the end.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking off her previous melancholy, Minami joined in her niece\u2019s mirth, chuckling as she shook her head and looked down at you with kind eyes. \u201cYes, I remember. Katie, if I recall. I still remember that day she came pounding on our door, sweating and heaving after having run around all day looking for little Timmy, and demanding to know if we had him. Or \u2018kidnapped him\u2019 to use her words.\u201d She chuckled again, clearly amused by what she saw as the girl\u2019s obvious delusions. \u201cOf course we didn\u2019t have him, but we helped to look for him as well. After all we wouldn\u2019t have wanted anything to happen to our little Timmy.\u201d She sighed happily, her thoughts drifting back to those happy times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoi\u2019s eyes took on a far off look as she hummed. \u201cHmmm. They finally found him a whole week later after Katie ran her track meet. Basically glued to her insole. The little guy must have crawled inside to give her that extra boost, which obviously worked since she won by a mile.\u201d She smiled ruefully, eyes coming back into focus as she glanced down at you. \u201cThough it would have been nice if he\u2019d told us first so we didn\u2019t have to worry.\u201d Her gaze was both friendly and inviting. \u201cThe two of us nursed him back to health of course. I mostly kept him close to me, but sometimes I let Aunt Minami have him when I was busy. We kept him safe and secure the whole time.\u201d She punctuated the statement by jiggling her sizable assets with a grin, letting you know exactly where they kept him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrambling to regain some sense of control you chuckled nervously, tactfully not voicing your own concerns regarding Tim\u2019s experiences. \u201cThat was\u2026 very nice of you. But I should at least give my roommates a call. After all, you don\u2019t want them panicking like this Katie girl and coming looking for me.\u201d You left out the part where you were pretty sure they had no idea where you even were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Minami\u2019s just smiling widely, reaching down to ruffle your hair but nearly knocking you to the ground in the process. \u201cYou\u2019re such a caring guy Hunter. I\u2019m so glad my niece found such a great boyfriend.\u201d Pressing down with a bit too much enthusiasm, her thumb smushed the features of your face before you could voice an objection. Beside the older woman, Aoi leant in to get closer herself, heaving chests competing for space as hungry eyes drank you in. \u201cRight! I\u2019m the luckiest girl in the world, though\u2026\u201d She shifted herself into a sexy pose, leaning back against her aunt\u2019s side as she stuck out her chest and made sure you got a good look at her booty as well. \u201cYou\u2019re not so unlucky yourself.\u201d Your mouth went dry as Minami chuckled and moved to copy her niece\u2019s pose, her own rear pressing firmly against the younger girl\u2019s while she bounced her chest for your benefit. With two heavenly bodies looming above you, posing for your attention, you felt far too many things to even put into words, your mouth just hanging open dumbly as your brain took a moment to reboot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSqueezing your eyes shut, you tried to get your mind back on track, only to gasp out loud as firm fingers suddenly wrapped around your waist and you felt yourself hoisted into the air. Your eyes snapped open to find yourself face-to-face with pursed lips and in the next instant your head was plunged into their hot embrace, your every sense overloaded by their wet pillowy embrace. A warm blast of air swept over you as the lips parted and for a terrifying instance you thought you may be sucked into the maw, before you were finally pulled back, relief washing over you as you looked up into sparkling eyes. Your own breath came rapidly as the mouth which had just threatened to eat you whole twisted into a warm smile and [Name] spoke to you in a happy tone, saying\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your captor was practically skipping as she strolled into her two bedroom townhouse, happily slamming both her booty and yourself into the door with a wet slap to send it swinging back into place. Momentarily dazed by the sudden impact, you missed the initial exchange as she called out a greeting and was drawn into the living room, the ringing in your ears finally fading to a manageable buzz part way through a sentence. \u201c-never guess what happened at my yoga class today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere you able to speak right now you would have screamed out that what had happened was that she had kidnapped you, but your attempts to scream did little but send a small vibration through the flesh that was filling what remained of your mouth. The only response you received was in the form of a minor earthquake as Aoi wiggled in response to what she interpreted as a sign of affection. You would have tried to scream again had you not become aware of another presence in the room, their form obscured from your current vantage point and voice muffled to your ears. \u201cWere you flirting with an instructor again? Or \u2018being friendly\u2019 as you insist on calling it.\u201d That voice. It was familiar to you even through the static at the edge of your hearing, but you couldn\u2019t quite\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loss of your clothes to the fibres of the car seat had removed the last visible sign identifying you as anything other than an off-colour smear across your tormentor\u2019s left butt cheek, and experience had taught you that you now had little hope of reforming without external help or several hours of uninterrupted progress. Which meant that a lot could be riding on the owner of that voice. You\u2019d met your fair share of women thanks both to your myriad experiences through schooling, vacations, and the many \u2018jobs\u2019 that your aunt had recruited you for, but you hadn\u2019t spoken to many in detail, and you knew that this voice was more familiar than that. Which narrowed it down considerably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeedless of your thoughts, Aoi smiled widely as her roommate stood to greet her, bouncing on her toes a little and setting off another tremor that rippled through your battered form. \u201cWell, you\u2019re part right.\u201d Really, she wasn\u2019t sure why so many people seemed to think she was flirting with them. She was friendly sure, but she had no real interest in normal-sized guys, or girls for that matter. No, her real flirting and affection was reserved for the tiny guys who had long ago stolen her heart. Like the diminutive hunk that was still hugging her ass with everything he had and then some. \u201cI met a little cutie in my yoga class. You could say that we really hit it off, so I\u2019ll be leaving the singles club.\u201d She didn\u2019t mention that she\u2019d brought you home, but did reach back to firmly cup her own butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as the palm of Aoi\u2019s hand forced your face deeper into her flesh, you could almost hear the eye roll in her roommate\u2019s voice. \u201cFor you to call them that, you must be talking about a tiny right? I thought that class was girls-only, how did you even\u2026\u201d A pause. \u201cWhatever. Just promise me you actually gave the guy a chance to talk this time. We don\u2019t want a repeat of last month\u2019s fiasco.\u201d With each word spoken, the pieces started to fall into place, and all at once you recognised exactly who this was. The cadence. The tone. The lyrical notes of a suppressed laugh. It was a voice which had meant both damnation and salvation for you in years past. The voice of your little sister Tracy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small light of hope began to shine in your mind. If Tracy was here, if you could just get her to notice you, then perhaps you could get out of this situation. Though the two of you had certainly had your issues in the past, ever since you had come home from college that first time she had proven herself to be a reliable ally, and one who was committed to making amends for past wrongs. Even as you thought that, you were brought closer as Aoi giggled and moved forward, her hands moving away as she sought a hug from your larger sibling. \u201cOh, don\u2019t be mad. I\u2019m telling you that guy wanted to play with my toes. Just because his wife got mad about it doesn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t having fun.\u201d That woman should have been thanking her for showing her how to really handle her lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA splayed hand to the face stopped your delusional tormentor in her tracks as Tracy protected herself from the impending assault. \u201cDon\u2019t. You\u2019re dripping all over. Take a shower you duffus.\u201d Her tone was teasing and not without affection, but with an underlying tone of severity that warned of consequences if the sweaty girl tried her luck. A shake of her head sent the brunette\u2019s braids swinging and she sighed at her friend\u2019s usual exuberance. \u201cAnd you know it\u2019s because you talk like that that I don\u2019t want to introduce you to my brother.\u201d Or, more accurately, it\u2019s because she had never been able to shake the feeling that Aoi would run off with you the first chance she got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling playfully, Aoi relented her attempts to embrace your sister, though scoffed at the latter statement. \u201cHmph, he would have loved me and you know it.\u201d She sighed wistfully at what could have been, while you were chilled to the bone at the revelation that such a fate had been hanging over you, held at bay by your sister alone. And yet, somehow the universe had delivered you to this crazy girl\u2019s clutches regardless, like it was playing a game with y-. Your thoughts were interrupted as your tormentor\u2019s hand descended from the sky to deliver a powerful slap to her own rear, leaving a temporary imprint of her hand against the cheek and your twisted body as you jiggled in place. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s missing out on all this, while my new little guy is going to get it all to himself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou silently groaned at this latest assault, while simultaneously wishing you could get your would-be paramour to see that neither you, nor any tiny you had ever met, appreciated this kind of treatment. Apparently done with the discussion, Aoi turned to leave, and you got the chance to actually see your sister for the first time as you stared out from the retreating posterior through eyes blurred by hours of endless crushing. For a moment you thought that she might actually see you as her eyes involuntary flicked to your bouncing prison, but they diverted themselves quickly with a slight blush and you were left behind to be carried away from your only immediate hope of salvation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour last glimpse of Tracy was your sister dropping back onto the girls\u2019 tan coloured couch before she was lost to you all together as Aoi turned a corner and bounced into her own room. It was difficult to see from your location but it was a fairly typical room all told, dominated by a bed against one wall and a computer desk against the other, with a dresser sandwiched between. A few stray clothes and knickknacks were spread around, which were quickly added to as your captor slipped off her top and shoes before moving to peel her booty shorts from where they had been practically devoured by her cheeks. For a moment your vision darkened as you were pressed between the sweaty fabric and the warm flesh of the Asian girl\u2019s rear, but any hope of being peeled away with the shorts quickly faded as they dropped to the ground and left your prone form behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow clad only in a thong that was little more than a couple of strings, Aoi bundled up her discarded clothing and dumped them into a nearby laundry basket before gathering a fresh set from her drawers. As she moved she engaged you in a one-sided conversation now that she was confident her roommate was out of earshot. \u201cWe still need some more personal time I think, but don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll introduce you to Tracy latter. She acts coy about it, but she knows how to treat a tiny properly. Her little brother is a cutie just like you, so she\u2019s had years of proper handling experience.\u201d She giggled at the comparison, unaware of just how close she was hitting to the mark as she bounced her way into the adjoining bathroom, her now barely contained booty jiggling along behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to tell this crazy girl that he wasn\u2019t someone like you, he was you. Aoi\u2019s words made you wonder just what exactly Tracy had told her roommate about your teenage years and what she had done to you. While you knew it would be hypocritical, you did wish that your sister would keep those kinds of stories to herself, and avoid putting any weird ideas in her friends\u2019 heads. As the sound of running water burst into life, you knew from experience what would come next, your last clear view of the room being the sight of a bouncing ass reflected in the room\u2019s mirror, with the discolouration that was you barely even visible to your own eyes. You couldn\u2019t help but reflect that the chance to see an attractive girl in the nude wasn\u2019t remotely worth the price you\u2019d had to pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only slim hope you had was that the shower would at least free you from your prison, giving you some small chance to escape or at least explain your plight, but is that even possible anymore?</span></div></div>",

After spending hours being ironed on to your captor\u2019s ass by a barrage of heat and pressure, you had some small hope that the sudden change might free you, but alas you remained firmly attached, even as your body began to shiver from the temperature loss. A joyful murmur from above suggested that, if she felt you at all, Aoi assumed you were vibrating in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time you had been carried into a shower attached to a woman, deliberately or otherwise. In the past though, your attachment had been rudimentary at best, and the flow and the pressure of the water had been enough to free you, if not always for the better. This time, even as Aoi turned and a jet of water struck you directly, you could feel the moisture flowing over you, the last tiny pockets of air that had persisted between yourself and the bodacious girl\u2019s skin sealed shut as water flowed through them and adhered you yet further with a wet slurp of bonded flesh. The humming from above grew louder as hands roamed, and you were pressed deep once more as fingers probed your exterior, apparently making sure that you remained where you belonged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother shift freed you from direct assault, though rivulets of water continued to stream across you from high above, flowing down the gentle curves of your tormentor\u2019s back and across the swell of her booty to find your form. Your stomach dropped as you were suddenly launched into motion, and for a heart-stopping moment you almost thought you saw another booty approaching before the truth was rammed home with crushing finality as you found yourself slammed into the glass wall at the back of the shower. Your attempt to groan was smothered by shifting flesh as Aoi fiddled around with the bottles at her feet, unknowingly smearing her little boyfriend across the glass with a soft squeak as she moved side to side. It was over as suddenly as it began as the Asian girl righted herself and poured a generous serving of liquid soap onto her retrieved loafer, ready for a thorough clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough deep down you had known it was coming regardless, the first real warning you had of your looming fate was the few suds that slid across you as Aoi began to lather her upper body, diluted from their trip down her body but still carrying enough of a sting to irritate your flesh. Though skin was skin, yours was significantly thinner than a normal humans\u2019, and you never did react well to the kinds of powerful chemicals that tended to inhabit most products. As the humming above increased in volume and morphed into an off-key rendition of some pop tune, you put your all into attempting to wriggle free, not wanting to face what was to come even though you knew it was a hopeless fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeedless of your fears, Aoi was enjoying herself immensely as she lathered her chest, taking more time then was needed to tease the sensitive flesh as she thought of her newfound little lover and the many things she would be able to do with him from now on. Though she was content to let you keep loving her booty for the time being, she couldn\u2019t wait to introduce you to everything she had to offer. At the gym she\u2019d given you a brief experience of her dexterous toys, but there were so many other things you were yet to experience. Just the thought sent a chill down her spine that had nothing to do with the cold water, as she finally moved away from her chest and quickly washed down her arms and stomach, reminding herself that there was no need to wait to play with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she couldn\u2019t see your location, your delusional captor did remember that you were pressed against her left cheek, ironically displaying a better capacity to keep track of you then most people who were actually concerned with your safety. For you, this meant being given a last few moments to pointlessly struggle as you watched the opposite mound of flesh being lathered up, your prison jiggling in sympathetic motion before the creeping shadow drifted over you as well. For Aoi, a shock ran through her as the loafer finally made contact with your body, the minor difference in sensation enough to break her off-key melody with a soft moan. Pushing deeper, she cleaned with a newfound enthusiasm, massaging her ass as she felt the lingering fatigue of her yoga session draining away. \u201cHmm. Don\u2019t worry little guy, I\u2019m going to make sure both of us get as clean as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile you were feeling anything but relief as you once again felt the crushing weight of being pressed deeply into your crazy paramour\u2019s bouncing flesh. The last of the sweat that you had been sure would be permanently ingrained into your skin was swept away, only to be replaced with the stinging soap, as it poured into every knock and cranny of your tortured body. The endless scrubbing tinged your skin red as the relentless strokes bombarded you from every direction, while you were forced to squeeze your eyes shut to combat the risk of losing your sight completely. You were deep enough now that you could feel the solid mass of muscle beneath the gelatinous flesh, pressed into the unforgiving surface and ground against it like you were being snuffed out against a rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar more time than necessary was spent on this torture until Aoi finally deigned to move to the rest of her body, though not without a displeased noise as she glanced at her loafer and found you had not been carried along. Really, she appreciated a guy who could see the value of her booty, but she did want to get you off of there eventually. Still, there was time yet. Half-blinded and deafened by the abuse you had endured, you were given a precious few minutes to regain your equilibrium, interrupted only by another brief make-out session with the shower wall as Aoi bent over to clean her feet, this time aware enough of your presence to giggle as your prison vibrated against the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the two of you exited the shower your body had at least become somewhat more prominent against the Asian girl\u2019s cheek, a red splotch of stretched skin looking something like an unfortunate friction burn. Despite the blemish on her otherwise flawless posterior, Aoi couldn\u2019t help but giggle slightly at the sight as she looked into the mirror over her shoulder while quickly towelling off. The scrubbing from the towel was thankfully brief as it swept over you, though it likewise did nothing to free you as that joyful voice boomed from above. \u201cHehe. I couldn\u2019t tell too clearly before but you\u2019re really spread-out there huh. What do you think, have you had enough of my booty yet?\u201d Another giggle, as if the very thought was ludicrous. \u201cWell, I know you love it but there is more of me to explore you know. My last boyfriend had a blast exploring all of my mountains and valleys, and I\u2019m sure you will too. Don\u2019t worry though, my booty will always be there for you as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally. As much as you wanted to protest Aoi\u2019s ideas about your intentions, more than anything you just wanted to get free from her ass. If you could just get the chance to reform a little maybe you could explain to her that you didn\u2019t want this, or better yet maybe get Tracy\u2019s attention. You knew if you could just make yourself known to your little sister that you\u2019d be home free. Whether the brunette would take you back to your roommates or insist on taking you somewhere \u2018safer\u2019 was up in the air, but at the very least she wouldn\u2019t leave you here. Unfortunately, thoughts of freedom were cut short as close-cut nails began to scrape around your edges, passing seamlessly from tanned flesh to red as they failed to catch the seam. Each time you thought they might catch the moment passed and your heart dropped again in concert with a downward twist to your tormentor\u2019s lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time you\u2019d been ironed onto someone\u2019s flesh like this, though it wasn\u2019t like you\u2019d ever gotten used to it either. When it got this bad you generally required either time to reform or a significant effort from someone who had intimate knowledge of how you worked, something which you suspect Aoi lacked despite her apparent experience with your kind. Sure enough your captor huffed out a breath as she shook her head, and placed a hand on her hip. \u201cGeez, you really are just like Timmy aren\u2019t you? He latched onto me like this sometimes as well. Wouldn\u2019t let go for days even. And like, I appreciate the devotion but don\u2019t you think it\u2019s more fun to play with all of me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot for the first time you wanted to object to the idea that any of this was your choice, but you remained unable to voice any such concerns. The towel returned to scrub you again, but had no more luck than the probing fingers, only succeeding in reddening you further. At this point you weren\u2019t sure if it was a blessing or a curse that Aoi at least knew where you were. In the past you had been both stuck unaware to women like your mother and aunt, as well as stuck for days by clients who had deliberately abused your form. Honestly, it was hard to say which was worse. At least knowing you were there meant there was some hope of being eventually released.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief moment you were plunged into shadow as a fresh pair of panties were pulled over you, only to be revealed once more as Aoi tugged the underwear up high enough to turn it into a thong, smiling at you once more over her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m not going to cover you up. You\u2019re a bit of a perv, but I\u2019m still proud of my little boyfriend.\u201d She gave you a little rub in recognition that you assumed was supposed to be comforting rather than another painful crushing. \u201cNow, why don\u2019t we\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Truthfully, Aoi was happy that her new boyfriend was so in love with her derriere, but she really did want the chance to show you what the rest of her had to offer. She\u2019d let you sleep with her butt if it was what you wanted, but you should at least explore other possibilities. You\u2019d had some chance to become acquainted with her feet, but they had a lot more to offer than you\u2019d seen so far, not to mention that you hadn\u2019t been introduced to her breasts or lips yet. Hell, maybe she\u2019d even get Tracy in on things, just as long as you remembered who your girlfriend really was. Speaking of her roommate, the brunette might offer a chance to remove you from your current perch. Grabbing at one\u2019s own butt was hard, and it wasn\u2019t like the other girl didn\u2019t have some experience. With that thought in mind, the Asian girl pulled on a loose top and bounced her way back to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom your unwanted prison you could dimly hear the sound of the TV as your captor approached your sister and sole hope of salvation, only for your stomach to lurch as you were suddenly launched into the air and then pounded into mush as Aoi\u2019s tremendous weight slammed down on you. Even the cushioned surface beneath could do little to soften the blow as it was instantly compressed. The heat which had faded with the shower returned instantly, and you groaned silently in pain. For her part, Tracy just rolled her eyes as her roommate leapt over the back of the couch to slam down on the couch beside her, eyes briefly flicking down to the unrestrained motion of the other girl\u2019s chest before she scoffed and diverted her gaze. \u201cSeriously sparkles. You really need to wear a bra.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoi waved the complaint off with a giggle, grabbing onto the other girl\u2019s right arm and snuggling it to her chest. \u201cHush you. We\u2019re just watching a movie, it\u2019s fine.\u201d She punctuated the comment with a wiggle that dragged you roughly across the cushion beneath and an affectionate squeeze to Tracy\u2019s arm, momentarily putting aside the reason she had come in the first place to just relax with her friend. Used to such behaviour, your sister just rolled her eyes again and turned back to the TV, surrendering her arm for now as moved the remote to her left and turned up the volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next half hour you suffered in silence beneath Aoi\u2019s rear, the rising heat and pressure of your prison punctuated only be the occasional wiggle or bounce from above, possibly a reminder that your would-be paramour hadn\u2019t forgotten you, and maybe just a reaction to the rising tension playing out on screen. A light sheen of sweat was forming again, lubricating you once more as it began to mix into your own pours, as if claiming you as a part of another\u2019s body. In the world above, Tracy had eventually managed to retrieve her arm, but found a new annoyance in her roommate\u2019s constant movement, eventually snapping and asking what exactly she thought she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving been waiting for this moment, Aoi beamed excitedly, shifting over so that her thigh was pressed against your sister as she dragged you beneath her, then leaning in as if sharing a secret in a crowded room. \u201cHehe, well, you know how I was telling you about my new cute little boyfriend before?\u201d She paused long enough to receive a wary nod in response. \u201cWell, after spending some quality time with me, he decided he wasn\u2019t ready to be separated yet when the class was over, so he ended up hitching a ride back here.\u201d Another giggle. \u201cIf you\u2019re nice maybe I\u2019ll introduce you to him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlarm bells sounded in Tracy\u2019s head as her friend gushed about how cute her boyfriend was and how he hadn\u2019t been able to resist her, wondering just how likely it was that some poor guy had had his intentions twisted by the other girl\u2019s warped logic. The brunette still well remembered the kind of mental gymnastics that her aunt had unintentionally used to subject her brother to days or even weeks of torment while believing the whole time that he was a willing participant. Granted, she\u2019d helped to build that perception herself, but often enough Norah had required no external input, just blissfully believing that her nephew was willing, able and eager to serve her needs. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me some guy you just met today agreed to come home with you just like that. Are you sure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuried beneath booty, you could only barely make out the conversation above, enough words coming through to get the general meaning. If you had been in a position to you would have hugged Tracy right now, all of her past transgressions forgiven. Well, you\u2019d forgiven her already, but still, as a big brother it made you happy to know that she\u2019d grown this much. For once in your life you really wished it was your sister\u2019s butt you were under right now, instead of the rear that pounded you once again as Aoi bounced in her seat and laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t be silly, of course I\u2019m sure. You should now by now that little guys can\u2019t resist this body.\u201d She smiled slyly. \u201cYou know I\u2019m sure you could bring a little guy home as well if you weren\u2019t so hung up on your brother all the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy\u2019s indignant glare would probably have held more force if she wasn\u2019t blushing so hard as well. \u201cI am NOT hung up on Hunter.\u201d Okay, so maybe the idea of you having run off to get an apartment with some unknown roommates worried her, but that was just reasonable concern for a tiny family member striking out into the world. She comforted herself with the knowledge that you would at least be rooming with other tinies, who would know if anything bad happened to you. Pushing those worries aside for the moment, the brunette returned to the topic at hand. \u201cAnd don\u2019t change the subject. If you\u2019re supposed boyfriend is here, why haven\u2019t I seen him yet? Where\u2019d you stash him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than respond verbally, Aoi pulled away slightly before climbing fully onto the couch, the next question dying on your sister\u2019s lips as her friend suddenly turned and shoved a scantily covered butt in her face. \u201cWhat the hell Aoi! I don\u2019t want yo- wait\u2026\u201d Though at first she tried to look away, your tormented body was thankfully still visible against your captor\u2019s skin, differences in skin tone giving you some small chance of salvation. \u201cOh my god! Did you crush the little guy to your butt? Why?!\u201d Years of experience had taught Tracy what a squished little guy looked like, and a hundred images of similar discolorations on various parts of family members and friends flashed through her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, Aoi seemed unfazed by the allegations being thrown against her, just glancing over her should to meet Tracy\u2019s gaze with a grin. \u201cDon\u2019t blame me. Sure, I introduced the guy to my derriere, but he\u2019s the one who\u2019s holding on like his life depends on it. I even tried to get him off in the shower, but I guess he\u2019s stronger than he looks.\u201d For years now she\u2019d been surprised by just how persistent little men could be with their affections. Though on the other hand she supposed it was to be expected, given how many of them had willingly chosen to become possessions over recent years. Maybe it was just part of the tiny psychology to want to be close to woman in any way they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she could almost see the aberrant thoughts forming in her friend\u2019s mind, Tracy reluctantly let the conversation go for now. She\u2019d been trying to convince the girl to be gentler with tinies since the two moved in together, with no progress to date, and right now there were other priorities. \u201cGeez. Well that aside, I can at least take him off now right?\u201d Her response was as wiggling of Aoi\u2019s butt and a giggle which she took as a yes. \u201cJust so you know, I\u2019m doing this for him, not you.\u201d Granted she didn\u2019t know this guy, but she couldn\u2019t help but feel bad for anyone in his situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut will Tracy\u2019s experience be enough to get you free? And if so, will she actually save you?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cUh\u2026okay.\u201d Tracy bit her lip as she lightly traced her index finger along your body. You shuddered at her cold touch. \u201cYou really did a number on this poor guy, Aoi. Don\u2019t know if I believe he actually wanted this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoi scoffed overdramatically. \u201cHow can you say that, Tracy-cakes? What little cutie wouldn\u2019t want their whole world to be this heavenly piece of ass?\u201d Aoi grinned happily at her own self-aggrandizing, still firmly entrenched in her fantasy that you were fully onboard with her kidnapping and forced sensual advances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy rolled her eyes, used to her roommates aggressive tactics towards tinies who curried her favor. One day, she\u2019d sit Aoi down for a lengthy talk on the proper way to respect tinies and treat them well. If she was up to it, Tracy even considered using her own poor behavior from the past as a model for how she\u2019d grown as a person. That being said, a small part of her feared Aoi would take away the wrong lessons from Tracy\u2019s past incidents with her tiny brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, the task at hand was what was most important, and Tracy began trying to peel you free by scratching at you with her fingernails. Sadly, you were far too engrained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy groaned. \u201cYeah\u2026figured it wouldn\u2019t be easy.\u201d She hopped up from the couch. \u201cStay right here. I\u2019m gonna go grab some things that might help us out. Save that poor tiny from any more time squished up against your fat ass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoi gasped, and threw a pillow at Tracy, who expertly dodged the attack with a chuckle. She then slipped out of the room, leaving you and Aoi alone once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe curvaceous giantess tried to look over her shoulder to spot you, but her butt was simply too massive for her to get a good look at your smeared blob of a body smack in the middle of her hefty left butt cheek. Blindly, she tickled at her cheek in what was supposed to be a flirtatious caress, but was more-or-less yet another round of smudging for your malleable body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Aoi got tired of the awkward position she was holding and plopped back into a normal sitting position on the couch. Her alluring derriere slammed into the couch cushion, crashing all of her weight back onto you. You internally groaned at the uncomfortable pressure of the well-developed giantess slowly squeezing the life out of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy strolled back into the room after a few minutes, stopped in her tracks, and sighed. \u201cSeriously, Aoi? We\u2019re trying to get the poor dude off, not MORE stuck. Stand up.\u201d Tracy grumbled at her roommate\u2019s careless actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoi blinked for a second, then giggled. \u201cOh, right! I was having so much fun with the tiny guy, I nearly forgot!\u201d She laughed again, then flipped around over the edge of the couch, once more presenting her scrumptious posterior to your sister. \u201cGotta say, even if you can\u2019t get him off, it\u2019s no biggie! The hunky little dude can just be a permanent tattoo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy frowned. \u201cUm, no he can\u2019t. He\u2019s a real person, Aoi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoi pouted. \u201cBut it\u2019s a nice life for him, right? Sexy Aoi Ass, twenty-four seven? Constant love and adoration?\u201d The playfully giantess smirked as she rubbed her hand into your body once more, again grinding your mushed form into an even-more indistinguishable blob. Tracy was about to retort, when Aoi locked eyes with her. \u201cI mean, would YOU turn down all of this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour younger sister balked, and her cheeks lightly burned pink. \u201cTh-that\u2019s neither here nor there! We\u2019re t-talking about this tiny guy you abducted out of that gym! How\u2019s he going to eat and drink while stuck to you?\u201d Tracy inquired, and Aoi simply shrugged. Swearing under her breath, Tracy pushed deeper with her questioning. \u201cHow\u2019s he going to\u2026uh\u2026say that he loves you back when he\u2019s stuck flat? How can he kiss you, and you kiss him, when he\u2019s plastered where he is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoi\u2019s eyes lit up with alarm at those words. \u201cOh, gosh! I didn\u2019t think about that! I was so caught up in letting him get a good body-full of ass, that I\u2026oh my gosh! Tracy, please get him off of me!\u201d Aoi was nearly panicking now, and presenting a clear case of her highly skewed priorities. \u201cI need him to experience me and my love in so many other ways!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy wondered internally if she\u2019d gone a bit far in coaxing Aoi to cooperate, but she\u2019d deal with any ramifications afterward. For now, she merely nodded. \u201cYeah, you crazy chick, I\u2019m working on it. Stay still.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoi shut-up immediately, comically serious now that future flirt sessions with her new tiny boyfriend were on the line, and kept her body as rigid as possible. Tracy, meanwhile, picked up a small bottle of glue that she\u2019d brought with her back into the room. Along with the glue, she\u2019d also brought a wax strip, and another small bottle with some sort of liquid inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Aoi. I\u2019m dabbing some glue on first. Just where the tiny guy is. It might be a little cold.\u201d Tracy explained, as she began using a miniature brush to apply a sticky coating of glue to your disfigured body. Truthfully, Tracy had to squint just to see the area where you slightly lighter skin tone contrasted with Aoi\u2019s tan complexion. She wondered if it would\u2019ve taken even a day for you to be fully engrained into the girl\u2019s buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the glue was in place, Tracy picked up the wax strip delicately. \u201cThis part will hurt, so I\u2019m sorry in advance. This wax strip will stick super, super hard to the glue, and should work perfectly in getting the tiny guy free in one pull. Remember how we did this a while back with that tiny that got embedded into your tummy when you rolled over onto him while napping together?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoi\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWhat? But that hurt so much!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah? So will this!\u201d Tracy exclaimed, launching into motion right as she finished speaking, and before Aoi could try to wiggle out of cooperation, both figuratively and literally. The wax strip smacked into her titanic behind, aimed mostly at her globe-like left cheek, which is where you were imprinted. Then, with a mighty pull, Tracy ripped the wax strip back, the entire ordeal punctuated by an ear-piercing shriek of discomfort from Aoi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoi whirled away and leapt to her feet, jumping up and down in pain and rubbing delicately at her ass. Her left cheek was a bright red color, and by the small tears welling up in the Asian girl\u2019s eyes, it was clear that the pain was searing. Even still, clad in only a loose top and nothing else, Aoi was a mess of scantily-clad jiggliness as she bounced around the room in agony, and Tracy had to take a second to force herself to not stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour younger sister then laid the wax strip out on the coffee table in front of her, easily spotting your tan globby form stuck right in the middle of the white strip of wax. Her plan had worked with a hitch, and now only one step was left to complete it. She popped the cap off the other bottle of liquid, and then drizzled a generous amount of the cold liquid over your body. Instantly, you could feel the tight constricting bonds of the wax and the glue losing their hold on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to answer your thoughts, Tracy looked over to Aoi (who by now had calmed down a bit) and explained what she was doing. \u201cThis glue solvent will break up the bonds holding the tiny in place, allowing him to reform good as new!\u201d Tracy paused. \u201cI mean, looks like the beating you gave him tore his clothes clean off, but otherwise, he\u2019ll be mostly unharmed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain in her booty subsiding, Aoi grinned anew. \u201cWell, thank you so much, Tracy-cakes! It\u2019s no wonder you\u2019re practically my best friend!\u201d She turned her attention down to you, and smiled with an almost feverish glint of desire in her eyes. \u201cNow itty-bitty Hunter and I can take our relationship to all new heights!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy\u2019s heart skipped a beat, and her mind launched into overdrive. There was no way her roommate\u2019s kidnapped tiny boytoy was actually\u2026was there? She had mentioned him being a new hire at the local gym, which would theoretically add up with what Tracy knew about your desire to job search. But really, what were the chances of it all? At the same time, Tracy fully knew how fate liked to screw over tinies in cruelly imaginative ways\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing herself to remain calm and logical, Tracy stood up and grabbed Aoi\u2019s shoulders. \u201cHold up, you horndog. Go get dressed and put some ice on your butt. This little guy\u2026H-H-Hunter\u2026needs a minute. I\u2019m going to bring him up to my room to reform safely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoi pouted, but nodded in acceptance. \u201cJust don\u2019t go trying to steal my boyfriend, Tracy. Course, if you wanted, I could be convinced to let you borrow the cutie for some fun time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy blushed bright red at Aoi\u2019s ironically embarrassing statement, which Aoi misinterpreted as her good friend being totally interested in the idea. Laughing melodically, she dashed out of the room, already entertaining fantasies of all the fun ways she and Tracy could enjoy you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly shaking with panic, Tracy took you up to her room, and closed the door behind her. Setting the wax strip down on her bedside table, she paced the room anxiously for the next ten minutes as you slowly but surely reformed. Finally, you had returned to your normal size, the solvent doing an excellent job in breaking the glue bonds, and allowing you to walk off the wax strip effortlessly. Of course, you were stark naked, and you feebly tried to cover yourself at the same time you called up to Tracy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-Tracy! Hey!\u201d You yelled, waving your free arm to catch her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping at the sound of your voice, Tracy rushed over and knelt by her table. Her worried expression filled your entire vision. \u201cOh god, it really is you, Hunter. How did this happen to you? I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed a small smile. \u201cYou have nothing to be sorry for, Tracy. And\u2026well\u2026it\u2019s a long story.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the class progressed, with Morgan leading the group through standing poses, you did your best to keep up with her. Aoi\u2019s intense staring, however, was distracting you.<br>\r\nAoi inched her way closer to you, subtly so she didn\u2019t alert Morgan to what she was doing. As Aoi inched closer, you backed up further away from her, not realising that you were getting closer and closer to the feet of a very distracted Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAoi, you seem distracted by something. Is everything ok?\u201d Morgan looked to Aoi, not breaking her stride and continuing with the exercises. Aoi, momentarily distracted by Morgan, didn\u2019t notice you disappear under Morgan\u2019s right foot as she changed position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, no Morgan, I\u2019m all good. Just spaced out for a second there,\u201d she giggled nervously. Morgan smiled in return and then resumed overseeing the rest of the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, meanwhile were continuing to back up from Aoi, when you were distracted by Morgan addressing Aoi. You turned back to look up at her, and were greened by the sight of the sole of Morgan\u2019s foot rapidly dropping onto you. You didn\u2019t even have time to scream before you were crushed under the damp, slightly sweaty sole of Morgan\u2019s bare foot. Aoi didn\u2019t even see it happen since she was distracted by Morgan had drawn her attention off of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body was flattened under the ball of Morgan\u2019s foot, all except for your head, which was pressed into the gap between her third and fourth toe, hidden from her view but not crushed completely. <br>\r\nBefore you could even process what had just happened, Morgan moved onto the next pose, which involved balancing on one foot, the foot you happened to be under.<br>\r\nMorgan\u2019s sweaty sole pressed down on your entire body, compressing it under her full weight. Your entire body screamed in agony as your crumpled form was pressed between her foot and the unyielding surface of the floor. Your face was pressed into the crevice between her toes, compressed but not squished completely. Sweat ran down between the massive digits onto your face, the trickle of salty liquid causing you cough and splutter, the sound completely muffled by the two digits smothering your face alongside the music drowning out any sound you could hope to make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being distracted by Morgan speaking to her, Aoi looked back down to where you had been, but didn\u2019t see you. She only saw Morgan\u2019s large, bare foot planted close to where you had been. You were completely hidden from sight and Aoi, figuring that she had maybe scared you off, slumped her shoulders slightly in disappointment, before deciding to focus on the class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Morgan shifted her foot as she changed position, grinding her foot on top of your crumpled form and dragging you along with it, you hoped you would be discovered soon or else you\u2019d be spending the next fifty or so minutes under the foot of your sporty new roommate. However, feeling your body begin to adhere to the sole of her foot, your more cynical side told you that you wouldn\u2019t be getting discovered any time soon, since Morgan seemed to be completely focused on the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Morgan waved the last of the girls out of the yoga studio, she sighed, content with a good session. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had spent the whole class being pounded further and further into the embrace of her increasingly sweaty foot. As the class went on, the studio grew hotter as the women exercised, which caused the women to sweat a lot. <br>\r\nAs Morgan\u2019s foot became increasingly sweaty, you could feel her pores opening slightly. The repeated pounding of her foot into the floor had only served to force you into the embrace of her foot, and your malleable body filled every crack and crevice it was able to fit into, including Morgan\u2019s open pores. <br>\r\nAs the studio was starting to cool now that it was emptying, you felt the pores begin to close slightly, pinching onto your flattened form. <br>\r\nYour face was continually pounded into the gap between Morgan\u2019s third and fourth toe with each step she took. There was enough of a gap that your head wasn\u2019t completely flattened, but it was compressed enough that you definitely couldn\u2019t speak. You could certainly smell however, the stench of Morgan\u2019s foot informed you of that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Morgan walked around the studio, rolling the mats up and putting them in a nearby storage closet, you were pounded mercilessly under her heavy strides. Every step seemed to cement you further into the ball of her foot. You hoped Morgan would find you soon, otherwise freeing you may prove troublesome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Morgan placed the last yoga mat in the closet, she turned around to survey the room, happy now that all the equipment was cleared away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d say your first session went well, wouldn\u2019t you Hunter?\u201d She looked around for you. \u201c...Hunter? You around here?\u201d<br>\r\nMorgan searched around the floor, not able to find you around there.<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm, did he maybe get squashed under one of the other women? Wait, he must have been what was distracting Aoi!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan rushed out into the yoga studio into the main hall of the gym. Spotting Aoi just leaving the changing room, now changed out of her workout clothes, Morgan rushed over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAoi! Have you seen Hunter? I lost track of him during the class,\u201d as Aoi was shocked to see Morgan approach her in a panic, Morgan continued. \u201cI saw you watching him during class, did you see what happened to him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, I didn\u2019t see where he went, but one minute he was there and after I looked away for a few seconds he was gone! He had been near your feet last I saw him. Sorry Morgan but I gotta go, see you and the little cutie next week,\u201d Aoi rushed off, clearly running late for something, leaving Morgan to slowly realise the place that you likely were stuck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked down at her bare feet with a grimace. She silently prayed that you weren\u2019t under one of her feet, although it would be the quickest way of finding you if you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan quickly rushed to a nearby bench, crushing you more and more, and forcing your face deeper into the embrace of her toes, with every step.<br>\r\nShe quickly plopped down on the bench and inspected the underside of her left foot, sighing when she didn\u2019t see you. Confident that you weren\u2019t on her feet, she shifted to check her other foot, only to gasp when she saw your crumpled form plastered to the ball of her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, Hunter! Are you ok?\u201d Realising quickly after the words left her mouth that it would likely be pointless waiting on an answer from you, she continued. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry! It must have been awful for you under there. Hold on, I\u2019ll get you off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan began to scratch at your legs and arms, trying to catch one of them and peel you off, but she just couldn\u2019t get her nail underneath you. She hadn\u2019t noticed your still squished, but not completely flattened head between her toes. After a few minutes of unsuccessfully attempting to peel you off, Morgan sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t get you off Hunter! Maybe I need to try something else? Maybe I can get Heather to help?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t know what to think of asking Heather for help. On one hand, having another person trying to free you would likely be a good thing, but on the other it wasn\u2019t exactly a great impression to your new boss that this happened on your first day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Morgan gets Heather\u2019s help, and between the two of them they manage to free you. How has this affected Heather\u2019s opinion of you? <br>\r\n2) Morgan gets Heather\u2019s help, but they cannot free you, and Morgan has to continue the rest of her day with you plastered to her foot. Will this engrain you more to her foot and will she be able to get you off after her shift ends? <br>\r\n3) Writer\u2019s choice.</span></div></div>",

So, with that in mind, ya think yer capable of some one-on-one coachin\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned. \u201cOne-on-one coaching? What do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mature woman smiled. \u201cNothin\u2019 too taxin\u2019, mind. Just a bit of helpin\u2019 out. For example\u2026\u201d Heather pointed behind you, and you followed her finger to see a young woman looking around aimlessly. \u201cThat darlin\u2019 jus\u2019 signed up for membership. Said she ain\u2019t nevuh been to a gym \u2018fore today!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, understanding. \u201cOh, okay. So, basically, you\u2019d like me to help her with her workout? Lead her through some stretches, explain how the machines work, that sort of thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather grinned. \u201cAbsolutely, Hunter dear. Ya catch on quick!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan spoke up. \u201cAlright, well, I\u2019ll leave you to it, Hunter. See you when our shifts are over, and have fun!\u201d She waved, and you waved back, and then Morgan was off towards one of the gym\u2019s side rooms, disappearing from sight as she slipped through the door. She figured you could manage on your own. You were a competent, tiny adult, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather lowered you to the floor of the gym. \u201cAlright, Hunter, time\u2019s a wastin\u2019! Get helpin\u2019 that poor lass over there. Ah have full faith in ya!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t let you down!\u201d You saluted your new boss, then ran off. It wasn\u2019t necessarily an easy trek, but you made it in under three minutes. The girl was soon firmly in your sights, and you thanked your lucky stars she hadn\u2019t wandered off from where Heather had pointed her out to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also noted how incredibly attractive the girl was, so much so that you nearly froze in your tracks and stared, wide-eyed. She looked to be in her mid-twenties, and at first guess, was of some sort of Hispanic descent. Her long, dark brown hair was tied back in a somewhat messy but still cute bunch. The girl\u2019s eyes were a deep and alluring brown, and they flicked around the gym anxiously. The girl\u2019s full lips were locked in an adorable, and probably unintentionally, sensual pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer exotically tanned skin looked soft and smooth, and she was showing a whole lot of it. All she was wearing was a low-cut, purple exercise crop top and matching purple short shorts. The outfit would be fine on any girl but this one. She reminded you of Quinn, particularly in the proportion department. Her curves were significant, to say the least, and though she wasn\u2019t wholly on Quinn\u2019s level, she was eye-catchingly curvy, to be sure. As such, her already form-fitting clothing was even tighter, and you found it difficult to not stare. Most of her stomach and abdomen was exposed, as were her long legs from the upper-thigh down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Excuse me, miss! Down here!\u201d You shouted. The girl gasped lightly, glanced around, and then down to the floor, making eye contact with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026oh. Oh! Hey there.\u201d The girl said. Catching you off guard, she squatted low to the ground, ostensibly to get a better look at you. Still, it scared you to see her powerful legs fall down, her huge ass looking like it was about to squash you flat. The girl essentially presented her crotch to you by squatting in such a manner, and it was now twice as hard to keep looking her in the eye. You could definitely see the outline of her panties under her ludicrously tight shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awkwardly cleared your throat. \u201cM-my name is Hunter\u2026and I\u2019m a new fitness coach here at Workout World. You looked like you needed some help. Would you like any coaching?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl quirked her mouth, raising a coy eyebrow. \u201cHelp? Coaching me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d You nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll help in any way I can. Trust me, I know a lot about working out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah? Damn!\u201d The girl shook her head ruefully. \u201cIf I knew the gym had hot little tinies like you on staff, I\u2019d have come here years ago.\u201d She laughed, and you had to admit that her words caught you off guard, but she continued before you could speak up. \u201cSounds like an awesome deal to me. As it stands, this is my first time in a gym, so I\u2019m a bit lost on what I should be doing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisregarding her \u2018hot little tinies\u2019 comment for the moment, you flashed her a thumbs up. \u201cThen I\u2019m your guy! Hunter, at your service!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl laughed again; her voice silky smooth. \u201cThe name\u2019s Maia. For the next few hours, I\u2019m totally in your hands, Coach!\u201d The girl, Maia, smiled at you and winked, and there was an unabashed hint of playfulness behind her expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill trying to push that aside, you pointed to the corner of the gym where there were exercise mats and other such simple equipment laid out. \u201cA good place to start is probably over there. Nice and quick, to ease into it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotcha, Coach!\u201d Maia grinned, and she began leisurely strolling over to where you had pointed. You dashed as fast as your miniscule legs could carry you to even attempt to keep pace with her, and you missed the sly smile on her face as she watched you run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the mats, you gestured for Maia to step on, and the Hispanic giantess happily obliged. Another quick pang of fear struck you, watching her step onto the mat, her giant feet on either side of you. Pushing down your mounting unease over this situation, you focused on the task at hand. After all, if you failed to help one girl with her exercises, you\u2019d be fired from this job for sure. You had to do a good job, no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Maia! Try bending down to touch your toes.\u201d You called up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that all? Easy!\u201d Maia replied, effortlessly. With ease, the curvy giantess threw her upper body forward and down, arching her back but still keeping her feet firmly on the ground. Demonstrating incredible flexibility, Maia bent all the over forward, easily touching her toes without breaking a sweat. You were impressed by your new student\u2019s capabilities, and looked up to compliment her, but then all rational thought left your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn bending over, Maia\u2019s abundant breasts were also now free to wobble, suspended as they were in this arched forward position. Her already low-cut crop top looked even more ridiculous now, and Maia\u2019s boobs threatened to spill out from the top. To make matters worse, the girl began listlessly swaying, shaking her tits side-to-side as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this it, Coach? This is a piece of cake!\u201d Maia said, triumphantly. Mentally smacking yourself out of your trance, you tore your gaze from the girl\u2019s abyss of cleavage and to her alluring face. She had an almost knowing look of happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou coughed. \u201cUm\u2026good. Great, actually! Onto the next stretch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren\u2019t blind enough to notice Maia\u2019s smugly satisfied smile, but she offered no further retort. You were able to successfully guide her through a few more standing stretches, like the tree pose and warrior pose. She almost crushed you under her foot while shuffling around for the warrior pose, and you didn\u2019t think it was possible to turn every simple stretch into a flirty display, but Maia managed it somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to conclude with one more round of toe touching, when Maia spoke up. \u201cYou know what, Coach? It\u2019s hard to hear you down there.\u201d The girl grinned mischievously and bent down. Faster than you could react, she swiped you up into her hand, stood back to full height, and then deposited you into her cleavage. It was so sudden and casual that it was nearly comical. Nearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngry or surprised thoughts swirled in your mind, but became muddled as soon as you actually touched Maia\u2019s boobs. Sinking into her cleavage up to your neck, nearly all of your tiny body was buried in her soft, jiggly mounds of flesh. It was like the world\u2019s softest bed, heavenly relaxing. Maia had exercised enough to heat up a bit, but not enough to sweat yet, so her cleavage was like a warm embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling in a flirty manner, Maia clapped her hands together. \u201cAh, see? Better! Now, what\u2019s next, Teach?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fought hard to push away pleasant thoughts. The Hispanic giantesses\u2019 fragrant body wash scent was overpowering while this close to her. \u201cM-Maia! This is hardly appropriate!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not? It\u2019s practical. You can give me instructions, and you have a close eye on my technique.\u201d Maia shrugged, appearing nonchalant, but it didn\u2019t take a genius to see the playfulness in her eyes. She knew what she was doing. \u201cUnless\u2026you wanted this to be something more than that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignored her teasing, and realized that you sadly couldn\u2019t argue with her logic. Sighing, you rolled your eyes. \u201c\u2026okay, fine. Next up is one last toe touch before sitting down for some other stretches.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Coach! Can do!\u201d Maia grinned, and spared no more seconds wasting time. Throwing herself forward again, the flexible girl fell into the perfect toe touching pose, nailing the stretch with ease. Sadly, an unexpected hiccup occurred this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same breasts you\u2019d been shamefully admiring during this stretch earlier once more strained against the top that held them. Hung upside-down from between Maia\u2019s massive boobs, gravity took hold of your body. That, combined with the gentle jostling of the girl\u2019s titanic tits, and you slipped free from their grasp. With a startled cry, you fell down to the floor, impacting on her yoga mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fall slightly squished you, but not too bad. Sadly, before you could begin reforming, Maia finished toe touching and stood to her full height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, what\u2019s next?\u201d She asked. \u201cOh! That\u2019s right. Sitting!\u201d The giantess grinned excitedly, then began to sit down on her mat\u2026and right on top of you!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cActually, I think that working at the studio would be a pretty easy job for me to handle.\u201d You reasoned. \u201cI feel like it\u2019d be a really unique and interesting experience that would be a lot of fun to try out. Also, if there aren\u2019t any other tiny guys working there, they might really have a use for me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery grinned excitedly. \u201cOMG, yes! That\u2019s totes what I was saying! This\u2019ll be awesome!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell that Morgan was a bit letdown that you hadn\u2019t picked her, and Quinn seemed indifferent like normal, but with a twinge of disappointment on her face. However, there really was no way around it. It\u2019d be impossible for you to balance three jobs at once. You just decided that you would need to hang out with them later to make it up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day passed by fairly uneventfully. The four of you spend time hanging around and chatting in the living room, eventually transitioning into watching a movie. The movie came after dinner, which was efficiently prepared by Morgan and served by Quinn. It was really just a few frozen meals heated up, but it was still a meaningful gesture and a tasty experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the movie finished, it was nearing ten o\u2019clock at night, and each of the girls meandered upstairs to their rooms. Surprisingly, they each seemed to have forgotten about you, and left you all by yourself on the couch in the living room. You couldn\u2019t really blame them, as this was only the first night for the three girls living under the same roof as a tiny like yourself. Your existence hadn\u2019t become fully routine for them yet. Thankfully, it wasn\u2019t too cold in the living room, and the couch cushion was nice and comfy, so you easily fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke to the sound of Morgan walking through the living room on her way out the door. If she was leaving, then the chances were good that you and Avery would have to head out soon too. So, you changed into clean, simple clothes, then headed off to the kitchen. It took you a few minutes to reach the kitchen and climb up onto the table, but you managed. You\u2019d been doing this all your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn was already seated at the table eating her own breakfast, and she nodded in acknowledgement upon noticing you. In the center of the table was an open bag of bagels, so you figured you\u2019d help yourself to a first meal of the day. Graciously, Quinn went out of her way to pour some apple juice into a shot glass for you, and you thanked her for her consideration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile ripping off chunks of the bagel, Avery came running into the kitchen frantically, dressed in only skimpy, frilly lingerie. She exclaimed hurriedly that she\u2019d overslept and was almost late for work. Unfortunately, Quinn moved away from the table and sauntered out of the kitchen a second later, exactly when Avery, rushing in a blind panic, dug her hand into the bag of bagels for a quick meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActing far too quickly and carelessly to ever dream of feeling you, Avery\u2019s fingers squished into your back as she retrieved a bagel and pulled it out. You cried out for her attention as she lifted you up into the air, but the pink-haired girl was already pulling up the fridge and grabbing something to drink, too distracted to hear your pleas. Soon, her luscious lips filled your entire vision, and her mouth parted open, revealing her cavernous maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a burst of strength, you pulled free from the bagel and managed to yank yourself away. Of course, that left the only possible place to go as straight down, and gravity carried you right into Avery\u2019s awaiting bosom. You bounced off her left breast, rolled into her cleavage, and found yourself wedged neatly up to your neck amongst her pillowy soft breasts. Surprisingly, she STILL hadn\u2019t felt you, and merely scarfed down her bagel and drink with a surely unhealthy quickness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRacing back upstairs, you were jostled like mad as her sizable boobs bounced erratically in her loose, revealing bra. You kept trying to get her attention, but kept failing. You could do nothing but remain stuck, and do your best to brace yourself and avoid slipping so deep between her tits that you disappeared. It dawned on you now that the pink-haired ditzy giantess had totally forgotten about bringing you with her to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery got dressed in record time, and thankfully for you, put on a low-cut crop top which kept most of her perky breasts and cleavage exposed, including you. She was also wearing a flashy pink skirt. Your attempts to get noticed still failed as she cried out a goodbye to Quinn and strolled out to her car, but as she sat in the driver\u2019s seat closed the door, she finally heard your pleas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing down, Avery spotted you, blinked slowly, and then smiled in a mischievous manner. \u201cOoh, hey there, small stuff. What\u2019cha doing in between my boobs, huh? So cute!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAvery, you\u2019re taking me to the studio, remember?\u201d You said, in a tone you hope sounded both annoyed and serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery blinked again, before smacking her forehead. \u201cOh yeah! Duh! Totes slipped my mind, Hunter.\u201d She winked at you. \u201cWhat a way to get my attention though, dude. Girl might get some ideas\u2026\u201d She trailed off with a giggle, then plucked you from her cleavage. You were blushing at the whole situation, as well as Avery\u2019s flirty teasing, which prompted another giggle from the giantess. Finally, she set you down on the passenger\u2019s seat and drove off to the studio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a shockingly short, ten-minute drive to \u201cStarlight Studios\u201d, and the building was about as blindingly gaudy as you\u2019d anticipated. It was a bright, sleek, modern designed building. After almost forgetting you again, Avery carried you inside with her, and the inside was just as modern and chic. There were no less than two different coffee shops inside the studio, and endless hallways seemed to stretch out to more photo rooms, prop closets, and specialized sets and stages than you could shake a stick at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery was quickly approached by an important looking woman, who the pink-haired girl cheerfully waved to\u2026using the exact same hand she was carrying you in. With a higher-pitched yelp than you thought yourself capable of, you were flung through the air, right towards the woman rapidly approaching your catastrophically forgetful roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the air, you got a brief glimpse of the woman, like time was slowing down. She appeared to be in her late twenties or so, and she was of some Asian descent. Her black hair was pulled back in a ponytail, though a few strands hung loose over her glasses-framed face. She was wearing a tight, white button-up blouse and black miniskirt. There was something about her that emanated importance, like an aura of authority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny further thoughts left you when you splattered down onto the clipboard the woman was carrying in front of her, your squishy body impacting against the hard board and flattening out like an accordion. You groaned at the pain, and began focusing on reforming, even as the woman finished approaching Avery. She\u2019d been locked on Avery, and had not yet taken notice of your landing on her clipboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAvery. Almost late.\u201d The woman said, quickly and efficiently. \u201cShoot is coming up in just a few minutes. We can\u2019t fall behind schedule.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery winced, and gave the woman a winning smile. \u201cOverslept, Konomi. Won\u2019t happen again! But at least I brought a surprise!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman, Konomi, adjusted her glasses. \u201cWhat\u2019s the surprise?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, you\u2019d reformed, and were just standing up on Konomi\u2019s clipboard. You brushed yourself off and waved to her, the movement drawing both women\u2019s eyes to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the surprise!\u201d Avery gushed. \u201cHunter, my new tiny roommate! He wants to try being a model!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonomi looked at you, then at Avery, then back at you, and frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s not really how it works. You need experience to work here at Starlight Studios.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery pouted adorably. \u201cBut boss! He\u2019d be the first tiny model here!\u201d She pleaded, then hesitated. \u201cActually\u2026he\u2019d be the first male model too. Hee hee! That\u2019s awesome!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whirled on Avery, totally floored by her revealing that you\u2019d be the only guy in this entire building. Why hadn\u2019t she told you earlier? Looking back to Konomi, any objection you thought of voicing fell away upon noticing her expression. She was staring at you intently, her eyes flicking rapidly. Millions of thoughts were racing through her head, and you could swear you almost literally saw dollar signs appear in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she smiled. \u201cYou know what, Avery. You\u2019re right. Hunter would be perfect here as our first male model AND first tiny model.\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cFor an introduction, my name is Miss Konomi, and I\u2019m the studio director. I lead most of the photo shoots. Starlight Studios prides itself on providing high quality photos to all our clients\u2026no matter the difficulty or strangeness of their needs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat unnerved you a bit, so you folded your arms. \u201cWhat would I have to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonomi waved off your concern. \u201cOh, nothing much. Pose for photos all day. Sometimes wear certain outfits. Occasionally act out\u2026things.\u201d Konomi seemed to push down a smile. \u201cReally, it isn\u2019t hard, and it pays extraordinarily well.\u201d In a quieter voice, she continued. \u201cThe things we can do now with a tiny model\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still apprehensive, but Avery shouted with glee. \u201cHe\u2019ll take the job!

I\u2019ll get everything signed up, then!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, and you were officially a Starlight Studios model, much to Avery\u2019s joy, Konomi\u2019s pleasure, and your cautious optimism.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'm sorry I was hesitant at first, Avery, but bringing Hunter on as part of the Starlight Studios team is actually a fantastic idea!\" Konomi said to both of you. At this point the two giantesses were strolling down a long hallway, with you sitting precariously on Avery\u2019s hand as she walked. You had spent the last ten minutes on Konomi\u2019s desk signing the necessary paperwork to fill out your modeling contract, and to be quite honest you didn\u2019t read much of it at all. You could have sworn you saw a line or two that said something like \u201czero liability for any workplace injuries\u201d but every time you slowed down to read something more carefully, Avery would lean her enormous cleavage mere inches above you out of excitement. As a 21 year old man you couldn\u2019t help but feel distracted by the proximity of this jiggling beauty, and as a result you ended up simply signing where you needed to sign and that was the end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you reached a set of double doors, Konomi leading the way with Avery and yourself in tow. The seemingly work-focused professional manner contrasted harshly with the bubbly exuberance of your current carrier. Konomi walked with intimidating intention and elegance while Avery practically skipped with every step, forcing you to cling on to one of her fingers in fear of flying off yet again. You looked around the room and figured that this must be the primary room where photoshoots were taken; it was enormous. It must have been a large warehouse in the past because there were countless micro stages set up with all kinds of varying decor. To name just a few you saw a suburban living room, a bedroom, an upscale bathroom, a city street, a fake beach, even a fake gym setup. This place was professional, no doubt about that, it seemed like they could whip up whatever environment they needed for a shoot in a moment\u2019s notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonomi stopped at the bedroom set, located right next to the fake city street, before grabbing a box off of a nearby table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe actually received a shipment of clothes from this new brand, Micro-Flex, just last week! Check it out!\u201d Konomi popped the top off of a box that was probably the size of a deck of cards, but it held countless articles of clothing designed for one inch tall guys like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah, that\u2019s so freakin cool! That stuff looks totally cute and Hunter has a great bod, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll rock all of it!\u201d Avery said, peering into the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed slightly at your new roommate\u2019s compliment. She was without a doubt quite flirtatious, and her overwhelmingly positive attitude seemed quite endearing to you already. You simply smiled and peered down into the box from your perch on Avery\u2019s hand, seeing a variety of shirts, shorts, and pants. It seemed like every color you could think of was present in that tiny box, and you had to admit you were quite excited to be modeling them! You had some qualms about the dangers of being a tiny model amongst various giantess models, but it seemed like your first shoot was going to be pretty straightforward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching you staring at the clothes, Konomi spoke up, \u201cDon\u2019t just stand there and stare! Pick an outfit and try it on!\u201d Looking up at the business casual woman as she spoke, you could practically see dollar signs forming in her eyes. You could tell that she took her work quite seriously, and this contract from Micro-Flex was most likely quite lucrative for the studio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, Avery moved you towards the box and you picked out a matching pair of red shirt and shorts. Wondering briefly if you were going to have any privacy to change, you looked up to meet the piercing stares of both giantesses above you and knew that the answer was no. Shaking your head and chuckling slightly you began to change in plain sight, stripping down to your boxers before sliding the red clothes on. You never considered yourself to be a shy person, and to be honest you were quite proud of your physique, so doing so didn\u2019t seem like a huge deal to you. Unbeknownst to you, Avery looked you up and down, raising her eyebrows in approval. But after a moment you were ready for the shoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLowering you to the ground on the fake sidewalk of the city street set, Avery then backed away and flashed a thumbs up as Konomi set up the camera to focus on you. You stretched a bit and had to admit, the Micro-Flex clothing sure was comfortable. It felt like no matter how you moved, the clothing moved with you and wasn\u2019t restrictive in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Hunter, you ready? Just strike some natural poses! Walk around a bit, pretending you\u2019re just going for a stroll through the city. Whatever\u2019s natural.\u201d Konomi said, looking through the lens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan do!\u201d you responded happily. Konomi then set the camera to automatically take photos every second or so. You tried your best to look natural, cycling through a variety of poses and actions to give a bunch of different angles. Avery seemed absolutely elated that you were taking to the job so easily, and Konomi herself even seemed impressed with your capabilities. The asian giantess slowly walked around the set, ending up herself on the far end of the fake sidewalk that you were on. You assumed she was just inspecting your poses from different angles, and you spoke up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey so what\u2019s so special about these Micro-Flex clothes anyway? They feel great and all but what\u2019s the selling point?\u201d You made small talk, asking the giantess standing near you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonomi smiled and simply said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I show you?\u201d Before you knew it the woman began walking the same powerful, elegant strut that she was earlier, now towards you on the fake sidewalk. It took her no more than a few steps to reach you, as your mind was going haywire trying to process what was happening. Before you could make a single move, Konomi\u2019s black heeled shoe slammed down onto your body, obliterating you into the pavement. Avery gasped and covered her mouth, Konomi simply stood with her weight pressed onto you until she heard the *click* of the automatic camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the first click things only got worse. Konomi began to twist and grind her sole onto you, causing you excruciating pain and smearing you flat into the false sidewalk. You couldn\u2019t believe that this photoshoot had taken such a dark and sudden turn into torture for you. After a series of more *clicks* from the camera, Konomi finally stepped off of you, and continued walking forward until she reached the edge of the city set. You heard one final click, no doubt taking a picture of your absolute splattered, two dimensional body stuck to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery was still too stunned to act, not knowing how carelessly her boss would treat her new roommate. Part of her was torn between standing up for you, but also part of her knew that this job meant the world to her, and risking it seemed like the last thing she wanted to do. While it didn\u2019t seem like Konomi took joy in what she just did, it definitely seemed like she had little concern for your wellbeing. She simply turned off the automatic picture taking feature of the camera and then looked down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn\u2019t been squashed for more than a few seconds, so despite the beatdown you just took you found yourself popping back to normal rather quickly. And just as you did you stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCheck out the clothes.\u201d Konomi said to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at your outfit, and with one single wipe of your hands to shake off the dirt and grime that came off of the sole of her heel, there wasn\u2019t a trace of the damage that Konomi had just done to you! The clothes looked brand new!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new proprietary fabric from the company, very hush hush and all that. But they said that one of the downsides of the many mishaps that little men like you have with giantesses like us is that the cheap cotton clothes made for you tend to rip off without the slightest bit of effort from us! These clothes promise to stay clean and on your body no matter the way you are twisted or treated! Each article even naturally sticks together if you apply enough pressure!\u201d Konomi explained the benefits of the magical clothing with perhaps a bit of callousness towards the plight of tiny men, but you couldn\u2019t argue with the results. These clothes really were a game changer. You saw even Avery had shifted to her focus, immediately forgetting her worries about you towards fascination towards the brand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow here\u2019s where you come in, Avery.\u201d Konomi turned to the beautiful, giddy girl, and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...\"</span></div></div>",

There\u2019s a line for girls too! That\u2019s totes super amazing!\u201d Literally jumping up and down with excitement, you paled at the sight of her hefty chest bouncing in time with her joy. Shaking yourself out of staring, you watched Avery scamper away to the box to get changed. Turning your back on her, you decided that you could at least be a gentleman in some ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonomi tapped her clipboard to get your attention. \u201cNow, Hunter, you might\u2019ve picked up that I mentioned certain \u2018sticky qualities\u2019. As this implies, these next set of photos are going to require you being squished or stretched.\u201d She smiled at you, but it didn\u2019t take a genius to see the money-making glint in her eyes. \u201cWill that be a problem?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou emphatically shook your head. \u201cNo ma\u2019am! No problem here!\u201d You put on a show of confidence, even though you weren\u2019t entirely looking forward to what was coming. Still, if this was all a test by Konomi, you weren\u2019t going to back down and fail. And, even if it wasn\u2019t a test, the more money that Konomi made, the more you and Avery would rake in. Win-win situation all around, you figured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery returned after a minute, and her new outfit was a far cry from the casual ensemble she\u2019d worn to the studio. She was clad from her neck to her toes in a sleek, sporty bodysuit that clung so tightly to her curvy supermodel body it might as well have been her second skin. The bodysuit was black with hot pink stripes racing across it, and looked exceptionally comfortable and maneuverable. The rational part of your brain admired the design of the fabric\u2026while the hormonal part of your brain couldn\u2019t stop ogling every inch of Avery. Ironically, despite literally covering most of her skin, the bodysuit left little to the imagination in practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour staring didn\u2019t go unnoticed by Avery, who struck a dynamic pose and winked at you. \u201cYou like what ya see, don\u2019tcha, Hunter? Hee hee! It is pretty sick, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed and averted your eyes, too embarrassed to mumble an apology or excuse, which only further enriched Avery\u2019s infectious giggles. Konomi was smiling too, but another look into her eyes told you that the gears in her head were spinning. What they were spinning about, only time would tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, you two.\u201d Konomi clapped her hands. \u201cTime to jump into it. These next few photos will involve most of our varying sets, but only for context and lighting purposes. The main point is to highlight how Micro-flex outfits stick and adhere to one another.\u201d She eyed Avery carefully. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to squish Hunter a bit, alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery frowned just a little. \u201cOh. I will? On purpose?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but he\u2019s okay with that. He already told me that it doesn\u2019t bother him at all.\u201d Konomi said, the lie sliding easily out of her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jerked your head over to her. \u201cW-wait, I didn\u2019t exactly say\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, awesome! Okay then!\u201d Avery exclaimed, her bright and cheery voice cutting off your attempt at clarification. Before you could try again, Konomi picked you up and carried you over to the fake gym set in the studio. A bit callously, she dropped you down onto the floor beside a treadmill, then sauntered over to adjust the camera. You picked yourself up off of the floor, once more amazed at how immaculate and clean your clothes were. Micro-flex was genuinely revolutionary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonomi steadied the camera, then motioned to Avery. \u201cAlright, Avery. Simple shot first. Step on up and then\u2026well\u2026STEP onto Hunter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently still a little apprehensive, Avery responded with a weak nod, biting her lip in an adorable fashion. Walking over to you, you were momentarily taken aback by just how humongous she was side-by-side with your bug-sized body. She was a gorgeous, heavenly goddess of a giantess, and standing down at her feet made you feel a mix of both awe and fear. You didn\u2019t quite know why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, maybe it was fear of the obvious, as, after sparing you a quick smile, Avery stepped down onto you, burying you under her left foot. Your body offered no resistance, flattening out into a paper-thin shape immediately. You were crushed out into a disc against Avery\u2019s heel, and, sure enough, you felt your clothes stick to Avery\u2019s bodysuit instantly. It was a strong adhesion too, not unlike glue, and when Avery lifted her foot a second later, you went with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemonstrating her flexibility, Avery twisted her leg up and held her foot in front of her face, spotting the red-colored flat circle that was your body on her heel. Giggling, she lightly poked your body, squishing your face a bit more into her heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHee hee! One second of squishing, and you\u2019re flat as can be, Hunter. Soooo cute!\u201d Avery gushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a business point of view, Konomi was pleased too, but hardly satisfied. \u201cExcellent, Avery. Now, step on him again, but this time grind your heel along the ground. Really work him into your foot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough an airheaded ditz most of the time, Avery wasn\u2019t dumb, and she looked at Konomi with shock. \u201cWha? Wouldn\u2019t that hurt the poor cutie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonomi shook her head succinctly. \u201cNot at all. I mentioned that Micro-flex reduces sensations of pain for tinies, remember? Hunter will be just fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was yet another lie, and you picked up on it right away. However, crushed flat, you had no way of shouting to Avery that Konomi was making things up, so your pink-haired partner simply blinked once to process what Konomi said, then grinned happily. \u201cOh, okay! That\u2019s totes cool. He\u2019s, like, invincible, huh? Wow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAirheaded Avery was back and in full force, and your current position left you powerless to defend yourself. You could just barely manage a wince in preparation for your next few seconds, as Avery just about slammed her foot back onto the ground. Convinced by Konomi\u2019s words that you couldn\u2019t feel a thing right now, Avery ground her heel against the floor with violent, reckless abandon, genuinely laughing at how loose she was letting herself be. Konomi watched with reserved fascination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Avery hoisted her foot back up thirty seconds later, you were more of a red stain spread across her entire heel than a simple circle, and were even more adhered to the fabric of her Micro-flex bodysuit than before. This pleased Konomi greatly, and the astute businesswoman eagerly snapped some shots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Avery...and Hunter. Excellent jobs so far.\u201d Konomi glanced at her clipboard. \u201cMicro-flex, along with testing their durability and sticky qualities, would really like us to take some publicity photos for their website that focus on tinies being squished and crushed in day-to-day settings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery frowned adorably at this direction, and let her foot fall back down, squishing you into the floor once more. \u201cReally? That\u2019s uber weird. Like, how does that make sense for a company that totes supports tinies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple, Avery.\u201d Konomi said gently, almost soothingly. \u201cBy taking fake candid photos, we can supply Micro-flex with data about how their product functions in real-life situations. On top of that, we can provide promotional materials that demonstrate how trapped or squashed tinies can be spotted and rescued, based on how they stick to other Micro-flex materials. Training tools, if you will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery had been bouncing on her feet during this entire explanation, repeatedly lifting her heels then digging them back down into the floor. Apparently, your current location had fled her vacant mind already. She finally stopped though, and clapped her hands together. \u201cAh, I gotcha! That\u2019s so crazy awesome! I love helping out like this, and I\u2019m sure Hunter does too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonomi nodded. \u201cOh, he does. He told me while you were changing that he is good to go with these photo shoots for as many hours as we might need them. He said he\u2019ll do anything for Starlight Studios!\u201d A third lie was just as easy as the others. You didn\u2019t hear a word, buried into the floor because of Avery\u2019s heel, but if you had, you would\u2019ve just been even more upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, Avery bit her lip again, and looked down at her foot, finally remembering where you were. \u201cSounds like something that little stud would say. OMG, he\u2019s too much!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, can we continue?\u201d Konomi walked back to the camera, and gestured towards the treadmill. Avery was more than happy to oblige her boss. In her mind, not only was this more fun than she\u2019d had in weeks, but she was determined to not drag down the experience for Konomi and you. As far as she was concerned, you were taking to modeling like it was your calling in life, and Avery would do everything to be the best damn partner for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next twenty minutes, Avery and Konomi took photos around the gym, with you still stuck to Avery\u2019s foot like you belonged there. Each new step further cemented you in place, the fabric of your clothes and your titanic roommates bodysuit meshing tightly, intertwining. It never stop hurting, and you silently begged for anything else but foot shots. Konomi had Avery posing on the treadmill, the bike, and the Stairmaster, each snapshot focusing on your crushed body and Avery\u2019s impressively nonchalant and unaware attitude. These were all meant to be candid, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the shooting calmed down, it took Avery and Konomi together to peel you free from Avery\u2019s foot, leaving you as an exhausted flat strip. Konomi scooped you up and held you tightly in her fist as she walked on to the next set, not enough to hurt but enough to keep you flat and unable to yell at her for the way she was tricking Avery into treating you. Powerless, your first day of hellish modeling continued\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cActually, I think that working at the beach would be a pretty easy job for me to handle.\u201d You reasoned. \u201cI love to help people out, and I think that I\u2019m pretty athletic. I don\u2019t know how good I\u2019d be at saving people, but I can help with any other issues, or be on the lookout for people in need.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn smiled approvingly. \u201cThat\u2019s a good attitude to have. You\u2019ll fit in, I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell that Morgan was a bit letdown that you hadn\u2019t picked her, and Avery was pretty upset that you hadn\u2019t chosen her either. However, there really was no way around it. It\u2019d be impossible for you to balance three jobs at once. You just decided that you would need to hang out with them later to make it up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day passed by fairly uneventfully. The four of you spend time hanging around and chatting in the living room, eventually transitioning into watching a movie. The movie came after dinner, which was efficiently prepared by Morgan and served by Quinn. It was really just a few frozen meals heated up, but it was still a meaningful gesture and a tasty experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the movie finished, it was nearing ten o\u2019clock at night, and each of the girls meandered upstairs to their rooms. Surprisingly, they each seemed to have forgotten about you, and left you all by yourself on the couch in the living room. You couldn\u2019t really blame them, as this was only the first night for the three girls living under the same roof as a tiny like yourself. Your existence hadn\u2019t become fully routine for them yet. Thankfully, it wasn\u2019t too cold in the living room, and the couch cushion was nice and comfy, so you easily fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke to Quinn standing above you, saying your name and lightly pushing the couch cushion with her foot to shake you awake. When you sat up groggily, she seemed to smile somewhat at your disheveled appearance, before switching back to her usual apathetic expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBreakfast in the kitchen.\u201d She said, jerking her head to motion towards the kitchen. She then sauntered away, leaving you to fulfill your morning obligations yourself. This way of treatment was still foreign to you, but there was something empowering about a giantess letting you act completely on your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting dressed and freshening up, you trekked over to the kitchen, narrowly avoiding Morgan\u2019s pounding feet as she strode to the front door. You would\u2019ve hated to get trampled under her sneakers as she left for the gym, so you were lucky you\u2019d leapt to the side in time. You were doubly lucky Avery was still asleep too, as you had no doubt, she\u2019d find a few to screw this morning up for you in that ditzy, bubbly way of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing up onto the kitchen table, you found that Quinn had set you aside some crackers and a shot glass of apple juice to drink from. Giving her an appreciative thumbs up, you dug into your meal, easily satisfying your hunger before you\u2019d even finished off all of the crackers. Quinn didn\u2019t say anything during the meal, but you caught her staring at you twice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished eating, Quinn lifted up a duffel bag of her own onto the table, and gestured to an unzipped pocket on the side. \u201cGet in. Easiest way to carry you, Hunter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing.\u201d You nodded, obliging the black-haired giantess. Scrambling up into the pocket, you fit snuggly inside. You watched the outside world disappear as Quinn zipped it up, and then everything began to swing and shake as Quinn shouldered the bag and headed for the door. In almost any other circumstance, this would terrify you, but you felt strangely at peace with placing your trust in your new roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your bag being set down on the passenger\u2019s seat, and then the car start up. It was a bit boring in the bag, but surprisingly comfy, and one hundred percent safe. The drive to the beach took a little over a half hour, but finally you heard the car stop. Quinn picked the bag back up, and gently patted the pocket you were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re here. Sanderson Beach.\u201d She explained, and if you listened closely enough, you could hear the seagulls and the waves in the distance. \u201cI need to go to the employee locker room to change, and then I\u2019ll take you to the office to meet with Brigitte.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pounded back against Quinn\u2019s hand as a sign of understanding, earning yourself the quietest and quickest of laughs you\u2019d ever heard, before your giantess carrier headed off to the locker room. You couldn\u2019t do much but keep waiting in the pocket, but you obviously knew why. In fact, you began to feel both embarrassed and intrigued by the fact that Quinn was now carrying you into the women\u2019s locker room. You had never in your life been in one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes of mostly silence passed, though you heard Quinn give a muffled \u2018hello\u2019 to someone else in the locker room with her. Finally, your pocket was unzipped, and you were quickly grabbed up by Quinn\u2019s giant, soft hand, her fingers enveloping you as she retrieved you. You were taken out of the bag and placed down on one of those hard-wooden benches common in locker rooms, and found yourself staring up at the black-haired giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll rational thought fled your mind. Your jaw openly dropped, and your knees felt weak. Quinn had been unfathomably attractive upon first meeting her, but this was on a whole other level. While you\u2019d been in the bag, she\u2019d changed into what you could only assume was her lifeguard uniform. Though it was only a simple red one-piece bikini at the end of the day, the very sight of it rocked your world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn\u2019s heavily abundant chest was wildly pronounced, as her gigantic breasts strained against the tight fabric of the bikini. The bikini clung to Quinn\u2019s body like a second skin (at a guess, it was a size too small for the curvaceous girl), and showed off so much of her porcelain smooth flesh. Every time Quinn so much as shifted slightly, her boobs jiggled, and the word \u2018LIFEGUARD\u2019 which was printed across her chest was stretched and distorted to a comical degree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing your extremely obvious stare, Quinn frowned and crossed her arms, succeeding only in squishing her abundant breasts more prominently. \u201cWow, perv. I thought you were better than that, Hunter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hastily clamped your jaw shut and stammered out a defense. \u201cI-I just didn\u2019t k-know you had changed! Caught me off guard!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was the only spare uniform close to my size that they had.\u201d Quinn sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so\u2026\u201d She cut herself off, and a faint color flared up in her cheeks. \u201cA-anyway\u2026it sucks, but whatever. Doesn\u2019t bother me that much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you look really great!\u201d You said, smiling (and secretly praying that a compliment was the right course of action here).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn quirked her mouth in a show of disbelief. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said you look great! Really!\u201d You nodded enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn seemed to debate whether you were being sincere or not for another second, and then finally smiled very softly. The blush had returned to her cheeks. \u201cTh-thanks, Hunter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing up her bag, Quinn effortlessly tied her short hair back and out of her eyes, then turned to put her bag into the locker behind her. For the second time in a row, your breath caught in your throat, and your jaw fell back open again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Quinn was impressive from the front, her backside was a heaven all onto itself. Her humongous derriere was impossibly alluring in her one-piece, each plump but doughy cheek perfectly sculpted into a big bubble booty. The one-piece left most of Quinn\u2019s creamy cheeks exposed, and it squeezed her ass so tight that the slightest movement shook it like an irresistible bowl of jelly. You desperately wished for nothing else than to leap into its pillowy embrace, this butt to end all butts bigger and more entrancing than any on the planet, in your books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to your staring, Quinn put her bag into her locker, then turned back to pick you up. Holding you in her hand, she walked out of the locker room and to the office. As she walked, you found it nigh impossible to not stare at her bountiful bosom or bodacious booty bounce and sway as she walked. Quinn was on a whole other level of thickness and beauty, and it was a shame she seemed oblivious to that. You also took note of how her one-piece seemed to keep riding up her butt crack, revealing even more of her ass. That whole \u2018size too small\u2019 issue was causing her a wedgie she had to keep picking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the office, Quinn introduced you to the chief lifeguard of Sanderson Beach, Brigitte. Brigitte was a twenty-five-year-old woman whose standout features were her fiery mane of red hair and her pronounced muscles and defined abs. She was alluringly muscled, fit but still feminine. Her own one-piece fit much more naturally than Quinn\u2019s, but she was still decently curvy under it. Her smile was award-winning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, little dude, it\u2019s a job you want?\u201d Brigitte asked, still smiling at you. It was a bit intimidating, how closely she was leaning in towards Quinn\u2019s hand to look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026yes! Yes, ma\u2019am! Any job you need, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d You proudly declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte grinned. \u201cLove the attitude, man! I\u2019ll hold you to that.\u201d She stood back to her full height of 6\u20192\u201d, and walked out from behind her desk. From what you\u2019d gathered, she spent most days handling office affairs. \u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026it\u2019s sudden to throw on another new lifeguard. We already have three others on shift today\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn mused. \u201cWith three lifeguard towers overlooking the beach, we can always use more eyes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue.\u201d Brigitte agreed. \u201cTell ya what, Hunter. Do me proud for one whole week, and you\u2019ve got a guaranteed position. Deal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d You said, shaking the red head\u2019s extended finger as a show of signing off on this new job. What\u2019s your first task?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWell, if testing you is what we\u2019re going with\u2026\u201d Brigitte tapped her chin, and looked at Quinn. Her eyes lit up. \u201cQuinn! Take Hunter with you to the middle tower. He\u2019ll be your partner for today\u2019s shift, and maybe the rest of the week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn nodded, understanding. \u201cOf course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled broadly. \u201cSounds like a plan to me, boss!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte laughed at your bravado. \u201cAlright, then get going, you two! Guard some lives!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Quinn both nodded again, before you hopped up onto Quinn\u2019s palm. Bracing yourself, you held steady as your black-haired roommate strolled out of the office and onto the beach proper. The sun was blisteringly hot, but thankfully you and Quinn had both put on some sunscreen (Quinn in particular had lathered up to the extreme). There was also an occasional breeze that felt quite good, especially on your miniscule body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn strolled purposefully towards the middle tower, which you could see was not too far away. It was a standard lifeguard lookout post, about twelve feet off the ground. That was only half what you were noticing, however, as your attention had shamefully wandered back to Quinn herself. In full motion, her gigantic breasts were once more bouncing in an eye-catching manner, and her one-piece was again riding up her massive booty, revealing even more of it to the world. You were hardly the only one staring too, as Quinn was drawing the eyes of everyone she walked by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven still, she seemed oblivious to the adoration of the beach goers, or her own sex appeal. Your roommate and new partner merely kept sauntering on, eventually reaching the bottom of the lifeguard tower. Without a word to you, she cupped her hand and tossed you into the sky. You screamed out in surprise, flew into the air, and then crashed back down up atop the tower, landing in a slightly squishy heap on the floor of the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you reformed, Quinn effortlessly scaled the ladder up onto the tower, and stood atop it seconds later. She spotted you immediately, and scooped you back up into her hand, then placed you on the railing that served as a barrier around the top of the tower. With you in place, she sank down into the lone chair, which looked to be made of uncomfortable hard plastic. You also couldn\u2019t help but note how Quinn\u2019s humongous ass just barely squeezed into the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of silence, you spoke up. \u201cSo\u2026this is the tower. What do we do now?\u201d You looked at your new partner eagerly, and though she stared back apathetically at first, your enthusiasm for your new job rubbed off just a bit on her, and she soothed her expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much, really.\u201d Quinn shrugged. \u201cIf someone asks for help, we help them. If someone starts screaming out in the water, we save them. Otherwise\u2026\u201d She gestured in a circle. \u201cThis is our post for the rest of the shift. Get comfy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed at her blunt explanation, and sat down on the wooden railing. It was smooth wood, so no splinters, thankfully. In fact, you bet that you were more comfortable sitting on the railing than Quinn was in her seat. Though it was early in the day, the sun had been bearing down for hours, and the plastic was probably quite broiling, not to mention how the chair pinched and poked at Quinn\u2019s hips and back. You had to believe that it was built for lifeguard\u2019s with much less developed proportions than the black-haired giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next twenty minutes were fairly uneventful. No one asked for help, no one screamed for a savior. The sounds of the beach were just the crashing of the waves, the laughing of the beach goers, the occasional windy breeze, and the cawing of seagulls. You passed the time with Quinn by asking her about some of her favorite memories working here. She was her usual cagey self for a bit, but she began to open up more as time went by. It was pretty fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the fun came to an end, and a faint voice called out from the bottom of the tower. \u201cHey! Miss! Can you help me find my phone? I swear, I just had it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn hopped to her feet instantly, and walked over to the railing, peering down at the young girl who had asked for help. \u201cOf course. I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d She replied. She then looked back to you, forcing you to quickly clamp your open jaw shut, hoping Quinn hadn\u2019t just caught you watching her bubble butt jiggle and shake due to how fast she had stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the way Quinn\u2019s eyes narrowed in annoyance, and the way she reached a hand back to readjust her wedgied one-piece, you knew that she had caught you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to not address it, you stammered out. \u201cU-uh\u2026want me to come with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, Quinn shook her head. \u201cNo, not this time. It\u2019ll take too long. Hold down the fort.\u201d She said, and then turned on her heel without another word. In one effortless motion, Quinn flipped around onto the ladder, and descended it out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll alone, you went back to scanning the beach, looking for anything that might be amiss, or anyone who might need help. There were a huge number of people at the beach, laughing, tanning, playing volleyball, swimming, and just generally enjoying themselves. For one blissful moment, you felt that this job was truly the best thing to ever happen to you, or any tiny, for that matter. It was perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe illusion of perfection shattered a moment later, when a squawking seagull dive-bombed through the air, coming to a screeching landing on the tower railing right beside you. You screamed and backed away, the giant bird like a mythical creature of death at your size. The seagull eyed you curiously, and took a step closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to end up the meal for some bird, you blindly leapt from the railing towards the inside of the tower, hoping it wouldn\u2019t follow you. You hadn\u2019t exactly looked where you were jumping, though, and you ended up landing right in the lifeguard chair. The fall slightly squished your legs, but the real thing you noticed first was the burning sensation of the hot plastic. It felt like you had landed in lava, it was almost overwhelmingly hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick glance told you that the seagull had given up and flown away, allowing you to breath a sigh of relief and focus on reforming. Your feet had flattened out and stuck to the plastic, the sticky nature of your body no doubt enhanced by how searingly hot the plastic was. Almost as overbearing as the temperature was the residual scent of Quinn\u2019s body wash mixed with her sweat. It was both gross and appealing, and that fact made it all the weirder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, you had only just reformed one foot when the worst possible thing happened: Quinn appeared, having finished helping the young girl down below. She scaled the ladder with ease, and then approached her chair. You still couldn\u2019t move, and could only look up at her in fear as she towered above you. Nightmare scenarios of her not noticing you and sitting down ran through your mind, but she actually spotted you right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands on her hips, Quinn frowned. \u201c\u2026what are you doing, Hunter? That\u2019s not your seat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held up your hands, willing your right foot to stop sticking to the chair. \u201cI-I know, I know! I\u2019m sorry, Quinn. A seagull flew by and scared me off the railing. This is where I fell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn\u2019s look of contempt told you that she didn\u2019t believe you, but there was a hint of uncertainty in her eyes. \u201cUh huh. You landed right where I\u2019m supposed to sit. Honestly, I should already BE sitting, even if you are there. It\u2019s not where you\u2019re supposed to be, after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the truth, honest! Please, Quinn, it won\u2019t happen again!\u201d You pleaded with your giantess lifeguard partner. \u201cI\u2019ll be more careful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn agonizingly long moment passed before Quinn closed her eyes and sighed. Reaching down, she plucked you up from her seat and returned you to the railing. She then sat back down, her butt audibly clapping against the plastic as she plopped into her chair. A grimace crossed your face, as visions of you being trapped under all of that played out in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave Quinn a big, genuine smile. \u201cThank you, Quinn. And I\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn shook her head. \u201cNo, I believe you, about the seagull. That isn\u2019t your fault, much. It would\u2019ve been wrong to punish you for it.\u201d She sighed, and you were about to speak again when she held up a finger, shushing you. \u201cBUT, if it happens again, I won\u2019t save you. You have to take care of yourself, Hunter, or you\u2019ll always be as weak and frail as people say that tinies are. You won\u2019t grow more dependable if I baby you every day during this job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took stock of her words, and nodded. \u201cOf course. You\u2019re right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn smiled faintly, and then was back to full business mode. \u201cSo if I see you on my chair again before I sit down\u2026\u201d She shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t let me find you on my chair, is what I\u2019m saying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRoger that!\u201d You saluted, earning a barely audible chuckle from the black-haired giantess. Then, the two of you went back to looking out over the beach. Your shift as partners continued.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a while of sitting around Quinn perked up hearing a shout from out in the water. Without hesitation she lept of from her chair and made her way out of the guard tower, leaving you behind. Not knowing what to do or being able to really follow Quinn you simply stayed put and waited for Quinn to return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked out onto the beach towards the direction Quinn ran off to and noticed that she was in the process of rushing out into the water. You looked a little farther out and saw that someone had drifted a little too far out and appeared to not be such a strong swimmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hated that all you could do is sit back and watch but also amazed at how quickly Quinn was taking care of the situation. Unfortunatley for you as you were distracted by the events unfolding out in the water you failed to notice the return of the seagull circling above you. By the time you noticed it swooping down at you once again all you could do is leap down from your perch and as fate would have it you landed in the worst possibly place, right back on Quinn's chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you regained your senses you looked and noticed your legs had been slightly squished from the fall and you frantically tried to reform them before Quinn returned. As if fate was laughing at you, you began to hear someone coming back into the guard tower and you prayed that it wasn't Quinn. Your prayers were not answered as you saw Quinn emerge from the ladder and enter the tower. As she entered she looked forward and instantly noticed you in the seat of her chair once again, a look of annoyance crossing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn approached the chair and you quickly began to plead to her \"wait Quinn, please, it's not what it looks like I-\" you started to say but it fell on deaf ears it seemed. Staying true to her word, Quinn turned her back to you and you could only look up in terror as her massive rear end came crashing down on top of you like a giant meteor, instantly squashing you flat beneath her. She shifted around in her chair to get comfortable, grinding your body underneath her. Once she finally settled you began to realize that you were going to be stuck here for quite a while and should just accept your fate and hope that maybe she would have to get up to help someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuck seemed to be against you today as the rest of the shift was completely uneventful and you remained squashed beneath Quinn's enormous backside. Unable to really see or do anything you had lost track of time but suddenly you felt a shift of movement from Quinn as she finally stood up. Unfortunately as Quinn stood you realized you were coming with her as you were now stuck to her butt. Quinn turned to looked down at the chair and when she noticed you were no longer there she simply shrugged and made her way out of the guard tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn made her way across the beach and towards the office building, each step causing her ass to sway and jiggle, which in turn cause you to do the same. Being squashed face first into Quinn's butt meant you really couldn't tell what was going on but you heard a door open and you noticed a drastic change in temprature meaing Quinn had entered the office building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds you heard another door open and Quinn spoke \"hey, my shift is over and heading home, so you'll want to send someone to tower 3\" she said. Bridgette looked up from her work and smiled \"Ok, thanks for the heads up. By the way, how did Hunter do on his first day?\" she asked. Quinn stopped for a second and shrugged \"he did ok I guess, pretty uneventful day\" she told her. \"Oh? Well thats good I guess, don't want to overwhelm him on his first day. Where is the little guy?\" Bridgette asked not seeing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn reached back and peeled you off of her butt, then held you in front of her. Bridgette laughed at this and shook her head \"and why exactly was he stuck to your ass?\" She questioned Quinn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn shrugged \"he kept getting into my chair, so I just sat down\" she told her boss. \"Well, if he is interested in being a seat cushion, I will be here for a bit and sure could you some extra padding in this old chair\" Bridgette laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Quinn respond....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Time passed as you and Quinn continued to relax and chat on your shift. It seemed like this was going to be a very easy job, especially if you\u2019re being partnered with someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you heard someone climbing up the ladder and you and Quinn turned to see who was approaching. A giant blonde reached the top of the ladder and she was wearing a red lifeguard swimsuit similar to Quinn\u2019s, only this one was a two-piece, exposing the blonde\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was definitely on the curvy side with a similar build to Quinn, her seemingly luscious blonde locks were tied up in a top-knot bun. She had beautiful blue eyes, plump lips, and slightly tanned skin. Age-wise, she appeared to be in her late 20s, and you had to admit, she was pretty hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Quinn!\u201d The happy blonde rang out. Exhibiting a bubbly, fun personality. \u201cHow are you today?\u201d The blonde\u2019s energy contrasted greatly with Quinn\u2019s as your roommate seemed slightly annoyed with this girl. \u201cOh... hey Bethany...\u201d Quinn bluntly greeted her coworker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde, evidently named Bethany, seemed unaware of Quinn\u2019s annoyance of her and continued the conversation. \u201cBrigitte told me we have a new member of our team, and I heard he was a tiny! I wanted to come introduce myself!\u201d Bethany said with an eager tone in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn turned to look at you and saw that you were staring at your new found \u201cdiscovery.\u201d You snapped out of it for a moment and made eye contact with Quinn, embarrassed that she noticed your admiring of Bethany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s right over there.\u201d Quinn dryly declared, pointing towards the rail where you resided. Bethany turned her gaze to where Quinn gestured and saw your tiny body in plain sight. She sauntered over to you, her hips swaying and chest slightly bouncing in a hypnotic display as she approached. She stood in front of you, the rail coming up to her waist so you were face-to-face with her soft belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to crane your head upwards, attempting to concentrate on her deep blue eyes to avoid the distraction of her physique. Bethany stared down at you for a moment and smiled. \u201cWell hello there, cutie! My name is Bethany!\u201d Her \u201ccutie\u201d comment definitely caught you off guard as you tried to formulate a response. \u201cUh.. hi. I\u2019m Hunter!\u201d Quinn rolled her eyes at your awkward reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBethany continued to study the tiny boy below her. Since tinies became a normal part of society, she has always treated them well and enjoyed interacting with them. However, this time it felt different; she had never encountered a tiny so... cute before. Her infatuation with you was growing each passing second as she eyed your cute face and shirtless body, she was going to enjoy working with you. She was a really sweet girl at heart, but not the most self-aware as she can be a tad too affectionate at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to feel slightly uncomfortable as the massive blonde continued her locked gaze on you, the grin she sported doing nothing to calm you down. \u201cWow...\u201d Bethany said. Finally breaking the silence. \u201cI must say, you are incredibly cute! I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever met a tiny as handsome as you!\u201d She finished her statement with a flirtatious wink causing you to tremble. Something about this girl made you slightly uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Umm, thank you! That\u2019s... nice of-Whoa!\u201d You were interrupted as a giant hand reached down and scooped you up off the railing and you were now face-to-face with Bethany as you sat on her palm. The happy blonde giggled before she started to poke and lightly stroke you with her finger, the tickling sensation grew quickly as you tried to fight her off. Quinn took a slight enjoyment at your predicament as she watched you grunt and squirm. \u201cAww! How adorable!\u201d Bethany sang as she continued to tickle your abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments Quinn began to grow annoyed with Bethany's obnoxious laugh and decided to come retrieve you. \u201cOkay, I think that\u2019s enough.\u201d Your roommate declared with authority as she grabbed you from her coworker\u2019s hand. \u201cAwww...\u201d Bethany's once joyful expression took a 180. You almost felt bad for her, she seemed nice and probably means well, but you were also relieved to be back in Quinn\u2019s grasp. \u201cIt\u2019s probably best if we all get back to work\u201d Quinn continued, having no regards of her coworker\u2019s sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay... well I\u2019m going to head back to my post then...\u201d Bethany was pretty bummed as she walked towards the ladder... but then she got an idea! \u201cSay, Quinn... would it be okay if I took Hunter for a bit? You know... show him around the beach and stuff?\u201d The sweet smile quickly returned to the blonde\u2019s face. Your heart nearly stopped at her suggestion, and you turned to look at Quinn, subtly trying to shake your head \u2018no\u2019 and use your eyes to communicate that message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn read your message loud and clear, she knew you didn\u2019t want to go with her. On the other hand she was still kinda pissed about the seat incident from earlier and sort of wanted to get back at you somehow. She knew Bethany very well, and the idea of you being stuck in her loving clutches was amusing to her. The thought brought a subtle smirk to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe delay of Quinn\u2019s response was unsettling, she obviously had something on her mind... was she considering letting Bethany take you with her??? Your thoughts were interrupted as Quinn opened her mouth and said \u201c______\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYeah sure. Whatever.\u201d Quinn answered. Before you could open your mouth to protest you felt yourself fly in the air as Quinn tossed you towards Bethany. The blonde had no time to react as you sailed towards her, so instead of catching you with her hand, you landed straight on her boobs. You bounced a few times before falling into the ravine that was her cleavage. Your entire body was wedged between the two fleshy mounds, completely out of sight. For a moment you wondered if Quinn purposefully intended for you to land here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn giggled with a satisfied expression. \u201cWow! Looks like he\u2019s already having fun!\u201d Bethany blushed for a moment as she processed what just happened. \u201cOh oops.. my bad Hunter!\u201d The blonde sympathetically expressed. \u201cOh don\u2019t apologize!\u201d Quinn chimed in again. \u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s just where he wants to be! I saw the way he was looking at you earlier, he\u2019s definitely on cloud nine right now!\u201d You tried to shout and explain the truth to Bethany, but your voice was muffled between her huge boobies. \u201cHee hee! That tickles!\u201d The happy blonde giddily announced as she felt your attempts to talk and squirm free, her boobs quivered as she laughed causing you to bounce in a nauseating rhythm with them. \u201cGuess it\u2019s your turn to get tickled now!\u201d Quinn teased. Butterflies excitedly swarmed in Bethany's stomach at the revelation that you seem to like her too! \u201cOmg! This is just FANTABOLOUS!\u201d Bethany squealed like a school girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn watched Bethany eagerly descend the ladder and haul you far away towards the other end of the beach, her bikini booty bouncing happily with each step. For a moment she felt kind of bad about what she just did to you, maybe the chair situation really was just an accident... However, she also knew that you having some time with an overbearing girl like Bethany might toughen you up a little more! Pleased with her justification, she turned her attention back towards the beach as you slipped her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuried as deep as you were in Bethany's cleavage, there was really nothing you could do to prevent her from carrying you away with her. Your feeble attempts to struggle or protest absorbed into the bouncing of her breasts without even being noticed by the massive blonde. With the warm flesh rubbing against you from all sides, it was difficult just to maintain your basic shape, let alone try to hatch an escape plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeedless to the thoughts of her little passenger, Bethany was just happy to have her new little friend in tow as she strolled along the beach, her large rear jiggling happily with each step. She\u2019s always been intentional in making sure that tiny men are treated fairly and well, so she takes joy in befriending you! Plus... she hasn\u2019t had a boyfriend in a long time, so she was excited to get to spend the day with such a cute boy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Bethany truly is a sweetheart and always tries to be kind to everyone she meets, she severely lacks social awareness. Her overbearing and highly affectionate nature typically acting as a major factor in her actions. This behavior has scared off many in the past, especially men, and little did you know you were about to become the next victim of her tender motivations...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh wait a minute!\" Brigitte exclaimed, raising her finger and eyebrows at the same time as she seemingly remembered something. \"I completely forgot about our tinies only section of our beach! We typically have had one of our normal sized lifeguards watch over it, as its pretty much just a 10x10 foot square of sand leading up to the water. But quite often there are issues that could likely use a bit more precision than our girls can give. I mean you save dozens of tiny guys from drowning without so much as a thank you, but accidentally kidnap a few guys after the waves slide them into the back of your swimsuit and you\u2019ll never live it down.\u201d Brigitte shook her head, part of her chuckling at her quick anecdote, and part actually annoyed by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s where you come in,\u201d she continued, \u201cThere\u2019s an appropriately sized lifeguard tower towards the edge of the zone, as well as a tiny megaphone for you to yell at any of the tiny guys in there or any normal sized girl trying to enter the zone.\u201d You smiled in return, appreciative of the inclusion of the megaphone. While some strange part about the physiological changes of men allowed your voices to travel to normal girls\u2019 ears most of the time, seemingly if they weren\u2019t paying enough attention then they often still wouldn\u2019t hear you. Being able to bolster your voice even a bit would likely be quite helpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte leaned over you once more, her powerfully toned body contrasting the overwhelming softness of your new giantess roommate behind you. \u201cSave people who need saving, help people who need helping, it\u2019s pretty self explanatory. Now get out there, and you too, Wallace, you\u2019ll be manning the station that the tiny section is in. Keep an eye out and help him if he needs it but I don\u2019t want to catch you doing his job for him!\u201d Brigitte\u2019s firmness was accompanied by a level of genuine confidence and enthusiasm that somehow reassured you. While she looked intimidating, you could tell that if you stayed on her good side then she would be a good ally to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am, believe me I won\u2019t be babying this guy. He\u2019s gotta survive on his own somehow.\u201d Quinn said to Brigitte, her eyes flicking down to you midway through her sentence. In a way you really appreciated Quinn\u2019s blunt, no nonsense way of speaking to you. You had grown used to women either taking care of your every need in an overbearing way, or actively seeking out to torture you. Either way the fact that you were only an inch tall seemed to almost always be the focus of any woman\u2019s attention towards you. It was quite refreshing to hear Quinn actually talk to you as an equal, even if you were about 1/70th her height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn then plucked you up in her hand, readjusting so you could sit on her palm as she turned and walked swiftly out of the office. Making a pitstop back in the locker room, Quinn stopped by her locker, placed you on the bench, and took out a large tube of SPF 100 sunscreen. You could only gawk up at your giant friend as she began to smear the cream over every inch of exposed flesh. You watched her soft hands caressing each of her comically oversized assets, making sure she didn\u2019t miss a single spot. The amount of sunscreen she needed to cover a single gargantuan butt cheek would probably be a lifetime supply for you. In the middle of your deep trance you heard Quinn\u2019s voice,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStaring again, perv. If you\u2019re going to work as a lifeguard you\u2019re going to have to learn how to keep your composure around regular girls in bikinis.\u201d Quinn\u2019s tone indicated half annoyance, but also half genuine enjoyment that she took from poking fun at you. Either way, you were about to shout back to her that she was far beyond a \u201cregular girl\u201d as she said due to her ludicrously attractive looks, but before you could speak a drop of sunscreen as big as you landed right on you. You quickly dug your way out of the thick substance, reaching the top to catch the tail end of a light chuckle coming from Quinn. By the time you pulled yourself out of the glob you were sufficiently covered head to toe, ensuring that you would neither melt nor burn yourself in the hot sun. Quinn then reached down with a finger, swiping up the remaining sunscreen on the bench and rubbing it into her the last spot on her ass that she hadn\u2019t yet covered. Quinn caught you looking once more and simply rolled her eyes before picking you up yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on let\u2019s get out there\u201d she said as she closed her locker and began powerfully walking out into the blistering sun. It was a scorching day on the beach, happy to be covered in Quinn\u2019s extra strong sunscreen. Since both of your stations were located towards the middle of the beach, it only took you a matter of minutes to reach them. You saw the tinies only section from your perch in Quinn\u2019s hand. It consisted of a number of spikes in the sand, with bright red rope traveling between them, effectively sectioning off the 10x10 foot area that Brigitte had been talking about before. You saw it was fairly crowded too, with a number of guys looking to simply spend a nice day at the beach without fear of being crushed by a roaming giantess. It honestly looked pretty fun to you, briefly making you wish that you had more friends your size. Spending all of your time with giant women had its benefits for sure, but the normalcy of the tiny zone did seem like a welcome change of pace for once. Quinn finally arrived at the edge of the rope, bending over to drop you off in the sand. As she did so you saw each and every head in the zone turn to stare at the hanging mountain of cleavage behind them. Honestly, you couldn\u2019t blame them, you were too. Quinn\u2019s body was a spectacle, even if she didn\u2019t often acknowledge it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Hunter, do some good work today. I want to make sure you keep this job\u2026 it would be kind of cool to keep working together like this.\u201d Quinn said down to you, once again showing just the slightest crack in her normally apathetic attitude. She then stood back up, returning to her full height, and turned to walk back towards her own normal sized lifeguard tower. Once more you and the sea of tiny guys in the section stared at the ridiculous ass eating up the backside of her lifeguard one piece with each passing step. You shook yourself out of staring and walked a few steps, climbing the lifeguard tower and sitting yourself in the high chair. Sure enough the megaphone was hanging off of the armrest and there was a miniature umbrella casting a nice shadow over you. You looked out beyond the tiny guys\u2019 zone and saw a myriad of beautiful giant women frolicking and having fun on the beach. You breathed a sigh of contentment, maybe your job wouldn\u2019t be so bad after all. After all, you knew from experience that guys were fairly resilient, so you didn\u2019t have much fear of actually needing to save any lives. It seemed like a pretty solid gig. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat befalls you as lifeguard of the tinies only section?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was quite crowded that day and most of the open space on the beach was already taken by other women. For that reason when you heard a woman\u2019s voice behind you say, \u201cUgh, finally an open space\u201d you whipped your head around and knew that she was headed straight for you. You watched for a moment as her massive feet kicked sand to and fro, each step getting her closer along her path right towards the tinies only section. Fumbling with your megaphone for a moment you finally raised it to your lips, the woman only a few steps away from steamrolling you under her massive sole and trampling countless guys in front of you as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, ma\u2019am! This is not an open space, this is an area dedicated to tiny men only!\u201d You shouted up, your voice amplified through the megaphone being clearly loud enough for the woman to hear. She luckily slowed down her pace and looked downward, finally seeming to recognize the mass of tinies laid out in front of her. She grimaced for a moment before looking specifically at you. You kept talking, \u201cI apologize for the inconvenience, but if you could kindly find somewhere else to set up your things I would really appreciate it. Normal sized women are not supposed to go past the red rope!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant woman tapped her chin for a moment in thought, before her eyes lit up with an idea. You were nervous already, you had hoped that the woman would just comply and leave you be. But deep down you knew that whatever idea of authority that you thought the lifeguard job would give you, ultimately meant jack squat when dealing with a woman who could squish you like chewed gum. She finally spoke down to you, \u201cEver heard of Baker\u2019s law?!\u201d the woman said haughtily, pointing confidently at her tan swimsuit bottom. Your heart dropped as you knew immediately what she was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaker\u2019s law was a Supreme Court decision that had been made nearly 18 months ago at this current point in time. After years of fighting from a student, now graduate, at a college called Middletown University that goes by the name of Amy Baker, a law concerning the usage and rights of tiny men as items had been passed. You heard all about it on the news when it first passed. Amy Baker fought for the idea that men should be able to choose to be used as whatever they wanted, not just forced to live as miniature regular people. They could pursue getting legally licensed for use by a specific woman or in general, as long as all parties involved were willing. The law stated that any licensed man must still be recognized as a human being, no matter what condition they were currently in or what they were being used for. The process in its entirety was quite rare, with a very small percentage of the population actually going through with it, but nonetheless it made nationwide headlines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was seen by this Amy Baker herself as a landmark day for tiny men\u2019s rights. She thought that men who were okay with being used should be respected and accepted for doing so. It was a sweet idea, really, but in reality it was easily abused by women who sought far worse fates for the tiny men that surrounded them. A few cases of men who got their Usage License for the right reasons would find their way to news stations every once in a while. A husband signing up for use from his wife and daughter because he didn\u2019t have enough money to buy them Christmas presents would warm the hearts of those who heard of it. But just as often as you heard good stories about Baker\u2019s Law, you also heard the opposite. Men were often threatened into pursuing their Usage License, or outright sold themselves into it in hopes of making a quick buck. You never really understood the point of passing the law in the first place, as you had never once noticed a woman police officer asking to see someone\u2019s Usage License ever. All you knew was that there was no way in hell you would do it yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping back into reality, you knew that when the woman said those words and pointed to her rather small bikini bottom, that it must have been a small guy just like you. You empathized with the man, having been in his situation more than a few times before. The woman then kept talking,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell he is a tiny guy just like you and the law says you have to respect his rights even though he is my swimsuit bottom! Since he is wrapped around my ass right now then my ass deserves entry into your stupid tinies only section. Couldn\u2019t you all just scoot over a bit too? It\u2019s not like I\u2019ll take up the entire space!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea how to handle the situation. If you still rejected the woman then she may really be able to pursue legal discourse, suing the lifeguard company for not respecting the rights granted to men by Baker\u2019s Law. You cursed this stupid law, what rights did that guy receive? The right to have his entire body wedged between her butt cheeks? In reality it just granted this giantess woman even more privilege to do as she pleased. Briefly considering standing up to the giantess, you eventually decided against it. However, an idea did spark in your mind about a loophole in the system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, of course we respect his right to be in here, he is a tiny after all. But since he is currently residing around your, erm, backside, then I am afraid your backside is the only part of you that is allowed to be in here with him.\u201d You smirked internally, knowing that at least in some way you had followed the rules and still won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman furrowed her brow in anger for a moment, before lightening up and responding simply, \u201cOkay that works for me!\u201d In an instant she dropped her things just outside of the roped off area, sending a cloud of sand careening over you and countless tiny guys near you. As the cloud of sand cleared you looked up to see the giantess had turned herself around, and had already begun squatting down, right where your lifeguard stand was on the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*crack*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive woman\u2019s ass collided with your lifeguard tower and yourself first, absolutely detonating the seat which you were starting to love so much. As it shattered you fell to the sand a few feet, with her planet sized ass following suit. Even in this horrific moment, you couldn\u2019t help but think that this woman\u2019s still sizable ass wasn\u2019t even in the same league as Quinn\u2019s. But you didn\u2019t have time to think as the crushing pressure of the woman rammed you deeper into the sand, displacing the grains around her. When all was said and done the woman\u2019s ass was planted firmly on top of you, with her legs sticking out away from the water and outside of the roped off tiny zone. She had won, you cursed yourself for being so stupid. You could only hope that this woman could show you mercy at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you handle this rude giantess?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The heat and the pressure underneath this woman was nearly too much for you, buried under her butt. With all your might you tried to wriggle and get away from her but being directly under her cheek made it impossible for you to move. You tried to focus on what to do under the heat and pain you were in.<br>\r\n\"I have to get out of here, I cant fail on my first task of the day! And what will  my boss and the other lifeguards think of me when property of the beach gets destroyed under my watch?\" You tried again but there was no avail. She was just much too heavy for you and you were much too squashed. Your senses became more and more dull thanks to the immense heat and pressure you were suffering. After sometime.. you coulndt say if it were 10 min or 1h her butt sweat began dripping from her cheek, forming a layer on her butt and yourself. At first you were just disgusted as anyone would, especially when that sweat comes from this bodyregion. Suddenly you remembered the poor guy, who apparently voluntered to experience this and much worse things as her swimsuit bottom.\"Why would someone volunteer for such a horrible  treatment with all the sweat and worse? Especially only for the profit of such an unpleasant woman\" you wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whait SWEAT that's it! I can try to wriggle around the next time she shifts her position and with a little luck I can escape due the layer of liquid around me! Or maybe dig my way out of here, right beside the sand doesnt seem so compressed as it is here\" you thougt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time the woman did shift around for some reason. The silent *plop* of a sunscreen bottle delivered the explanation why luck was on your side. But it didnt matter to you: You wriggled your whole body to move a little forward. Step by step you moved forward like a snail, unfortunatly for you was the fact that you were just as slow as the animal. Finally you arrived at the section of loose sand to dig your way to freedom. When you looked up you could see the huge ass crack of your (former?) captive. You tried to get the fear out of your head, cause it would only lead to freeze you because of that feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now lets do this\" you said to yourself, trying to motivate you and getting the fear out of your head. Suddenly you heard a quiet but noticable voice:<br>\r\n \"Hello? I mmmpf HELP!\" <br>\r\nYou nearly pissed yourself out of fear until you remembered the thong-guy and that the voice most likely belonged to him.<br>\r\nThe next moment you looked up and saw the butt looming over you. You had to think quickly: \"Ok I dont know what is happening here but first i need to get away from this ground zero, if i make it I can solve the riddle of the thong-mans voice\" you cursed yourself for the term \"thong- guy\" but since that stupid law passed the supreme court it was all around the news and media in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou digged your way away from this dangerous place and made mor progress than you expected yourself. You were in a good physical condition but was helping you the most , was the fact that this woman took her sweet time for putting on her sun lotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your work was done and you felt safe enough to look back you realized that you indeed made it out of the danger zone. Exhausted you allowed yourself a moment of rest,celebrating your victory and taking a deep breath of fresh air. <br>\r\nAfter 5 min of resting and reforming more and more you were nearly in your original human form,which filled you with joy and relief. Mostly because it wouldnt be the first time for you getting away from one danger and stumbling in the next.<br>\r\nSpeaking of danger: \" I have to solve this stupid situation with this woman without getting squashed again you \" you told yourself. \"But what about the guy in her back... Was he really calling for help or was it just the pressure and heat which made me hallucinate?\" you wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile thinking about this occurence under the butt your feet finally plopped back in their normal form and you were able again to walk and solve the problem with the lifeguard stand and maybe solve the riddle of the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly approached the woman, who seemed to read a book with her sunglasses on and enjoying her time. What angered you additionally to your broken work station was the fact that she does not seem to be concerned about what you two talked about before, now almost her whole body was in the tiny section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u00c4hm EXCUSE ME ,MISS?\" you shouted up to her.<br>\r\nConfused she took her sunglasses down a little to see who was talking to her and finally she cought sight of you.<br>\r\n\"You again? What do you want from me again? I'm trying to enjoy me time here at the beach. Wasn't our early talk enough for you to realized that you are not welcome here?<br>\r\nWhat she said was making a very angry and much less careful.<br>\r\n\"I'M THE LIFEGUARD HERE AND YOU ARE A GUEST OF THIS BEACH. I REMIND YOU THAT YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW THE ORDERS OF THE STAFF WITHOUT EXCEPTION!\" you screamed at her full of anger.<br>\r\nAt first she looked shocked at your outburst but soon she just smirked while shrugging her shoulders. She doesnt seem to be impressed and answered with a slight giggle :<br>\r\n\"Well Mr. Lifeguard, of course I follow the orders of the beach. We talked about my rights...aaahm his rights to be in this tiny section.\" <br>\r\nWhen she mentioned the guy in her backside, you suddenly remembered your second goal for this conversation but you had to play your cards smart.<br>\r\n\"Well first of all I have to correct you a little, indeed you followed my orders from before but it seems like you didnt notice that you destroyed property of the firm I'm working for, my Lifeguard- outlook. Which i believe wasnt on purpose but still is a violation.<br>\r\n\"I didnt destroy anything, i would be glad if you showed me proof of these wild accusations\" she demanded.<br>\r\nAfter you told her to stand up and look behind her, her face turned red out of anger or shame you couldnt tell.<br>\r\n\"Well ok , seems like I did, but there was no way for me to see this little match- house.\" Plus it was Brains fault as well\" she said while pointing at her thong, which began to have a deep red colour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This brings me to the  next topic i wanted to ask you about...\" you started your sentence dripping of confidence after your last verbal win against this woman. You were disgusted that she tried to blame her thong for this but that was their personal problem. What you were interested in was the usage license<br>\r\nwith both their signatures.<br>\r\n\"May I ask you for your usage license please?\" you asked. <br>\r\n\"Well no , cause that is really none of your damn buisness and besides I only have to show it to a police officer.\" she said offended.<br>\r\n\"Well that is indeed very true but when I was burried with my Outlook -tower under you I could hear a voice shouting out for help, which made me believe It was worth asking why this might be\" you said overconfidently, forgetting about the difference in her and your possibilties.<br>\r\n\"Well, Well, Well we have a very dedicated young lifeguard here it seems, always seeking for the wellbeing of his customers.\" she said while searching in her beach bag. After a little time of searching, she took a very creasy piece of paper out of her bag, which was nearly not readable due of its bad state. On one corner you could see a big coffee spot in the middle there was something which looked like ketchup.<br>\r\n\"This is the Usage License for my little thongy- Tony here\", she said while pulling on her thong to emphazise her power over him and smirking at you.<br>\r\nWhen you looked on it you could only read that her name was Rachel Wood and that her part of the document had a signature as it should be. But the other half of the paper, where his information should be was all dirty and nearly not readable. At first you thought you would have lost again against this woman but fortunatly for you, you realized that there was no signature to see under the coffee spot.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry mam it seems there is no signature of a Tony on this license which makes the whole document wortless, legally speaking of course\" you said smiling and drunk of your own self esteem. \" I will have to call my boss to further inspect this anomaly, I'm sure when we ask Tony he will explain everything\" you said <br>\r\nIn the blink of an eye the woman grabed you with light speed and you found yourself right in front of her angry face. <br>\r\n\"Oh I  dont think so my dear. Do you see this woman there?\" she asked pointing at a huge curvy black woman in a skimpy blue bikini walking towards your spot and waiving with her arms to greet. Even from this perspective you could see that her assets , especially her butt were giant in comparison to Rachels<br>\r\n\"This is Isabella, my dearest friend and by coincidence she is a notary which can confirm my story about tonys free choice to be a thong for me. \" she explained to you with a huge smile on her face.<br>\r\n\"She was responsible for all the paper work I had to do before I could get Tony where I wanted. So here is the deal little man either you stay silent about all  of these accusations with the tower and tony, or maybe a new Usage License appears with your name on it and I promise you that the \"For everyone to use\"- Box will be crossed. I'm sure Isabella would gladly be of help for your wish. And the way I see it you would also make a great thong but I guess you will be the wrong size for a woman like me\" she said with a telling expression on her face while turning her eyes to Isabell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were in a double windmill. either you give in and wont have an explanation for the lost tower  or you will have to deal with a corrupt notary and her evil friend leading to a Usage Licence for yourself. \"What shall I do either way I'm fucked up, the question is... is my well being more important than tonys? Noone will investigate his status as a thong without you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But even though it was your first day, it was your duty as a lifeguard to protect the lives of any tiny guys at the beach. It would have weighed heavily on your conscience if you just abandoned him to be imprisoned in this arrogant woman\u2019s ass. Clearly you figured that she, with the help of her friend, had the ability to create counterfeit usage licenses based on the muffled screams of the guy acting as her thong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even knowing that fact, you would never be able to forgive yourself if you let this fellow guy Tony suffer in his current predicament. You cursed your stupidly strong sense of empathy, knowing that like always it would only lead you to trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry miss, but I just can\u2019t let this slide. This usage license clearly isn\u2019t official and you know it.\u201d You said up to her, still pretending to find this mysterious panic button that you claimed to have on you. From in between two of her fingers, pinching you like a twig, it was admittedly hard to feign confidence. You saw the malice growing in this giantess\u2019s eyes as you challenged her, strengthening the pit of nerves that you felt in your stomach. You knew firsthand that directly challenging a normal sized girl as a one inch tall guy was consistently the dumbest choice that you could make, but for some reason you just couldn\u2019t let this situation go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your absolute surprise Rachel opened up her fist and simply dropped you onto the sand below! You landed with a thud inaudible to any regular sized people, immediately trying to straighten and reform the legs that she squished in her grip. Nevertheless, it seemed like your plan had worked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, you little tattletale. Messing with you isn\u2019t worth the risk of you actually calling over someone who has real power.\u201d Rachel said while gathering her things! It seemed like you had actually won your battle! Your confidence soared briefly, thinking on your feet actually got you out of a jam for once. But then Rachel continued, \u201cMy friend and I will find somewhere else on this stupid beach to tan, but not before we find another lifeguard and ask allllll about you. I\u2019m sure that my notary friend finding out all of your personal details won\u2019t end up badly for you at all!\u201d Rachel\u2019s indirect threat struck fear further into your heart as she then leaned down, lowered her sunglasses, and looked directly into your eyes. Her enormous breasts threatened to spill out of her bikini top, but you were far too terrified to even pay attention to them at a time like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you think you might have won or something, twerp, but you didn\u2019t. Not only am I not giving up my little thong, but let\u2019s just say your life is going to get a lot more difficult in the near future.\u201d Rachel smirked before finishing, \u201cEven though I may not be the one dishing out the punishment to your tiny ass, you better pray that the other women in your life really like you, because if they don\u2019t\u2026 well you\u2019ll find out!\u201d As she concluded her speech, Rachel stood up and shot you a final wink before spinning around and walking away. She signaled to her friend Isabella that they would need to find a new spot, prompting a quick look of confusion from the woman before she simply shrugged her shoulders and kept walking. As the two women walked further into the distance you cursed the sad life of that guy, Tony, watching as he was chewed up between the callous woman\u2019s butt cheeks. You took another moment to assess your surroundings and you lamented the state of the men\u2019s beach section. The simple action of that jerk of a woman sitting down in the sand practically wiped out everything that was set up to help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back once more to make sure that the two menaces of women were actually leaving, you gulped with fear upon remembering Rachel\u2019s threat. If her friend really was a notary like she said, could she really write a usage license for you without your consent?! As you had that thought your eyes found the two, now a good distance away, and they seemed to be talking to Brigitte. Rachel clearly pointed directly at you and the tiny guy\u2019s section, sharing a few words with your boss of all people. Your eyes opened wide, as you finally saw Brigitte split from the two immediately begin walking towards you. Now panicked, you frantically wondered what that malicious woman may have said to your boss. If she bad mouthed you enough you wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you were fired on the spot! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte\u2019s long powerful steps covered the vast stretch of beach between you and her in no time. What may have been a multiple day hike for you was only a minute or so for the strong giantess. Your nerves were about to overwhelm you as Brigitte walked straight up to you, surprisingly noticing you next to the remnants of your shattered lifeguard tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHunter!\u201d She exclaimed, intimidating you once more. But suddenly she broke into a huge smile, \u201cThose two women over there just raved to me about how helpful you were to them! They said they really appreciated your hard work and were asking all about you! They even asked for your home address which I thought was a bit strange at first, but they said they wanted to send you a gift or something. Either way, keep up the good work. You\u2019ve already surpassed my expectations for you, and the busy part of the day should just about be ending so the rest of the day should be a breeze.\u201d Brigitte shot you a big thumbs up before turning and walking away, presumably to check on Quinn and the other lifeguards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t believe your ears. Not only did Rachel and Isabella not try to get you fired, but they actually praised you. On one hand you were happy, but on the other hand you felt incredibly uneasy with how that whole situation went down. What else did that crazy girl and her friend have in store for you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of your day went miraculously smoothly. True to Brigitte\u2019s claim, the rush slowed down significantly, a welcome change for you. You sadly had to sit in the sand since your lifeguard tower was destroyed, but somehow no other life-threatening events happened at all until the end of your shift. At the end of the day, Quinn picked you up and took you home, carrying you in the pocket of her bag once more. Part of you wanted to talk to her on the trip back but you didn\u2019t want to push the envelope with your new roommate. She seemed a bit standoffish, even though you could tell that there was more to her than that, but either way risking annoying her didn\u2019t seem like the best move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour luck continued into the evening, as you and your three roommates ordered chinese food and had a remarkably unremarkable dinner. Nobody slurped you up along with their noodles, or threw you into the trash accidentally, or even squashed you at all! You had a genuinely nice night, each telling one another about their respective jobs. It was fantastic to say the least. Even when the three girls left you downstairs without figuring out your sleeping arrangements just like the night before, you didn\u2019t mind one bit. You had hope that you would figure it out soon enough, but until then the cushioned couch was more than sufficient. Eventually, you drifted off into dreamland, thinking about how your one inch tall life might turn out normal just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke in the morning to Morgan standing over you, holding a letter with your name on it. You rubbed the sleep out of your eyes and looked closer and saw that it was stamped with the logo of the C.T.C or the Center for Tiny Citizenship! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis looks serious, Hunter. You want me to open it for you?\u201d Morgan said, with evident concern in her voice. Having just woke up, you simply nodded. Morgan dug her finger into the envelope and gently opened it. When she pulled out the two of you recognized the paper immediately. Tinies and regular sized girls alike knew what it was upon first glance, considering it was likely the single most impactful law that had been passed in the last half century. Both you and Morgan\u2019s eyes went wide, as she read out loud \u201cUsage License for General Use\u2026 Hunter Woods\u201d Morgan spun the paper around immediately you saw a clearly forged version of your signature, along with the words General Use instead of a specific woman\u2019s name on the opposite side. Down at the bottom you saw in fine print, \u201cnotarized by Isabella Brooks\u201d. Your entire world was shattered in an instant. Those crazy women did it. Not only did you have an official usage license, but a General Use one to boot. This meant that any woman could use you without needing documentation of their own. Effectively, if a cruel enough woman found out about this she could destroy your life as a human being in an instant and subject you to a life of use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot being able to handle this atomic bomb of news so early in the morning, you felt yourself get light headed and faint!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you awoke soon after, what was happening?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Some/all of the girls all take a sick day and take you straight to the C.T.C. to get to the bottom of your random Usage License)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(You wake up in Quinn\u2019s bag, with her taking you to work just like yesterday since she didn\u2019t want to be late. Little did you know but your employer gets automatically notified if a tiny guy acquires a usage license while currently employed. Brigitte may force Quinn to use you as a swimsuit to replace her too-small uniform)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(You wake up to a knock on the door and it is a relative who you haven\u2019t seen in a while, eager to use you)</span></div></div>",

He\u2019s awake!\u201d Her face was soon flanked by the equally enormous faces of Quinn and Avery. <br>\r\nYou saw the look of concern on Avery\u2019s face change to her usual carefree smile once she saw you were awake.<br>\r\nQuinn was showing her usual apathetic expression, but you could see the worry in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly became aware of the sounds of many different conversations coming from all around you. This made you take a look around and you and realise that you were currently on a bus, with you and your roommates occupying the back seats.<br>\r\nYou looked back to your roommates in confusion before Avery, noticing the confused look on your face, spoke up.<br>\r\n\u201cWe all took the day off to take you to the C.T.C and help you get rid of that general usage license!\u201d Avery\u2019s exuberant personality and loud voice drew the looks of a few of the other women on the bus, many of their eyes drawing to you at the mention of your usage license. Several of them gave you flirty looks, most of them gave you looks that made you very uncomfortable. You were speechless as Avery broadcasted to the whole bus that they could freely use you and the law would be on their side.<br>\r\nMorgan and Quinn quickly shushed Avery who didn\u2019t even seem to realise what she had done wrong, but the damage was already done. You could feel many sets of eyes on you, including the bus driver, who you could see stealing glances back at your group in her rear view mirror. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat? It\u2019s not as if anyone could take Hunter from the three of us, we just need to keep an eye on him,\u201d Avery huffed defensively as she saw the irritated looks on the other girl\u2019s faces because of her outburst.<br>\r\n\u201cSo Hunter, the plan is to walk in to the C.T.C building and demand a meeting with the woman who notarised your license and try to straighten this out. If not we can try and threaten legal action against them, although that might be a difficult route since these usage licenses are kinda hard to get rid of from what I hear. Plus none of us really have that much money to pay a good lawyer, so let\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t come to that,\u201d Morgan\u2019s eyes seemed to sadden as she explained how difficult that getting rid of this license could be. You felt yourself falling deeper into panic the more you thought about it as well. The only thing keeping you even slightly calm was the fact that all three of your roommates were here to protect you.<br>\r\n\u201cOur stop should be coming up soon, so sit tight Hunter,\u201d Avery gave you a small smile, which then faded to her usual neutral expression once she realised she was smiling. <br>\r\nThe bus journey passed uneventfully, the chatter between your roommates drifted away from your situation, which helped ease your nerves. However as the girls chatted you couldn\u2019t shake the feeling of several sets of eyes still on you, many of the women on the bus hadn\u2019t taken their eyes off of you since Avery\u2019s outburst, even the bus driver was still stealing glances at you when she wasn\u2019t focusing on the road. Eventually Quinn and Morgan also noticed the stares, both of them giving you a look of reassurance as Avery continued to chat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the bus started to approach the stop closest to the C.T.C office building. Quinn, Morgan and Avery stood up, with Morgan at the front holding you. <br>\r\nMany of the women who were watching you lost interest when they saw you leaving the bus, except for one, the driver. <br>\r\nAs your group walked through the isle you saw her glance at you and smirk. Before you could even contemplate what was happening she pressed on the breaks, jolting the bus to a halt in the stop. Morgan stumbled forward with you in her hand as she tried to keep her grip on you. Does she succeed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Yes, Morgan manages to keep a hold of you and you all get off the bus as quickly as possible. Morgan and Quinn glaring at the bus driver as you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) No, and you go flying forward towards the bus driver, exactly as she planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) No, you go flying backwards towards one of the other passengers, or towards Quinn or Avery.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For a moment it seemed that the brunette was going to crash to the bus\u2019s floor herself, but in the next instance her fall was halted as Quinn\u2019s arm wrapped around her waist and held her steady, the pale girl\u2019s free hand gripping the nearest hand hold and managing to stay steady even as Avery collided with her back with a small squeak of surprise. You meanwhile were being squeezed nearly to death as Morgan\u2019s hand compressed you like a piece of putty, your roommate too preoccupied catching her breath and glaring daggers at the driver to notice your plight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the immediate danger passed the three hurried off the bus, though not without Quinn flipping off the driver in the process. Several of the other passengers still eyed the four of you as the vehicle pulled away, but that particularly threat was over for now. Once on solid ground, Avery made a show of throwing her arms around Quinn\u2019s shoulders and thanking her for the save, only to laugh as her roommate shoved her off. The pinkette then shifted her gaze to her sister and you, a cheshire smile crossing her lips as she witnessed her twin\u2019s fingers nervously playing with the squishy mass of flesh you had been reduced to. \u201cMy my, having some fun with Hunter are you Morgs?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Eyes flitting down, Morgan gasped as she realised what she had done to you, quickly loosening her grip and inverting her hand so you were sitting in her palm, squished extremities slowly coming back together as you tried to catch your breath. \u201cOh God, I\u2019m sorry Hunter. I just didn\u2019t want to drop you. I wasn\u2019t paying attention. I just\u2026\u201d She trailed off as she brought you closer to bump against her chest in what you assumed was intended as a comforting gesture. It went south fast though as Avery giggled and threw her arms around you both, momentarily crushing you between the twins\u2019 chest before Quinn pulled her off with an eye roll and shove her towards the nearby building. Letting out a relieved breath, your current holder smiled down at you and followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the four of you entered the imposingly large C.T.C building, you had managed to reform enough to stand up straight in Morgan\u2019s palm, trying not to feel intimidated at the many women standing around in the expansive foyer, and wondering if there was a single man working here. Thankfully, your reticence didn\u2019t slow Quinn down, as the curvaceous young woman made a beeline for the front desk and placed her hands down firmly in front of a bored looking receptionist. \u201cWe\u2019re here to see one of your workers. First name Isabella.\u201d The receptionist moved to respond, but your roommate spoke over her. \u201cShe issued a licence to my friend Hunter Woods. Without his consent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist appeared taken aback, surprise, and possibly offence, flashing across her face as she contemplated the outlandish allegation. Her jaw set as she prepared to respond, but she was interrupted by the sound of clicking heels as none other than Rachel herself strode out to meet you. \u201cHunter! I\u2019m so glad you could make it, though I suppose I shouldn\u2019t be surprised. You\u2019ve always been one of my more punctual patients.\u201d The smile that accompanied those words was warm and welcoming, and for a moment you were so shocked that her words didn\u2019t register. When they finally did you found yourself wracking your brain in an attempt to determine just what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn meanwhile was immediately on guard against this new arrival, her own voice drowning out your first attempt to speak. \u201cWho are you?\u201d A raised eyebrow was her initial response, before Rachel turned to face the pale girl with a small frown. \u201cI might ask you the same question. I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve met, so I am curious what you are doing with my patient.\u201d Not liking where this was going you tried to speak up, only to be drowned out once again by Quinn as she growled out her next words. \u201cWe\u2019re his roommates. Now what exactly do you mean when you say \u2018patient\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel cocked her head at that, her expression seemingly thoughtful as she feigned considering the younger girl\u2019s words. \u201cIt means that I\u2019m his psychiatrist.\u201d She tapped her chin. \u201cHunter never mentioned having roommates before. Is this a recent occurrence?\u201d Whether the sinister woman was guessing or had seriously done her research you didn\u2019t know, but Avery\u2019s rapid nodding was all the answer she needed as she made a tutting noise with her tongue. \u201cI see. Hunter you really should share these kind of things with me. It may be relevant to your treatment.\u201d Her hand came to her mouth as she gasped, and just for an instant you saw something malicious flash in her gaze. \u201cOh no, please don\u2019t tell me you forgot again Hunter. This is serious. Things might be getting worse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll at once you began to see the sinister game that Rachel was playing, realising that she had known you would come here and had prepared herself accordingly. Finally given the chance to speak you raged against her wicked intent. \u201cYou liar! Don\u2019t listen to her guys. I\u2019ve never seen a psychiatrist in my life, let alone her!\u201d Though if you were honest, there were times that you could have used one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attempts to continue were cut off as Rachel gasped dramatically once more, her hand moving to her chest as she faked an expression of deep concern and took a step towards you. \u201cOh dear, it\u2019s worst than I thought. These slips of yours are happening far too often now Hunter. It may be a sign that you\u2019re heading for a complete breakdown.\u201d She shook her head sadly, though simultaneously sighed as if in deep relief. \u201cStill, I\u2019m so glad you decided to check-in when you did. Who knows when your next moment of lucidity might have been. At this point I think we cannot act quickly enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to scream out again that she\u2019s lying, but your ability to breath was suddenly robbed from you as Morgan closed her fingers tightly around you in an unconscious attempt to shield you from the outside world. Not paying attention to her hand, the brunette eyed Rachel wearingly as she half-hid behind Quinn\u2019s larger frame. \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018check-in\u2019? Is Hunter in some kind of trouble?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that her advance was putting the girls on edge, Rachel stopped and raised her hands in the universal sign of surrender. A hand moved to massage her brow as she adopted a troubled expression and glanced first at you and then at the three girls standing in her way. \u201cLook. I really shouldn\u2019t be sharing a client\u2019s diagnosis with non-family members, but\u2026\u201d A sigh. \u201cYou do seem like good friends, and given Hunter\u2019s current state of mind, I suppose I owe you the basics.\u201d Leaning back against the receptionist\u2019s desk, she folded her arms beneath her impressive chest and made a show of considering her next words. \u201cHunter here has been seeing me for some years now. Like many of his kind he is unfortunately suffering from a condition known as MDPD, or Minun Dissociative Personality Disorder. Minun being another term for what you would know as tinies. In Hunter\u2019s case, his condition was most likely brought on by some unfortunate experiences in his childhood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn, at least, looked like she had questions, but Rachel continued before your roommate could voice them. \u201cIn some cases, like Hunter\u2019s, the personality switches in MDPD sufferers is known to cause temporary and often specific memory loss, including even complete denial of the condition and of any memories gained while under the affect of the core personality.\u201d She gestured at you, still unable to speak thanks to Morgan\u2019s tight grip, as if your prior words were proof enough. \u201cI had hoped that he was getting better, but if he can\u2019t even remember me right now after so many years of work, it may actually be getting worse.\u201d A sad smile accompanied another shake of her head. \u201cI suppose the stress of leaving home and trying to break into the workforce was just too much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding once more, Rachel fixed a smile on her face as she spread her arms as if in triumph. \u201cStill. All is not lost. I approached Hunter a few week ago with the suggestion of a rather radical treatment. I had hoped it wouldn\u2019t be needed, but Hunter disagreed, and it looks like he was right to do so.\u201d You glared up at her as she smiled down at you, the tiniest of twitches at the edge of her lips the only sign that there was anything other than genuine kindness and concern behind that gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan\u2019s fingers slackened and you tried to call out, but the next thing you knew you were forcibly torn from the brunette\u2019s grasp and pressed forcibly into the chest of her twin sister, as Avery pulled you into a fierce hug fuelled by concern. Much to your discontent, the young model had bought fully into Rachel\u2019s story, her eyes misting with tears as she crushed you against her assets. \u201cHunter, I had no idea. You should have told us if you were suffering. We would have done anything to help you.\u201d You tried to protest but your mouth was clogged by cloth and boob, and what muffled noises you could make were drowned out as Morgan argued with the shorter girl about who should hold you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the twin\u2019s turned their attention to fawning over you, Quinn fixed narrowed eyes on the woman who was trying to destroy your life, as of yet unsatisfied by her attempt at an explanation. Even if she hadn\u2019t known you long, she\u2019d seen enough to doubt you were truly suffering from this MDPD. \u201cWhat kind of treatment, exactly, are we talking about? And how does any of this explain why you issued Hunter with a general use licence. How exactly was that meant to help him huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel sighed, looking for all the world like a weary retail worker dealing with a difficult customer, before finally fixing a look of concern on her face and advising Quinn that you\u2026</span></div></div>",

They use cutting edge treatments to help disassociated tinies find their true personality, whether that be as a human\u2026\u201d She paused, smiling gently. \u201c\u2026or as an object serving the important purpose of assisting others in their day-to-day lives.\u201d Quinn appeared shocked by this information, and Rachel continued on before she could voice another objection. \u201cYou need a licence to attend, so that they can carry out the necessary treatments in full compliance with the law. Honestly, I was worried Hunter was taking too big a step too soon, but now that I\u2019ve seen him like this I\u2019m glad he signed all the necessary paperwork while he was still thinking straight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving tuned back in when Rachel started talking, both Avery and Morgan were saddened by what they heard, the shorter twin\u2019s grip thankfully loosening enough for you to finally shout out another protest. \u201cI told you she\u2019s lying! I\u2019ve never even heard of MCP-whatever. The first time I met this crazy bitch was at the beach yesterday!\u201d You were aware that you were loosing your cool, but you could already see the future this horrible woman had planned for you unfolding before your eyes, and you would be damned if you allowed her to send you off to some institution who knows where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to form, Rachel feigned ignorance, appearing taken aback by your harsh words but not responding in kind. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for aggression Hunter.\u201d She frowned, as if something had just occurred to her. \u201cOh dear. Before it was just memory loss, but if you\u2019re saying you saw me at the beach then I\u2019m afraid that your condition is deteriorating even more rapidly than we had feared. The creation of artificial memories is rare even in MDPD sufferers. You\u2019re quite convinced it was me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop lying!\u201d You could see Quinn looking at you in concern now but you blocked it out, focusing on the threat in front of you. \u201cI recall exactly what happened. You came to the beach without any care for the tinies, except maybe for that poor guy Tony who\u2019d you unlawfully trapped as your thong! When I called you on your fake licence you and your friend Isabella threatened me with a fake licence of my own!\u201d Your eyes darkened as you thought of the next part, the existential threat still hanging over you. \u201cAnd you followed through didn\u2019t you!? I have a goddamn licence now!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the rest of your rant like a trained professional, Rachel zeroed in on a single key piece of information. \u201cTony? Hunter, I would never trap anyone as my thong against their will, least of all Tony.\u201d You scoffed, and opened your mouth to protest, but were interrupted by her next words and actions. \u201cHere, you can ask him yourself.\u201d Caught off guard by the suggestion, you could only stare as the psychiatrist undid the first few buttons of her blouse and nonchalantly plunged a hand into her own cleavage. Seconds later she pulled out a disoriented looking tiny, who you didn\u2019t recognise but could only presume to be Tony, last seen in the form of a thong. Rachel shot the little guy a smile with far too pronounced teeth. \u201cEveryone, this is my handsome little husband. Dear, Hunter seems to think I took you to the beach as my thong. Do you have any idea what he\u2019s talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see Tony shiver as his owner ran a finger down his spine, and instantly knew this would end badly for you. The others didn\u2019t seem to notice however, as the clearly intimated tiny spoke up in a timid voice. \u201cOf course not d-dear. You\u2019ve never done something like t-that to me.\u201d There was a twitch in the hand that held the little man and he hurried on. Dull eyes flashed to you with a spark of apology, and you smiled grimly in response. \u201cOf course, we\u2019ve met a couple of times when he\u2019s received treatment from you dear, but certainly never as a t-thong.\u201d You hated the idea of a fellow tiny selling you out, though if you were honest you could somewhat understand. In all likelihood he\u2019d been Rachel\u2019s possession for some time, and a chance at salvation was worth almost anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your horror, the others were looking increasingly uncertain in their convictions now. Morgan was now looking at you with concern while Quinn had an unreadable look. Avery just cuddled you all the harder as she sniffed sadly, pressing you against her breasts and ignoring your attempts to struggle free. Before any of you could speak Rachel casually dropped Tony back into her cleavage, pushing him down between the massive orbs again before reaching over to grab some files from the front desk. \u201cIf you still aren\u2019t convinced then here. Documented attendance by Mr Hunter Woods at my clinic for the last few years, as well as further documentation around his licensing application.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeming more hesitant now, Quinn reached out and took the fabricated papers, eyes widening slightly as she flipped them open and started to read their contents. Beside her, Morgan crowded close so she could get a look as well, while Avery looked back to Rebecca, only to see the older woman holding out her hand with an expectant look. The young model looked hesitant, and you sent her a pleading look, but it was enough to stop her from wordlessly handing you over, wholly convinced that she was doing the right thing. Your other roommates looked up at the motion and eyes narrowed, but there was little they could do to slow things down now without causing a scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to shout out again in protest, but Rachel had more experience then you could know, and even as she smiled down at you with apparent warmth, the fingers that seemed to cradle your body pressed down with expertly precise force on your diaphragm, robbing you of breath. \u201cDon\u2019t worry Hunter. I know you must be really confused and scared right now, but I promise we\u2019re going to get you the help that you need.\u201d At those words Quinn finally seemed to regain some of her earlier determination and looked ready to intervene, but she was interrupted as the psychiatrist made a beckoning motion towards a group of women standing at the opposite end of the foyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, your roommates turn to see who Rachel was motioning to, your own eyes following their shifted gazes and nearly bugging out when you saw who was approaching. Two woman, looking to be of similar age to yourself and your roommates, were heading across the room in your direction. Each was dressed in purple nursing scrubs, which clung tightly enough to their bodies to leave little to the imagination. To put it simply, each of them was stunningly beautiful. One a pale blond with hair down to the middle of her back, and the other a tanned woman with a long brunette braid. More importantly, each of them sported outrageous curves that could compete even with Quinn\u2019s, while still appearing to maintain a level of tone that kept their prodigious assets firm and perky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were momentarily distracted from your dire predicament as you watched the two nurses bounce over, their massive chests actually bouncing off one another at one point as they hurried over to greet Rachel. Words failed you as their massive forms came to a stop just a few feet away, the brilliant smiles on their faces seeming to hold no ill-intent as they each looked down at you for a moment before focusing back on the woman who was intent to make your life a living hell. To her credit, the psychiatrist\u2019s smile never slipped, even as she continued to weave her malicious web. \u201cHello girls. Thank you for coming on such short notice, but I\u2019m afraid this is a rather serious case, and Hunter here needs all the care that he can get.\u201d She raised you slightly so you could better look the two in the eye. \u201cHe will be staying in the ward until his condition improves. I hope you will be able to accommodate his particular needs, as you have so many others in the past.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the instant, the attention of both nurses shifted entirely to yourself, and for a moment everyone else seemed to fade away as you looked upon such radiant and benevolent expressions.  It was the brunette that spoke up, though the blonde nodded along as she did so. \u201cHey there little guy. I\u2019m Talia, and this is Emily.\u201d The blonde gave you a little wave. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take you somewhere where you can be safe and cared for okay. You\u2019ll love the ward I promise. Us to, and all of the other girls as well. We\u2019ll do everything we can to make sure you find your true calling.\u201d Though the content of her words still chilled you, you couldn\u2019t find it in yourself to doubt their sincerity, not with the way the two continued to beam at you. Like you were something precious to defend at all costs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesmerised, you couldn\u2019t even find the will to protest as Rachel finally loosened her grip. \u201cYou\u2019ll find that his licencing arrangements are all in order. General use licence as per your usual clause. Indefinite term, though with the option to switch to a specific licence if required.\u201d Her lips twisted into a small concerned frown. \u201cJust be aware that he\u2019s having a dissociative episode at the moment, so he may not be fully compliant. Hopefully he\u2019ll calm down soon. If not, you may need to take more extreme measures to help him.\u201d With that ominous threat hanging over you, you suddenly found yourself tossed casually into the air, sailing across the distance between Rachel and the nurses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut do you reach the nurses unimpeded, and if so are you even caught smoothly?</span></div></div>",

Before you could even speak, she cradled you to her chest much as Avery had done, though with her more prodigious assets in play you found yourself quickly sinking into the warm embrace. A pale hand pressed flat against your back and held you in place, and for a moment you recalled some distant memory from your infancy when you had been held against your mother\u2019s breast just like this. You weren\u2019t a baby anymore though, and you could feel more than one part of yourself stiffen as your face turned violently red, though if the blonde noticed she made no attempt to loosen her hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the sound of Emily\u2019s heartbeat now resonated in your eyes, you could hear the beginnings of a protest from Quinn, only for the raven-haired girl to be cut off as Talia interjected, expertly placing herself between her colleague and your roommates. \u201cFiends of Mr Woods?\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for a response, apparently having drawn her own conclusion. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, he\u2019s going to get all the help he needs. We need to take him now but if you want to see him visiting hours are Wednesdays from 2pm to 4pm. However, we do asked that you not visit him for the first two weeks of his treatment, in order to not disturb the necessary adjustment period.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe discussion continued, but faded out of your hearing as Emily started to move away, the breast in-front of you starting to bounce against your held form, rubbing you up and down as you fought to regain your bearings. The blonde was half-way across the lobby before you managed to call out. \u201cWait! There\u2019s been a mistake! I\u2019m not supposed to go to the wa-mph!\u201d You were cut off as the hand against your back pushed harder, your mouth suddenly too full to function.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove you, Emily cooed gently, fingers stroking your back in an attempt to impart comfort. \u201cShh\u2026 I know you\u2019re confused right now, but you don\u2019t have to worry okay. I\u2019ve got all of your paperwork on my phone already. Mr Hunter Woods, age 21. High priority. Committed for treatment of long-term MDPD.\u201d She smiled sadly, hating to see little guys like you in such distress due to conditions beyond your control. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do all that we can to help, no matter how long it takes. Our ward has a great success rate in helping tinies like you find their true calling, no matter what it may be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to tell her that your \u2018true calling\u2019 was being a man, but your mouth remained full as she continued on, oblivious to your discomfort. \u201cSome tinies remain in our care for years, but if you work hard I\u2019m sure you can be out in a few short months.\u201d Your blood ran cold at the idea of being confined to some institution for months, especially if that was the best case scenario. You had no idea what to expect, but you struggled and squirmed to make your displeasure known, only to be pressed yet harder into the yielding flesh before you as Emily cooed above. \u201cSave your strength little guy. You should get some rest for now. The doctors will explain once we get to the ward.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a car-door opening preceded a moment of vertigo as Emily dropped into the passenger seat and closed the door behind her. For a moment all you could hear was the steady beat of the blonde\u2019s heart before the click of another door and a soft whump as Talia climbed in to the driver\u2019s side. The car\u2019s ignition roared to life and mild vibrations began to run through you as the vehicle pulled out into traffic and quickly carried you away from any hope of salvation. Beside you, the brunette spared a brief glance and smile for the little guy pressed against her partner\u2019s chest before focusing back on the road. \u201cIt so sad that so many tinies loose their way like this. His friends really seemed to care for him too.\u201d She sighed, but smiled a moment later as her fingers tapped at the wheel. \u201cStill, it feels really good to be part of the solution you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily smiled and laughed, finally releasing some of the pressure on you and allowing you to take deep breaths of air. \u201cI know. I know. I hate that they have to deal with stuff like this, but it\u2019s great that Dr Miller\u2019s treatments have been so successful.\u201d Cradling you in her palm, she reached down with her free hand to peel off her left flat and run a finger along the insole within, her smile soft as she did so. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that Dr Miller is going to approve Sammy for release soon. We\u2019ve been working so hard these last few months and I just know we\u2019ve made some real breakthroughs.\u201d With a happy sound she slipped the shoe back on and gave it a few good stomps for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia nodded knowingly. \u201cYeah. It\u2019s taken him longer than some, but I think we\u2019ve finally gotten there.\u201d She shot another smile at her friend. \u201cThanks in no small part to you of course.\u201d Emily blushed but nodded appreciatively as the brunette continued. \u201cI\u2019m also hoping that they\u2019ll give Ben a clean bill of health soon as well.\u201d Keeping both hands on the wheel, the prodigious girl twisted slightly in her seat, her mammoth rear shifting from side-to-side as it started to chew up the back of her pants. \u201cI\u2019ll be sad to see him go since we\u2019ve been together for over a year now, but I just want what\u2019s best for him, you know. And I\u2019m sure all of the other girls who\u2019ve cared for him would agree.\u201d She laughed lightly, eyes flicking to you briefly as they pulled up to a red light. \u201cI guess that means both of us may be available for a new charge in the near-future. Maybe even little Hunter here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nListening in, you had no idea what the two nurses were talking about, but suspected it was nothing good, especially as both women favoured you with inviting smiles. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d You nearly sighed in relief as your words didn\u2019t prompt Emily to crush you to her chest once more. \u201cPlease tell me what you are talking about. Who is Dr Miller? What charges? Who are Sammy and Ben?\u201d You had a million other questions as well but you felt those would do for now. You didn\u2019t like the sound of any of this and just wished desperately that you could go back and undo your challenge to Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling slightly, Emily unexpectedly lowered you away from her chest and instead placed you on the seat between her legs, the shelf of her breasts blocking your view of her face. Talia\u2019s voice filtered down from above as the car rumbled back into motion. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to wait for your evaluation. But we\u2019ll happily show you the ropes after that.\u201d You wanted to ask what an evaluation was, but were cut off as the car suddenly turned sharply and came to a stop once more. \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d This time it was the brunette who scooped you up, and you found yourself once more pressed into the inviting warmth of a woman\u2019s chest as the two climbed out of the car and headed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard the faint whir of automatic doors and the sound of a cherry greeting from a woman you couldn\u2019t see, your vision dominated by Talia\u2019s chest. It was Emily who responded. \u201cHey Grace. We brought the new guy, Hunter. Say hello little guy.\u201d You were allowed to breath as your handler pulled you away from her chest enough to let you see the bespectacled brunette sitting behind what appeared to be a small reception desk, her smile kind and wave friendly as she met your gaze. \u201cWelcome little guy. I\u2019m so glad to have you here.\u201d You couldn\u2019t see all of her from her seated position, but from what you could see she was as curvy and beautiful as her colleagues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer knowing what to even say you just waved back but remained quiet as you were carried past the reception, thinking perhaps it might be better to just wait and talk to this Dr Miller, hoping that they at least would be more reasonable. Such thoughts, however, were stricken from your mind as Emily and Talia stepped into the next room and your jaw dropped at the sight that awaited you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than a dozen beautiful women occupied the expansive space. All looking to be in their 20s, and with a wide range of ethnicities, yet all matching in regard to their massive curves and universally beautiful complexions. On one side of the room several donned the same purple scrubs as Emily and Talia and either sat at a table playing cards or milled around a coffee machine, seemingly waiting for something. On the other side a smaller group were engaging in what appeared to be a full-powered workout. A freckled redhead, fiery hair flowing out behind her, was running full-tilt on a treadmill, her beautiful form clad only in a tan thong and bra that appeared several sizes too small, while her feet lacked shoes, covered only in what appeared to be tan socks of some kind. Nearby, two other nurses, one who appeared of Southeast Asian descent, and the other Middle Eastern seemed to be cooling down after their own intense workouts, their bodies slick with sweat as they shared a tan washcloth that already looked to be filled to bursting to wipe away the excess perspiration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesmerised, and more than a little aroused, you were momentarily too caught up in day dreams to realise the truth. It was only when a younger nurse whose look you could best describe as \u2018perky goth\u2019 missed her mark during an enthusiastic one-woman game of handball against the nearest wall that you realised the cruel reality. Off-balance, the raven-haired girl\u2019s foot slammed down on the tan ball she had been using to play, a squeak of surprise emitting from her throat followed by an earnest \u201cSorry!\u201d and the look of someone who had just accidentally kicked a puppy. A tan object addressed as a living thing. Something you recognised all too well. Realising exactly what kind of fate awaited you here, you began to struggle desperately, pushing at the fingers that surrounded you as you tried to pull free. Caught off guard, Talia grip loosened slightly as she looked down at you in concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut do you manage to escape, or do you remain at the mercy of the oblivious nurses?</span></div></div>",

Calm down please. You\u2019re safe here.\u201d You didn\u2019t listen, just kept pulling until an arm slipped free and you entertained a small hope of freedom. Then Emily stepped in to help her friend, a shadow flashing over your vision the only warning you got before the two chests collided, pressing together and trapping you between the firm masses, only your head sticking out to stare up in defiance. With your chest squished and mangled you were unable to scream out in protest as the two nurses cooed above you, gazes kind but determined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrawn by the commotion, several of the waiting nurses started to approach, their eyes trained solely on your tiny form betwixt their colleague\u2019s assets with beneficent smiles driving icy daggers of fear into your heart. An ochre-skinned girl of unclear ethnicity seemed particularly enthusiastic, almost knocking over her chair in her hurry to come and help. Her hair was dyed a deep crimson-hue and secured in a long ponytail that bobbed along behind her as she jogged. A small stampede of other nurses followed in her wake, their collective assets jiggling all over the place as they moved, which you now realised promised nothing but torment for your time in this facility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to your relief, short-lived though it may be, the stampede of incoming nurses was stopped in its tracks as a throat was cleared loudly, all of them turning to look as a shorter woman with a stern expression and piercing blue eyes stared at them all from a doorway at the far end of the room. She was older than the nurses and notably less endowed, a few grey hairs beginning to show among short blonde locks. From the clipboard she held and the white coat she was wearing, you suspected she was a doctor and held onto some small hope that she might yet save you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the woman strode slowly across the room Emily and Talia finally separated, leaving you exposed and gasping for air as you hung limply from Talia\u2019s grasp. Looking you up and down with an apathetic gaze, the doctor made a tutting noise and glanced down at her clipboard. \u201cHunter Woods. Admitted due to a severe case of Minus Dissociative Personality Disorder causing both multiple personalities and several incidents of acute memory loss, as well as an apparent inability to determine on a day-to-day basis whether you want to be used as an object or seen as a man.\u201d You tried to protest, but she cut you off. \u201cIt also says here that you\u2019ve begun to hallucinate and create imagined conspiracies aimed against yourself.\u201d She turned the clipboard so you could see it and pointed to a scrawl near the bottom. \u201cFortunately young man, we have your signature to give you all the help you need.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ochre-skinned girl smiled at you sadly as your condition was set out, inching slightly closer as she did so. Up close, you realised that this girl was younger than your current holders, likely in her late teens or very early twenties and that despite an obviously high level of tone she sported a set of curves that put even Quinn to shame, her breasts seemingly defying gravity as they stretched the too thin fabric of her top. \u201cYou poor thing. Don\u2019t worry though, because the nurses here are the best and we\u2019re going to look after you little guy.\u201d She smiled so wide you thought it might have hurt. \u201cI\u2019m just getting started here myself but I\u2019ll do everything I can to help you get better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearing her throat again, the doctor sent a small glare at the crimson-haired girl before addressing you once more. \u201cAs I was saying. I am Doctor Miller, and I am in charge of all of our patients here, including you. The nurse who interrupted me\u2026\u201d The younger girl blushed and smiled sheepishly. \u201c\u2026is Allira, our newest nurse in training. You two are both newbies of a sort.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, you don\u2019t understand.\u201d You tried to argue. Tried to make them see sense. \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to be here. Those documents are fake. I just want to go home.\u201d Unfortunately, Miller just smiled a flat, unreadable smile, her eyes betraying no emotion. \u201cWe want you to be able to go home as well Mr Woods, but it just won\u2019t be safe for you until you are cured. Why, one day you may be perfectly content as some nice girl\u2019s new bra, then the next you may wake up suddenly convinced that everything you previously knew to be true is wrong. Just think of how traumatic that might be for the both of you.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNo, you need to get better young man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverywhere you looked you could see nurses nodding along in agreement, each and every one of them looking at you sympathetically, like you were truly some broken thing in need of help. You realised with rising dread that Miller had them all totally under her thumb, and that anything you might say would just be argued away in the face of her experience and those \u2018signed\u2019 documents. You wondered if even she knew the truth, or if the doctor was just another person deceived by Rachel, convinced of the righteousness of her own purpose regardless of mounting evidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you contemplated your fate, Miller held out her hand expectantly towards Talia, who handed you over without protest. The rougher surface of the older woman\u2019s palm shocked you out of your thoughts, and you looked up only to see the blonde paying you no attention as she turned and walked back the way she had come, navigating a short hallway before stepping into a small office. You briefly contemplated another escape attempt, now that you only had one opponent to worry about, but no sooner had the heavy door slid to then the doctor simply dropped you onto her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStriking the surface with a painful thump, you felt your legs squish beneath your weight, and turned to glare up at the careless woman. Your anger faltered in the face of fear though as Miller\u2019s apathetic smile turned sadistic and she chuckled slowly. \u201cDon\u2019t bother trying to scream pest. This room is sound-proofed. Those stupid nurses won\u2019t be able to hear you now.\u201d Fear gave way to anger once more as you shouted out. \u201cYou knew!\u201d But the cruel woman just responded by prodding you with a finger and knocking you onto your back, pressing down on your chest and keeping you pinned with utter ease. \u201cOf course I did. Did you think I\u2019d be blind to what goes on in my own facility?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sneered as she continued to look down at you like she was inspecting a bug. \u201cYou need to accept that you\u2019ve lost. I don\u2019t know what you did to piss off Rachel, but that was perhaps the last mistake you will ever make. You belong to me now. You leave when I say so. If I say so. As I say so.\u201d Another dark chuckle rose from her throat. \u201cAnd don\u2019t expect those foolish girls to help you. We pick them very carefully to ensure ongoing compliance. They\u2019re all compassionate souls to be sure, but they are also the kind of people who defer to authority, and their opinion of your kind tends more towards how one might treat a child or a pet. Fitting, given that you are certainly not a man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough your blood boiled, you tried to maintain a modicum of calm as you spoke. \u201cYou. Can\u2019t. Keep me here. My family will come looking for me. My friends know where I am. They\u2019ll find out what you\u2019re doing here.\u201d If you really thought about it there was no way this situation could last. No matter what lies Rachel had told your roommates, those same excuses wouldn\u2019t fly with your family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiller just smirked at your words, her tone mocking as she spoke. \u201cReally now. We\u2019ve done it so many times before, what makes you think that you will be special. If your family won\u2019t believe the first lie then we\u2019ll just tell them another. After all, in the eyes of the law, you signed up for this.\u201d With the hand not holding you down she flicked through a couple of files on her desk. \u201cYou\u2019ve met Emily and Talia. I wonder, did Talia introduce you to her thong, or did Emily let you meet her insole? Did you perhaps feel a sense of kinship with them?\u201d Her smirk only grew as she watched your face twitch in recognition and she found the files she was looking for, laying them out beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSamuel Reynolds. Arrogant enough to think that he could tutor real humans, like some kind of equal. Isabella lured him in with a fake job offer and then we put him in his place.\u201d Blue eyes shifted to the second file. \u201cBen Smith. Somehow managed to trick some foolish girl into agreeing to marry him. Yakima, I think her name was.\u201d She shook her head, nostrils flaring in outrage. \u201cRidiculous. Fortunately for everyone involved, Rachel managed to scoop him up before they could go through with the nuptials.\u201d The doctor looked back to you, sneering in disgust. \u201cThey were defiant like you at first. So were their so-called families, but they came around in time. And now after years of being traded between the nurses, the two of them are almost ready for release.\u201d Miller chuckled, though there was no true mirth in her expression. \u201cOf course, not as men. No, they\u2019ve been cured of that arrogant delusion. The two of them will make fine additions to someone\u2019s wardrobe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued to glare at the doctor, though inside you were gradually losing hope. \u201cI will get out of he-.\u201d A finger flicked you in the face, snapping your head back and stunning you temporarily. \u201cNo. You won\u2019t.\u201d Her voice was cold now, and would brook no further disagreement. \u201cHere, my word is law, and it is I who will decide on your primary caregiver. Maybe I\u2019ll give you to Emily to replace Sam, or to Talia to replace Ben. Or perhaps you would prefer young Allira. You\u2019d be her first charge so I\u2019m sure she would take extra special care of you. Of course, you\u2019d still be seeing the others as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew you had no choice in the matter, just glaring balefully until Dr Miller decided to\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you flew from Morgan\u2019s grip time seemed to slow for you. You looked around the bus to see all the women who had been staring at you excitedly when they heard about your usage license begin to shift in their seats in anticipation now that they saw you were separated from your roommates. You saw Morgan\u2019s panicked face as she realised she had lost her grip of you, but didn\u2019t see exactly where in the air you were, or where you were flying towards.<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, you turned around to see your destination. You could see the eyes of the bus driver in the rear view mirror tracking your movement, she looked ecstatic that her plan had worked as you were now sailing through the air in a perfect arc towards her. You saw a few of the women in between Morgan and the front of the bus reach up to try to catch you, and a few of them come close, their fingers brushing against you. You yelped every time one of their hands swept past you, but your fear of them seemed misplaced, because the real danger was where you were about to land. The bus driver eagerly watched you arc through the air, sailing over her head and landing with a barely audible splat at her feet, just in front of the pedals her feet were currently resting on. As you took a second to get your bearings you managed to take in the appearance of your new tormentor.<br>\r\nEven from your perspective on the floor you could see she was heavyset, she seemed to be incredibly pear shaped, you could see the sides of her ass peeking out over the sides of her chair, as well as her pudgy stomach hanging over her belt slightly. Her face showed some signs of age, you\u2019d guess she was around 45 or so, and her brown, slightly greying hair was cut short and pulled back in a bun. You managed to catch a glimpse of her name tag, which told you her name was Janice, before your sight of her was blocked by the sole of her shoe. The shoe stomped down on you and she twisted her heel on top of you, grinding you into the treads of her shoes. You silently screamed, your head too mangled for you to actually be able to make any noice, as this cruel woman ground you into the sole of her shoe like a used cigarette. Once she was sure you were stuck in the treads of her shoe she lifted her foot, carrying you with it back onto the break pedal, resting it there while she turned to your roommates as the bus doors swung open.<br>\r\n\u201cAlright girls, this is your stop. I\u2019ve got a schedule to keep so if you could be quick,\u201d Janice spoke with an impatience that could probably be interpreted as her simply being frustrated with her job, but you knew she wanted your roommates off the bus before they discovered your location.<br>\r\n\u201cHold on a minute, I just dropped our tiny guy we had with us, give us a minute to find him please!\u201d You heard the panicked voice of Morgan pleading with Janice. \u201cWe can\u2019t just leave him on the bus.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSorry girls but I\u2019m already late as it is. Tell you girls what, I\u2019ll give you a minute or two but after that I really need you guys off here. My boss has been giving me grief about running late all the time, you understand don\u2019t you?\u201d Janice would normally have just driven on if a passenger was refusing to get off the bus, but she really didn\u2019t want the three girls on any longer than they had to be, otherwise they could possibly discover you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that time limit in place, the girls hurried in trying to locate you. Morgan knew you had been thrown forward, she just wasn\u2019t sure exactly where you went. Quinn had saw a few of the women further down reaching up for you, but wasn\u2019t exactly sure if one of them had caught you or not. With those two facts in mind, your roommates began to search for you. Morgan went down to the front of the bus to look for you there, Quinn began interrogating the girls who she saw reaching for you, and Avery began looking on the floor and under the seats for you.<br>\r\nSeeing the girls so organised and efficiently searching for you worried Janice, she expected them to panic and not manage to search the whole are you could have been in. Her nerves caused her to absentmindedly grind her heels into the floor, further compacting you between the grooves of her shoes. She silently prayed that they would run out of time before they started to suspect her. Do they discover you? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Yes, and they manage to convince Janice to give you up.<br>\r\n2) Yes, but you are either too crushed into the grooves of her shoe for them to recover you, or Janice uses your usage license as defence to keep you.<br>\r\n3) No, and they have to leave the bus and go to the C.T.C building without you, potentially making removing the license much more difficult.</span></div></div>",

You silently cried out to them, but your mangled body could make no sounds.<br>\r\nQuinn was the first to finish her job of finding out if any of the girls had managed to catch you. Her deadpan face and annoyed scowls were enough to intimidate most of the women into telling the truth and she determined that none of them had caught you, moving on to help Avery look for you on the floor after that.<br>\r\nTheir search also proved fruitless, and after two minutes they both looked to Morgan, who had been searching the front of the bus for you and only had the area around the driver left to check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice had been eying the clock like a hawk, praying for time to move faster. She had began to panic as she saw Morgan get closer to her, but a smile crept up from the corners of her mouth as she saw the clock tick over once again, time was up. She quickly hid her grin, before turning to Morgan with a look of faux concern. <br>\r\n\u201cSorry girls, times up. Sorry but I\u2019ve got a schedule to keep,\u201d she was straining to keep her grin from reemerging, but must have done a bad job at it because Morgan looked at her with confusion. <br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you in such a rush to have us off this bus? Most drivers would have just shrugged and drove on with us still on board, are you hiding something?\u201d Hearing Morgan say this, Quinn and Avery approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no, why? How could I have him?\u201d Janice was not a good lier under pressure, and the tone of her voice was starting to give her away.<br>\r\n\u201cBecause you wanted him to fly out of Morgan\u2019s hand. Why else would you have hit the breaks?\u201d Quinn\u2019s flat tone of voice did not match the brimming anger in her eyes, she realised now what was going on. \u201cJust hand him over and we won\u2019t have to report you.\u201d<br>\r\nJanice opened her mouth to respond, but thought better of it, she was already on thin ice with her supervisor and didn\u2019t need any more trouble. She lifted her foot up and began prying you loose with her fingernail. There was a brief moment that you feared she wouldn\u2019t actually be able to get you out, but that fear was placated as you felt your body slip out from between the tight treads.<br>\r\nYour body slipped out as a long, thin piece of string, having been tightly compacted into a single tread of her shoe. One of your eyes was still visible so you could look up at your would be kidnapper. Her face had an expression similar to a child who got caught shoplifting, as she glumly handed your stringy form over to Quinn, who wordlessly grabbed you from the bus driver with a cold glare. <br>\r\nYour three giantess friends exited the bus without another word, and it pulled away, leaving you all to look up at the C.T.C office building. As you were now in the shadow of the building, knowing that the woman who had caused you so much hardship was inside and that you would have to see her soon, you shuddered.<br>\r\nQuinn, feeling your shivering body vibrate against her hand, looked down at you reassuringly before looking up at the building again and walking towards it, determined to help you out of this situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour anxiety shot through the roof as Quinn walked through the double doors into the stuffy reception hall of the C.T.C office building. There was a long line to talk to the single, very bored looking receptionist. Quinn let out a heavy sigh and joined the back of the line while you saw Morgan and Avery sit down in the seating area, looking bored already. A few moments after joining the line your body popped back into shape, allowing you to look around.<br>\r\nAs you looked at the other people standing in the line you noticed a similar trend between all of them. All of them either had tiny men with them or had some kind of tan clothing on display. You started considering your own situation and wondered how many of the men here had been assigned usage licenses against their will. Even further how many had their licenses assigned by the very woman you were trying to speak to, Isabella. <br>\r\nBaker\u2019s Law, in your opinion, had done more harm than good. The woman who managed to push it through seemed to have noble intentions, but the law she helped create may very well have ruined your life, and possibly the lives of many of the other guys in this room. <br>\r\nDeep in thought you strangely seemed to blame Amy Baker more than Isabella herself, which you realised was stupid and shook yourself out of it. Looking back around the room you saw that the line had moved up a lot while you were thinking and you and Quinn were almost at the front. Realising this, you began to panic slightly, the thought of seeing Isabella again making you incredibly anxious.<br>\r\nSeeing your distress, Quinn looked down at you.<br>\r\n\u201cListen Hunter, I know you\u2019re worried about this, but you need to get your head in the game here. We\u2019ll be here to back you up but in the end it\u2019s you that\u2019s in this situation so you are going to have to put in the work to get out of it,\u201d Quinn\u2019s small speech knocked you out of your doom and gloom attitude.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah you\u2019re right Quinn, thanks.\u201d<br>\r\nQuinn gave a small nod before continuing, \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll be in there with you to make sure she doesn\u2019t do anything underhanded... you\u2019re a pretty nice guy and I don\u2019t want to see anything bad happen to you if I can help it.\u201d<br>\r\nYou were about to reply to Quinn, but the line suddenly moved forward and Quinn was called forward to the reception desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn approached the desk, where a young woman sat, appearing bored out of her mind. As Quinn began to speak to her you could see her eyes drifting to the clock on the far wall every now and then, clearly counting the minutes till her shift ends.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m here with my friend Hunter Woods, he was issued a general usage license against his will and we need to speak to the notary who issued it, Isabella Brooks.\u201d<br>\r\nThe bored receptionist looked up at Quinn, obviously disinterested in this conversation mere moments into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... Ok give me a minute, I\u2019ll check if she\u2019s in right now...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) \u201c...Yup she\u2019s got an available slot now, you and your friends can go on in.\u201d You all go in to meet with Isabella.<br>\r\n2) \u201c...Ah yes, she\u2019s expecting you, go on in.\u201d Isabella has had time to prepare, how will this affect your chances of removing the license.<br>\r\n3) \u201c...Sorry she\u2019s not in at the moment, you\u2019ll need to come back at another time.\u201d You and your roommates need to leave and come back later, maybe gives time for them to do some research or writer\u2019s choice.</span></div></div>",

Her expression remained unchanged while you started to worry internally, if Isabella was expecting you, she was more than likely prepared for you. You started to lose hope before remembering Quinn\u2019s little pep talk to you, so you took a deep breath and prepared yourself.<br>\r\nQuinn waved Morgan and Avery over before the receptionist informed you where Isabella\u2019s office was, and the four of you made your way there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of walking in silence, everyone too tense to talk, you all come across the door labelled \u201cIsabella Brooks, Notary\u201d. Morgan looked around the group before reaching out and knocking, a faint \u201ccome in\u201d could be heard from the other side of the door and Morgan opened it to reveal Isabella, sitting at her desk. Her long black hair was pulled back into a tight bun, and she was wearing a black business suit that did little to hide her prominent curves. <br>\r\n\u201cCome in, take a seat all four of you,\u201d she smiled, maintaining a facade of professionalism. As everyone sat down in their seats, Quinn still holding on to you protectively, Isabella continued. \u201cNow I understand that the three of you are under the impression that there has been a mistake with Mr Woods\u2019 general usage license...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean the license that you forged,\u201d Quinn interrupted coldly.<br>\r\n\u201cW-What, I don\u2019t quite follow what you are saying. Hunter approached me and applied for this license,\u201d admittedly Isabella was a very good actor. You could even see Avery\u2019s face begin to display confusion. \u201cIf he hadn\u2019t approached me, how else could his signature be on the document? I would never forge a signature because it would be, first of all, unethical, and secondly it would most likely lead to me losing my job if anyone found out. In all honesty though Hunter, if you have any issues I can amend sections of your license, although removing it altogether would prove time consuming and difficult.\u201d<br>\r\nAs Isabella smiled politely down at you, you could see the malice in her eyes, there was no way she was going to make it this easy.<br>\r\n\u201cHowever,\u201d she continued, a smile crept up on her lips, anyone who didn\u2019t know this woman\u2019s true nature probably would have mistaken it as an innocent smile, but you knew better. \u201cAs an employee of the C.T.C, my main priority is ensuring that Hunter\u2019s rights that he claimed when he signed up for that license are respected. It appears to me that, in pursuing this avenue of attempting to remove his license, you are all acting contrary to his wishes. In applying for this license, Hunter has displayed a desire to be used as an object, accepting his squishy nature, and you are all not only refusing to allow him to live life as he has chosen to, but are actively trying to remove that chance from him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious,\u201d both Quinn and Morgan said in unison, jaws dropped, although you see that Avery was noticeably silent, looking uncomfortable and occasionally glancing at you with a guilty expression which worried you. Was Isabella\u2019s speech starting to sway Avery?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I am entirely serious, I took this job to protect the rights of those tiny men who want to live in the way their bodies are suited to without judgement. Most tiny men feel social pressure to live \u201cnormally\u201d, and don\u2019t allow themselves to even consider living in the way they want to. You all seem to belong to the group that\u2019s probably made Hunter feel like he\u2019d be shunned for trying to live in this way,\u201d once Isabella finished talking you opened your mouth to speak, but Quinn, who had been seething in anger up to this point, cut you off.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would Hunter want to be used as an object? That\u2019s insane!\u201d It seemed That the ludicrousness of Isabella\u2019s speech was throwing off Quinn\u2019s ability to argue against it. This was looking bad, you couldn\u2019t get a word in and the people who were arguing on your behalf were to frustrated and angry to argue rationally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final nail in the coffin came when Avery spoke up.<br>\r\n\u201cGuys, I think she\u2019s right,\u201d everyone looked towards Avery, too stunned to correct her. All except Isabella, who was grinning now that she had managed to convince one of your roommates. \u201cLike, I just realised that Hunter hasn\u2019t actually told us he didn\u2019t want this.\u201d<br>\r\nYou opened your mouth to correct her, but Morgan interrupted you.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah Avery, because he was passed out until like 20 minutes ago. The fact that he passed out just after hearing about this license would suggest that he was unhappy with the news, wouldn\u2019t you think so,\u201d Morgan was clearly trying to not get frustrated with her sister, but was failing, causing Avery to look slightly annoyed. Before either of them could continue to bicker, Isabella spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou make a good point Avery, if Hunter hasn\u2019t verbalised that he doesn\u2019t want this, then you have no solid evidence with which I could use to cancel this license. I have his signature on a legal document to prove my case. Even if Hunter made this admission in front of you all I couldn\u2019t be sure it would be an honest one and not an answer that you had pressured him into giving. I think that, given the situation in front of me, I will not only not motion that his license be revoked, but I will conduct a police supervised home visit within the next week to ensure that  Hunter\u2019s wishes are being respected. If you all feel that you cannot respect his wishes then I suggest that you give him to someone who will before that visit occurs, because if it isn\u2019t then Hunter will be taken into our custody and given to someone who will respect them. Don\u2019t worry Hunter, the C.T.C\u2019s number one focus is that your license is not only maintained, but that it is given full use.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t believe this, she was going to force one of your roommates to use you against their will! If you were honest that was the best case scenario, if they gave you to someone else you couldn\u2019t be sure what would happen, and god forbid what would happen if this home visit happened and Isabella saw something she didn\u2019t like. She would likely use that as an excuse to use you herself. <br>\r\nLooking at Quinn and Morgan, they couldn\u2019t believe it either. Avery\u2019s sheepish agreement with Isabella hadn\u2019t gone away either, if anything she seemed to be growing more convinced that this was the right thing to do by the minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, now that\u2019s all resolved I think it best if you guys headed home, to prepare for the home visit. If you guys decide that you\u2019d rather not abide by the usage license I suggest you find someone who will. It\u2019s often less problematic if you do it that way rather than wait for it to be done by us. Or don\u2019t, in the end Hunter will end up with someone willing to use him, for his own good of course,\u201d she gave a smug grin with the last part as she dismissed you all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk out of the building was quiet, with everyone figuring out what exactly just happened. You all went in with high hopes and they were dashed within a few minutes. You were starting to lose hope of ever getting rid of this license.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Hunter, who do you want to use you first?\u201d Avery broke the silence. All three of you turned to the oblivious girl in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone of us will be using him, Avery!\u201d Morgan snapped at her sister. \u201cShe\u2019s doing this against his will, it\u2019s wrong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, like, even if that\u2019s the case, someone has to use him or we\u2019ll all get in trouble,\u201d Avery retorted and both Quinn and Morgan looked at you glumly. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to use him if you guys don\u2019t want to. I think the little cutie would look totes amazing as a cute little thong for me.\u201d<br>\r\nYou could tell Avery was trying to make the most of the situation, but her overly positive personality was just driving you deeper into despair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAvery, I don\u2019t want that. I don\u2019t want to be used by anyone,\u201d your voice came out meekly, still processing exactly what happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, but didn\u2019t Isabella just say that if you said you didn\u2019t want to be used it was because of us pressuring you?\u201d Avery seemed confused, you could scarcely believe how airheaded she was. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to pretend around us, cutie.\u201d<br>\r\nShe was still being flirty, and you knew deep down that nothing you said could convince her of the truth. Morgan and Quinn seemed to have given up as well and were now discussing next moves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anything you knew the next few days could have a massive impact on how the rest of your life goes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens during those few days?<br>\r\n1) One of your roommates decides to use you so they can keep you with them while they try to undo your license.<br>\r\n2) They decide to get someone else to use you, but who is it? <br>\r\n3) Before anyone can figure out who will use you, Isabella turns up for her inspection. Looks like you are getting taken away, but where? <div align=\"left\"></div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the next two days, being around your roommates was awkward. You could see the pity in their eyes when they talked to you, though it was clear they didn't all have the same reasons for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsurprisingly, Quinn and Morgan were upset that sooner or later, they'd have to use you as an object. Unless they wanted you to be taken away from them, there was simply no other way. Avery on the other hand, was upset that her roommates hadn't let her use you yet. Isabella had seemingly convinced her that you really did want to be an object, but were being held back from telling the truth by embarrassment. Avery did her best to help assuage that embarrassment in her own ditzy, not too subtle way. You'd be sitting on the couch watching TV together and Avery would start shifting around, making a big show of getting comfortable, and say \"Gosh Hunter, my thong keeps riding up and making me uncomfortable. I sure wish I had a comfier one.\" Then the next day she'd been getting ready to go exercise with Morgan and had walked into room in pair of skin tight spandex shorts before loudly announcing: \"Ugh, I hate panty lines. If only I had a thong that fit me perfectly.\" Morgan had rolled her eyes at her sister's obvious motives, but you could see the concern on her face. She'd clearly considered whether you being a thong for Avery would be safer than being open to attack by Isabella. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two days, the girls finally broached the topic at breakfast. Morgan began: \"Alright Hunter. So I know you're not happy about this, but we've been talking and until we have a solution to get your license revoked, it seems like we are going to have to start using you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, unhappy but unsurprised. You could see the same resigned look on Quinn and Morgan's faces, but Avery had a barely concealed smile. You couldn't really fault her for it, she did think she was helping after all. You just wished she could see how ridiculous Isabella's claims were. \"I don't like it. But I understand, and I'd rather be with you girls than have Isabella take me away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan nodded before continuing. \"We figured that's how you'd see it. We do want you to have some input on this though. We figured we'd let you decide who you'd be used by. We've each done some thinking about what we'd turn you into.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Avery couldn't contain herself anymore. \"I didn't have to think at all Hunter. I've known you'd make a great thong for me for days. Just imagine, spending your days snuggled up between my big sexy butt cheeks. Maybe you'd even get to be in photoshoots with me! No need to be embarrassed though, no one would be able to tell you weren't just a normal thong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to yell at Avery and tell her that no one acknowledging you as human was a bad thing, not a pro. But you knew it wasn't worth it, and so just nodded and turned to Morgan and Quinn, hoping their options involved less giant asses. To their credit, both of them also seemed to think Avery was being ridiculous. Also ignoring her, they pressed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I actually need your help working out.\" Morgan said sheepishly. \"My sports bras keep ripping on me, and it's getting expensive to keep replacing them. I was hoping you'd be a bit more reliable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter was surprised by this one. He had hoped Morgan's plan for him would be less painful, but trying to contain her breasts while she worked out sounded more extreme than being Avery's thong. \"Is there any reason I have to be clothing? Couldn't I be something that lets me get squished less?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We looked into that too Hunter. Unfortunately Isabella sent us over a packet of 'minimum usage rules'. Apparently based on preferences you set out when you applied for the license, you specifically requested being molded into something unrecognizable so that you wouldn't have to face embarrassment of being recognized.\" Quinn explained. \"I know it's ridiculous, and we are working on it, but there's a lot of paperwork to get through to get anywhere with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quinn, don't say he is being ridiculous, you'll hurt his feelings.\" Avery cut in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to give one last shot at convincing Avery. \"Avery, she isn't hurting my feelings. Everything Isabella is saying is a lie, I have no interest in being squished into clothing for any of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of course I believe you Hunter, don't worry.\" Avery said, ending her sentence with an exaggerated wink. You sighed and turned back to Quinn. Avery was hopeless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's my third choice then?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Quinn's turn to turn red as she made her request. \"Well, one of my flip flops broke, and the new ones I bought online are seriously backordered. I was thinking maybe you could fill in as a flip flop until I got another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYiu shuddered as you thought of what it would be like under Quinn's feet. She always wore those flip flops to her life guarding job. Even at home, she'd often wear them around the house to avoid stepping on the cold kitchen tiles. They were uniformly tan initially, but you could see the outline of Quinn's foot permanently worn into them now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even get what there is to think about Hunter.\" Avery said. \"You could be wrapped around the butt of a literal model, or you could be smashed under Quinn's sweaty feet or stuck holding up Morgan's sweaty tits. Seems like a no-brainer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't pressure him! Let him pick on his own.\"  Morgan chided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes drifted back and forth along the line of girls, trying to choose. In some sense, Avery did have a point. While flossing her ass as a thong sounded pretty unpleasant, he wouldn't have to endure the sweaty pounding he'd experience in the other two roles. Avery's modeling job seemed much less active than Quinn and Morgan's work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Morgan and Quinn were the only ones who believed you didn't want to be an object, so you figured they'd probably at least try to go easy on you. If you picked Morgan, you'd get a break whenever she wasn't exercising. Based on Avery's enthusiam, you doubted she'd ever wear a regular thong again if she had you. As a flip flop, you'd get breaks during the night at least, plus when Quinn was sitting up in her lifeguard tower. And she had a replacement on the way, so Quinn's option was the only one that seemed to have a natural expiration date. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you decide?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You sighed, wishing you weren\u2019t currently having to choose which of your roommates got to wear you as clothing first. You wished you could have went back to a few days ago, before this usage license had been forced on you and do that day completely differently. <br>\r\nIn the end no amount of wishing for things to be different would make it so, you would just have to have faith in your roommates to get you out of this mess you were in.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLooking between the faces of your three roommates, you struggled to make a choice. You ruled out Avery pretty quickly, her eagerness to use you meant that picking her could only end with the inside of her ass crack being the only thing you\u2019d see for however long it took to get you out of this situation. At least with Quinn or Morgan you would get some respite.<br>\r\nPlus picking Avery could have the unintended side effect of giving credit to the opinion that you wanted this to happen, and the last thing you needed right now was Morgan and Quinn having doubts about your intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking between the concerned faces of Quinn and Morgan, you eventually decided that Quinn wore her flip flops far too much for you to want to replace one of them. You decided to go with the option that would hopefully allow you to see the least use and settled on being moulded into Morgan\u2019s new sports bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... I guess if I have to pick one, I\u2019ll be your sports bra Morgan,\u201d as you said that, Morgan\u2019s eyes went wide, not expecting you to actually pick her. Quinn\u2019s expression barely changed, although you saw a small amount of relief in her eyes at the prospect of not having to use you. Avery pouted, frustrated that you didn\u2019t pick what to her seemed like the obvious choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-thanks Hunter, I guess,\u201d Morgan blushed. She was clearly embarrassed at the prospect of wearing you so intimately for a long period of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat! Why would you want to be smushed by her sweaty boobs when you could have been hugging my totes amazing butt?\u201d Avery seemed genuinely confused and a little offended that you hadn\u2019t picked her. Her frown faded slightly as her eyes went wide in realisation. \u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019re totes into boobs isn\u2019t it? I can make you into my bra if you want, cutie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, Morgan and Quinn all sighed heavily as Avery missed the point once again. As you had your face in your palm, trying to comprehend how badly Isabella had turned Avery to her side, Morgan spoke.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about how you would wear him Avery. He doesn\u2019t want to be worn full stop, he only picked me because I recognise that,\u201d Morgan was exasperated at Avery. Her frustration gave away that they had clearly had multiple conversations about this when you weren\u2019t in earshot, but Avery just wasn\u2019t getting it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery simply huffed, before grumbling. <br>\r\n\u201cHe totes does want to be used though. You guys are pressuring him into thinking he doesn\u2019t.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring her sister, Morgan gently scooped you up in her palm before carrying you up to her room. She gently sat you down on her desk before looking down at you, hands on her hips with a pitying look on her face.<br>\r\n\u201cGod, this is a mess. I\u2019m so sorry this has to happen, Hunter. Don\u2019t worry though, we will be sure to do everything we can to get you out of this,\u201d she gave you a reassuring smile, before her frown returned. \u201cI guess there\u2019s not point in delaying this, sorry in advance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could respond Morgan, clearly wanting to just get this over with based on her expression, slammed her hand down on the table. You were flattened out in an instant. Morgan immediately set to work stretching you out into the rough shape of a sports bra, grimacing the whole time. <br>\r\nFirst, she stretched out the disfigured blobs that used to be your arms and legs, after which she began flattening your torso out so it would cover and support her chest tightly. Satisfied that you were starting to look the part, Morgan gave you a sheepish smile that you could tell was supposed to be reassuring, but in your position it didn\u2019t make you feel any better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan brought you to her chest, unintentionally doing it face first since your features were smeared to the point where they were unrecognisable. Your entire field of view was taken up by Morgan\u2019s perky, tanned left breast, her puffy nipple was poised to smash directly into your face. <br>\r\nYour torso had been smeared in such a way that you were essentially lying on your side, your face was going to be pressed into Morgan\u2019s left breast, while your groin would be pressed into her right one. Your legs would make up the straps around her right shoulder and your arms would make up the left ones. <br>\r\nAs Morgan tied your arms and legs together to secure you around her chest, you felt your body pulled tightly into the warm embrace of her soft skin. It would actually have been vaguely pleasant if you weren\u2019t squashed face first into her boob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Morgan finished tying the straps of her roommate turned sports bra, she turned to admire herself in the mirror. Letting go of you now that you were secure across her back, Morgan blushed as she saw how tightly you hugged her form. Her breasts were supported nicely, and you had been stretched out enough to cover them both. Your skin tones clashed enough to keep from wearing a tan sports bra look strange, and she chided herself when she caught herself thinking just how comfortable you were. Her blush deepened as she scolded herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou meanwhile were in an immense amount of strain. When Morgan let go of you after securing your arms and legs, gravity took hold of her abundant chest and you were the only thing holding them close to her chest now. <br>\r\nMorgan\u2019s bust was the smallest of your roommates by the simple fact of how much she exercised, but it wasn\u2019t by any means small, especially to you. Holding up the weight of Morgan\u2019s boobs was a Herculean task in itself, and you mentally cheered that it wasn\u2019t Quinn who had asked you to fill in as a bra for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks again for this Hunter, you are saving me a lot of money since I don\u2019t have to keep replacing these anymore. I\u2019ll try to make things as easy as possible for you but apologies in advance,\u201d Morgan said sheepishly, looking at you in the mirror, imagining you would be looking back at her. Morgan didn\u2019t realise she had stretched you face first across her chest and not facing outwards, not that she would have been able to tell anyway, since your face was largely unrecognisable by this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearing her eyes away from you and trying to force her blush to go away, Morgan focused on getting dressed into the rest of her workout gear, a black tank top and a pair of green compression shorts. As she sat down on her bed and leaned over to tie her shoes, you felt gravity take hold even harder and your arms and legs strained to keep her bust tight to her chest, it was incredibly painful, but you couldn\u2019t vocalise it since you were crushed so badly. <br>\r\nMorgan was impressed it just how well you acted as a sports bra. Once again she chided herself when she realised she was thinking about how much she was looking forward to seeing how comfortable you were when she exercised.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up and heading downstairs, Morgan waved goodbye to Quinn and Avery as she passed by the living room.<br>\r\nAvery jealously glared at her sister, plump lips in a full pout since she was still upset you hadn\u2019t picked her. Quinn had largely moved on, and barely looked at Morgan as she waved, too engrossed in her research on how to remove your usage licence that she was reading on her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Morgan left the house, you were totally unaware where she was headed since your view was dominated by a Morgan\u2019s nipple pressed into your face. You were sure it wouldn\u2019t be entirely pleasant wherever she was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Morgan is heading down to the local park, to play basketball with the Sanderson community basketball team, they have a big match coming up and are trying to get as much practice in as possible.<br>\r\n2) Morgan is heading to her job at workout world. She has a pretty hectic day scheduled, and you will have to support her the whole shift.<br>\r\n3) She is just going on a jog, nothing too exciting for her. Skip ahead the next few days and Isabella will show up for her visit, she is satisfied with Morgan\u2019s use of you, but does she find a way of making your experience more unpleasant?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You absolutely couldn't even consider Avery in this situation, choosing her when she was so willing and eager to use you and think that you actually wanted to be used would be likely to sway your other roommates to her way of seeing things. You needed to choose from the other two, you would much rather be touching boobs than feet if you were being honest, but on consideration if you were made into a sports bra Morgan would hardly ever take you off considering her job and hobbies. It seemed then that the only 'job' where you would get any kind of break while you were still squished would be serving as Quinn's Flip Flop Ironically you'd be choosing Quinn to go with again. Besides she'd be getting actual new flip flops soon so if it was worse than you thought it would be you could get out of it guaranteed at some point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long pause as you considered the options, Avery was practically jogging in place she was so excited to hear what you were going to say, probably assuming that you would choose her. You delayed long enough, you felt if you tried to hold off any more Isabella would be busting down the door any moment. \"Alright, if it's gotta happen I'd like the thing that has an expiration date before any legal stuff. Quinn make me your flip flop.\" You stated as confidently as you possibly could, Avery froze like she was a video that was buffering clearly stunned by your response. Morgan of course looked concerned and remorseful but didn't say anything trying to hold back from changing her mind. So the only one moving was Quinn, she looked a bit annoyed? She tried to put on a sad smile as if she was happy to be picked but also unhappy at having to be the one to use you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'll be sure to swap you out as soon as my order comes in.\" She said reaching her hand down to you, you fully expected her to just flatten you but instead her hand comes around and she scoops you up cupping you in her hand. Avery's brain was starting to reboot now trying to come up with a reason for what was happening other than the obvious. Quinn was walking you to her room just as you could hear Avery start to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, if you want feet I could-\" She got the door closed on her though and there was muffled noises of Morgan and her talking outside. Quinn plopped down on her bed and sighed. She opened her hand and looked at you sadly again before adopting the annoyed look again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I choose this to try and push you away from choosing me, ugg, whatever. Don't try and cheer me up please it will make this so much harder.\" She cut you off before you could even try and set you down on her dresser, turning around and giving you a very nice view of her expansive rear as she picked up her flip flops off the floor. Turning back to you she showed you the damage, which was immediately obvious, she had ripped the right one a big chunk was missing right where the 'thong' would connect. \"So, flattening you out wouldn't really be effective at turning you into a useful flip flop, my flip flops are kinda flat but not that flat. So, since it's just a bit missing I'll put you over top of the broken one.\" She explained her plan. it wasn't that terrible, not having to touch the actual ground would be nice but at the same time you'd be placed over top of the deep indent that Quinn's foot had made. You opened your mouth to say something but Quinn choose that exact moment to squash you between her fingers. She had obviously been trying to stall herself up to this point and had now steeled herself to get the job done. As your roommate started pulling on your body you had expected her to take your arms or legs for the 'thong' of the shoe but for some reason she had a different plan her fingers delicately found your tongue and pinched it off of your body before fully yanking you out into the right size. all of your features were blurred and you were wondering why Quinn had done this after not wanting to make things bad for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFace up on the desk now Quinn set the broken flip flop near you, and unlike before when it was away you could actually smell them now. despite being open all the time a funky foot stink permeated  the air around them. You only wished that you could change your mind and offer to hold Morgan's breasts right now. Quinn didn't speak to you but you saw her grabbing the little glue bottle and dabbing the shoe with it. You of course couldn't struggle at all, even if you could you doubt Quinn would reverse course now and you were soon laying flat on the glue having your edges massaged into place to match perfectly. It was only when you were placed on the floor with your partner that you understood why Quinn pulled your tongue instead of your arms, the strap for her Flip Flop was pink and it would look weird for the other one to be tan. Rather than use Dye she had opted to just grab a part of you that was already pink in some strange attempt to be merciful. She looked down at you one more time sadly \"Well, I guess you're my flip flop until my new ones come in, I don't know if I'll talk to you that much since you can't talk back and uh, don't worry that glue dissolves on it's own after a month it's just so you don't come undone in the first couple days. I hope the backlog doesn't take too long though.\" She sighed placing her foot over you and starting the finishing touches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the titanic foot of your new owner pressed into you, you felt yourself sink a little down into the indent her feet had already made as she pulled your tongue even farther out flossing it between her big and second toe and then gluing part of it around that side before looping it back and attaching it at the other side as well. You were kind of grossed out by the taste of glue but also Quinn's feet weren't all that clean either. The soft pressure of her adjusting you was then suddenly replaced by the intense weight of the voluptuous woman standing again all of her weight crashed into you like a ton of bricks along with the terrible realization that you had indeed subjected yourself to this torture for at least a month just for the chance that there would be breaks every so often. She lifted up her foot and stomped back down on you a couple of times and curled her toes over your face, she wasn't going to say it out loud but you were even more comfortable than she had thought you were going to be. Satisfied with her job of fixing you in place she started walking back out into the common area. Each step she took had you flying through the air only to have the life squeezed out of you when her foot fell back down, Quinn was the heaviest woman that had ever stepped on you that was for sure. When she took a step it would painfully yank your tongue as her foot bent and then used it as leverage to slap you back into her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe passed Morgan and Avery on her way to the couch where she plopped down and raised her feet onto the coffee table sort of but not really resting you as she absentmindedly played with you pulling and slapping you back into her foot painfully as she flipped through T.V. Channels. This would be a long month...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were right, it was a long month.<br>\r\nQuinn wore these flip flops much, much more than you had initially thought that she did, which explained their level of wear and tear. You were worn most of the day while Quinn was at home, as well as when she was working at your old place of work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn had thought it safer for you if she simply told Bridgitte that you wanted to quit your job at Sanderson Beach, which the fit redhead had been disappointed by, but understood. She had said that you would have been even more useful with a usage license, which made you slightly glad that Quinn had made that decision for you, as well as neglecting to tell Bridgitte that she was wearing you. <br>\r\nYou watched the two women talk in the same way you ended up watching everything in your new form, through the gap between Quinn\u2019s toes. <br>\r\nYou were forced to watch the world pass by without you through Quinn\u2019s smelly, wiggling digits. In some ways you sort of wished you couldn\u2019t see at all, because where you were you could only view the world around you, and never interact with anything. <br>\r\nYou spent most of your time looking up at Quinn, although you very rarely saw her face since it was obscured by her massive breasts. Your tongue was continually ground between her massive toes, soaking up all of the sweat and grime that accumulated between them. You were forced to become very well acquainted with the taste of the recess between Quinn\u2019s big and second toe, and it seemed like a taste you would never truly get used to. The smell was another thing that continually bothered you, as it lingered even when Quinn wasn\u2019t wearing you, and made it difficult to sleep at night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the days wore on, Quinn\u2019s constant pounding under her foot was starting to make your body conform to the contours of her foot, just like the part of the flip flop you had replaced. Unlike the part you had replaced however, you didn\u2019t have the luxury of breaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn your fourth day of being worn by Quinn, Isabella arrived for her inspection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour roommates had been relaxing in the living room, you couldn\u2019t see any of the other girls because Quinn had her foot propped up on the coffee table, so you could only see her. You saw her glance at you occasionally with a slightly guilty look on her face, but otherwise she was engrossed in something on her phone. You could hear Morgan and Avery chatting as Quinn\u2019s toes idly squeezed and toyed with your tongue and face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quiet atmosphere was broken by a knock at the door. Quinn made no move to go answer it, but you heard one of the twins footsteps as they went to answer it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later you heard the clack of heels on the wooden floor of the hallway. Quinn looked up at the new arrival and you could tell it was Isabella based of the scowl that crossed Quinn\u2019s face the instant she saw her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning everyone!\u201d You heard Isabella say pleasantly to everyone. Quinn rolled her eyes at the cruel woman trying to act nice. Isabella continued. \u201cSo, I\u2019ll just get down to business and then I can be out of your hair, have you all settled on a place for Hunter? Or do I have to take him with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn wordlessly kicked your flipflop off of her foot and onto the coffee table. You looked up towards Isabella as she leaned over to pick the flip flop up to inspect it. Her nose crinkled slightly at the strong smell coming off of them, and she looked confused briefly, before her eyes widened and she began to grin as she spotted your eyes looking up at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, this use was... unexpected,\u201d she looked like she was struggling to contain her laughter and stay professional. \u201cBut it certainly fits well with the guidelines Hunter and I straightened out when he applied for the license. Thank you all for finally seeing sense and giving little Hunter exactly what he deserved.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard Quinn and Morgan grumble something inaudibly and you imagined Avery would be nodding in agreement. <br>\r\nTurning her head back you you, Isabella smiled warmly, although you could see the malice in her eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cGot some good news for you as well Hunter! I put your reasoning for your application on record, as well as some of your caregivers misgivings about your intentions. I also added the transcript of our little group chat the other day on record, highlighting both mine and Avery\u2019s statements about your desire to be used, so it\u2019s all extra evidence in our favour. So now your license is all the more protected against removal, isn\u2019t that great!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were crestfallen, but couldn\u2019t do anything to vocalise it. Isabella had used your visit to her office to build her case! She seemed to be trying to discredit Quinn and Morgan, so they\u2019d be less able to argue on your behalf! If she wasn\u2019t actively trying to ensure that you would spend the rest of your life as an object, you would have to admire her intelligence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she smiled and set you gently back on the table, you looked to Quinn and Morgan, both distraught over the news Isabella had just delivered. <br>\r\nSatisfied that she had ruined everyone\u2019s morning, Isabella smiled and said goodbye before leaving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone simply sat in silence for a few moments, before looking to you apologetically. All except Avery, who looked at you with happiness at seeing your rights protected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the present, you were currently laying on the floor of the living room, next to the couch, your partner flip flop laying next to you. Quinn had taken just you off after finally giving in to Avery\u2019s constant pestering that she wanted to paint her roommates toenails because she was bored, having already painted her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, fine, if it\u2019ll stop you badgering me about it,\u201d Quinn groaned, not taking her eyes away from her phone. Quinn and Morgan had been trying to find a way to counter Isabella\u2019s efforts, despite that disastrous visit from her three weeks ago. She had simply kicked you off without even looking at you. You had noticed her treatment of you was becoming much more distant and callous, but you figured it was from guilt at having to wear you as long, as well as becoming increasingly distracted by the efforts to free you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay! Oh you won\u2019t regret this Quinn, I\u2019ll have your toes looking fantabulous in no time! I think I\u2019ll paint them an uber pretty pink to match your favourite flip flops,\u201d Avery had seemingly completely forgotten you existed, since she hadn\u2019t acknowledged you in almost a week. You could only look up to the pink haired giantess as she excitedly rushed over to the coffee table and sat down, grabbing one of Quinn\u2019s feet and beginning to concentrate on painting her nails, cutely sticking her tongue out in concentration while she did it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes it have to be pink though, I\u2019d prefer black,\u201d Quinn complained, but made no move to stop Avery, her apathetic nature showing itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuinn, you should know by now that I don\u2019t do dark colours,\u201d Avery giggled, and simply trailed off into an unending stream of chatter about how pretty Quinn\u2019s feet would look by the time she was finished with them, among other topics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou zoned out of the conversation, simply taking the rare chance to look around a room without your view being obstructed by Quinn\u2019s pounding toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter around ten minutes, Quinn huffed in annoyance.<br>\r\n\u201cAgain! Really! My new flip flops got delayed again!\u201d Quinn fumed. Her anger stemmed more from frustration of the shipping company than concern for you, you had momentarily slipped her mind while Avery was painting her toenails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, why do you need new flip flops when you\u2019ve got a set of perfectly good ones...\u201d Avery trailed off as her eyes drifted to you. \u201cOh yeah, Hunter, duh! Hey cutie, how you doing down there? Ready to be my thong yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery\u2019s unending positivity was a novelty that had worn off entirely over your month long stint as Quinn\u2019s footwear, so you could only roll your eyes in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Avery. Hunter signed up to be my flip flop and I still need him since my damn delivery has been delayed again,\u201d Quinn caught herself as she suddenly sounded incredibly selfish in regards to wearing you. Blushing, she simply went quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery finished up on Quinn\u2019s toenails, before your ridiculously curvy roommate turned owner slid her foot back into her flip flops and walked up to her room. <br>\r\nSitting on the edge of her bed, she looked down at you with a pitying expression on her face.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that earlier, Hunter. I was frustrated about my order getting delayed again, along with this whole legal battle we\u2019ve got going with that evil notary,\u201d Quinn sighed. \u201cLooks like I\u2019ll need to use you for another while though, since my replacement flip flops keep getting delayed and it doesn\u2019t look like we\u2019ll be getting rid of your license for a while either. To be in with the best chance, we need to try and find proof that Isabella forged your signature, because she\u2019s got us cornered otherwise. Anyway, I\u2019ve got work in the morning, so good night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn got ready for bed and you were soon left in darkness as she switched the lights off.<br>\r\nLeft to your thoughts you could only fear how casual everyone was becoming with you in this form. If you weren\u2019t freed soon you feared that the way your roommates treated you could irreversibly changed, you wanted them to view you as an equal, not the footwear of one of their real roommates.<br>\r\nIn the end you couldn\u2019t do anything to change it, you would just have to hope that Quinn and Morgan would come through for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Quinn is approached by a member of the public who witnessed your confrontation with Rachel and Isabella at the beach, wondering if you were ok since they hadn\u2019t seen you working as a lifeguard since then. Possibly a lead to freeing you? <br>\r\n2) After three months, Quinn\u2019s flip flops arrive. What happens to you? <br>\r\n3) You are stolen while Quinn is saving someone at Sanderson Beach and isn\u2019t wearing you. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over the next two days you, Morgan and Quinn began to research a way of quickly removing your usage license, but found that removing it would not be a simple matter. In fact, one article Morgan found said that removing a usage license could take weeks, or even months! Combining that with how focused Isabella seemed to be on forcing this on you, you wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you were stuck with this thing for a year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had all been sitting around the kitchen table researching for the better part of the day, and frustration was starting to set in for all three of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, I don\u2019t think I can look at these anymore! I might need to call it for tonight guys,\u201d Quinn sighed, rubbing her temples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah girls, I\u2019m beat as well. Maybe for the best that we just pick this back up tomorrow,\u201d you agreed. You were worried about this situation sure, but you didn\u2019t want your friends working themselves to death over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHunter, both Quinn and I have work tomorrow,\u201d Morgan looked like she was losing hope. \u201cSo we won\u2019t be able to get very much research done. Plus Isabella could show up any day now! We might need to face the fact that until this is fixed, someone is going to have to use you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Morgan looked at you sympathetically, you sighed.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I figured this was going to be the likely outcome,\u201d you rubbed the back of your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre we finally seeing sense and wearing the little cutie like he so obviously wants to?\u201d Avery peaked her head into the kitchen. \u201cMay as well just give him to me now and I\u2019ll have him as a totes cute thong in no time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all sighed at the pink haired girls misreading of the situation.<br>\r\n\u201cAvery, I\u2019ve already told you. I don\u2019t want anyone to wear me. Your eagerness to turn me into a thong probably would make you the last person I\u2019d choose!\u201d You snapped at Avery without meaning to. Your bubbly, pink haired roommate looked crestfallen, clearly you had hurt her feelings. Even Quinn and Morgan looked slightly taken aback by your outburst. Feeling bad, you looked at Avery, a slight wetness in her eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cAvery, I\u2019m-,\u201c before you could continue, Avery stormed off. You heard a door slam upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeez dude, that was harsh,\u201d Quinn remained completely deadpan as she said this. She clearly understood why you snapped, but she clearly felt bad for Avery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I didn\u2019t mean it,\u201d you looked up to Morgan and Quinn, regret painted on your face. \u201cYou think she\u2019ll be ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah Hunter, she\u2019ll get over it,\u201d Morgan reassured you. \u201cBut for now we\u2019ve got more important matters to attend to. We need to find someone who would be willing to use you to keep Isabella at bay while we get through all this paperwork. I don\u2019t think Quinn or I are too comfortable with using you, and you obviously would rather not have Avery do it. Any ideas who we could ask?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm, we\u2019ll obviously I trust my mom and Tracy, but I\u2019d rather avoid using them if possible. They\u2019d both do it in a heartbeat to help me, but I don\u2019t want to put Tracy through that and my mom might see this whole situation as my fault and see fit to punish me for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAunt Norah is another option, but I\u2019d rather avoid her as well if I can, she\u2019d likely mould me into something and forget about me after a while. I\u2019d rather not spend a few months as her insole or something like that because she forgot I was there. Do you guys have any ideas?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you looked at your roommates, Morgan seemed to think about it for a moment. Quinn shook her head.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Hunter, but you definitely wouldn\u2019t want to be given to my mom. She hates tinies so if we gave you to her the usage license would be the last of your worries,\u201d Quinn\u2019s words filled you with no small amount of fear at the prospect of ending up with her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to Morgan, she began to speak.<br>\r\n\u201cI mean I guess we could give you to mine and Avery\u2019s moms. They love tiny guys, and I doubt they\u2019d forget you. They can be a little overbearing in their affections, but they are always an option I suppose,\u201d you could see a hint of apprehension in Morgan\u2019s eyes as she spoke about giving you to her parents, but you passed it off as her being slightly embarrassed by her parents or something like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft with the choices arrayed in front of you, you thought long and hard about it. Eventually you came to a decision, and looked up to Morgan and Quinn, who were looking at you expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I\u2019ve made a decision,\u201d you sighed. Not liking the prospect of being worn by this person at all, but you didn\u2019t have any other choices. \u201cI\u2019ve decided that I should be given to...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) \u201c...one of my family members.\u201d You are given to either Helen, Norah or Tracy.<br>\r\n2) \u201c...Morgan\u2019s parents.\u201d Morgan takes you to her parents house and explains the situation to Mariah and Lilyana, before leaving you there. After finding out where you went, Avery might decide to \u201ctell the truth\u201d to her moms, maybe leading to a change in their treatment of you.<br>\r\n3) \u201c...none of them. Can we think of someone else?\u201d (Writers choice) </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You awoke, and after taking a moment to breath deeply and calm yourself down, you could hear the faint sounds of laughter and waves crashing, and realized that you were once more in Quinn\u2019s bag, being carried along to work at Sanderson Beach. Sure enough, after a minute, your pocket was unzipped, and Quinn lifted you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at you, Quinn noted your shaken expression and frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re really worried about this, huh?\u201d She asked, a hint of genuine compassion in her voice. \u201cLook, Hunter, I think that License stuff is bullshit and frustrating. I knew a few tinies once who signed up because they were low on cash, and the last I ever saw them, this bratty cheerleader at our high school had them glued to her boobs like pasties for over four months. Of course, according to law, it was all \u2018legal\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paled at Quinn\u2019s story, and began quivering in fear. \u201cY-you don\u2019t think\u2026that\u2026\u201d You began, but Quinn cut you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell no, Hunter. You\u2019re under my care while we\u2019re hear at the beach.\u201d Quinn\u2019s expression was blazing with righteous fury. \u201cUntil this License mess is sorted, I\u2019m telling Brigitte that you WILL NOT leave my sight each day. I swear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour accelerating panic attack slowed down, and you flashed Quinn a grateful smile. To your surprise, she actually returned it, and it was one of the few times you could recall seeing her actually smile so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn began walking, and resumed talking as she did so. \u201cIn fact, we\u2019re headed to Brigitte\u2019s office right now. She requested to speak to us, and told me not to change for some reason. Maybe she finally has a replacement for my too-small bikini. Regardless, I\u2019m letting her know that your safety comes first. She\u2019ll be understanding, count on it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for doing all of this, Quinn. It means a lot.\u201d You said to her, and though she didn\u2019t respond with more than a curt nod, you could\u2019ve sworn the lightest trace of pink flushed her cheeks for a split second before disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two of you reached Brigitte\u2019s office, you found your new boss seated at her desk, and frowning at her computer. As Quinn walked in, Brigitte glanced up, and her frown only deepened. As she locked eyes with you, the light in her eyes dimmed a bit. You weren\u2019t totally sure, but it seemed as if she was displaying signs of\u2026anxiety? Apprehension? Guilt, maybe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn took a seat in front of Brigitte\u2019s desk, and placed you down on the edge of her boss\u2019s desk. Noting her superior\u2019s apparent unease, Quinn furrowed her brow. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Brigitte? You wanted to see us? Truth is, I had something to say to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte\u2019s eyes widened, and she breathed out, seemingly releasing a breath she\u2019d been holding for a while. \u201cO-oh? Is that right? Go ahead, shoot. I\u2019ll\u2026uh\u2026explain myself after you speak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn shrugged. \u201cOkay, sure. Basically, I just wanted to request Hunter as my partner for the next few weeks. I wanted him up in the lifeguard stand with me, or by my side during patrols.\u201d Your black-haired roommate glanced at you, then back to Brigitte. \u201cHe had a\u2026less than enjoyable first day, and would feel safer as close to me as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the phrase \u2018close to me as possible\u2019 caused Brigitte to shift uncomfortably in her chair, and the redhead seemed to be at a loss for words for a moment until finally composing herself. Looking at her computer, then at you, and finally at Quinn, she spoke again. \u201cWell, that shouldn\u2019t be too much of a problem\u2026in a way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spoke up. \u201cThat\u2019s great, thank you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte bit her lip, and waited an uncomfortably long time before speaking again. \u201cSee, thing is\u2026I actually got an email late last night. I checked again to make sure it was real this morning. From what I can see on my end, Hunter has applied for, and been accepted for a General Use License. All the paperwork is here on the screen, and legit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your fears rising, and you stammered out a reply. \u201cW-well, th-that\u2019s not actually\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn, unintentionally, cut off your explanation with her own. \u201cNo, ma\u2019am, Hunter was\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte silenced both of you by raising your hand. \u201cLook, guys. I\u2019m sorry, but it doesn\u2019t matter. From your expressions, it seems like maybe this was all a big mishap, but the paperwork is genuine. This License has to be treated as real and applicable to any foreseeable situation. Until it can be officially revoked\u2026which I hear is a huge pain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour giantess partner seethed in her chair, angry at the women from yesterday, not Brigitte, who\u2019s hands were tied. \u201cJust because the License is real\u2026for now\u2026doesn\u2019t mean we have to do anything with\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of that\u2026\u201d Brigitte leaned back in her chair, and pulled an envelope out of a drawer. She dropped the envelope onto her desk in front of Quinn, letting the contents spill out. Inside the envelope were about thirty little slips of folded paper. \u201c\u2026I found notes like these in the Sanderson Beach tips and complaints box all this past week. These thirty are from yesterday ALONE.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn, confused, sifted through the pieces of paper, pausing to read a few. After glancing at them, a full, beet red blush ignited in her cheeks, and her eyes widened. You\u2019d never seen Quinn look so taken aback by anything before. She was utterly speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte sighed. \u201cTen of these paper slips are from beach goers complaining about your risqu\u00e9 uniform, Quinn. Mostly families and older people saying that you\u2019re setting a bad example for children. The other twenty slips are, frankly, quite lecherous. Perverts and the like complimenting your\u2026ahem\u2026\u2018crazy hella fine ass\u2019 and \u2018bouncing bubble butt\u2019. It\u2019s pretty gross.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your amazement, Quinn actually sank into her seat from embarrassment. \u201cI-I can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m just shaped this way\u2026AND it\u2019s that dumb suit\u2019s fault. It\u2019s too small!\u201d Quinn was a bit frantic now, probably trying too hard to save face. It was almost cute, if you didn\u2019t have a growing sense of dread building inside of you over what was about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly my point, Quinn.\u201d Brigitte nodded, and she began to slowly move forward, leaning over her desk. Momentarily distracted by your boss\u2019 huge, firm breasts and lean abdomen, you were caught off guard as the towering redhead scooped you up into her palm and held you tightly. The action also snapped Quinn out of her flustered spiral, and she sat up attentively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, Brigitte, what are you\u2026\u201d You tried to say, before being silenced by Brigitte gently but forcibly smushing your head flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte shrugged her shoulders. \u201cI don\u2019t know all the details here, but this seems like the win-win situation to me. Hunter as a General Use License now, making it perfectly legal for him to serve his position here at Sanderson Beach by being molded into replacement bikini bottoms for you. Just as long as it takes until we get a new, proper fitting suit for you, Quinn. Besides, the General Use License, when used in a work setting, ups his hourly pay. Again, win-win!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn was floored. \u201cWha\u2026Brigitte! He\u2019s a living being like us. He doesn\u2019t want to be my bikini bottoms!\u201d Quinn paused, and began blushing again. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to have to wear Hunter for\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, his License says what his License says.\u201d Brigitte frowned. \u201cThis might be weird for you at first, but you just need to change your thinking. By law, he\u2019s property now, remember?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn\u2019s eyes nearly bulged from her skull, and she sneered at her boss. \u201cYou can\u2019t seriously believe that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte shook her head. \u201cNo, I like that little dude, but it\u2019s factual law. Not only do we need to abide by his License, but this will also solve your dress code issue. No more rude comments or worrying complaints from beach goers, and no more discomfort for you. I mean, I\u2019m sure you know how stretchy tinies are. He\u2019ll fit you well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMa\u2019am\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt the end of the day\u2026I\u2019m your boss, Quinn. I\u2019m telling you this is going to happen.\u201d The giantess redhead looked sullen for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but all you could do is quit to avoid this. Even still, Hunter would remain employed here, and I\u2019m sure his License would be useful for other purposes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour giantess roommate looked utterly defeated, and she sank back in defeat. Sparing you a heart wrenching look of dismayed acceptance, she nodded at Brigitte\u2019s proposal. A huge smile came back to the normally energetic redhead\u2019s beautiful face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! Awesome!\u201d Brigitte smiled. \u201cThis\u2019ll be over before you know it, Quinn. As soon as we get a replacement suit for you, Hunter is off the hook. And, as soon as his License is revoked, if that\u2019s what the little dude wants, he\u2019s free to go back to normal work.\u201d Brigitte began flattening you by clenching her palm. \u201cBesides, you two get what you wanted, right? He\u2019ll be \u2018as close to you as possible\u2019, remember? It\u2019s perfect!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrunched up in Brigitte\u2019s hand, you felt your spirits fall to despairing lows. This day had truly become the nightmare those two evil women from yesterday had promised it would be. Your License in full effect, you were nothing but property by law now. Brigitte\u2019s last statement, innocent as it had been, stung particularly harsh. You had wanted to partner with Quinn to avoid THIS exact scenario, but fate had screwed you over in the end.</span></div></div>",

More than muscular enough to easily dominate you, Brigitte reduced you into a paper-thin flat disc in seconds, and was now smearing you into a larger and larger circular shape with an annoying level of casual carelessness. Though she said that she genuinely liked you as an employee (and you believed her deep down) Brigitte was taking to using your License quite quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m going to have to delay you for a few more minutes, Quinn.\u201d Brigitte explained. Quinn, who could barely stop from wincing at your treatment, slowly pried her gaze away from you and towards her boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026what do you mean?\u201d She asked, fighting hard to slip back into her normal apathetic attitude. She hated what was happening to you, but couldn\u2019t think of any way to change it. Brigitte\u2019s points made perfect sense, and the law was the law, as much as Quinn despised it. Your black-haired roommate was also a bit afraid (though she\u2019d never admit it) of disappointing her boss by maintaining a combative or sulky demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte rummaged around on her desk and retrieved her phone, then began typing the number pad before replying to Quinn. \u201cBasically, I\u2019m shit at anything related to design. If I tried to make Hunter into your replacement bikini bottoms myself, it\u2019d be a mess.\u201d Brigitte laughed heartily. \u201cThankfully, Natasha is much more skilled than I am, so let me call her real quick and she\u2019ll drive over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn nodded. \u201cAh, okay.\u201d It took her a second, but Quinn recalled Brigitte mentioning before that she lived with her girlfriend, Natasha, in a spacious apartment not far from the beach. Natasha was, if Quinn was remembering correctly, a part-time fashion designer. After a moment of ringing, Natasha picked up, though Quinn could only hear Brigitte\u2019s side of the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte lit up excitedly, presumably from hearing her girlfriend\u2019s voice. \u201cAh, Natasha! Still at home?\u201d A pause. \u201cUh huh, I need your help in the office. Little bit of styling and designing. Got a Usage License tiny for ya to mold into bikini bottoms!\u201d Another pause. \u201cYes, babe, I know, you feel kinda weird about it, but you\u2019re so damn good, baby.\u201d One more pause. \u201cYes, paperwork\u2019s all taken care off. It\u2019ll be easy, and I\u2019ll buy dinner tonight to make it up to you. Love ya!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte hung up, then laid your pancaked body down on her desk. She then casually dropped a heavy notebook atop you, pressing you down hard onto her desk and ensuring you were unable to reform in the time that passed before Natasha arrived. The redhead giantess then leaned back in her chair and drummed her fingers on her desk. Quinn fought to keep her face neutral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I\u2019ve got a few ideas for reorganizing volleyball competitions after the west nets broke\u2026\u201d Brigitte began, engaging your roommate in conversation. Able to slip into more normal work patterns, Quinn tried her best to ignore you and conversed rather pleasantly with Brigitte for the next fifteen minutes, passing the time amicably while you fought uselessly to wiggle out from under Brigitte\u2019s notebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Natasha arrived, and she swept into the room with a grin on her face, a skip in her step, and about a million art and design supply bags under her arms. Dropping the bags in an empty chair, Natasha giggled as she was swept up into Brigitte\u2019s arms and kissed passionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn was momentarily taken aback by Natasha. She vaguely noted that Natasha was African American, with curly brown hair that framed her face, and that she was exceptionally pretty. What threw her off was that Natasha was no more than 5\u20192\u201d. Her short height was almost comedic in comparison to Brigitte\u2019s towering form, and as it was, the muscular redhead easily lifted her girlfriend and spun her around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting Natasha back down, Brigitte composed herself and then removed the notebook from atop your body. Gesturing to you, Brigitte retook her seat. Sobering up, Natasha approached the desk and gently scooped you up into her hands. Her delicate, artist\u2019s hands rubbed and massaged your body, poking and prodding at you. Natasha bit her lip gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, he\u2019ll definitely work just fine. Soft and stretchy enough to fit even Quinn.\u201d Natasha explained, causing Quinn to briefly blush at the offhand reference to her curvaceousness. Natasha didn\u2019t seem to notice, though, and in fact went straight to using her sharp fingernails to tear your clothes off, leaving you totally nude in her hands. \u201cHe\u2019ll need to be naked for the dye to work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn furrowed her brow. \u201cDye? What\u2019s that for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha pulled a few bottles from her bag, as well as a medium-sized bowl. \u201cFabric dye is needed to dye\u2026uh\u2026this tiny dude\u2026the same red color as all of our lifeguard uniforms.\u201d Natasha glanced at her girlfriend. \u201cThough it should be noted that the dye can permanently affect the tiny\u2019s skin tone. Only the solvent liquid will restore his skin tone to normal. You DO have some in stock, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte nodded vaguely. \u201cUh, definitely. I saw a few bottles in the storage room\u2026last month or something.\u201d She trailed off, and neither Quinn nor Natasha heard her last comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood enough for me.\u201d Natasha smiled, before dumping a red bottle of fabric dye into her bowl. She mixed in a few other liquids, and then finally submerged your body into the bowl. You mentally screamed out as the cool liquid soaked and sloshed all around you, covering you entirely. Crumpled up as you were, you couldn\u2019t do a thing to fight Natasha, and soon you were fully drowned in the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantesses left you to stew in the bowl for ten minutes, Quinn sparing you a glance every so often, but finally Natasha retrieved you. When she did so, you caught a brief glimpse of yourself in the reflection of a mirror on the wall, and found to your utter horror that your body was entirely dyed bright red. Every inch of your skin tone had been changed to a bright red color, with not a trace of your normal tan shade remaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, perfect!\u201d Natasha grinned. She hastily plugged in a small blow-dryer into the wall and dried off the remnants of the dye from your body. She then laid you out onto Brigitte\u2019s desk and grabbed some white fabric paint and a brush from her bag. She\u2019d laid you onto the desk face first, so you couldn\u2019t tell what was coming next, but you instinctively winced as you felt the dripping brush dabble white paint onto your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn leaned forward to watch, morbidly curious. \u201cWhat are you doing, Natasha?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha winked at Quinn. \u201cEver wonder who designed that cute little logo that Sanderson Beach uses? It was yours truly!\u201d She beamed brightly. \u201cI\u2019m just sketching it onto these bikini bottoms real quick. The white color will pop out, and the fabric paint will fuse to the bottoms, preventing it from scratching or fading. It\u2019ll also be waterproof!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn frowned at hearing the phrase \u2018fuse to\u2019, and your own heart plummeted with despair. Still, both you and she were powerless in this situation, and could only let Natasha do her work. Brigitte looked on proudly as Natasha painted the Sanderson Beach logo onto your back: a cute picture of a sandy beach, volleyball net, and bright sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished drawing, Natasha gently blew on you to dry the paint, along with another go with the blow-dryer. She then turned to Quinn, retrieved a tape measure from her bag, and noted the measurements of Quinn\u2019s prodigious posterior, hips, and thighs for good measure. With all her notes in place, it was time for the final excruciating step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking you up, Natasha tentatively pulled at your malleable body, a huge smile spreading on her face. \u201cOh, this material is just the BEST for clothing!\u201d She gushed, apparently already forgetting you were a living person at this point, too caught up in the excitement of her craft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next fifteen minutes, Natasha worked at a feverish pace, not letting up for an instant. She pushed, pulled, stretched, squished, and molded your tiny body into the world\u2019s most perfect bikini bottoms. Your arms and legs served as the loops for Quinn\u2019s legs to go through, your face made up the inside back of the bottoms, and your lower half the inside front. Natasha sealed the deal with a thin but extra-durable layer of waterproof superglue to seal your limbs in place, completing the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted, Natasha sat back and handed you to Brigitte. Brigitte eyed you excitedly, immensely proud at the work of her girlfriend. Satisfied beyond any doubt, Brigitte tossed you to Quinn, who caught you gently. Your black-haired partner spared you a sympathetic look, but you barely noticed. The fabric dye and mushing and mashing from Natasha had really mangled your face, causing your vision to be blurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte cleared her throat. \u201cSo, normally, you\u2019d wear the standard one-piece uniform. However, until we get your replacement, use those bottoms every day, and just wear a Sanderson Beach lifeguard t-shirt over whatever top you want. Sound good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn nodded numbly. \u201cUm\u2026sounds great, ma\u2019am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome! Then go get changed and head out, we\u2019re behind schedule! Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t dock you pay for this.\u201d Brigitte laughed, then turned to flirting with Natasha. Apparently, the conversation was over. Knowing she was dismissed, Quinn left the office and headed towards the changing room, you in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Quinn were not at all looking forward to this day\u2026or the foreseeable future.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Quinn was at least partially relieved to find the employee changing room empty, as it meant she didn\u2019t have to experience her horrible discomfort at what was about to take place with any prying eyes around. Still, as she found an empty bench and began stripping out of her casual clothes, she was incapable of looking away from her new bikini bottoms\u2026and the poor tiny roommate that used to be just an hour ago. No trace of the funny, if slightly pervy, guy Quinn had come to tolerate was left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough your blurry vision from the dye and the mashing, you were just barely able to glimpse Quinn from the angle she\u2019d dropped you onto the bench. You could see the fuzzy image of her body as she stripped naked, and then her hand grow closer and closer as she reached for you. Your blood ran cold from fear, while simultaneously your hormones began churning at double time. It was a frustrating situation that was a mix of terror and arousal. Your basic human rights had been ignored in every capacity thanks to that damn General Usage License\u2026but Quinn was also the sexiest girl you\u2019d ever seen in your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny lingering attraction faltered as Quinn stepped into the two holes that Natasha had formed by looping your arms and legs. There was no turning back now, save for a quick pause from Quinn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so, so sorry about this Hunter.\u201d Quinn sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll do everything I possibly can to fix this as quick as possible. No tiny deserves this.\u201d Your black-haired roommate sighed again. \u201cThat said\u2026this is that last I can talk to you until at least this evening when our shift ends. Sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, your fate was one hundred percent sealed, as Quinn\u2019s hands were totally tied. Pulling you up the rest of the way up her legs, Quinn had no choice but to treat you like the bikini bottoms that you currently were. From now until this whole mess was solved, you were a swimsuit, not a normal tiny guy living his life. Your Usage License required you to serve out your sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black-haired giantess, predictably, had a little bit of trouble squeezing you past her thick thighs, and especially up and around her utterly massive ass. She finally managed, using your body\u2019s stretchy properties to their absolute limit. Your bikini shaped body was pulled out tight across Quinn\u2019s ass, but you did your duty shockingly well. After Quinn finished fitting you in place, she couldn\u2019t resist glancing at her appearance in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou covered the expanse of her pale, thick derriere effectively, modestly concealing most of her bubble butt (and a million times more modest than her previous bottoms). You hugged her hips snuggly, but still allowed her to move freely. Her crotch was similarly protected, while also comfortably cradled. In fact, that was what shocked Quinn the most. You were unbelievably smooth and comfortable, distractingly so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn\u2026this is a comfy\u2013\u201d Quinn began, before abruptly cutting herself off. She\u2019d already started rubbing her hand along her butt, tracing her fingers against your back. Caught up in how soft, smooth, and supportive you were, for the faintest of moments the true identity of her new bikini bottoms had slipped her mind. No longer, and Quinn visibly recoiled at the fact that she\u2019d just thought about how nice you felt wrapped around her. The very idea was wrong to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning, Quinn dug out a fitting and mostly supportive bikini top from her bag, and then threw on a simple Sanderson Beach employee t-shirt over top. Sliding her feet back into her flip-flops, she adjusted her hair, slipped on some sunglasses, and strolled out of the changing room, desperately trying to think of anything but how nice you felt hugging her hips as she walked, and not like her old suit wedging itself into her butt crack every five seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crossed the sandy dunes and reached the middle lifeguard tower, where Brigitte had her stationed today. Scaling the ladder, Quinn took a moment to survey her surroundings, and then she leaned forward against the railing, pressing her hands into the polished wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor your part, you were just as weirded out by Quinn. You\u2019d been worn as clothing several times in the past, but never anything as thorough as this. Gripped so tightly around Quinn\u2019s silky-smooth skin, it almost felt a little comfortable, her own body heat washing over you. It wasn\u2019t some sort of secret heaven, as your body was still stretched painfully tight to fit Quinn\u2019s meaty thighs and huge ass, but it was almost bearable\u2026save for the humiliatingly close proximity to her womanhood, and the faintest trace of stench from deep inside her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were now, your face was firmly squeezed into Quinn\u2019s plump buttocks, but because you more-or-less fit her like a glove, you weren\u2019t riding up into her ass crack like a wedgie. Your body was merely pressed into her doughy cheeks, like a too-tight hug that you couldn\u2019t escape from. Her slightest movements jiggled her flesh across your face, but it wasn\u2019t unbelievably awful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little over an hour, however, Quinn couldn\u2019t last any longer. She\u2019d been purposefully avoiding sitting, but her legs were screaming for relief. Grimacing at what she was about to do, Quinn slowly walked over to her lifeguard chair, took a deep breath, and then turned around and sat down, settling into the constrictive chair a size too small for someone of Quinn\u2019s proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment she sat, any illusion of this being a not-so-bad circumstance shattered. Quinn\u2019s sizable derriere took up the entire space of the chair, squeezing into its tight confines. Your body was demolished beneath her ass, with nearly all of Quinn\u2019s weight bearing down on you. Her hot flesh pressed into your swimsuit-shaped body, spilling out around you and utterly enveloping you. Your face was mashed flat by her cheeks, and both the slight stench and trickle of sweat doubled down into an oppressive scent and downpour of sticky sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her credit, Quinn had no way of possibly comprehending how terrible this was for you, and could only hope that she was making it as bearable as possible. Subconsciously, she wiggled a bit in her seat to get comfortable, acting totally on habit. It took her a second to realize and then chastise herself for the action, but the damage to you was done. She had smeared even more of her hot flesh across your body, and dumped another load of sweat onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thirty minutes passed uneventfully, and Quinn vaguely wondered why her usually annoying lifeguard chair wasn\u2019t so bad today. The truth was due to your body taking the brunt of most of the searing heat from the plastic instead of Quinn herself, singing your naked backside. You yourself were also still comfy to Quinn, and were acting like an extra layer of soft protection while she sat, like a thin cushion wrapped around her lower body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStretching her arms, Quinn nonchalantly crossed her legs, her body tired of sitting in the same position for so long. Still conflicting with her years of habits, this time Quinn didn\u2019t think twice about the action. She merely took a sip from her water bottle, unaware to the fact that crossing her legs pushed her thighs into the front of her bottoms, thus shoving your crotch into direct contact with her own womanhood, doubling your embarrassment and humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Quinn caught sight of a girl struggling to properly do the butterfly stroke amidst the waves. Not in danger of drowning, but an excuse to get up and move. Taking her chance, Quinn leapt to her feet, jostling her hefty posterior, but before she moved, Quinn was briefly confused by how sweat-free her ass felt. It was normally a factory of swampiness in the intense heat of the sun. Shrugging, Quinn climbed down the ladder, oblivious to the truth that it was your own body that was absorbing all of her sweat, like a sponge. You were involuntarily taking it into yourself and off of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWading into the water, the coolness of the liquid hitting you was a splash of relief, but even that quick blessing faded soon. As Quinn submerged up to her stomach, you were entirely under the salty water, stuck there at Quinn\u2019s mercy. All around you was churning and bubbling noises, and freaky reverberations of laughter and chatter. The water flowed all through you and around you, the saltiness stinging your eyes that you couldn\u2019t close due to being crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn helped the girl for a solid fifteen minutes, and when she left the water, you were totally wet, and clung to Quinn tighter than before, like a second skin. You gripped her in a clenching hold, and you could so clearly feel every inch of her most sensitive areas touching your naked, swimsuit shaped body. Her cheeks jiggled as she walked back to the lifeguard tower and scaled the ladder, rubbing up and down against you so much it started to chafe your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she reached the top of the tower, Quinn was floored to find herself nearly totally dry, from the waist down, despite having just left the ocean. Once more, your body had acted like a sponge, soaking up all the water droplets from Quinn\u2019s flesh into your own pores, just like a good little swimsuit. Quinn grimaced as she spared a sympathetic glimpse at you before sitting, but even she couldn\u2019t fight that feeling of how great you were as a pair of bikini bottoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the day went, before finally coming to a close hours later. You suffered, and through your own suffering, you eased Quinn\u2019s. By the time your shift ended, and Quinn strolled off to the changing room, you just wanted it all to be over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a pair of bottoms sucked.</span></div></div>",

They tossed their wet uniforms in a pile, said their goodbyes to Quinn and each other, and strolled out of the changing room. Finally alone, Quinn hastily pulled you away from her ass and wiggled you down her long legs, stepping out of your makeshift loops and freeing you for the first time in hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough far too mashed, flattened, and compressed to actually gulp in the fresh air, you still mentally sighed with relief as the cool AC of the changing room hit your face. Your vision was still a blurry mess, but you could just barely make out the disfigured image of Quinn staring down at you, something like worry and pity written all over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez, Hunter. This is a mess.\u201d Quinn sighed. \u201cI promise we\u2019ll end this as soon as possible. Morgan and Avery will help too.\u201d The black-haired giantess rubbed your face softly. \u201cIf it\u2019s any consolation, you really did help my day go better, being so comfy and absorbent.\u201d As soon as the words left her mouth, Quinn blushed and backtracked. \u201cUh\u2026never mind!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the door swung open, and Brigitte sauntered in, smiling broadly at Quinn. \u201cAh! There you are. Thought maybe you\u2019d left with the other girls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn shook her head, setting you down on the bench in front of her so she could begin pulling up her panties and shorts to wear home. \u201cI was about to. Same shift tomorrow, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte nodded. \u201cYeah, same shift. Maybe the left tower though? I\u2019ll have to look at coverages. Honestly, we could really use one more lifeguard on staff\u2026\u201d Your red-haired boss trailed off, and then glanced at you. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019ll take those.\u201d She stated simply, grabbing you casually off the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn paled, and her eyes widened. \u201cW-wait, Brigitte! That\u2019s Hunter, not just bikini bottoms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscular giantess folded her arms across her chest, inadvertently squeezing you into her firm breasts. \u201cYes, I suppose. Although technically, he\u2019s a Sanderson Beach uniform right now, not a tiny. His usage license dictates those rules.\u201d<br>\r\nQuinn\u2019s face grew devoid of emotion. \u201c\u2026what.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her credit, Brigitte looked a little sheepish. \u201cWhat I mean is, he legally isn\u2019t Hunter right now. He\u2019s Sanderson Beach property, and as such\u2026\u201d Brigitte trailed off and groaned. \u201cGod, I feel like the bad guy in all of this, but it\u2019s the law! He\u2019s property, and so he can\u2019t leave the beach. He stays here, Quinn!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a human being!\u201d Quinn cried, indignant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot according to his license!\u201d Brigitte retorted. \u201cWe don\u2019t allow our staff to take their uniforms home, and Hunter is no exception in his current form. I\u2019m sorry, Quinn, but that\u2019s the way it is. Until your replacement uniform comes in, or his license is revoked, the law is the law.\u201d With a sense of finality, Brigitte tossed you over her shoulder, causing you to fall onto the top of the pile of wet uniforms from the other lifeguards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn seethed, but finally took a deep breath, her expression flipping straight to the opposite. Sullenly, Quinn nodded, finished getting changed, and shuffled out of the changing room, but not before Brigitte patted her on the shoulder in a sympathetic motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlone in the locker room, Brigitte rubbed her temples. \u201cDamn\u2026you forgot how emotional that girl can be when she isn\u2019t acting all apathetic. I feel bad for her. Wish she\u2019d just get over this soon.\u201d Shrugging, Brigitte scooped you and the other uniforms up into her arms. \u201cAnyway, time for a good washing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalling back into her typically energetic, confident attitude, Brigitte crossed the changing room towards a washing machine in the back, popped open the lid, and tossed you and the other swimsuits inside. You began to panic at this unexpected turn of events, but there wasn\u2019t a thing you could do as Brigitte slammed the lid shut and started the wash cycle after pouring in some detergent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny small hope you held that the fabric dye and paints Natasha used would break apart in the washing machine were shattered within minutes. Your bonds held strong, and after an hour of spinning around and bashing into sopping wet clothes, the wash cycle ended. You were still a perfectly shaped pair of bikini bottoms, looking to all the world like a normal Sanderson Beach employee uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Brigitte didn\u2019t even spare you any special attention as she pulled you out, instead just bunching up all the clothes, carrying them right outside the changing room door, and hanging them up on a clothesline to catch the sun. She dug two sharp metal pinching pins into your eyes as she clipped you to the line, causing you to mentally scream out, but obviously make no sound. Brigitte just kept smiling until the whole line was filled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, your employer left, heading home for the night, and you were alone with nothing to do but sway in the breeze and try to ignore the sharp crushing pains from the clothespins. Once more you tried and failed to reform, the binding holding you in your bikini bottom shape. You vaguely recalled Natasha\u2019s words about how permanent her changes to you could be without special sealant, and as you eventually drifted off to sleep, you prayed to anyone who would listen that fate wouldn\u2019t keep you this way permanently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were awoken hours later by the feeling of the clothesline shaking up and down. Though your vision was still blurry, you could make out the other lifeguards as they giggled and gossiped while unpinning their suits all around you. Your blood ran cold, your mind spinning horrible nightmares in which a distracted giantess grabbed you instead of her proper suit, thus separating you from Quinn, your only hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, when a hand finally did grab your face, it was Quinn herself. You could just barely make out her grimacing face, and the sight of her lips mouthing the words \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019, before you were dropped to the ground and dragged up her legs. You physically and mentally braced yourself as best as you could in the last few seconds you had, and then Quinn hefted you up over her massive cheeks and snapped you into place around her shapely derriere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day was hardly eventful. You continued to experience endless crushing, smushing, and sweat baths as they day prior, and Quinn continued to feel quite comfortable physically, but internally she knew how awful this was for her. Quinn was also frustrated all day, as she\u2019d spent the past night working around the clock to undue your license, only to find that the cruel woman Isabella had thrown every possible legal barricade into Quinn\u2019s path to stall her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, the entire rest of the week went by uneventfully. Every day, Quinn would begrudgingly use and abuse you, forcing your services as a tiny-turned-bikini, and you would suffer as a result. Each night, Quinn would tear her hair out trying to remove the license only to make minimal progress. Her mind was becoming so consumed with the legal jargon battle with Isabella that she started to think of you less and less during the day, and therefore treat you less carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour own nights also followed a predictable pattern of being washed in the machine with the other suits each evening, and left to hang on the line overnight. Brigitte had long stopped referring to you as a person, and obviously none of the other employee\u2019s knew your true identity. That sort of treatment from everyone around you was soul-crushing, and you started to fall into a bit of a depression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, one morning, there was a shift in the norm. Brigitte herself grabbed you from the clothesline and carried you limply back to her office. You had no idea what was going on, but as your employer set you down on her desk, you caught a glimpse of a mail package beside you with a label that read \u2018replacement lifeguard suit\u2019. With a release of unbridled joy, you realized that Quinn\u2019s replacement was in, and your time as a bikini was over!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly picking up on your silent excitement, Brigitte leaned back in her chair and looked down at you. \u201cGuess your time\u2019s up, Hunter.\u201d Before she could say anything else, the door to her office swung open, and a girl ran in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked harried and out of breath, and in her early-to-mid-twenties. She was average height, and had bright, curly blonde hair and sky-blue eyes. Immediately noticeable to Brigitte though, were the girls abundant curves. Fairly stacked in the chest department, the girl was incredibly developed in her lower half, with a monstrous ass that rivalled Quinn, and equally thick thighs and wide hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026n-not late\u2026am I?\u201d The girl panted, out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte\u2019s eyes glinted with recognition. \u201cAh. You must be Angeline. Ready for your first day?\u201d Your boss looked over some papers in front of her. \u201cImpressive resume, I must say. Can\u2019t tell you how great it is to have another lifeguard on staff for our busiest days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline grinned adorably. \u201cThanks ma\u2019am! When do I get my uniform suit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ll\u2026\u201d Brigitte began, but then trailed off. After a moment, she swore under her breath. Impossibly, she was back to square one. Angeline\u2019s curvy figure would, in no way, fit into a normal uniform. The only employee swimsuit that would work would either be the replacement she had literally JUST gotten for Quinn, or\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte glanced down at you, and then back at Angeline. She bit her lip in contemplation, and you looked helplessly back up at her, having no idea what was going on but getting a horrible sinking feeling in your chest.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bridgette sighed, but didn\u2019t seem very remorseful. She was simply frustrated that she\u2019d need to wait on yet another large uniform being delivered. You were beginning to worry how casually she was treating you now that you had a usage license. Your main fear at the moment was that even now that Quinn\u2019s replacement uniform was here, that Bridgette would find another use for you and you\u2019d end up in an even worse situation until your license could be revoked, and you had no idea when that would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced down at you and grimaced, before looking back to the box containing the replacement uniform that had signalled your freedom before Angeline hand came in. You got a sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach, already knowing that you wouldn\u2019t be getting out of this mess for a while, you just hoped that she\u2019d give you back to Quinn so you could at least be acknowledged as a person before she put you on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to order in a custom uniform for you, I don\u2019t think a normal one would fit around your... assets,\u201d Bridgette once more looked up and down Angeline\u2019s curvy frame, before chastising herself quietly and flushing a slight pink in her cheeks. <br>\r\n\u201cOk boss, so what do I do in the meantime?\u201d Angeline smiled at Bridgette, eager to get started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridgette looked at both you and the replacement uniform once again, before muttering to herself<br>\r\n\u201cQuinn\u2019s not going to be happy about this,\u201d she whispered quietly enough that Angeline didn\u2019t hear it but you definitely did, and you started to panic, knowing what was coming next. Bridgette looked back to Angeline and smiled. <br>\r\n\u201cYou can use this in the meantime,\u201d before picking you up and tossing you to her. \u201cWear that along with one of your own bikini tops, and put a Sanderson Beach T-shirt over the top of it. I\u2019ll order you an actual uniform today, but I\u2019m not sure when it will arrive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem, boss,\u201d Angeline gave a small salute before giggling and getting up to go get changed. Her hands closed around you, bunching you up into a ball in her hand. With that she walked out of Bridgette\u2019s office, her hand holding you swinging from side to side, giving you a small amount of motion sickness. You started to panic, this new girl had no idea that you were a person and not just some random bikini bottom, anything could go wrong if she wasn\u2019t made aware of your sentience, and even if she was made aware you have no idea how she could react to the knowledge that you were a tiny guy with a usage license. She could decide to just steal you and keep you as her own bikini forever! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were caught up in a panic, Angeline began to walk towards the changing room. Exiting Bridgette\u2019s office, she actually passed by Quinn, who had been called to Bridgette\u2019s office as well. The bubbly new girl smiled at Quinn, who awkwardly whispered hello to her. Quinn rushed past the bubbly new girl, not comfortable with how energetic she was, but in doing so, completely missed that she was carrying you. You were completely unaware of this, balled up in her hand you couldn\u2019t see anything and Quinn\u2019s faint reply was too quiet for you to hear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline walked into the changing room before tossing you unceremoniously onto one of the available benches, after all, to her you were just a piece of fabric. You lay on the bench, unable to look away as Angeline began to strip, not that you would necessarily have done so even if you could look away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline\u2019s already impressive curves almost seemed to expand slightly as they were released from the confines of her clothing. <br>\r\nAngeline was, you would guess, around the same height as Quinn, and was no less  genetically blessed than your roommate. If anything her curves were slightly more impressive, looking slightly less soft than Quinn. Her years of working as a lifeguard have clearly sculpted her curves slightly while somehow not reducing their size, there was clearly muscle under her curves.  This was most prominent on the backside that she presented to you when she turned around to grab her bikini top from her bag.  Her rear seemed perfectly sculpted, not a single blemish across is smooth, tanned surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were distracted by Angeline\u2019s heavenly rear end, you failed to notice that she was now fully dressed apart from her bottoms, and her hand was now reaching for you. <br>\r\nAs you were brought to the floor and her legs were pushed through the holes of your swimsuit shaped body, a sensation you had grown sadly familiar with throughout the week with Quinn. As you skyrocketed up towards the twin globes hanging above you, you saw Quinn storm into the room with determination written all over her face towards Angeline, followed quickly by a distressed and irritated looking Bridgette. Obviously Bridgette had told Quinn where you were. As Angeline struggled to get you up past her thick thighs and ginormous ass, you saw Bridgette catch Quinn by the arm and the two women began a heated hushed exchange, before Angeline managed to pull you up over her ass with one final tug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t get to see how this new development played out, as you were tightly compressed into the quivering flesh of your new coworker. You couldn\u2019t even really hear anything, between the sound of Angeline\u2019s cheeks shifting with her slightest movements and the fact that your squashed ears must also be facing inwards towards her butt. The pressure was familiar, similar to every time Quinn wore you, and you knew that comfort would disappear as soon as Angeline started walking or even worse, sat down. <br>\r\nAfter a few moments there was no change to your situation, and you felt Angeline begin to walk, so you guess that Bridgette had managed to stop Quinn from confronting Angeline. You internally sigh, resigning yourself to spending yet another day as a swimsuit. <br>\r\nThe rest of the day passed by as any other day had done since your new job had started. The only difference was that the slight hint of cafe Quinn took with you was completely absent. You were subjected to crushing pressure every time your unaware tormentor sat down, which happened regularly, you guessed it was a quiet shift. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Angeline\u2019s shift ended, you felt the familiar relief from cool air of the changing room as she finally peeled you off herself. After adjusting to the light, you got to look around, noticing that the changing room was full of female lifeguards in various states of undress. Tearing your eyes away from them you noticed the familiar clothing bin that you would inevitably be deposited in when Angeline packed up her things and left. Standing next to the bin was Bridgette, who was saying goodbye to the lifeguards as they left. It was strange that Bridgette seemed to be overseeing the bin, almost as if she was trying to stop anyone from taking their swimsuits home with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Angeline packed up her things and got ready to leave. Passing by Bridgette as she dumps you in the clothing bin.<br>\r\n\u201cWow, gotta say Bridgette, that has got to be the comfiest bikini bottom I\u2019ve ever worn! It\u2019s so absorbent as well, even after a few dips in the water I was bone dry,\u201d Angeline\u2019s compliments made you feel good, but you checked yourself. You were a person, not a bikini! Angeline\u2019s face flushed a beer red for a moment. \u201cActually the last bottom I had that was that absorbent actually ended up being a tiny guy who ended up as my underwear by accident. I felt sooo bad when I found him but I gotta admit, he was the best underwear I ever had.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridgette\u2019s eyes went wide at Angeline almost catching on to your true nature. You were shocked as well. Angeline didn\u2019t seem to notice Bridgette\u2019s reaction and gave her a happy smile before saying goodbye. You didn\u2019t see her leave, but you did see Bridgette\u2019s face soften and her sigh with relief that Angeline hadn\u2019t worked out your true nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another few lifeguards left and dumped their swimsuits in the bin with you, you were partially buried in damp swimsuits, although thankfully your face was uncovered so you could still see. You saw Quinn approach and glance down into the bin. She could easily make you out, since all of the other swimsuits were one piece suits and you were only morphed into a pair of bottoms. She looked remorseful and angry that she couldn\u2019t help you without putting her job on the line.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it Quinn, after our conversation this morning I thought you would have finally understood the consequences of theft of company property. I\u2019m sorry that your friend\u2019s position right now upsets you but that\u2019s what he is right now, company property. So just put your swimsuit in with the others and go home, I\u2019ve ordered a replacement for Angeline\u2019s uniform and once it arrives we can turn your friend back, but not a minute sooner,\u201d Bridgette\u2019s voice was hushed, to avoid letting the other women in the room hear them. Bridgette\u2019s annoyance at Quinn\u2019s concern for you seemed to be overtaking her hesitation at using you as an object in a way that really concerned you. You started to fear that she would continue to view you as \u201ccompany property\u201d for a long while after Angeline\u2019s replacement swimsuit came in. Quinn gave you one last solemn glance before sighing and tossing her new swimsuit in with you, unintentionally burying you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laid there in the darkness, getting progressively more buried as more women left. After a long time you were once again put through the wash cycle you had grown accustomed to without so much as a glance from Bridgette, and you were once again hanged up to dry overnight. You spent the rest of your time awake contemplating how hopeless your situation was before finally passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the week passes by while you wait for Angeline\u2019s replacement uniform, what happens? <br>\r\n1) Angeline somehow figures out your true nature, but how will she react?<br>\r\n2) Angeline\u2019s uniform comes in, but does Bridgette find another use for you?<br>\r\n3) Quinn, frustrated by the hopelessness of her legal battle with Isabella, attempts to rescue you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On the third day of your newest humiliating predicament, Angeline actually showed up to Sanderson Beach earlier than Brigitte. You could hear her from what felt like a mile off, her melodic voice happily humming a cheery tune to match her bubbly attitude. Ironically, her happy-go-lucky humming sent shivers down your spine, as it simply confirmed you were about to experience another full day of torment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline was, from what muffled bits of conversation you picked up the past three days, a sweetheart and an angel. She was kind and compassionate, always willing to help anybody in need. Her constant upbeat energy could turn any frowns upside-down, and she had the skills as a competent lifeguard to back up her excited disposition. She\u2019d helped countless people the past few days, and saved one little girl who\u2019d waded out too deep to swim back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, from your perspective, it was hard to think about her as anything but the insanely curvy captor crushing you ceaselessly with her monumental booty. Spending eight hours a day with your face rammed into her dank ass crack, your body smushed by her weighty cheeks, and you poor form forced to absorb all of her sweat was taking its toll on you. Worse was how she was blissfully unaware of it all, and simply treated you like any other scrap of fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline stopped right before reaching for you, and glanced at the clock. Realizing she was earlier than intended, the curly-haired blonde blushed. \u201cOh, oops! Guess I have a bit of time!\u201d Grinning at her innocent mistake, Angeline skipped off to use the bathroom, leaving you to continue to hang out on the line amidst all the other lifeguard uniforms. You mentally breathed a sigh of relief, even though you knew it was only delaying the inevitable by a short while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later, and Brigitte herself finally arrived. As she did every morning, she walked to the line of freshly dried swimsuits and arranged them so they could easily be picked up by their respective owners. When she got to you, her usual smile faltered a bit, and she absentmindedly traced a finger along your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026I mean really?\u201d Your boss muttered. \u201cWhy you\u2019d get a usage license if you didn\u2019t want this to happen? I really think Quinn is in the wrong about all of this.\u201d Brigitte ran a hand through her fiery red hair. \u201cHow could a tiny like you ACCIDENTALLY get a usage license?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA tiny?\u201d Said a soft voice from behind Brigitte.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte let out a startled cry and whipped around to find Angeline standing at the exit of the bathroom, having just finished. Her expression was one of utter confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline\u2019s frown deepened. \u201cWhy did you call my bikini bottoms \u2018a tiny\u2019? What did that mean, boss?\u201d The perky blonde asked, eyes wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte swore under her breath, mind furiously trying to think of a valid excuse she could use to save face. Finally, the pieces clicked in her mind, and she smiled reassuringly at her newest employee. Quinn would absolutely kill her for what she was about to do, but Brigitte would deal with that later. Besides, she was genuinely beginning to believe her version was the truth anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s a bit complicated.\u201d Brigitte looked around conspiratorially, then winked at Angeline. \u201cCan you keep a secret, Angeline?\u201d<br>\r\nAngeline snapped to attention, and nodded eagerly. \u201cOf course, boss! Anything!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. Basically, I hired a new employee a little while ago. His name is\u2026\u201d Brigitte paused, genuinely forgetting your name for a second. It finally came to her. \u201c\u2026Hunter! Cute little thing, you know how they are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline grinned from ear-to-ear. \u201cOh yes, tinies are just so adorable!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh. Anyway, just a bit after he joined, we had a shortage of suitable swimsuit uniforms for our normal sized lifeguards to wear. Wanting to show he was as eager and willing as any other employee, Hunter bravely volunteered to let himself be turned into a replacement bikini bottom until our shipment of new uniforms arrives.\u201d Brigitte explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was, of course, completely fabricating the reasoning behind this whole mess. Brigitte was tactically leaving out any details about your forged usage license, or that fact that you\u2019d essentially been forced into being a bikini bottom replacement against your will. The way she was conveying the story, all of this was on you. Of course, flattened and morphed as you were, you could do nothing to defend yourself, and could merely flutter in the wind while strung up on the clothesline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline gasped. \u201cSo\u2026wait! That means that the bikini bottom I\u2019ve been wearing is\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep. A tiny.\u201d Brigitte nodded. \u201cLittle Hunter himself. And, you gotta admit, he makes a damn good bikini, doesn\u2019t it? You pretty much said so yourself the other day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline\u2019s cheeks flushed pink, and she bashfully smiled at the ground. \u201cI-I guess I did s-say that\u2026huh?\u201d Angeline coughed and fought to subdue her rising embarrassment. \u201cB-but why did he agree to this, and how long does he need to stay like this? Also, why am I the one wearing him instead of someone else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte smiled congenially. \u201cAll valid questions. See, little Hunter, the brave trooper that he is, volunteered his body\u2019s unique squishy properties to turn into the perfect bikini bottoms that could fit any of our lifeguards as we needed him. He was even selfless enough to tell us, before he was molded into a bikini of course, that he would stay in that shape for as long as we need him to, even if it took a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s so considerate of him! Wow!\u201d Angeline gushed, looking over at you with newfound admiration. Meanwhile, your levels of fear and panic were only rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA truly sneaky thought crept into Brigitte\u2019s mind, and she smiled warmly at the younger girl as she leaned in close. \u201cNow, this part is embarrassing for him, and I\u2019m telling you in complete confidence that you won\u2019t spill his big secret to a single person. Okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline nodded and motioned with her hand the act of zipping her lips and throwing away the key. Brigitte laughed at the exuberant girl\u2019s show of trust, and then continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHunter confided in me that he actually really likes being used as an object. He enjoys being squashed and molded into different things, and he loves it above all when the curviest and most beautiful girls are the ones making use of him. It makes him feel loved and fulfilled. Every single squish is like a loving embrace for his entire being.\u201d Brigitte paused to prepare the metaphorical finishing blow. \u201cHe told me what kinds of girls are \u2018his type\u2019, and the moment I saw you walk into my office, I knew you were his type. That\u2019s why I chose you to wear him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline\u2019s face exploded into emotion as Brigitte finished her extremely fabricated tale. Unfortunately, the blonde girl had no reason to doubt her boss, and bought each word utterly. Angeline\u2019s blush blossomed in her cheeks, her eyes sparkled with joy, and her sensual lips curled into a lovely smile. She was the vision of an angel to all but you, who could only see her now as nightmare incarnate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hardly believe how devious Brigitte had just been in manipulating Angeline to buy into her lies, and there wasn\u2019t a thing you could do now to stop Angeline from believing in Brigitte. You had thought it was bad before when Angeline was unaware of her comfy bikini\u2019s true nature, but now that she both knew you were a molded tiny AND incorrectly believed you to be someone who wanted to be squished and used, there was no telling how she\u2019d act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatting Angeline on the shoulder, Brigitte moved to walk away, but paused for a final word. \u201cTake everything I\u2019ve said as you will, Angeline. And remember, it\u2019s all a secret, so don\u2019t speak  a word of it to anyone.\u201d Brigitte grinned mischievously. \u201cI only told you because I know that your Hunter\u2019s type. I bet, even though he can\u2019t talk right now, he\u2019s on cloud nine to be worn by you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline, without taking her radiant eyes off of you, replied to Brigitte. \u201cTh-thanks, boss.\u201d Angeline then reached out to pluck you from the clothesline and take you back to the locker room. Sensing she\u2019d accomplished what she set out to do, Brigitte left Angeline to it, and walked back to her office, supremely satisfied with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte was far from a cruel person, but she was an extraordinarily practical one. The simple matter was, your usage license had stripped your human rights away, and it was potentially illegal to NOT treat you like an item. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte was, frankly, disgusted by the nature of the license and anyone who would sign up for one. From her rather limited knowledge on the subject, she believed it to be an ordeal to even apply for a usage license. Thus, she found it impossible to believe you\u2019d stumbled into possessing one on accident. Therefore, in her mind, the only sensible reasoning was that Quinn was the one wrong about all of this, and you really did want to be used. As far as Brigitte was concerned now, she\u2019d done you a favor by setting you up with Angeline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Angeline was riding a different kind of euphoric high. She\u2019d been floored to find out that her perfectly absorbent bikini bottom was an actually tiny, but her heart had skipped a beat hearing that the tiny in question had volunteered for her service willingly. Not only that, but the little cutie actually liked being squished and used by someone beautiful. It filled Angeline\u2019s heart with joy to hear the lengths the tiny cutie had gone to show his true feelings, and she was now doubled excited to put him on again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, on the other hand, realized with horror just how much crazier this situation was going to spiral now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Angeline plucked you off of the clothes line, biting her lip in anticipation of wearing you now that she knew you were a tiny guy, and was under the impression that you enjoyed it.<br>\r\nShe walked over to one of the empty benches before dropping you onto the wooden surface. You glanced around, seeing that the locker room was completely empty, Angeline had clearly arrived before anyone else, meaning she would have no interruptions, a fact that you could see she was extremely happy with.<br>\r\nAngeline stood above you, leaning forward to look down at you, which gave you a close up view of her seemingly bottomless cleavage, which was on full display in her low cut top. She was still blushing, but you could see a growing confidence begin to spread across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-So... cutie, Brigitte tells me you like curvy girls, well... I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get a girl much curvier than me,\u201d she gave you a seductive smirk, knowing that you were probably staring at her cleavage. \u201cThe only other girl who comes close is Quinn, but she seems pretty mean, I think you\u2019d be better sticking with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Angeline giggled down at you you couldn\u2019t help but think that you would much rather be with Quinn, since she wouldn\u2019t be making any incorrect assumptions about your intentions. You couldn\u2019t voice any of these concerns however, as Angeline stood back up and began to turn around. Her slow turn gradually brought her titanic rear end, packed into a tight pair of jeans, into view. This was a sight that, had you not spent the last two days wrapped around that ass, you would have found enthralling. However, knowing that those cheeks were capable of utterly obliterating your body, so you felt a confusing mixture of arousal and fear. Angeline was, without a doubt, one of the hottest women you had ever seen, and she seemed to be an incredibly nice person as well, someone who you could have seen yourself considering dating, but thanks to Brigitte\u2019s lies to her, you highly doubted you would ever view Angeline without fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline began to slowly pull down her jeans, through a mixture of trying to be seductive and genuinely struggling to get them down past her wide hips. Each passing second unveiled more and more of the surface of her slightly tanned, perfectly sculpted ass, which expanded outwards as it was freed from the contents of her jeans. You had been up close and personal with Angeline\u2019s backside for the past two days, but it\u2019s sheer size still staggered you. <br>\r\nAfter getting her jeans past her thighs, Angeline turned back to look over her shoulder at you.<br>\r\n\u201cNow that I know you\u2019re actually a tiny guy, and that you like me smushing you with my big butt, I\u2019ll definitely not be holding back. You\u2019ll get all the ass you could ever want,\u201d Angeline slapped her ass, causing it to wobble slightly. She immediately blushed again and started to giggle uncontrollably, obviously she wasn\u2019t hugely confident in the art of seduction. A fact which you found insane considering, with her beauty and curves, she could literally have any man she wanted. \u201cBut seriously Hunter, don\u2019t worry about being embarrassed, no one else knows about you, so it can be our little secret. I wouldn\u2019t want any jealous girls getting any ideas about using my itty bitty boytoy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found it incredibly difficult to be angry at Angeline in this situation, it wasn\u2019t her fault. You were furious with Brigitte for lying, furious at the two women who put you in this situation, but mostly you were furious at yourself for getting yourself into this situation. If you had just left that Rachel woman alone, or went to get another lifeguard to help you before confronting her, none of this would have happened. You would have met Angeline as an equal as opposed to being crushed under the rear of this kindhearted, oblivious woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were lamenting over your situation, Angeline had pulled her jeans down her shapely thighs and legs, stepping out of them before bending over. You looked up to see her cheeks spread, showing her poor battered thong, crammed into her crack. You never thought your life would progress to the point where you actually felt empathy for a scrap of cloth, but seeing the poor, battered piece of fabric being pulled from between your coworkers buns you definitely felt a twinge of empathy.<br>\r\nHer bottom half now fully nude, Angeline gently lifted you down between her feet before slipping them through your holes.<br>\r\nAs she dragged you up her legs, she stopped just below the base of her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Hunter, since I know you love every squish I definitely won\u2019t hold back on you. You\u2019ve done such a good job supporting me the last few days that I want to return the favour. After all, you did ask Brigitte for a curvy woman, with an ass this big I\u2019m rough on my clothes whether I want to be or not,\u201d with that Angeline tugged you upwards into the embrace of her meaty ass. She seemed to pull you tighter against her skin than you normally had been, but your bikini form was perfectly made to hug her hips so you didn\u2019t get an up close experience with the inside of her crack quite yet. The dark canyon of her crack was centimetres from your face, and you could smell the faint, earthy scent of sweat and everything else that goes along with an ass, masked for now by her minty shower gel, but you knew that wouldn\u2019t last long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline let out a satisfied sigh, loving the feeling of you embracing her. Every second that passed, she grew more infatuated with you. Not just with how good you felt hugging her hips, but also her perspective of you as an incredibly selfless person, based on Brigitte\u2019s lies. She rubbed her backside, and you, forcing you into the embrace of her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting the rest of her uniform on, Angeline practically skipped to her post for the day, one of the towers at the edge of the beach. It was a fairly secluded location that didn\u2019t get as busy as some of the other areas of the beach. Angeline happily noted that she\u2019d likely have plenty of privacy here at the top of the tower with you.<br>\r\nYou meanwhile had been enjoying the vaguely comfortable sensation of supporting Angeline as she walked. Your body was still painfully pulled and stretched by her large, toned buns as she walked, but it was a vacation in comparison to the experience of her wearing you while sitting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline climbed the ladder to the top of the tower. Upon reaching the top she looked back at you and rubbed your body lovingly.<br>\r\n\u201cHere comes the fun part cutie, I promise I\u2019ll try to give you all the ass you want. Hope you enjoy it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mentally screamed out when you felt gravity take over as Angeline dropped hard onto her chair. You were instantly flattened under the full weight of Angeline, all of it centred on her hefty rear. It was still fairly early, so the plastic chair hadn\u2019t absorbed much heat from the sun yet, and therefore didn\u2019t burn you, a fact that barely registered to you as you were smushed underneath Angeline. Letting out a small giggle, Angeline began roughly shifting her weight in her chair, smearing you left and right underneath her. <br>\r\nAngeline was loving this, she was getting to do her favourite job in the whole world, while also helping out a cute little man who also happened to be the most comfortable bikini bottom she had ever worn. You were barely able to form any coherent thoughts, between the heat, pressure and growing pools of sweat being forced onto your body by Angeline\u2019s rough treatment of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s that for you little guy, enough ass for you? I\u2019m sooo glad that Brigitte told me about you, it means I can fulfil every desire you have,\u201d you couldn\u2019t see it, but Angeline began to blush before what she said next. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been looking for a tiny little boyfriend for a while. Maybe you could help me out with that once my uniform arrives? Since we\u2019re already so well acquainted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this you would have blushed as well, if it wasn\u2019t for the paint covering your body. Angeline was incredibly attractive and seemed really nice, but Brigitte\u2019s deception made you concerned how she would treat you if you dated her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully you would be freed soon, so you could correct Angeline\u2019s impression of you before she was fully convinced this was what you wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Angeline\u2019s replacement uniform arrives in the next few days, but Brigitte finds another use for you.<br>\r\n2) Angeline\u2019s replacement uniform arrives in the next few days, and now that you were back your normal self for a while, Angeline asks you on a date.<br>\r\n3) Quinn finds out that Angeline know\u2019s you are a tiny guy and confronts her. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You spent another three days serving as Angeline\u2019s bikini bottom. Her \u201cteasing\u201d of you seemed to become more intense with each passing day, along with her infatuation with you. Angeline seemed to be painting a picture of you in her head without having ever actually met you, one which would likely cause problems for you in the future.<br>\r\nBrigitte hadn\u2019t spoken to you since her slip up with Angeline, but the routine stayed the same. She would throw you in the washer with the other uniforms every night and pluck you off of the clothing line every morning. Despite her not speaking to you she never failed to give you a condescending look. Unbeknownst to you her disgust at the idea of the usage license and her assumptions about your ownership of one was warping her perception of you to the point where she was beginning to dislike you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw Quinn once, when she had arrived before Angeline and was picking up her uniform. She looked at you remorsefully, before her conversations with Brigitte suppressed her concern for you, and she left you hanging on the line, mouthing \u201csorry\u201d as she turned to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the fourth day since her last acknowledgement of you, Brigitte grabbed you from the clothes line and brought you to her office, where you saw a familiar looking box which, you knew based on past experiences, would contain Angeline\u2019s replacement uniform. Relief swelled throughout you as you realised your tenure as a bikini bottom would be coming to an end! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping you nonchalantly on her desk, Brigitte circled around the desk before plopping down on her chair with a thud. She glanced at you, looking at you more like a piece of property than a person. <br>\r\n\u201cSooo....,\u201d she paused for a moment. \u201cWait, shit what was your name again? Eh, guess it doesn\u2019t really matter that much.\u201d <br>\r\nAs she shrugged her shoulders at herself forgetting your name, you were shocked. It seemed during your two week stint as underwear, Brigitte\u2019s nonchalance about using you had changed to complete apathy and disregard for you. You couldn\u2019t voice these concerns however, so Brigitte continued.<br>\r\n\u201cI know that I told Quinn I\u2019d let you turn back into a tiny guy after you weren\u2019t needed to replace any uniforms, but you\u2019re more useful in this form than you would be as a lifeguard. Plus I couldn\u2019t find any solvent for the dye that Natasha put on you and I\u2019ve not gotten around to ordering any in yet...\u201d Brigitte trailed off before shrugging her shoulders again. \u201cSo I guess the best use for you in bikini form right now is just to go in the lost and found as a spare bikini. Lotta girls come to this beach and break or lose their swimsuits, so you can fill in as a spare when that happens, win-win right? You keep being useful to Sanderson Beach, and you get to keep fulfilling whatever perverted desire drove you to get that usage license in the first place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe condescending tone Brigitte was speaking to you with was driving you deeper into a hopelessness that had been steadily growing since you had gotten this license forced on you. If your boss was treating you like this, how would your family start to view you? You felt that even if you did get rid of your usage license, which seemed like a long shot when you weren\u2019t even in a position to argue your case and were relying on your roommates to do it for you, the damage to you image in the eyes of everyone around you would last even longer than that. That notary and her friend had successfully ruined your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte looked up through her open door to see Angeline walking towards her office, Brigitte had sent her a text about picking up her new uniform. Seeing her newest employee coming, and without sparing another glance at you, Brigitte slid you off her desk and into one of its open drawers, before sliding it closed and encasing you in darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack up in the world of real people, Angeline had just happily strolled into Brigitte\u2019s office, excited to spend another day with her new little boytoy. The door was only half open, so the bubbly girl happily bumped it open with her wide hips, giggling as she did it. <br>\r\n\u201cHey boss, you wanted to see me?\u201d Angeline plopped down on one of the seats in front of Brigitte\u2019s desk, noting how much she was starting to miss the feeling of her cute little man cushioning her buttocks. Shaking that feeling by acknowledging that you would be back hugging her hips soon enough, she focused on her boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, yeah, hey Angeline,\u201d Brigitte was still flustered by how exuberant, cute and, quite frankly, attractive Angeline was. She was in a committed relationship but she was only human, and Angeline\u2019s curves were just too prominent to ignore. \u201cYour new uniform arrived this morning, so now you can match the rest of our staff. Your previous uniform worked really well, but now you can look like a real Sanderson Beach lifeguard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline\u2019s good mood was dampened slightly upon hearing that she wouldn\u2019t be able to enjoy wearing you, but she brightened up when she realised that if you weren\u2019t serving as underwear then she\u2019d actually be able to meet you! She began to blush when she thought about all the stuff she\u2019d be able to do with you once you officially became her tiny little boyfriend. <br>\r\n\u201cS-so does that mean cute little Hunter won\u2019t need to be a bikini bottom anymore?\u201d Angeline looked to Brigitte expectantly. Brigitte raised her eyebrow in confusion for a moment.<br>\r\n\u201cWho?... Oh, yeah, Hunter...\u201d Brigitte trailed off, trying to come up with an excuse for Angeline to explain your new position. \u201cHe... uh, decided that he wanted to stay as a bikini bottom for a while. Obviously I explained to him that you had a uniform now, so he wouldn\u2019t be needed to fill that role, and well the little guy just looked so sad that he wouldn\u2019t be able to help out anymore.\u201d<br>\r\nBrigitte faked feeling sorry for you, convincingly enough that Angeline felt incredibly sorry for you. <br>\r\nClearly Angeline wasn\u2019t very smart, since she fell for this obvious lie. For one thing you wouldn\u2019t be able to talk to Brigitte to convey this intention to her considering you were still stuck as a bikini bottom!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw the poor little thing! Where is he? I just know I can make him feel better,\u201d Angeline, ever one to help out people in need, was desperate to comfort you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, since he was so eager to keep helping, I suggested that he act as a spare bikini bottom for anyone who has lost theirs. The little dude was ecstatic. So for the foreseeable future that\u2019s where he\u2019ll be,\u201d Brigitte finished her speech with a reassuring smile towards Angeline, but she could see that the bubbly, excitable girl deflate slightly upon hearing your new job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh... that\u2019s great I guess, I\u2019m glad the little cutie will be able to keep helping out,\u201d Angeline was crestfallen, she was hoping once her uniform had arrived she would be able to actually get to know the cute little man who had started consuming her thoughts at night as well as supporting her during the day. The news that Brigitte had delivered gave Angeline a feeling similar to being rejected by a crush. However, Angeline was not one to give up easily, and if she wasn\u2019t going to be able to woo you the traditional way, she\u2019d have to improvise.<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want, I can look after the lost and found stuff. It would give you time to focus on more important things,\u201d if Angeline wasn\u2019t getting to wear you, she sure as hell wanted to be around you as much as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte was slightly taken aback by Angeline\u2019s offer, but smiled.<br>\r\n\u201cSure, sounds good to me. Here, make sure this gets to its proper place,\u201d Brigitte reached into her drawer and tossed you at Angeline, who fumbled slightly to catch you. \u201cAnd make sure it stays in lost and found, it\u2019s still company property, so if it goes missing it wouldn\u2019t reflect great on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline deposited you in the small cardboard box labelled \u201clost and found\u201d that was located in the large storage shed outside of the staff building. She looked down at you with a dejected, jealous look on her face.<br>\r\n\u201cListen Hunter, I know you like to help people out, but I thought we had something going here! Did I do something wrong? Was I not giving you enough smothering as you would have liked?\u201d Angeline looked genuinely upset at your \u201crejection\u201d of her, but that look was swiftly replaced with a determined smile in your direction. \u201cDon\u2019t worry though, a few days of being worn by other women will hopefully make you realise what you\u2019re missing out on and you\u2019ll come back to me when you\u2019re ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished talking to you, she was getting ready to put the box away when a woman\u2019s voice called out.<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me. Is this where I can borrow a replacement bikini bottom? Mines sorta snapped.\u201d <br>\r\nAngeline turned and greeted the new woman, you got a good look at her as she walked into your field of view. She was incredibly tanned, with auburn hair and a beautiful face. However, your eyes were drawn to her waist, which was barely covered by a small beach towel.<br>\r\nSeeing her wide hips, along with how quickly you were going to be used again after being forced into this new job by Brigitte, gave you a bad feeling for how the next few weeks would go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline handed you to the new girl while suppressing a jealous glare. Seeing this immensely attractive girl carry you off made her fear you would forget about her rather quickly, and she began brainstorming ways to win you back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) You spend a considerable amount of time in lost and found, but your roommates manage to make some headway with removing your license. You get some freedom, but Isabella starts work on screwing you over in another way.<br>\r\n2) After a few weeks, Brigitte\u2019s uniform gets damaged, so she has Natasha remodel you to fit her as a bikini bottom.<br>\r\n3) One of the beachgoers takes you home with them (either accidentally or on purpose)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You awoke to the sight of Avery\u2019s enormous face staring down at you. She had a look of genuine concern on her face which was replaced with her usual exuberance once she saw you wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhmygosh you\u2019re awake!\u201d She squealed, the volume of her voice in your ear just as you woke up caused you to wince. \u201cYou were out for a whole half hour. I was starting to think you weren\u2019t going to wake up, cutie.\u201d She feigned concern in her usual flirty manner, pouting her lip seductively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat up on the couch with Avery sitting beside you, you noticed that Morgan and Quinn were both missing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery saw you looking around for them and spoke up, \u201cThey both had to go to work, Morgan was almost ready to call in sick but I convinced her to go, told her that I\u2019d be here for another hour before I had to go to work anyway, so we\u2019ve got half an hour together before I need to go to work. I figured after seeing the usage license you\u2019d want some time alone to think, Quinn said she\u2019d tell your manager you were sick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe usage license! It had totally slipped your mind for a brief blissful moment. Those two girls, Rachel and Isabella, had basically have any girl the opportunity to ruin your life. Luckily your roommates seemed to not be the types to abuse you at this vulnerable time, but there were plenty of women out there who would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing your concern at being reminded of this, Avery tried to reassure you, \u201cDon\u2019t worry Hunter, the three of us won\u2019t let anyone find out about this. We won\u2019t let any mean women use you,\u201d you already knew that your roommates would help you through this, but hearing Avery say it reassured you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlthough I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t mind me using you, cutie. I could use a new thong,\u201d Avery\u2019s voice lowered to a seductive whisper, but when she saw your horrified expression at what she said she explained, \u201cnonono I don\u2019t mean permanently! I need a new one for a shoot at work.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stammering was cut short by a knock at the door. Both of you looked towards the door as paranoia began to set over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone has to have found out about the usage license and came to use me!\u201d panicked thoughts filled your mind as Avery picked you up and walked towards the door. These thoughts were completely irrational of course, how could anyone have already found out about the usage license? You only got it half an hour ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the frosted glass of the door you could see the outline of a woman, her only features you could make out through the glass was her red hair. Avery opened the door to reveal the familiar beaming face of your Aunt Norah. She was confused seeing a strange woman answer the door but her eyes quickly drifted to Avery\u2019s hand, her eyes lightly up seeing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Hunter! I was in the area and thought I\u2019d stop by to see your new place, this must be one of your roommates?\u201d She looks back up towards Avery. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Hunter\u2019s Aunt, Norah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they introduced themselves to each other, you noticed that Norah had her hair tied back in a ponytail and was wearing a tank top and compression shorts that hugged her curves tightly along with a pair of running shoes. She was also sweating a lot so you guessed that she probably ran here. Her clothes left her midsection exposed, and as you stared at her lean stomach you were reminded of that Christmas you spend inside it sloshing around with all the food and drink she had that day, not an experience you ever wanted to repeat if you could help it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were reminiscing about the various torments you suffered at the hands, or rather the assets, of your aunt, Avery and Norah finished their introductions and moved back to the living room. The sudden movement jerked your attention back to your current situation as the sudden movement almost threw you from Avery\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women sat down on the couch and Avery placed you down on the coffee table before they went back to their conversation. As Avery described herself and both Morgan and Quinn. Five minutes of this conversation passed and you realised that they hadn\u2019t acknowledged you since Avery placed you on the table. You knew your Aunt was forgetful but you were beginning to realise just how forgetful Avery was as well. This was a bad combination of people to be alone with at your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approached the table edge to try and get their attention when you heard Norah say, \u201cAvery, do you mind if I take my shoes off? I ran here and my feet are killing me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery said she didn\u2019t mind and without breaking eye contact, Norah slipped her running shoes off with her feet and propped her feet up on the table, right where you were standing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw her feet rapidly descending towards you and it reminded you of every other time you had gotten trapped under Norah\u2019s feet when she wasn\u2019t looking. This time was different however, you managed to jump out of the way of her socked feet, drenched in sweat, just before they buried you under them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you leapt out of the way you let out a small yelp that must have grabbed their attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sorry Hunter, didn\u2019t see you there. You should be more careful next time, don\u2019t want to get buried under my big smelly feet,\u201d she said as she wiggles her toes teasingly. Norah lecturing you on being careful was a bit ironic since she usually squashes you from her carelessness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation continues for another 20 minutes, with you actually being included in the conversation this time. As it continued you began to wonder why exactly your Aunt Norah was here, your apartment was almost on the other side of town from where she lived, and she ran here. Was this a new jogging route she was trying out? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOMG I\u2019m going to be late!\u201d Avery shrieked after glancing at the clock. \u201cI gotta go guys! Norah, I\u2019m sure you can let yourself out. Hunter, I hope you enjoy your time alone, don\u2019t worry too much about the general usage license, we\u2019ll figure it out tomorrow. Bye, cutie,\u201d she said with a wink and rushed out the door, slamming it closed behind her in her rush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw a glint if recognition in Norah\u2019s eyes at the mention of the usage license that worried you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, that reminds me Hunter. I got a letter telling me about that general usage license you applied for, I think the whole family gets one,\u201d your heart sank hearing this. Now your whole family will think you are fine to be used by them whenever they want, what else would they think when in their mind you applied for the usage license?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway that\u2019s why I\u2019m here, since you got that you\u2019d be perfect for this huge favour I need. I know how helpful you\u2019ve been for me in the past and I guess that you got the usage license so you could be even more helpful? I know how much of a sweetie you are so I wasn\u2019t surprised,\u201d she looked down at you with that pleading expression you could never refuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour got a sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach, whenever Norah asked you for a favour it usually didn\u2019t end well for you. If it was a job she was going to ask you to fill in it would be unpleasant, especially considering you have a general usage license, so doing work for strangers had a high chance of them deciding to just turn you into clothing and keeping you. Which was something you wanted to avoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAunt Norah, you know I\u2019d like to help you out if I can, but...\u201d you started to refuse to help her before she interrupted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool, thank you so much! You\u2019re such a sweetheart. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re happy to help because I really didn\u2019t know what I was going to do about...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) ...My thong, it snapped during my run and I need a replacement. In fact a lot of my underwear has been breaking lately, so I\u2019d need you to act as my underwear till I can get a replacement.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) ... This job listing for a tiny with a general usage license. Good thing you applied for one huh? It\u2019s strange though, this particular one has requested like 3 little guys in the last few weeks, guess they keep getting busier?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) ... this letter I got from the C.T.C, it was from the person who notarised it. Said she needed your signature or something and to bring you to her office. I\u2019ve been needing some paperwork done myself so I thought this would be a good way to get ahead of the long wait times.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201c...My thong, it snapped during my run and I need a replacement. In fact a lot of my underwear has been breaking lately, so I\u2019d need you to act as my underwear till I can get a replacement,\u201d you opened your mouth to tell her that you didn\u2019t really want to act as her thong, but she continued talking before you could get a word in. <br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s because my underwear is so tight usually, I find it comfier that way, but...\u201d she shifted uncomfortably, embarrassed, obviously that wasn\u2019t the only reason, before whispering. \u201c<i>I also have put on a bit of weight</i>.\u201d<br>\r\nYou\u2019d have thought it was kind of funny that your aunt, who was probably one of the biggest exercise freaks you know, was so worried about putting on a little weight if she wasn\u2019t also talking about using you to replace her broken underwear. She genuinely looked embarrassed about it and it made you feel kind of sorry for her, but that brief moment of pity cost you a chance to clear things up with her.<br>\r\n\u201cThe problem is it all seems to be going to my hips, and I just can\u2019t seem to get rid of it. All of my underwear is way too small for me now so it just snaps when I go on a run. I can\u2019t get as far as I\u2019d like with them snapping constantly, so I can\u2019t lose the weight. So when I got the letter saying that you had got a general usage license I thought it was perfect timing. I get super stretchy underwear that\u2019ll fit me no matter how many pounds I pack on until I get rid of it all, and you get to use that usage license you applied for! Win-win am I right. You\u2019ve always been such a helpful little guy I\u2019m surprised it\u2019s taken you this long to decide to get a usage license,\u201d as Norah finished her speech with a warm, proud smile you were left flabbergasted at her air-headedness, if her underwear didn\u2019t fit her anymore why couldn\u2019t she just but new underwear that would! Where was the need to put you through the torture of filling out that role when there was such a simple solution! Could she not see that buying new underwear was a possibility? Also was this really how she saw all the times you accidentally ended up as her sweat rag or insole, as you being helpful? Her ditzy brain must have misremembered most of those times because most of the time it was because of a mean spirited prank from your sister. Knowing how stubborn your aunt could be it will likely be incredibly difficult to convince her otherwise.<br>\r\n\u201cAunt Norah, you know I\u2019d help you in any way I can, but,\u201d you began to try and explain the situation, trying to stop this before it escalated<br>\r\n\u201cI know you would, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re the best nephew I could ask for! Anyway Hunter, I need to get back to my run, so I\u2019ll just mould your into my thong now so you can get started helping me lose weight,\u201d with that she slapped her palm down onto the table, flattening you before you could even get a full sentence out. <br>\r\nAs Norah began to stretch your limbs out you wondered to yourself how you even managed to get into these situations most of the time. If you had just minded your own business with those two girls on the beach or had been able to tell Norah that you didn\u2019t want to be her thong none of this would be happening right now. You didn\u2019t even see the point in struggling against Norah stretching your limbs out and tying them together to form straps for your new thong form because she\u2019d probably interpret it in some way that would make your situation worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring your time contemplating how awful your luck seemed to be regarding these situations Norah had quickly turned you into a serviceable thong. Your arms and legs were tied to each other to forms the straps, while your body made up the front and back of the thong. You realised with a frustrated sigh that Norah had formed you in a way that your face was facing inwards on the back of the thong, so it would be crammed between her ass cheeks, probably without even realising she had done it.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Hunter, once we get you home I\u2019ll have some stuff that\u2019ll make you hold this shape a bit better. Ohhh maybe I can even paint you! Make you look good as a thong as well as functional!\u201d You began to panic even more, with Norah\u2019s forgetfulness if she did this she\u2019d be liable to forget that her new thong was actually you! <br>\r\nNorah carried you to the bathroom before setting you down on the counter. As Norah turned around to begin untying her shoes you tried your best to reform and break the bonds holding your limbs together, but you realised pretty quickly that it would take more time than you had. Giving up on that and instead deciding to focus your efforts on reforming your face so you could contact Norah and tell her to stop this, after spending the rest of her run being ground between her butt cheeks you weren\u2019t sure that you\u2019d be able to reform your face very easily so this may be your only chance. You looked over to Norah to see that she had gotten her shoes off, you\u2019d have to hurry. <br>\r\nAs you struggled to reform your face you were given pause when you saw Norah struggle to pull down her compression shorts past her hips. With one final tug she managed to get them down and took them off. You could see what she was talking about when she said she had gained weight. Her usually toned buns had taken on a much softer, jigglier quality, and they were much larger than you remembered them. It had been a while since you had last seen Norah but the amount of mass added on to her rear since then was a lot, it wasn\u2019t as large as Quinn or even your mother but for Norah it was large. You thought that it could maybe just be her age catching up with her a bit. If time wasn\u2019t of the essence and you had use of your mouth you\u2019d have told her that she looked fine, but that wasn\u2019t the priority now, you had to reform your face and stop this. Then you saw the straps of her previous thong pathetically fall away from her sides, snapped in half, but her buttocks held the piece between them in place, preventing it from falling to the floor.<br>\r\nYou had made quite a bit of effort, both your eyes and nose had reformed, and your mouth was getting close, when Norah looked over her shoulder at you.<br>\r\n\u201cYou see the problem Hunter? How did this happen?\u201d She grabbed a handful of her cheek, the slight parting of her buns allowing the thong to slip out from between them. \u201cHopefully now I\u2019ll have underwear that will last long enough. Let\u2019s try you on then.\u201d<br>\r\nAs she lifted you off the counter you redoubled your efforts, desperate to reform your mouth to end this. As she started to pull you up her legs towards her monolithic backside your arms got stuck around the base of her ass. Just as that happened you managed to reform your mouth.<br>\r\n\u201cNorah wait...,\u201d you were cut off as, with one final tug, Norah rocketed your face up between her cheeks. Your face was immersed in the swampy atmosphere of Norah\u2019s ass, still incredibly sweaty from her run. There was a sudden, crushing pressure on you as Norah clenched her cheeks to get a good feel of how you fit, crushing your face again and undoing your reforming with a simple movement. You could feel your arms and legs straining as they wrapped around her generous hips, but unfortunately for you, they held.<br>\r\n\u201cWow Hunter you feel great! Snug but you don\u2019t feel ready to snap like my previous thong,\u201d as she said this she looked at the poor piece of fabric that had been hugging her hips previously and grimaced. \u201cClearly you\u2019re made of tougher stuff, I think you\u2019re going to be perfect for helping me lose weight. Thank you again for helping me with this, you really are the best nephew I could ever ask for!\u201d<br>\r\nYou only heard part of this from your position between her and the layers of butt meat around you. You could only scream internally as she began to walk out of the apartment, her grinding cheeks mashing you and smearing what visible features you had left, if this kept up you would end up looking like a regular tan thong, and while in this form your general usage license made sure that\u2019s legally what you were, nothing but a thong. Norah stopped in the living room to leave a note for your roommates informing them that you were helping her with something and you\u2019d be back in a few weeks hopefully. With that done, Norah took off running down the street. <br>\r\nBut where was she going?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Her house, where she will turn you into a more serviceable thong.<br>\r\n2) Her house, but by the time she gets there she has forgotten that you are her thong!<br>\r\n3) To your mother, Helen\u2019s house. She\u2019s having dinner with your mom and sister, but will she mention you, or even remember you for that matter?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You weren't kidding when you remembered her house being on the other side of town, down in your sweaty prison your body was dutifully sucking up all of the ass sweat which, despite your mangled features, you could still taste. The jiggly mounds pummeled you thoroughly enough that you were delirious, an hour and a half later you almost wished that you had the ability to snap like those other thongs at least she'd have to take you off then. You didn't even think that she would remember you by the time she made it home, and that would be bad enough with you so mashed up, but even then you might have enough time of her not wearing you to reform. That hope however was not to pass, you felt some of the pressure release and a rush of cool air hit you, the fingers around your arms pulling you down saw you back at Norah's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great job Hunter! I had forgotten how absorbent you could be, and you don't even smell. For the next few weeks I bet I could even go to restaurants without having to worry about leaving sweat stains on the chairs. Good thing I remembered you, I wouldn't want to have to stretch you out again.\" She talked casually but excitedly, walking around her house with nothing below the waist. There was a little desk in one corner that she tossed you onto. \"Anyway, I promised you some stuff that would help you hold shape so you don't have to spend all that effort staying pulled out and here it is! Tada!\" She waved a can in front of your face with a label that said 'Full length' with a picture of a tiny man and then a picture of a bra and had some additional information that you couldn't read before she turned it away and sprayed you with it. It didn't sting or anything or even taste bad but for some reason you felt a bit tingly. \"I have to use this for my Clients sometimes so I always have a bit on hand, plus my laundry detergent has a solvent for it inside. Once I'm done with you I can just pop you in the washer and boom you're back to normal. Until then... what do you like better, Black? or Green?\" She held up two cans of a similar spray paint of the same brand name as the last thing. She seemed to be waiting for an answer but you were still taking in what she had said, she didn't plan on washing you until she was 'done' however long that took! You couldn't talk anyway and she seemed to realize it after a moment. \"Oh, right you're a thong duh, I'll just go with my favorite then.\" She shook the Green can and sprayed you with it, at first you figured that your vision would be obscured but it mostly just gave you a 'overlay' of green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waited for a moment before touching you making sure the paint was dry or soaked in, what a nightmare situation. Norah had not only basically removed your ability to get back in shape, but she also just made you look like any of her other Thongs. Only Norah knew exactly what you were, and if she did manage to loose the weight but forgot about you, you might be lost amongst her things. You were of course, unable to verbalize any of this, merely laying on the desk unmoving just like a real thong as Norah gripped you to put you back on. You barely even made a peep as she snapped you around her hips again. \"Ohh, Nice Hunter! You look exactly like my old Lucky Thong, well I guess not so lucky anymore since it snapped a while back. Oh but now you can fill that position... speaking of positions, it's about time for me to start my Yoga session.\" She chuckled to herself as she went to slip back into her compression shorts...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the compression shorts were stretched over Norah\u2019s hefty rear, your world was once again filled with the oppressive mass of her globular cheeks squeezing the life out of you. After enduring a one and a half hour run crammed into her ass, you would thought that you would be at least somewhat used to serving as your ditsy aunt\u2019s thong but between the oppressive heat, sweat and pressure of her swamp-like ass, you don\u2019t think you\u2019d ever be able to get used to it.<br>\r\nTrue to her word whatever Norah sprayed you with did make your time holding up her rear slightly easier, since your arms and legs weren\u2019t constantly trying to reform back to their normal length, they were only contracting to a length that made sure they fit snugly around her hips.<br>\r\n\u201cThere we go, that spray should help make your job a little easier and make you look super good on me!\u201d Your aunt giggled. \u201cAnyway I\u2019m going to go start your favourite exercise to help me out with, hot yoga! Are you excited? Anyway do a good job supporting my big \u2018ole butt and it\u2019ll be back down to it\u2019s usual toned self in no time!\u201d<br>\r\nAs Norah practically skipped into the yoga studio she had specifically set up for hot yoga you were falling into despair. Hot yoga with Norah was bad enough when she was using you as a sweat rag, never mind being crammed into her sweaty ass crack. As you endured the sweat and crushing you begged for anyone to come and save you.<br>\r\nSadly for you, the next week went by with no interruptions. Every day you had to endure Norah going out on a run for almost 3 hours, and then later on deal with the exercises she did in her home. The only respite you got from the constant crushing pressure exerted on you by Norah\u2019s ass was when she took you off to shower. Other than that you got no breaks from her rear, Norah didn\u2019t wear any other underwear for the whole week or even take you off to wash you. It was a whole week of basically nothing but darkness, crushing and sweat. The small respite you got while she showered served only to give you a quick glimpse of the outside world before you were returned to your confinement with a quick smile from Norah. <br>\r\nYou noticed she was talking to you less and less as the week went on and you were becoming increasingly concerned that she was starting to forget that it was you serving as her new stretchy, unbreakable thong and that you weren\u2019t just one of her normal thongs. In the end there was nothing you could do to try and get her attention, whatever Norah sprayed you with was stopping your body from reforming and prevented you from being able to move at all. Your only hope was that someone would come along and save you from your air headed aunt, but no one else knew that Norah had spray painted you green so chances of that happening were slim. <br>\r\nA few times you heard what you thought may have been the voice of your mother, but it was muffled through the mass of flesh around you so it was hard to tell. Nevertheless, you mentally screamed out to her for help, but unsurprisingly your cries were left unanswered. The week also showed no significant change in the weight on Norah\u2019s hips, if anything you were sure they may have gotten a tiny fraction wider, although that my have been your imagination. It did make you wonder exactly how long you were going to be trapped as Norah\u2019s only fitting underwear for, you could be trapped in here for months!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a week of this torture, you felt the familiar grinding of the ass cheeks surrounding you that signalled that Norah was walking somewhere, it was almost like her butt was chewing you. This in itself was not unusual, she walked a lot of places, but it was still something you felt like you\u2019d never get used to. The part that was unusual about this particular incident was when she answered the door and from deep down in her cavernous crack, you heard a muffled voice speaking to your aunt, it was one of your roommates!<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t tell which of the three girls it was but the fact that one of them was even here told you that they had been searching for you. You couldn\u2019t really make out the words that either woman was saying from deep down in your prison, but you did hear your name mentioned a few times, every time they mentioned you, Norah\u2019s buns clenched slightly in reflex, you weren\u2019t sure if it was intentional or not but it was definitely unpleasant.<br>\r\nAfter a brief conversation you felt your surroundings shift as Norah moved to the side to let her visitor in before you heard the sound of the door closing. Your world was once again compressed as you assume Norah sat down on the couch. As the conversation continued you began to wonder, which of your roommates was it who managed to track you down? And did Norah still remember that it was you serving as her thong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) It\u2019s Quinn, and Norah does remember it\u2019s you, but is still reluctant to give you up.<br>\r\n2) It\u2019s Morgan, and Norah has completely forgotten that it\u2019s you.<br>\r\n3) It\u2019s Avery, and Norah remembers you, but can Avery convince her to let you go? </span></div></div>",

Every damn step would cause one of Norah's jiggly mounds to rise up before crashing down and smearing you into its twin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeet squishing into her trusty yoga mat, Norah made a deep sigh before instructing, \"Breathe in...\" and bending over at the waist to touch her toes. Her instruction served only to torment you as you could only breathe in the inebriating musk from her sweat filled run that had collected especially in her booty. You wanted to whine out that if Norah was going to force you to be her unwilling thong, the least she could have done was put your face anywhere but buried deep in her ass! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sensical complaint didn't even come to your aunt's mind however, after all, it was all the same to her. She was only focused on making you the most comfortable, durable, and most importantly, the most absorbent little thong she could ask for. As she bent deep into her forward fold, Norah felt your body stretching against her hips, releasing her deep breath as a pleased sigh. Your silky smooth and honestly mildly warm form was sliding against her sensitive backside, giving a pleasurable chill down her spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah's deep bend still only allowed her cheeks to part slightly. Their newly gained jiggly mass barely opening a sliver of light out to see the room even as your body was stretched to extreme lengths by your usual standards. You felt your body try to flinch back in disgust as you actually stretched far enough to touch down at the very base of Norah's ass and you begged Norah wasn't enjoying your feel so she would relieve you of this awful task. As you heard Norah's satisfied sighs and restrained moans, you feared that wasn't happening <i>anytime </i>soon...or maybe <i>ever</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlexible Norah had her head by her ankles as she spoke out to you, \"Wow, Hunter you just feel so <i>amazing</i>! I bet when you were signing up for that usage license you had no idea you'd be able to find someone to help you out so fast!\" Norah giggled, even the simple act of that causing her hefty ass to jiggle teasingly. \"Luckily for you, you have such a considerate and loving aunt there to give you a hand! Or should I say a butt!\" Norah's taunting snickers continued, \"I mean really, this is such a great opportunity for you! I'm an excellent yoga teacher, and every pose I do is kinda like making you do it with me! By the end of the month, you'll probably be stretchier and fitter than ever! Oh! And I will be too of course!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing her misguided thought, Norah stood back up, causing her cheeks to clap back together, creating a wet seal that trapped you deeper in her ass than you had been just five minutes ago. Wait, did she just say a month?! You thought this was going to a week long excursion at most! You fought with all your might but you could only feel a light tingling where your arms were. It was as if your body was truly made into one solid piece, taking away any control you should have of your form. Norah's sealant was truly the heavy duty stuff. That laundry detergent she had had better be the real deal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't able to think on that much longer as Norah lunged into another pose requiring your immediate attention as you strained roughly. After a grueling hour Norah was finally finished plopping down onto the mat in an exaggerated stumble of fatigue. You of course were smooshed under her ass as she caught her breath, something you wished you could do with the same fresh air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up and admiring herself in her studio's mirror, Norah stroked the backside of her shorts while peering at them over her shoulder. \"Well...that's day one completed. What a workout...huh, what's this?\" Norah's hand brushed over her crack and felt it was suspiciously more dry than the rest of her juicy butt. Grinning, Norah remembered why and did her best mock tiny impression, calling down with a high-pitched voice while shaking her cheek along, \"Great job, Norah! You're looking sexier already! I can't wait for more fun tomorrow!\" Norah burst into a fit of laughter at her awful imitation of you. \"Oh god, I'm sorry Hunter, I just couldn't help it! You do have to admit it was awfully accurate though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith day one on the books, Norah bounded her way out of the studio making a beeline for the kitchen. She had worked up quite the appetite. Taking a health shake from the fridge, Norah gulped it down before heading off to shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whole month passed without a hitch in Norah's program. You were shocked that Norah hadn't forgotten you yet, as she continued to speak to you at least a couple times a day remarking how perfect you were for her or how she bet you were enjoying yourself. While you disagreed on both fronts it seemed Norah keeping you as a personal motivator was stopping her from forgetting you weren't just her old trusty green thong. You never made any progress on getting a word in, that was until the end of the month when Norah actually slid you off and you got a face full of her smiling lips. Dropping you onto a cold sheet of metal, you knew exactly where you were from experience past. Tossing her sweaty clothes on top of you, Norah poured in her solvent and started the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later and Norah had retrieved and dried you. You were left a tanned thong shape for another hour but Norah waited patiently for you to reform while watching TV. You rested at her feet on the coffee table much to your dismay but you didn't care since you were finally reforming. Popping into human shape, Norah noticed immediately and gave you a happy clap of satisfaction. \"Oh, Hunter you're back to normal! And as cute as ever, no worse for wear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou always got embarrassed from your aunt's praise, even after a month of being complimented on things you didn't even like about yourself. Rubbing the back of your head sheepishly you simply squeaked out a \"Thanks, Norah...So time for me to go home, huh?\" As usual you prioritized getting away over setting the past straight, a strategy that had at least kept you going this far in life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah beamed at your question, standing from the couch and spinning to face her back to you. Her butt hung over you and the coffee table like a menacing moon ready to fall, and being cast in it's shadow made you wince instinctively. \"Well, that depends! What do you think?\" Norah's booty clad in gray-spandex was heaving up and down as she went through different stances trying to show off her stuff to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the level of fitness was clear, Norah wasn't kidding when she said the weight was stuck to her hips. Finished showing off, Norah's face filled your entire vision as she hovered in front of you. Her hot breath practically knocked you over as she excitedly asked, \"Are you seeing the progress?! Well, are ya? Are ya??\" You wiped the light drop of saliva that sprayed you off your face before answering your eagerly awaiting aunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Norah, you look fantastic. Truthfully, you always have!\" You knew telling Norah the truth that she looked fine was the only way to get back to normal. I mean, if you told her she had no progress who knows when you'd get this chance again? Not to mention she may forget you next time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah gushed, clutching her hands against her face in mock humility, \"Oh, Hunter, of course you'd say that! You are such a little flatterer!\" She tried to cutely pinch your cheek but only succeeded in squashing half your face! \"But really Hunter you don't have to be such a tease! I think you should be able to say first hand that my butt hasn't shrank at all! Grasping at your face rapidly, you were trying to pull your mouth free as Norah lamented, \"Honestly I'm <i>super </i>embarrassed to admit this but...I kinda was drinking these meal replacement drinks by mistake...I <i>kinda sorta </i>thought they were protein shakes...heh heh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped tugging at your face in pure shock at this revelation and you were somehow stunned by Norah's airheadedness even after all these years. Noticing your surprise, Norah continued, \"I'm sorry, okay! They were just so damn tasty I wanted to believe!\" Norah saw you throwing a tantrum stamping your foot and went on damage control, \"Oh come on, don't give me that face! You said I look great anyways...but I understand you're disappointed I didn't meet my own goal...\" Norah sank her head and you thought you heard sniffling from behind the curtain of her shiny red hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPopping your mouth free you felt awful for her and wanted to see her smile return. \"Oh Norah, it's okay! You just need to keep up your training another few months and everything will work out!\" Norah's face shot up and you saw her eyes glimmering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think so?! Oh thank you, Hunter, I knew you'd be accepting!\" Snatching you up, Norah pelted you in passionate kisses which for once only inspired laughter from you as you remarked on her crazy mood swings. Now with you both joyous and optimistic, Norah changed the mood entirely as she squashed you in between her hands. \"I'm so glad you aren't upset with me Hunter. I thought a month under my big butt would really wear you out; but I should've known better! Hell I thought I could lose the weight in another month but if you want me to keep it up for a few that's soooo nice for me. After all, I do have a <i>few </i>shakes left to finish...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed and fought but Norah had already morphed you expertly into a thong shape and hovered her 'Full Length' spray over you menacingly. \"Hey there's no reason to shake Hunter, I've got <i>plenty </i>of green left, your <i>favorite</i>!\" You winced wondering how she confused her favorite with yours but couldn't do a thing as the spray sealed you once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping you up her thick legs, you felt her familiar crushing embrace...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Three months. Three more months you endured serving as Norah\u2019s thong, dealing with the torturous sensation of being trapped in between her shifting, sweaty ass cheeks as she worked tirelessly to lose weight. You endured many, many sessions of yoga entombed within her hefty rear, as well as arduous, lengthy jogs. <br>\r\nNorah continued to talk to you almost every day, and down in the darkness the small bit of contact you had with her every day was one of the few things that kept you sane. Aside from that, you felt terribly lonely, despite spending your every waking moment hugging Norah\u2019s hips snugly, only seeing the light of day when she took you off to shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were forced to listen to the muffled sounds of Norah going about her life, between meeting with tinies she had recruited for her job, to lunches with your mom, Helen. Every time you heard your mothers muffled voice you prayed that Norah would slip up and tell her where you were so that you could be rescued and taken back to your home with the three roommates who you had hoped to get to know better... were they missing you? Will they even remember you after all this time? It had been four months since Norah had taken you on the misguided assumption that you were willing to serve as her underwear while she lost weight. You wondered how long they looked for you, how often they thought about you. You had only known them for a day or two, by this point they probably assumed you weren\u2019t coming back.<br>\r\nThe thoughts of getting back to your life as you had left it was the main thing on your mind, throughout all of the sweat, crushing and occasional farts that you endured in your jiggling prison. <br>\r\nIn your heart you knew everything wouldn\u2019t be back to normal even once you were freed, you still had a general usage license, you knew this because you hadn\u2019t been freed yet. You also had most likely lost your job at Sanderson Beach, considering you hadn\u2019t been to work in four months. Bridgette had seemed nice, but not THAT nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs these thoughts went through your head, as they had for the last three months, until you felt yourself being pulled from the warm embrace of Norah\u2019s cheeks. You were dragged down her thighs and finally down past her feet. Sighing internally, happy to be exposed to the cool air, you expected to simply be deposited on Norah\u2019s bed while she went for a shower like you had every day since the start of your confinement. Instead you were brought up to her smiling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHunter, you know what day it is? Your three months that you promised me are up! And I must say, I think you did a fantastic job, you might be the best thong I\u2019ve ever owned!\u201d You internally cringed hearing Norah\u2019s use of the word \u201cowned\u201d. As Norah brought you around her back to view the backside that had imprisoned you for so long, you could see that her weight loss routine had worked. Norah\u2019s ass no longer had the jiggly, untoned appearance it had before you had began your job as her thong. Now it was firm and toned as it was for as long as you had known her. It had retained some of its increased size, but that, along with the restored firmness made it looks even better than it had before. Norah slapped her ass with her free hand. \u201cSee that Hunter? That\u2019s all thanks to you ya little miracle worker, I could never have done it without you, a lesser thong would have snapped under the pressure of my workout routine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would have blushed from Norah\u2019s praise if you weren\u2019t currently pained green, even if she was complimenting you on something you would never see as a positive trait about yourself. <br>\r\nAs Norah brought you back around to her face you couldn\u2019t help but notice she was giving you a sheepish, guilty look that made you uncomfortable.<br>\r\n\u201cThis is where I give you the bad news Hunter. I know you\u2019re probably excited to get back to your life after being so helpful... but I kinda don\u2019t have any more solvent,\u201d you couldn\u2019t believe this, you were going to be stuck as a thong for even longer! \u201cI kinda had to use the last of it on a guy I had contracted to fill out as a bra for a swimsuit model. Don\u2019t worry though, I\u2019ve ordered more of it, and it should arrive within a week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were slightly relieved that Norah had a solution, but it was just going to take a while, what confused you however was Norah moving towards her dresser, which had an open envelope sitting on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry though Hunter, I know you\u2019ll be eager to get back to your roommates, so I\u2019ll put this through the letter box of your apartment myself. I\u2019ve got a letter in there explaining the situation and I\u2019ll drop off some of the solvent once it gets delivered,\u201d you tried to thrash or vibrate, anything to let Norah know that this was a bad idea, but the full length spray bound you tightly and you couldn\u2019t move.<br>\r\nYou were deposited in the envelope and, with one last proud smile from Norah, cast into darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour envelope prison hit the floor of your apartment that you hadn\u2019t seen the inside of for four months. Norah had dropped you off in the middle of the day, so there was a good chance your three roommates were all at work. You sighed, hoping things would go smoothly, although you doubted it, given your luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting for what you assumed to be house, you heard the sound of keys jingling as the door was unlocked. <br>\r\nYou heard the familiar voice of Morgan as she entered, \u201cwonder who this letter is for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were exposed to the light of the room and you saw Morgan\u2019s confused face as she opened the envelope to see a bright green thong.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the... why did someone mail a thong here?\u201d As she pulled you out and read the letter she gasped. \u201cOh my god, Hunter, is that you? We had no idea what happened to you! Your aunt left a letter saying you\u2019d be gone a few weeks but it\u2019s been months! We\u2019ve been hoping to find you again, but we had to stop researching ways of getting rid of the usage license while we looked for you, don\u2019t worry though, we\u2019ll get started on that again as soon as Quinn and Avery get home. Plus I guess we\u2019ll need to wait on your aunt getting more of that solvent she talked about in the note before we can have a proper reunion.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan gently placed you down on the coffee table, laying the note face down beside you. Before announcing that she had to go for a shower and that she would be back soon. You were left alone on the coffee table and after a few minutes you could hear the faint sound of the shower coming from upstairs. You were pleased to have been found, but you wouldn\u2019t completely relax till you had been freed from your underwear form, anything could go wrong before that happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard the door open before seeing Avery saunter into the living room. She spotted your bright green form almost instantly, but didn\u2019t seem to notice the face-down letter from Norah.<br>\r\n\u201cWonder who these belong to?\u201d As she brought you closer to her face to inspect you, you saw her nose crinkle in disgust. \u201cEW! These stink, must be one of Morgan\u2019s workout thongs. I\u2019ll just throw this in the washing machine so they don\u2019t stink up the living room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went into a full blown panic as Avery carried you to the washing machine and tossed you inside, alongside a basket of other dirty clothing, a lot of which, you noticed in horror, were other thongs, panties and bikini bottoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing you saw before being confined to darkness was Avery\u2019s oblivious, smiling face. You just hoped that Morgan would be able to find you after this was over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***** <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wash cycle was unpleasant, although the thought of being clean after not being washed by Norah for three months was a good thought. You were also sad to feel that Norah had been correct, the \u2018Full Length\u2019 spray seemed to keep whatever hold it had on you without the solvent. Eventually Avery returned to transfer everything to the dryer.<br>\r\nWhat surprised you however, was that once the dryer was finished, you weren\u2019t greeted by Avery\u2019s face. Instead it was that of a panicked Morgan! She must have found out what Avery had unwittingly done with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan scanned the pile of clothes as she pulled each item out one by one, before her gaze seemed to settle on you. <br>\r\n\u201cOh my god Hunter thank god. I\u2019m so sorry! I should never have left you out on the coffee table like that,\u201d as Morgan reached down into the drier you were so happy... until she pulled out the thong next to you! <br>\r\nShe pulled a bright green thong out, which was startlingly similar to what your bright green form looked like, without sparing you a glance.<br>\r\nContent that you were safe, Morgan happily hummed as she sorted the remaining clothes into piles for each of your roommates. <br>\r\nAs Morgan lifted you out, you could see in a nearby mirror why she hadn\u2019t recognised you, the detergent had removed your green colour. You looked like an ordinary tan thong now! <br>\r\nYou were placed in one of the piles and buried under more clothing before you could feel your pile get carried upstairs to someone\u2019s room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while in darkness, the clothing on top of you was lifted, as your eyes adjusted to the light you heard a female voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) \u201cThis thong is a bit too small for me, maybe it\u2019s Avery\u2019s? Oh wait, it stretches, nice.\u201d It\u2019s Quinn, she might be able to find you if she\u2019s made aware of the situation, but otherwise, your time as her underwear would likely prove painful.<br>\r\n2) \u201cOoh, this thong is totes cute! I can\u2019t remember buying it though, is it Morgan\u2019s? Oh well, too bad for her, it\u2019s mines now!\u201d You could now see the beautiful face of Avery, based off her comment you feared that even if Morgan made her aware, she\u2019d think her sister was just trying to steal her thong back.<br>\r\n3) \u201cWait, I don\u2019t recognise this one. It\u2019s weirdly warm and stretchy as well. Wait a second, is this one Hunter?\u201d Morgan checks the green thong, but does she confirm it\u2019s not you?</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHuh. This thong looks kind of small.\u201d The voice said, and as your eyes finished adjusting, you could see Quinn staring down at you with a small frown on her gorgeous face. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s Avery\u2019s? Or is it mine?\u201d Panic overtook you as you recalled just how unbelievably thick Quinn was, and it became clear just how much of a nightmare scenario this was shaping up to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn\u2019s smooth hands dancing across your body as she inquisitively examined you only heightened your rising fear. You\u2019d thought that maybe, just maybe, she would\u2019ve spotted your trace human features, but they truly were blurred beyond recognition. You looked just like a normal tan thong, albeit a slightly stretchy one, a fact Quinn discovered a second later as she pulled your malleable body a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wait. It stretches. Nice! Guess it is mine.\u201d Quinn shrugged and smiled, content with the answer her research had produced. Putting any additional thoughts out of her mind, Quinn stood up and walked over to her closet, dropping you onto the corner of her bed as she did so. It was only then that you noticed she was stark naked, having clearly just finished showering. Even then, all her nude glory couldn\u2019t shake you out of your futile silent screams, desperately begging her to notice you, even as she dug around in her closet for an outfit for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute passed, and it was clear your fate was sealed. Quinn set aside a pair of black jeans and a metal band t-shirt, along with a gargantuan black bra. She then reached for you, and as her hand clasped you and began lowering you to the ground, you felt a chilling depression as the three past months of suffering from Norah all rushed back to you. Were you really about to be sentenced to even more booty servitude solely due to Norah\u2019s negligence and Avery\u2019s airheadedness?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile consumed with your thoughts, Quinn was consuming you in an entirely different sense. Though it took her a bit of effort, she managed to wrangle your squishy form up her thick thighs and settle into place around her gigantic derriere. Pulled to your absolute limits, your limbs ached and cried for release that wouldn\u2019t come as your looped arms and legs clung to Quinn\u2019s hips, and your torso rocketed straight between your curvy roommate\u2019s globular cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Norah but even worse (as Quinn truly had no idea what she was doing, and so had no inclination to spare you or save you) you found yourself buried deep in mounds of sweaty and slightly smelly ass flesh. Everything was darkness, and all sounds were muffled and inaudible. Quinn\u2019s slightest movements shifted her hefty cheeks up and down, grinding them along your battered body, smudging you even more. Still, the chemical Norah had used on you preserved your accursed thong shape despite the beating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExamining herself in the mirror, Quinn blushed lightly at the severely scandalous appearance of the thong on her heavenly developed body. The tan strips of fabric were like floss around her hips, and the majority of the thong had completely vanished inside of her crack. Still, the black-haired girl couldn\u2019t deny the comfort of the thong, nor the soft, squishy support it provided. Immodest attire aside, it was really nice, perhaps the best she\u2019d worn in years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleasantly surprised by the capabilities of the normal-seeming thong, Quinn finally stopped admiring herself and finished getting dressed. Wrangling her prodigious chest into her bra, she then slid on the t-shirt (who\u2019s logo was comically warped by the titanic tits trapped underneath), and then shimmied the jeans on. They weren\u2019t meant to be skintight jeans, but on Quinn, they essentially were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she snapped the waistband of the jeans into place, your torment only doubled in excruciating humiliation. Quinn\u2019s doughy cheeks were constricted tightly, compressing around you and clenching your body painfully, while simultaneously dousing you in sweat and stench. It felt like an inescapable sauna of a million degrees inside of Quinn\u2019s ass, and as your unaware roommate began walking out of her room, and her butt bounced and ground your stringy body mercilessly, you mentally cried out a broken plea for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the living room, Quinn sat down in the recliner and began glancing at her phone. Avery, who had been sitting watching TV, felt her jaw drop open as she stared at Quinn. Somehow, in just casual t-shirt and jeans, Quinn still managed to be distractingly sexy, and Avery found it so hard to look away she was compelled to comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTotes killin\u2019 it, girl!\u201d Avery giggled. \u201cYou are super-duper pretty!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn waved off her compliment with a small smile. \u201cThanks\u2026it\u2019s whatever. I don\u2019t try to dress myself up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery gushed. \u201cBut that just makes you even more of a hottie! You don\u2019t even have to try with your looks!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHAT brought a blush to Quinn\u2019s face, as well as an awkward shuffle in her seat. Her little wiggle was only further endearing her to Avery, but it was hellish for you. Just by simply shifting her booty, Quinn dragged you even deeper into her ass crack, her alluring curves devouring you as her meaty cheeks chewed you up. You were so mangled and crushed by her butt cheeks that it was only Norah\u2019s chemical keeping you from snapping around Quinn\u2019s hips and falling apart. Sadly, you were still a perfect little thong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, following a horrifyingly similar train of thought as Norah, Quinn began to realize that she couldn\u2019t feel a single drop of sweat in her normally kind of swampy ass. With how big her butt was, keeping it contained in jeans all day normally generated no small amount of moisture. However, she felt as clean as a whistle down there, and couldn\u2019t help but wonder if her new thong was some sort of miracle fabric. Comfy and practical? She was very impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, just like with Norah, it was your body\u2019s own squishy and absorbent properties that were of benefit to Quinn. You yourself were forced to absorb all of her sweat and stench into your own body, keeping her flawless and gorgeous while dirtying yourself to disgusting degrees. As squashed as you were, you couldn\u2019t do a thing to protest either. All you could do was serve your enforced purpose, as Quinn moved terrifyingly closer to adopting you as her new go-to underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust entering the room, Morgan flicked Avery on the noggin as she sat down. \u201cStop teasing the poor girl, Avery.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery pouted melodramatically. \u201cIt\u2019s been three months, Morgan. I\u2019m entitled to some flirting, right? She\u2019s totes the most gorgeously gorgeous girl I\u2019ve ever seen. I find thicc chicks adorbs!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan sighed, and Quinn blushed again, averting her gaze from Avery\u2019s relaxed, lop-sided grin. The more sensible Sinclair sister then cleared her throat. \u201cAnyway, since you two are both here, I just wanted to let you know of a big development that happened a little while ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping back to business, Quinn returned to her normal demeanor. \u201cOh? What\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan winced. \u201cBasically, Hunter\u2019s back. He was sent through the mail by his aunt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn sat up straight (ironically forcing even more of her weight to crush you from all sides). \u201cHe is? That\u2019s awesome. How is the little dude? Did his aunt treat him fairly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery tittered like a schoolgirl. \u201cSomeone seems pretty invested in the guy, huh? Are ya in loooove?\u201d She giggled again, and Quinn looked at her in exasperation (but didn\u2019t deny her taunt).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan shushed her rambunctious twin, and continued. \u201cUm\u2026he was probably NOT treated well. He was sent back as a thong, and it was implied he\u2019s been a thong for the whole three months. In fact, we can\u2019t even free him until we get some solvent from his aunt next week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn growled. \u201cThat woman. Her and that damn notary! Forcing Hunter through torment just for kicks! It\u2019s sick!\u201d She fumed, and it was clear that three months hadn\u2019t doused her sense of fighting for tiny rights (even if her rousing speech had been lost on your muffled, crushed ears down below).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo he\u2019s a thong now? That\u2019s fun!\u201d Avery clapped her hands together. \u201cFirst dibs on wearing him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn was about to rebuke the playful girl\u2019s tasteless suggestion, when she suddenly paled. She began to think about the mystery thong in her basket of clothes, and how stretchy and absorbent it was. Fearing the worst, she looked over to Morgan. \u201cAnd\u2026what did you do with him? O-Once you found him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan smiled easily. \u201cOh, he\u2019s resting in a drawer in my cabinet. A LOCKED drawer.\u201d She added, eyeing Avery, who slumped in disappointment. \u201cHe\u2019ll rest there safely until the solvent comes. Also, he\u2019s a super bright green color, so he\u2019s very easy to spot, and even harder to misplace.\u201d She gave Quinn a thumbs-up. \u201cYou can trust me to keep him safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn let out a long, satisfied breath. Her new thong really was just a standard thong after all, normal stretchy fabric and everything. It was one incredibly comfy and useful thong, that was for certain, but it wasn\u2019t a misplaced tiny guy. Quinn fully trusted and believed Morgan, so she put any further doubts out of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, trapped in the abyss of Quinn\u2019s ass, you had heard exactly none of the conversation your three roommates were holding, and failed to realize just how thoroughly they\u2019d screwed you over. Maybe some miracle would save you, but the chances were slim. For at least one full week, it was looking like you\u2019d be nothing but Quinn\u2019s thong, and if fate screwed you over even harder, perhaps more than week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had you done to deserve this?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Quinn relaxed as Morgan had unintentionally assured her that her new comfy, absorbent thong wasn\u2019t you. Since Morgan hadn\u2019t mentioned you being put through a wash cycle by Avery without her realising it, Quinn wouldn\u2019t be expecting you to be a tan thong, only a green one. As she relaxed in her seat again, her massive cheeks unclenched, as they had been while she was concerned for you. This gave you a slight bit of respite, but not much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three months that you spent being worn by Norah couldn\u2019t have prepared you for being worn by Quinn. The ludicrous proportions of her mighty backside put more strain on your body than any workout session with Norah ever could, and that was with her just sitting in a chair! Terrifying thoughts of being worn by Quinn during a workout flashed into your mind, and you silently thanked whatever deity would listen that Quinn didn\u2019t seem like the most active of your roommates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour three roommates spent the rest of the day relaxing around the house, while you were left to the high pressure, smelly and sweaty environment of Quinn\u2019s backside. Quinn barely moved from the chair, so you got no respite from your suffering underneath her, and even when she did, her movements pulled and stretched your limbs to the point where you feared they would snap around her wide hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day passed by uneventfully and eventually you felt the cool air as you were tugged down past Quinn\u2019s thick thighs and were dropped unceremoniously in her hamper with all of her other unwashed clothes. You looked up and saw Quinn, in all her nude glory, as she walked over to her dresser to find a pair of pyjamas to wear, eventually settling on a pair that would have been loose fitting on any girl that wasn\u2019t Quinn. On her they were stretched to their limits around her hips and bust. <br>\r\nAs Quinn flicked off the lights and crawled into bed you couldn\u2019t do anything other than wallow in despair at how your life was going and the stench of Quinn\u2019s dirty clothes. Eventually you drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***** <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Quinn were awoken by the sound of someone knocking on her bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuinn, I\u2019m almost ready for our run. Get your big butt outta bed,\u201d you heard Morgan on the other side of the door. Quinn groaned, obviously having heard her as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, why did I agree to start working out with Morgan,\u201d Quinn groaned. She kept talking to herself as she struggled out of bed. \u201cOh well, I guess once I start to lose some weight it\u2019ll be worth it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn hurriedly gathered some workout clothes consisting of a far too small looking pair of workout shorts and a loose fitting top. As she rummaged in her underwear drawer she sighed in frustration when she saw it was empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan I need to get more on top of washing my clothes more often,\u201d her eyes glanced towards the hamper you were resting in before settling on you. \u201cI suppose wearing them for one more day couldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mentally begged for Quinn to realise it was you as she lifted you out of the hamper and up to her face to inspect you. She crinkled her nose, expecting her new thong to smell pretty bad after being in her swampy ass all day yesterday, but was surprised to find that you didn\u2019t actually smell very bad at all.<br>\r\n\u201cHuh!\u201d She exclaimed, becoming more impressed by this mystery thong with every revelation about it. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t smell anywhere near as bad as I had thought it would, plus it\u2019s not even damp! This is the best thong ever... if only I could remember where I got it.\u201d She shrugged her shoulders. \u201cOh well I guess I\u2019ll just have to get as much use out of this one as possible. I\u2019m really glad Morgan has Hunter secured in her drawer, otherwise I\u2019d be really worried this was him. At least this way I don\u2019t need to give up my new favourite underwear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Quinn smiled you could only scream internally as she shimmied out of her pyjama bottoms before stepping through your holes and dragging you up into the warm, crushing embrace of her ass. Your limbs were once again stretched to their limit around her hips. <br>\r\nHer workout shorts soon followed, which compressed her globular cheeks into their tight confines, which caused them to press into you even more than they already were, which you didn\u2019t think was even possible. It was like being trapped in a vice, the two previously jiggling masses of buttflesh were pressing in tightly from all sides, they were at that moment taking up your entire world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were left to languish in the claustrophobic embrace of Quinn\u2019s butt cheeks while she got changed into the rest of her workout clothes. Your situation didn\u2019t change very much while this was going on, but you did get stretched to the point where you were sure you would break in half when Quinn bent over to tie her running shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn begrudgingly walked downstairs, her mountainous cheeks grinding your poor body as she went. <br>\r\nShe joined Morgan in the living room, the much more athletic girl giggling at Quinn\u2019s grim expression at the prospect of exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could look a bit more enthusiastic Quinn,\u201d Morgan giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I just don\u2019t do... exercise,\u201d Quinn said half-heartedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll love it once we get started,\u201d Morgan grinned, eager to get started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard none of their conversation buried so deep in Quinn\u2019s butt crack, at most you could only make out the muffled sound of Quinn\u2019s voice, but you couldn\u2019t understand any of the words she spoke. However, you definitely caught on to what was happening when the pounding you received from Quinn\u2019s shifting cheeks increased in frequency and force. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of running Quinn was struggling to keep up with Morgan, and was hating every minute of it. As bad a time as Quinn was having, yours was infinitely worse.<br>\r\nBeing worn by Norah while she ran was bad, but being worn by Quinn made that seem like a walk in the park. Quinn\u2019s butt seemed to somehow be sweatier, crush you more ruthlessly and was even hotter than Norah\u2019s ass during a run. <br>\r\nHowever, Quinn noted that her ass crack wasn\u2019t as swampy as she expected it would be. She smiled, knowing that it was her new mysterious wonder-thong. As the run progressed Quinn decided that you would be her new go-to underwear in the future. <br>\r\nYou were unaware that Quinn had decided to subject you to a whole lot more torture under her rear, since she hadn\u2019t verbalised it, not that you would have heard it if she had verbalised it anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Quinn continued on her run with Morgan, her jiggling assets drawing meany eyes without her realising it, you dutifully absorbed the sweat that was pouring between her cheeks and resigned yourself to the fact that you would likely be dealing with a whole lot more of this in the near future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeven days had passed. You had spent the vast majority of the week crammed into Quinn\u2019s gigantic ass, dealing with all of the sweat, crushing and heat that her ass could inflict on you, along with the occasional fart. <br>\r\nThis one week as Quinn\u2019s underwear was in many ways worse than serving as Norah\u2019s. While Quinn didn\u2019t exercise anywhere near as much as Norah did, her larger rear got incredibly sweaty just by the fact of its size. Acting as Quinn\u2019s underwear was also much more painful since it felt like you would snap at any moment, stretched what felt like past your limit around her ludicrous hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were exposed to the light as Quinn opened the lid of the dryer, freeing you from the darkness and giving you a view of her beautiful face staring down at you, a sight which had been incredibly rare throughout the week since you had been crammed between her butt cheeks for most of it. As Quinn pulled you out and dropped you into a basket to take you up to her room, you saw Morgan walk into the room, holding a familiar green thong in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Norah dropped off some of the solvent?\u201d Quinn inquired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah she gave me a few doses of it, just in case something like this happens in the future. Surprisingly forward thinking of her, I\u2019d say,\u201d Morgan smiled at the thong that she assumed was you. \u201cDon\u2019t worry Hunter, you\u2019ll be back to normal soon enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe for the best it wasn\u2019t me that answered the door, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have been able to keep calm around her after what she put Hunter through,\u201d Quinn fumed, obviously still angry that Norah had worn you as a thong for three months. You knew she\u2019d feel terrible when she finally figured out that you were her new favourite thong, if she ever did figure it out at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah she didn\u2019t even seem that sorry about it, she just gushed about how helpful he is,\u201d Morgan shrugged. \u201cShe seems nice, if a little ditsy. I think she actually believed that Hunter was cool with being her thong.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were talking you watched as Morgan dropped the green thong into the washing machine and loaded it up with the detergent containing the solvent, before your view was obstructed by Quinn dropping another article of clothing on top of you, hiding you from sight. As you lay there, getting progressively more buried by Quinn\u2019s clean laundry, you hoped that they would figure out where you really were when they realised that the green thong wasn\u2019t you before Quinn wore you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Morgan tells Quinn and Avery that the detergent didn\u2019t work, they figure out that the green thong wasn\u2019t you. Quinn quickly realises that you were her thong the whole time.<br>\r\n2) Morgan tells Quinn and Avery that the detergent didn\u2019t work, they figure out that the green thong wasn\u2019t you, but Quinn doesn\u2019t connect the dots.<br>\r\n3) They assume that there was a problem with Norah\u2019s solvent, so they brainstorm ways to try and free you, thinking that you are still the green thong.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Finished gathering up her freshly cleaned articles of clothing, Quinn hefted her hamper off the ground and headed back upstairs to her room. You and the rest of the clothes were jostled around in her hamper as she trotted up the stairs, but it was honestly heaven compared to what you\u2019d primarily been experiencing for the entire past week. You\u2019d take a plush basket of silky lingerie over the dank confines of Quinn\u2019s gargantuan rear end any day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in her room, Quinn slid out of the simple shorts and shirt she was wearing, as well as the current pair of underwear she had on. She tossed the worn clothes into the newly emptied dirty laundry basket, and while still naked, began putting her freshly cleaned articles away, while also setting aside a new outfit to wear for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLayer by layer, clothes were taken off of you, until finally light shone in and you were revealed to the world once more. Even a full week later, it was impossible to understate the overwhelming beauty that Quinn exuded, breathtakingly nude and towering above you in all her glory. Despite all the torment she\u2019d put you through this last week (none of which she herself could be blamed for), your awe and growing feelings of adoration for her still soared high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, as she bent down and picked you up, and a small grin crossed her face, some of that love for Quinn faded in place of anxious resignation. Though her soft hands held you delicately as she carried you over to the side of her bed, it was painfully obvious the treatment wasn\u2019t because of your secret sentient nature. No, after a week of hell, you knew Quinn was just excited to wear her new favorite miracle thong again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, after a few more minutes of sorting her clothes into various drawers and inside her closet, Quinn wandered back over to you. Scooping you off of her bed, you caught one more glimpse of Quinn\u2019s beautiful face, a content and satisfied expression written there. The lack of recognition in her eyes still killed you, as you\u2019d truly hoped she would eventually realize the truth and save you. Sadly, for the moment, all Quinn did was lower you to the ground, and then step her feet through the loops molded out of your stretched and contorted limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d almost become accustomed to the experience by now, but that didn\u2019t make it any less awful. Your mangled body barely made it up Quinn\u2019s thick thighs and around her scrumptious booty, and as your arms and legs strained at their very limits to hug Quinn\u2019s hips, most of your body vanished right into her butt crack, slipping into a world of heat, sweat, and stench. Everything was darkness and muffled noise, and hot flesh pressed in on you from all sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour oblivious captor merely smiled at the soothing sensation of the stretchy thong settling into place, and with a happier smile then she\u2019d ever show in public, went about slipping into the rest of her attire. Morgan had mentioned going on another run, so Quinn changed into a pair of compression shorts, as supportive a sports bra as one could buy with assets as large as Quinn\u2019s, and a black tank-top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had she changed than Morgan burst into the room, looking harried. Out of breath, the frantic brown-haired athlete stammered for a coherent sentence. \u201cQ-Quinn\u2026Quinn! The solvent didn\u2019t work on Hunter!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour black-haired tormentor frowned (and also blushed lightly at Morgan having caught her in such an expressive mood). \u201cWell\u2026that\u2019s weird, right? Let me see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan thrust out her hands, wherein the green thong that had stolen your identity for the past week was lying. It was still soaking wet from the wash, but that was hardly the most notable thing about it. It appeared to have been burned a bit in a few places, the fabric singed and melting away. No doubt an adverse reaction with the solvent that was never intended for store-bought lingerie to handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, all Quinn had to do was lean forward a bit, and she could spot the clear strings of fabric clinging to the burned marks on the thong. Narrowing her eyes in confusion, Quinn picked the thong out of Morgan\u2019s hands and pulled on it, testing its stability. In seconds, the thong began to fall apart into pieces, and more and more strands of fabric snapped loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan slapped a hand to her mouth, face froze in horror, but Quinn only sighed. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Hunter at all. It\u2019s not even a tiny. Just a regular thong.\u201d She explained, and Morgan\u2019s rigid posture relaxed. Quinn was still annoyed, however. \u201cThis begs the question though. Where is Hunter if he isn\u2019t the thong we all thought he was?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the hallway, a cheerful pink-haired head poked into the room. \u201cAre we all talking about Hunter? Can one of us finally wear the little cutie?\u201d Avery giggled, but genuine earnest shone in her eyes, illuminating her true intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan bit her lip nervously, and then looked at her twin sister. \u201cHey, Avery. You told me that you put Hunter into the wash last week, right? Because you found him on the table, and didn\u2019t even bother to read the note?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thinly-veiled insult flew right over Avery\u2019s vacuous head, and she merely tapped her chin in an adorably exaggerated show of thinking. \u201cHmm\u2026did I do that? OMG, I actually totes forget!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn glared at her, but more out of concern for you than anger at her roommate. \u201cYou don\u2019t remember? Did you even put him in the wash at all? Have we been looking in the wrong place all this time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery put a hand to her chest, mildly offended. \u201cHey! It was a whole week ago, you guys! You can\u2019t be super duper cereal about me remembering, can you? Like, I just forget! I remember picking the thong up\u2026oops, I mean Hunter\u2026but then my mind is totes blank!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn and Morgan facepalmed near simultaneously, and then Morgan groaned out a reply to her sister\u2019s scatterbrained antics. \u201cAlright. Guess we need to dig through our lingerie, pick out every single green thong we own, and put them all in a wash cycle together with the solvent. Sound like a plan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn nodded instantly, and though Avery hesitated for a moment with a sulky pout, she finally conceded. The three girls then dutifully picked through their underwear drawers, clean clothes baskets, and also dirty laundry to procure every green thong they could get a handle on. Altogether, they managed to scrounge up about six different green thongs. Morgan, wishing at least one was their wayward tiny roommate, walked off to start the new wash cycle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour captor, however, waited alone in the living room, and spared a quick uncertain glance at her hefty posterior, and the comfy, absorbent thong she knew was buried in between all that mass. A single, niggling thought nagged at her to double-check the true identity of her new favorite thong, but after a moment, Quinn forcefully shoved the thought aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the facts that she knew of the situation, you were a completely green thong lost somewhere in their apartment, not the tan thong wedged up her crack and comfortably hugging her hips. She didn\u2019t even begin to consider that the wash cycle had wiped away your green coloring, as she didn\u2019t even know how exactly you\u2019d been dyed green in the first place. Also, the embarrassment of facing the potential truth that she\u2019d been wearing you so intimately for over a week was crushing, and so Quinn ignored her mind\u2019s single hesitant concern, confident it was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan then strolled back into the room, sighed, and ran her hand through her hair. \u201cWhat a morning, huh? Still down for that run?\u201d She threw Quinn a lopsided grin, and was a bit stunned to see Quinn shrug in acceptance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah sure.\u201d The black-haired giantess replied. \u201cI could live with a bit of de-stressing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan nodded eagerly. \u201cAh, sweet! You\u2019re totally enjoying these runs now, aren\u2019t you? I knew you could do it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t say that.\u201d Quinn grumbled, but with a small smile. \u201cI\u2019ve just gotten used to them. I walk and swim for hours a day at Sanderson Beach. Running is a similar amount of exertion, just with more effort in less time.\u201d She began to stretch her legs. \u201cBesides, it builds up my stamina, which will probably benefit my work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan grinned and laughed. \u201cHow analytical of you, Quinn. What else did I expect, though? I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re having fun!\u201d The athletic girl took the lead and slipped out the front door, with Quinn hot on her heels a moment later. After a few more stretches on the front lawn, the two girls took off down the sidewalk, jogging at a brisk but manageable pace, enjoying the wind in their hair and the vigor in their hearts, and drawing no shortage of stares from passerby\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep in your hellish prison, you were endless ground up by Quinn\u2019s monumental ass cheeks, each step she took decimating your poor body. You were crushed tight from all sides by her hot flesh, dunked in buckets of sweat, and already absorbing copious amounts of bodily fluid and stench. Muffled as the outside world was to you, you hadn\u2019t heard a word of the commotion this morning, and so as far as you knew, this torment was going to be your future for a very long time. And, in actuality, it very well could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the run finally ended, both girls stumbled into their apartment soaked in sweat, but feeling energized. Their enthusiasm faded, however, as Avery met them in the living room, a sopping bundle of destroyed green thongs in her arms. Obviously, not a single one of them was you.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, Morgan's eyes widened. \"Wait, are any of us wearing a green thong now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan and Avery quickly pulled open their pants and peeked at their underwear. Morgan sighed with relief to see her panties were gray, while Avery was disappointed to see she was wearing a pink thong. Quinn didn't have to check though. She knew her thong was the miraculous tan thong she'd been wearing for a week. Now that she thought about it though, that's just about the time Hunter was returned to Morgan... And when Avery supposedly washed him....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God...\" Quinn said, dropping her pants instantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the problem Quinn? Your thong isn't green.\" Avery said, looking quizzically at the tan thong that was tightly wrapped around her roommates ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you washed it Avery! Which means...\" Quinn began, working the thong down her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The green dye might have washed off!\" Morgan finished, realizing where Quinn was going. She opened the washing machine and held out her other hand to take the thong from Quinn. Despite the long run they'd just gone on, the thong didn't seem sweaty at all. She dropped it into the washing machine, crossed her fingers, and hit start. The view of the inside of the washing machine was obscured by a wall of suds for 2 full minutes. When Morgan finally drained and opened the washer, she found uou, tiny, panting and wearing only your underwear. You rubbed your head, dizzy from the spin cycle, as you saw your three giant roommates staring at your through the circular opening to the washer. It was strange having arms you could control again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunter I'm so sorry! I really thought Morgan had you in her drawer, and you were supposed to be green! I had no idea I was wearing you!\" Quinn said, her voice almost quivering. She was clearly very upset about what she'd put you through. She gingerly lifted you out of the washer and placed you on a table, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Quinn. It was no big deal.\" You said, trying your best to make it believable. You didn't want Quinn to be upset about something that was really out of her control. \"It's like you said when we met. Tinies have to learn how to be strong on their own. I think I've definitely gotten pretty strong now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be pretty strong to spend a week in Quinn's thicc ass.\" Avery teased, though she was quickly elbowed into silence by Morgan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Quinn asked, ignoring Avery's comment, shocked at how mild your reaction was. \"I thought it must have been horrible! Between all the pressure and the sweating and not being acknowledged, I thought you'd hate me. I wore you practically every day for a week! And I've been running with Morgan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really Quinn, it was fine. Not bad at all.\" You insisted. \"Though we should still figure out this usage license situation. I don't want my aunt to be able to take me again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn smiled, relieved that you seemed unharmed by her bodacious booty. \"Of course, we can get back to work on that right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We still have all the paperwork.\" Morgan chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! And we definitely don't want anyone else taking you away from us!\" Avery finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at the giant women, relieved to see how much they cared for you. And of course, it was nice to be able to smile again, instead of just being a thong. \"Thanks girls, you're the best. Now if you don't mind, I'd really like to go lay down for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Quinn said, lifting you up off the table. This was unlike her, usually she was all about you doing things for yourself. Clearly she still felt bad about what you'd endured. She carried you up to her bedroom, where you foud that your tiny bed was set up on top of her dresser, tucked in the corner against the wall. \"I set it all up while we were waiting for you to come back. Took longer than we thought, but still...\" Quinn smiled sheepishly as she dropped you on top of her dresser. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Quinn, I really appreciate it.\" You said, hopping up onto your bed. It wasn't lost on you that just a day ago, you were sleeping under this bed, trapped as a thong in Quinn's panty drawer. You ignored that thought for now though, and climbed into bed, relieved that your experience as a thong was finally over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr was it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you drifted off to sleep, Quinn was back downstairs, chatting with Morgan and Avery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you realize that your thong was him Quinn? It was smart to realize the dye might have washed off, but you seemed sure it was the one you were wearing.\" Morgan asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I had been wondering where I bought that thong, and had trouble remembering. Plus, it was like nothing I'd ever worn before.\" Quinn said, keeping her voice low. She definitely didn't want Hunter to hear this conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? Like, extra comfy?\" Avery asked, bouncing on her toes with a mix of excitement and jealousy. It seemed unfair that Hunter had been worn by two women so far and neither of them were her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely the most comfortable thong I'd ever worn.\" Quinn agreed. \"Plus he stretched to fit perfectly. But most of all, he absorbed all the sweat from my exercise.\" As soon as Quinn finished, her face flushed red, realizing she has been gushing about how much she enjoyed wearing their roommate as a pair of panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds totes incredible. I HAVE to try it! And Ooooo! It looks like his aunt sent us some more of that binding spray she used to keep him thong shaped!\" Avery said, holding up a bottle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan snatched it out of her hand. \"No one is turning Hunter back into a thong!\" Morgan chided, inspecting the bottle. She saw the back had a picture of an athletic girl mid squat, with magnifying glass over her compression shorts showing the tiny turned thong underneath them. The caption said \"the best workout you'll ever have, guaranteed\". She felt herself wondering what it would be like to wear him during an exercise routine, then said: \"Unless he agrees to it, anyway.\" and put the bottle back in the box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to sweet talk him into it then.\" Avery said. \"If he can handle Quinn's butt, mine will be like a vacation for him.\" This time both girls elbowed her, then burst out laughing. The situation was almost too absurd not to laugh. Most of all, they were just glad they got their roommate back, even if it would be hard to look at him the same way after knowing just how good of a pair of panties he would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. You find that during your time as a thong you've developed a crush on Quinn, and decide to ask her on a date. (RESERVED FOR ALISTAIR)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Morgan asks for a favor, and you agree before asking what it is. She has a marathon race in the next day or two, and it turns out her athletic thongs were all green. Since you said being Quinn's thong was no big deal, she knows you wouldn't mind filling in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Avery spends the next week trying to persuade you to let her wear you as a thong. After constant refusals, an accident lands you in the washing machine, and she finds you when unloading it. Assuming you let one of the other girls wear you, she gets angry at you. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were woken up by the sound of Quinn opening the door to her room as she entered to get ready for bed. As you sat up to look at her entering, your whole body felt stiff and sore. This was understandable considering you had been shaped as a thong and used very intensively for the better part of four months, and your last owner happened to have the biggest ass you had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn, seeing you sit up in your bed to look at her, grimaced, realising she had woken you up.<br>\r\n\u201cAh, sorry dude. I was trying to be quiet,\u201d Quinn seemed to be acting much more considerately around you than you remembered, she obviously felt bad for what she had been unintentionally doing to you for the last week. She suddenly blushed very intensely as she looked you in the face. \u201c...and, uh... sorry again about the last week. I know you were probably putting on a little bit of bravado when we found you because I can\u2019t believe that wasn\u2019t awful for you. So uh, yeah. Sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell Quinn was flustered even talking to you about this, since she was so embarrassed you decided to try and make her feel better again.<br>\r\n\u201cQuinn, honestly... it wasn\u2019t that bad,\u201d you tried to put on a brave face about it, even though the experience had actually been awful for you. Your face must have betrayed you because Quinn looked doubtful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for trying to make me feel better Hunter, but you don\u2019t have to pretend,\u201d she had approached and was currently going through her drawers that your bed was sitting on top of, as she was crouched to look into some of the lower ones, you could only see her hair and eyes, which were looking downwards, away from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Quinn grabbed her pyjamas, she looked up at you, still crouched. You were once again amazed by how beautiful Quinn was, and as you looked into her eyes you felt... something. Your chest felt tight, almost as if the mere sight of her face had stolen your breath. Admittedly it was a sight you hadn\u2019t seen very much of for the last week. As you looked into Quinn\u2019s big, piercing blue eyes, that feeling confused you, a confusion that must have been written all over your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything ok dude?\u201d Quinn cocked an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah... I think so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, Quinn stood up and walked over to her bed. You watched as Quinn\u2019s planetary backside bounced and wobbled as she walked, barely contained by the shorts she was wearing, with... longing? No, that couldn\u2019t be what you were feeling, Quinn\u2019s backside had crushed and utterly dominated you for the last week! You also did feel no small amount of fear, which made sense considering the events of the last week, but the combination of longing and fear was a confusing one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, dude... could you look away. I\u2019m trying to get changed,\u201d your eyes were drawn from Quinn\u2019s backside up to her face, staring at you with a hint of annoyance and with a slight blush on her cheeks. You found it ironic that Quinn was trying to be so private with you still, when you had just spent the last week face first in her ass. Muttering a small apology in embarrassment, you flipped over in your bed to face the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you heard the shifting fabric of Quinn getting changed, you thought on the confusing feelings you had just felt. Sure, Quinn\u2019s rear had just subjected you to a week of pain and suffering, but she was still one of the prettiest, hottest women you had ever met... did you have a crush on Quinn? <br>\r\nThere was obviously attraction there, but she was such an intriguing person as well, you just wanted to learn more about her every time she gave you another glimpse of her personality. <br>\r\nThe whole week of being her thong, and seeing her face as a signal for the few moments of respite you received was probably also a contributing factor, perhaps your brain was beginning to associate Quinn\u2019s face with relaxation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost to your thoughts, you didn\u2019t even notice Quinn cross the room and turn off the lights without another word, before crawling into her bed and going to sleep. Exhaustion soon took you and you fell asleep once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost a week had passed and you were still grappling with your newfound feelings for Quinn. <br>\r\nYou found yourself staring longingly at her when she wasn\u2019t looking, your eyes were drawn to her expansive backside most of all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had spent the last week at home, the girls figuring it was safer to keep you in the house until your usage license situation was fixed. You had lost your job at Sanderson beach after not turning up for a week anyway, so it wasn\u2019t as if you had anywhere to be anyway. <br>\r\nYou had considered confiding in either Morgan or Avery about your newfound feelings for Quinn, but you decided not to. You hadn\u2019t been alone with Morgan all week since she was busy at work and with all of her various exercises and sports that she was involved in, and you didn\u2019t want to tell Avery because you doubted the bubbly girl would keep the whole thing a secret from Quinn, plus you feared her flirtations with you would lead to her becoming jealous that in the end it was Quinn who you had feelings for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn this particular day it was just you and Quinn. Morgan and Avery were at work and it was Quinn\u2019s day off. <br>\r\nThe day had been fairly awkward, as you had found it difficult to actually speak to Quinn since you realised your crush on her, and Quinn still felt bad for the torture that her ass had put you through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were both currently sitting at the kitchen table, eating lunch which Quinn had prepared. It was just a simple sandwich and a glass of soda. Quinn had been kind enough to tear you off a small corner of the sandwich and fill you a cap full of soda. <br>\r\nYou were both eating in silence, with both you and Quinn occasionally glancing at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Quinn broke the silence.<br>\r\n\u201cIs, uh.... everything ok Hunter?\u201d She looked at you with her usual expressionless face, but you could read some concern from the tone of her voice. \u201cYou\u2019ve been acting weird all week. If it\u2019s what happened last week then I totally get it... I was just a little worried.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no Quinn, it\u2019s not that,\u201d you took a deep breath and just decided to admit your feelings to her. Trying to find the right words, there was a long silence, during which Quinn seemed to grow increasingly anxious and impatient, her gorgeous face shifting into a small frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an agonisingly long time without finding the correct words, you just decided to do it, better than leaving this silence hanging over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, uh, t-the reason I\u2019ve been so weird around you lately,\u201d your mouth was going dry with nerves. \u201cIs because during my week as your thong... I think I realised I ... l-like you...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long silence, Quinn\u2019s face remained unchanging, making it really difficult to figure out what she was thinking. There was a growing redness in her cheeks. You realised that you hadn\u2019t been breathing since you stopped speaking, so you gasped, taking a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after an agonisingly long wait, Quinn spoke.<br>\r\n\u201cHunter...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) \u201c... I-I kinda like you too.\u201d She feels the same way, your feelings for each other could possibly even solve the problem of the general usage license if you change it to a private one with Quinn as your \u201cowner\u201d.<br>\r\n2) \u201c... you little pervert!\u201d She got the wrong idea, thinks that you only like her for her ass. She decides to punish you with her ass since you\u2019re obviously so obsessed with it.<br>\r\n3) \u201c... I\u2019m sorry but I just can\u2019t do this right now.\u201d She rejects you, possibly caused by the fear of what her mom would do to you if she found out.</span></div></div>",

She had a look of confusion and worry on her face as she went to her room and laid you and the regular thong on her bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright so what I could I use to tell... wait I can look this up!\" You mentally cheered as she pulled out her phone. \"Color may wash away but not guaranteed, I guess that rules color out.\" You realized there were only two things left, and she listed them both. \"The real tell tale signs are stretchiness/malleability and tiny based clothing has unreal sweat absorption...both are pretty stretchy, but only one should absorb my sweat in a workout really well and that'll tell me which is which. Hunter, if I'm picking you I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to scream as the well intentioned Morgan scooped you up. \"Here goes nothing.\" She said stripping down and replacing her previous pair of panties with you. You felt that familiar feeling of being wrapped around an ass but clearly you were shrunk somewhat in the wash as this was even tighter than Nora's!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you tried to gather yourself in this new, fresh Hell, she took a moment to turn and admire herself in the mirror. \"Well hopefully these aren't Hunter, the really look good and squeeze all the right places hehe.\" She laughed and gave her ass a playful squeeze, not helping your case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then grabbed some short shorts, turned on a heater and started to stretch. You begged this was a nightmare but the feeling of sweat pooling around you began to take hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before she started some light cardio with jumping jacks and jump squats. You were alternated between being sandwiched by her firm and unforgiving cheeks and being pushed deeper into her ass everytime she switched exercises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She must have enough sweat now!' you screamed mentally but she seemed set on getting a full workout in even when you were assaulted with taste and smell of her sweat, every drop of which absorbed into you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext were free weights and while one set was curls, the other was lunges which acted very much like squats, pushing you deeper into her sweaty ass. You begged for an ending to be brought soon to this, it was supposed to end with Nora anyhow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, she continued her workout for another 30 minutes as she was committed to keeping her body fit, you almost slipping her mind from time to time. On the good side, nothing worked you like squats and although her cool down stretch put you in some uncomfortable situations, you were comforted by the fact that it was coming to an end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took you off and placed you on the bed next to that green thing you despised. After a quick inspection, Morgan spoke, \"Wow not much of anything. That's almost unheard of, I think I might even be cleaner... WAIT THAT MEANS I USED HUNTER!!!\" She quickly turned back to your sweat soaked, thong form. \"I'm so sorry, I swear I didn't know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would accept her apology if you could but if you could speak there wouldn't have to be an apology. \"Lemme go tell the girls about your predicament, you need to be washed and I don't want another mix up happening.\" She left the room and you ,for the first time in what felt like forever, felt relief wash over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan than entered the room and told you-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)Bad news, the girls think you have to find a way to make due on rent, and with not enough money, you'll have to make it up through manual labor once you reform or even now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Good news, the girls are understanding and you get a second chance, but are the girls gonna be too overprotective?</span></div></div>",

She didn't even consider that the big ticket was because most of the money you would be 'working' for was basically siphoned off to her because of your general license and her being the one to bring you in. She had already plucked you off the table and yanked you out into a bracelet she could wrap around her wrist. \"Don't worry Hunter, the place is actually just around the corner from my house, I guess it's a bit of a jog from here but I did already jog here.\" She explained which didn't make you feel any better. What the heck kind of job was this? Why did it want general usage guys and not like... the kind of temp contracts your Aunt usually got. You didn't get any information about it from the jog, that was all blurred together as you flew along on Norah's wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you did get there the building she stopped in front of left you flabbergasted, you had heard about this kind of place before but you never realized one was so close to... anything near you. The black tinted windows and the name oof, Tiny Pleasures, it was a 'specialty store' that had only two kinds of clients, Women that wanted a tiny molded into something that they would 'rent out' and the much more expensive 'looking to buy' kind who wanted a tiny guy for themselves and would pay ungodly sums to get a tiny with a general use license. You thought that their existence was a rumor! Some shitty internet horror story but here it was, in your town no less. Norah however did not seem the least bit surprised by this and moved directly into the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA goth looking girl didn't look up yet \"Sorry mam but-\" She cut herself off as she saw Norah enter \"Oh, Norah. I wasn't expecting you to get back to me so soon. You got a guy? Really?\" the woman seemed almost as surprised as you were about this. \"We kind of blew up in popularity recently I didn't think we'd get more like, from the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah laughed a little. \"Oh Joan, I'm the best you know. This little guy just got his license paperwork filled out yesterday and he was so eager to help.\" Norah was pulling you off of her wrist and dangling you in front of this 'Joan' woman. She was decently attractive as well, but you couldn't tell how big she was because of her cloths, still you didn't want to be just handed over, you ultimately couldn't do anything about it though as you were dropped into the manicured hand which closed around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you are, I'll have your commission sent and... want your usual? Two hours, I'll give you this time for free for working on such short notice\" Norah bit her bottom lip. and the Goth gave a sly smile and nodded. You had no idea what that meant but it could not be anything good. \"Like I said, we've been really busy so I'll take just a bit you go wait in room four.\" Joan smiled and Norah walked off towards the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the world shifting as she walked into the back room. \"Alright, Number Four, I get that Norah like talked you into this and whatever but from here on out you are mine. Don't worry, I'm sure you'll see the hot ass red head from time to time but unless some hot shot comes in here with the big bucks you don't leave this building. I know your license is general but this is a JOB and I don't want any random slut thinking she can just walk out with her brand new Tiny guy Thong on the fuckin rental fee.\" As she said this she was pulling you out a bit, you saw some instruments on the table that you couldn't fathom the use for, but then she brought down a little pen on your back. You couldn't tell but it was the type that would stay pretty much no matter what unless the remover was applied. even if it got small, there was a big number four stamped on you. \"If you're wondering how much you make, I don't have to answer to you until your license runs out. Now, this should be good enough to where you don't get confused with someone else. I've gotta get you ready for Norah's order though.\" You tried to squirm, you had to at least let her know you didn't want to get used by Norah but this only seemed to make her mad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gonna be difficult with me, that's fine.\" She really wasn't inconvenienced by your struggle at all, she flipped you over and found your semi squished face partially elongated from the stretching your Aunt and her had given you. She had some tweezers prying open your mouth with them and pulling your tongue out. \"Maybe next time don't struggle and I can make this a bit more pleasant. as it is, newbie like you needs breaking in. I'll probably leave you like this for a while... give the other guys a break at least.\" She rolled her eyes as you attempted to struggle again. She placed your tongue in a bit of glass and then shoved the rest of your body in a similar glass. \"now, this is the part that is unpleasant\" She attached a device to the end of your tongue tube and your body tube. Then you felt it, the suctions,  whatever that device was it was like a vacuum or something and it not only pulled out the air but it was forcefully pulling you out as well. Expansion you didn't think was possible felt like it was going to rip you apart except that you knew that you weren't, there was a little mirror on one side you could see your body and tongue slowly expanding to fill the containers. You were vaguely aware of the Goth filing her nails as she waited, nonchalantly paying you no mind as she forced you through the torture device. You thought you were going to pass out but before you could there was a ding and the suctions stopped. You must have expanded at least six times your height and that wasn't even considering half of that was just your tongue. As the goth released you from the containers your flesh felt tender and sensitive. Your tongue immediately started getting little taste bud goosebumps and Joan rubbed the top of it down until it wasn't quite a cylinder anymore and then started brushing you with something, it stunk like chemicals but when it touched your tongue it tasted like lemon. She got the part where you were only connected by a thin strand and coated both sides before pushing you together with your 'other half' holding you together for a moment before letting go to reveal that they were now stuck together. \"That aught to keep you from shrinking half way through. Let's see...\" She set you down 'feet' to the table with one of your eyes on the cylinder facing the mirror. Perhaps you had been blocking it out or just hadn't realized what exactly she was doing, but now like this you couldn't deny it any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at you was a pink and flesh colored dildo with a big number four printed on it, you could see your eye on the side as well and some of your features, the top half that was your tongue was like those with the little bumps, your taste buds naturally forming in such a way. Joan came back with a thin metal rod with a cap on the end picking you up a in a gentle hold your pain spiked as she pressed the metal into you slowly slightly displacing you but finally clicking your body into the cap. You whimpered a bit as she turned the dial to test and sure enough your whole body was vibrating. \"perfect, alright number four. Sorry I don't have your actual name yet, Norah will have all that stuff sent to me by tomorrow I'm sure. Whatever your name is, You're finally ready! I bet you're just shaking from excitement now that you finally get to go back to her hmm, I'm sure that's what most of her prospects are after anyway.\" Joan snorted as she closed you into a box that shot you up through a tube and landed you gently on your side. You sit in the dark for a moment as the door opens...</span></div></div>",

Since you did get a general use license that makes things so much easier! Now hang tight and we will be there soon,\u201d your aunt said the last sentence with a giggle since obviously you had to hang tight being a bracelet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your aunt jogged, you couldn\u2019t help but worry what the reason could be for the signature. They already had forced a general usage license on you, just what else did they need? You hoped that having Aunt Norah there would be helpful but as you were swung back and forth that hope dwindled further away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short 15 minute jog, you and your aunt were passing through the door of Isabella\u2019s office. You heard Norah give greetings and start explaining why she was here and how wonderful having a helpful nephew like you was. Despite the situation, you couldn\u2019t help but smile at the praise your aunt was giving you. By the time she had removed you from her wrist and allowed you to reform on the table you were almost embarrassed from her praise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella smiled at you as you popped into shape and slid 3 papers your way. \u201cThis is really very simple Hunter, as we previously discussed I was not sure when I would have the time for your actual usage license to be formally written up and so we settled on the general use so you could be of help in the meantime. I have here three different versions drawn up from what we discussed, all you need to do is sign the version you want the most and we will have no further paperwork to do! Please proceed quickly as you wonderful aunt has some paperwork I need to finish for her,\u201d Isabella said very curtly and you hurried to check the contracts before you picked up the pen to sign....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was no way you were going to sign a usage licence of your own free will, what was she thinking you would do. You didn't have to wonder for long actually as you looked around them you noticed a few stamps on the desk, from your perspective it was easy to read them. one was a mark for Isabella's signature as she also needed to sign off on this stuff, it was the other one that caught your eye. An easily replaceable one with a tiny sized stamp, your signature was on it seemingly copied from some other paperwork you had signed in the past, and near that another contract she hadn't slid over to you, one with her own name on it and a big bold permanent on the top if you 'stayed behind' to 'take more time' she would just force your fake signature onto one of her own documents. you could practically hear her saying those exact words to Norah to get her to leave without you, if you didn't want to end up as her Thong for the rest of your life you'd need to bite the bullet and sign one of these documents, she clearly thought you wouldn't even consider it. Norah thankfully could get very distracted trying to go over paperwork so you had some time to consider your options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to the contract on the far Right you noticed it was a permanent licence, the kind that could only be cancelled if BOTH party's agreed to end the licence seeing that every single box of 'uses' was checked off including 'other' you tried to find the name. Becky Wallace... you didn't know who that was actually, but Wallace was Quinn's last name so maybe they were related, you couldn't be sure since you hadn't talked to Quinn all that much. There was a possibility that Quinn's mom was as nice as Quinn seemed to be but you couldn't trust a total stranger with listening to your story so that you could revoke the usage licence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind you moved on to the next contract, you were at first excited that this one only had a one year long tenure, the kind that couldn't be annulled until it expired but was immediately cancelled after one year's time. Going down to the boxes of course every single box was filled in even Other, although on this one a few of the 'favorites' were selected which would tell the holder which objects the 'willing' tiny wanted to be used as the most in particular Sex Toy and Insole were highlighted. You were confused as to why this one was so specific in it's marks until you got to the name... Helen Woods, no wonder she thought you wouldn't sign these, this was an even worse option than trusting yourself to a stranger. If Helen got this licence... you couldn't be sure how she would react but you couldn't imagine the 'giving you what you want' version would be any better than the 'how dare you young man' version. Sure it wouldn't last forever but... Helen easily misinterpret this as a 'gift' for her birthday and go wild or be very angry that you would 'take the easy route' in life by being a 'thing'. You had to hope the last one would be the least awful because you would rather go on the off chance a stranger listened to you than face your mother's wrath for a whole year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother permanent, off to a bad start and the boxes weren't any less filled than the last two although on this one everything was marked as a favorite, theoretically that did nothing but it seemed strange that it was like that. Then the name. Norah Woods you couldn't figure out how she had managed to make what you could only consider to be the worst choices in such a short time, did she just spend all of yesterday digging into you for revenge because you bothered her friend at the beach... You couldn't dwell on that now, you could hear the footsteps outside the door, if you didn't sign now it would be that petty girl that owned you, a split second of indecision on what to do but forcing the bad feeling out of your throat you grabbed the pen and scrawled your name on Aunt Norah's contract just as the two women rejoined you in the room. Norah sitting behind you in the guest chair and Isabella taking her seat across from you and snatching the three contracts from the desk before Norah could read them at all. She hummed casually as she flipped through them until she paused at the one you signed, almost fluster by seeing a signature there. but she regained composure and simply shredded the other two smiling as she slid over to her computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now normally this would take longer but since Norah has been such a help I think I can print your cards right now since both of you are here\" She gave a sweet smile that was very sinister to you as you slowly watched confusion turn to excitement on Norah's face but she had to make sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both.. you mean the other one is for... me?\" She asked casting nervous glances at you. Isabella nodded and the squeal Norah let out drowned out your plea for her to calm down. You tried to talk but Norah was suddenly asking a bunch of questions \"What duration did he choose? how many things? Do I get to decide? What-\" You could still hear her going on with the endless questions as she had leaned u and smashed you under her boobs to get closer to Isabella but she was soon shushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The card will show everything and his copy will be encased in yours as well as on record.\" She waved a plastic card to cool it off. \"For some reason your approval went through fast enough to get the laminated card so here you go.\" she gave the card over to Norah who then sat back in her chair with you left crushed on the desk. You could see her face getting more excited and turning a bit red as she looked at all of the 'agreed' forms She tucked the card away and peeled you up before you could reform on your own totally pinching you into non-verbal flatness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I was right when I said you wanted to be more helpful to me, more than I thought even.\" She looked back at Isabella who had a slight smile and she swallowed a little before shuffling off to the bathroom with you. She idly pulled at you as if she still couldn't believe it. \"Wow, wow wow! oh my gosh Hunter, how did you know I always wanted my own tiny man to-gah everything. I was always too nervous to ask guys cause like, duh I forget things and I didn't want to leave some guy where he doesn't want cause I forgot.\" The irony that exact thing had happened to you many times was not lost. \"But you signed up to be my toy <b>forever</b> and do <b>anything</b> cause you want it too. I mean, even when you had that general I wasn't gonna do this since you had places to be but now that I know this is what you want I'm going to do <b>everything</b> you checked off that you wanted. I need to figure something out until I get home so for now you can be...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"My super special Hunter Insole!\" She wasn't giving you any room to talk, her brain having already decided your signature was all she needed to do whatever she wanted without even talking to you and by technicality right now that was true. You had just signed your body over to your ditsy aunt who apparently was even more enthusiastic about it than you had anticipated at first. The yanking she was doing had managed to pull you out to a good length and width and she giggled when she got a look at your stretched features turning you around and letting you see yourself. She had made a sort of oval with you that looked roughly like an insole but you looked like you had been trying to make a funny face as your tongue was comically pulled out and one of your eyes was half closed with your arm having been crushed right under it giving the impression you had been doing that thing where you pull your face skin down and taunt someone. You tried to make some noise but since your tongue was out so far it barely came out as a whine and some light wiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down Hunter, I was just finishing up. Since we went off my usual route to come here it's only an hour jog. Only double my typical distance from the house! I bet now that you're with me I could even get my jog distance longer in a shorter time, isn't that great Hunter, maybe we'll make it back even faster.\" She easily misinterpreted your struggles as cries of excitement as she pulled her right foot out of it's shoe you could see that in the AC steam was rising from the shoe the smell hit you as soon as the hot air did. Was she boiling her foot in onions every night! your eyes started to water from the smell, as she slid you into the shoe you noticed your face part was in the heel allowing you to see out but you could feel your legs were bent back so only your crotch was probably under the toes but your stomach took up it's place under the ball of her foot. \"This is gonna be the best, I can't wait to try you out! I wonder what I'll like you best as, I know you put down that you loved <b>everything</b> so I guess I just gotta break you in.\" Hearing her causally talk about how she was excited to use you and 'break you in' was almost as bad as seeing the damp 'white' sock replace her face, the heavy use was evident as the sock had obviously been worn thin around the ball and heel and the dark spots indicating where her toes were. She was moving at normal speed but it almost seemed to slide over you in slow motion, the toes touching down on your tongue and then dragging all the way to the end of the shoe leaving behind a layer of filth and sweat mixed together the salt and dirt taste causing you to convulse slightly until her foot fully filled the shoe and sealed you in. She must have felt it though because she said something you couldn't hear from inside the shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with her foot fully inserted the heat started to turn up and the excess sweat from her sock was squeezing out with every step and absorbing directly into your body. You tried to focus on a plan to contact Norah or... anyone to explain what had happened to her, you feared that if you didn't it would take a very long time for you to make any progress. You were floored as soon as she started moving though, every step broke your focus as her heel squashed your head and then she rolled up to the ball and stomped your stomach, and she was just walking out of the office. She stopped moving for a moment and you could hear Isabella's voice, you only got a couple words but then you heard Norah respond \"Insole.\" and then Isabella's full belted laugh as Norah started moving again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious she was outside immediately, the sauna inside her shoe turned into a full blown steam cooker and then after a small pause, probably to put on music, She took off in a blur of motion to your perspective. There was no more time to think, only brace for the next step as each lift off 'knocked the wind' out of you and you started actively trying to drink the sweat as you were sure it was filling up the shoe somehow. If you could have you'd be screaming your head off, the experience even worse than you had even thought. despite how clumsy she was you had never actually been trapped inside of Norah's shoes before and having it now was not giving you a good feeling about your tenure as Norah's personal tiny if she continued not even trying to listen to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime was a blur, you were sure that several hours had passed as the steps started to blend together and finally your body had absorbed enough from the socks (even if you couldn't taste anything but foot anymore) that you didn't feel like you were drowning in sweat. In actuality it had only been about fifteen minutes, your delirious stomped on mind was begging for some sort of even futile release. You tried screaming and found that it made your mind feel a little better to shout in frustration and so you continued to do it, causing your body to slightly vibrate against the assaulting foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah was bopping to her favorite workout play list when she felt the little buzz from her shoe, it felt kind of nice like it relaxed her foot a little. \"Aww Hunter, you were already doing such a great job as an insole supporting me and soaking up all my sweat, isn't it exhausting shaking like that just for a little massage? Then again you did gift yourself to me so I guess putting in your full effort to make me satisfied is something you'd do.\" Not that you could hear but Norah was musing to herself. At some point you gave up on screaming having been screamed out but by then Norah had stopped jogging, you looked up at your new Owner... your Aunt as her face hovered about the shoe for a moment, you were already so exhausted from the jog you were  having trouble telling if she was looking at you until she said...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gazing up at this carefree giantess you legally belonged to, you expected to see a ceiling indicating she had taken you inside. Instead you saw past her joyous expression only to see the bright blue sky overhead. You wondered why she had stopped if she wasn't home yet but as if reading your mind, correctly for once, she seemed to answer your question calling down, \"Phew, alright Hunter, that's about half way! I've gotta say I can already tell this is going to be one of my favorite things to use you as. I mean, usually I have to stop at this bench to air out and cool down my feet since by now they're usually soaked; but thanks to you I can just change what side you're on and save some time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had just gotten to the point where the sweat was manageable within Norah's shoe, and now you were about to be subjected to another one? Your body put up no resistance as Norah pried you off the bottom of the inside of her shoe and shoved you into it's twin. You squeezed into the sweltering tomb with a squelch as the sweat that was already pooling at the bottom sloshed with your addition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your face still tucked in her heel, you saw Norah giving herself a tiny massage with an investigative look. \"Wow! The foot you were with a minute ago is only damp, yet my other one is totally drenched! I mean, really, see for yourself!\" Norah hovered her uncleaned foot over your prison, wiggling her toes for effect as she showcased just how much worse for wear it was without your assistance. Clenching her foot, Norah's sock was squeezed into the crevices of her toes, causing a toxic downpour to fall free from it's fabric, only to land directly onto your exposed face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oopsie! That was a bit more dramatic flair than I was going for!\" Norah's giggles provided a tormenting backdrop as you fought the salty stinging in your crushed eyes. Actually peering down at you, Norah saw your grimacing expression and issued a response, \"Aww, am I chatting too much? Or do ya just miss my warm foot~? I'm sorry, honey, let's get back on the road!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wasting anymore time, Norah tucked her foot back into her shoe and gave it a few good stamps to make sure it was nice and snug. Not needing any approval from the little pad cushioning her foot, the gorgeous redhead went back into her jog down the road, totally oblivious to the torment each and every step was inflicting on her little nephew she loved so much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mere fifteen minutes later, an eternity when spent bearing Norah's weight and the burden of soaking up her fresh sweat, your aunt was seated on her couch attempting to cool down after such a grueling run. Wanting to get your approval after such a good first use of you legally as hers, Norah untied her shoes and grabbed each heel, pulling them off and letting them thud lazily on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the one she thought housed you, Norah was puzzled to not see a smiling face beaming up at her. Instead she just saw the usual bottom of her shoe. \"I was sure he was in this one...\" Norah mumbled before checking her other shoe. \"Maybe he got jammed inside?\" Norah leaned in to get a closer look towards the front of the shoe only to get hit with a hot wave of her own odor. \"Oh my! Why on Earth would he sign up to be put in <i>there</i>?\" She was blowing away the stench with her hand before a lightbulb went off in her head as she answered herself, \"Wow, he really loves me<i> that much</i> that he'd deal with all this just to make my run a little easier...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah was restraining cries of joy at how she must be the luckiest woman to ever live when she felt a familiar tingling against the bottom of her foot. Your feeblest attempts at getting her attention seemed to pay off as her weight came off you. Expecting to be peeled off her dirty sock, you instead heard your aunt's voice speak down in surprise, \"Oh, there you are Hunter! Giving my foot a big ole' hug after the jogs over, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah bit her lip and felt her thighs squeeze together as her mind started to wander with the silence of the room. \"You know, it's just you and me now...I bet you're just dying to be of <i>use </i>to your <i>favorite </i>person in all sorts of ways\" Norah spoke out softly and with a sultry touch as she wiggled herself into the couch. You tried to shout out \"NO!\" but only got a mouthful of sock fuzz in the process. Norah released a light moan as you pressed right up against a sore spot on her sole and decide, \"Alright, <i>fine</i>, you can stay there for a <i>little </i>while longer. I had a lot more <i>fun </i>stuff to experiment with you lined up but this should be fine while I rest up. Whaddya say you give me some more massaging as thanks for being such a good owner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Norah call herself your owner sent a blood chilling shudder through your body. Sure that's what she legally was and you knew that, but hearing the powerful title slip from her plush lips made your heart sink into your stomach. Feeling your body lift into the air, Norah moved her feet to rest on her living room ottoman and you heard the garble of the TV being flipped on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing you wanted to do was give this misunderstanding broad what she wanted, but you needed to push yourself free from her foot before you could get to work on reforming. Pushing your arms and legs as best as you could against the sole, Norah cooed in satisfaction, unable to stop herself from closing her eyes in bliss. Ignoring her pleased expressions, you kept at prying yourself further and further. As time went on you had to deal with Norah's playful other foot mindlessly rubbing against you, a simple and subconscious act for Norah that spelt disaster for you, but you pressed on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took the better part of an hour but you finally felt your body popping loose from all the damage Norah had done with her light jog. This time, Norah's other foot actually helped you as it caught the gap between you and her sock and ripped you free. Plopping down a carbon mold the shape of Norah's foot, toes and all, you went to work prying your limbs free and coming back to your human form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding back at your mighty one inch form, you took in your surroundings to make a plan, only to see that Norah was fast asleep! Her legs were outstretched towards you of course, her tall and menacingly powerful feet still stood right next to you, their wicked stench still lingering all over. You wanted to give Norah the benefit of the doubt and blame the smell on her shoes or maybe her well-worn out socks, but with her tendencies and your history, you sighed in remorse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou called out to Norah as well as you could but she didn't have the slightest reaction. You considered shoving or punching at her foot but you figured that was asking to get smeared under her heel if she perceived it as an \"itch\". Your only real option seemed to be to make your way on up to her face and see if you could wake her up with your shouts from there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped as you looked at the long fall to the floor. Scaling this ottoman down didn't seem feasible. That left one real option. Crawling your way up her ankle, you stood atop her shin and looked across her bare legs at the long bridge before you. One step at a time, you journeyed over the gap between the couch and her footrest, Norah's smooth and supple skin being no help in preventing you from falling. You only prayed she didn't move in her sleep, or even wake up and stand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your caution to thank, you made it past Norah's knees only to reach a newly ominous sight. Your sleeping aunt's legs were crossed together, her broad and thick thighs pouring over each other as they squished their juicy flesh into one another. You saw beads of sweat pooling together only to roll down and plop on her floor. Gulping at the challenge ahead, not only was it dangerous, but it also led to the intimidatingly embarrassing region of her crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Norah's tired murmurs ahead, you just hoped you'd make it to Norah's face okay... </span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Standing on your aunt's right knee, you saw the glistening smooth expanse of her thick thighs ahead of you. With her legs crossed, you saw the area where her thighs met squashed together, creating a crevice where beads of sweat were pooling together. To any normal sized person, it would probably just look like a light sheen of sweat. But from your perspective, you knew if you fell, you'd be getting properly soaked. You shuddered, realizing you'd need extra caution. The only way to set the record straight was to wake Norah up and explain you didn't really want to be her property.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a few steps and took note of how slippery it was. Norah's legs were already buttery smooth, but with the added perspiration it was like trying to walk on oil. About halfway across, you tripped, causing you to face plant into Norah's supple flesh and yet hug it for dear life as to not fall off. The heat of Norah's thigh was radiating onto your face, and the salty atmosphere made your neck hurt as you tried to distance your face as far as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you slipped towards the side, you gazed over her thigh only to make out the sight of a discarded pair of underwear, a pair of knee socks, and a foot massager, all scattered out on the floor beneath the couch. You winced, imagining all the mishaps Norah would put you through if she found you on any one of those and got the wrong idea, <i>or worse</i>, didn't even see you when she used them. You noted it was quite a mess for someone as active as Norah, but you suppose you shouldn't be surprised considering her forgetful and carefree attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to meet your fate down there, you scrambled back up onto her thigh and regained your footing. Prepared to continue towards Norah's hip area, much to your dismay, you let loose a sigh at managing to get back on your feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you put yourself at ease however, Norah murmured cutely in her sleep and began to move. You gazed up at her face to see her eyes still closed, but her legs were moving beneath you! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing from having her legs stretched in front of her, Norah lifted her titanic legs up and moved them onto the couch, opting to lay on her side to get more comfy. What this resulted in for you was her other thigh crashing down on you from above, sandwiching you with crushing force from above. Norah let out a pleased sigh as she was satisfied with the transition, all while you were trying to push your way free from her squashing thighs. Your entire lower body was pinned between them, and now with gravity working in a new direction, the droplets of sweat began running down from Norah's left thigh only to splash onto you and threaten to drown you in their overwhelming presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sputtered against the toxic residue, trying without much success to wipe the stinging fluid from your eyes. Why did Norah have to sweat so damn much? Why couldn't she have taken a shower after her run? You briefly imagined Norah carrying you with her into the shower and felt a larger sense of gratitude that this was your current situation rather than the alternative. Perhaps her being asleep was much better than this hyper-excitable, overbearing ditz being awake and continuing to try and subject you to a never-ending tour of every inch of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Norah's thighs being so slick actually worked in your body. With your minor strength, you were still able to push your flattened form free, your body fluttering to a splat at the crater Norah's weight was making in the cushy couch. Making quick work in reforming, you realized scaling her thighs at this point was hopeless. You'd never be able to get a decent grip as sweat continued to cascade down towards you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing you needed to keep making your way towards her face to get closer to where she could hear you, you trekked towards the only spot you could actually climb, her shorts covered hips. It was only now you realized Norah was turned with her back to you and the rest of the room, and that meant her swell of a rear was pushed out as your only point of leverage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned as you grasped at the fibers of her shorts, wincing as you felt the moist threads gush under your grip. For once, Norah's ass stretching her bottoms to their absolute limits was a good thing as it meant the fibers were easy to grasp, being spaced out just enough. On the flip side, the awful part was the absolutely steaming atmosphere surrounding Norah's hot and sweaty backside. You attempted to hold your breath to prevent from breathing in the suffocating fog of stench coming from the gorgeous redheaded giantess, but it was no use as the climbing was extremely strenuous and you were forced to breathe at a rapid pace to keep your stamina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou must've been seventy-five percent to the top when you heard another whisper from Norah. Feeling the glutes beneath the shorts lightly flex, you scrambled to get higher in a last mad dash. Unfortunately, even your <i>sleeping </i>aunt was faster. Rolling onto her butt, Norah laid on her back, suffocating you against mounds of booty flesh. You cried out for any kind of mercy as you'd been stalled by set-back after set-back courtesy of this unaware, sleeping, woman. The same woman who held the paperwork you signed saying you <i>wanted </i>her to use you as nothing more than a useful contrivance to satisfy her every waking desire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Norah was in blissful dreamland. She had had such a productive day thus far. Reconnecting with her favorite nephew had landed her the ultimate privilege of a permanent usage license, making her a newly proud owner of a tiny. Not to mention a tiny that she had such <i>strong  </i>connection with over so many years of familial bonding, and bonding in...other ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would probably be a little too embarrassed to subject a stranger to the overbearing and <i>often</i> <b>dirty </b>job she demanded from a tiny in her possession, not to mention her ludicrously ditzy nature, but someone oh-so familiar with her truly was a gift from above. Besides being familiar, the fact she could spread the joy around by fulfilling your deepest desire to be a help to her, more than she had ever realized in the past, gave her a strong feeling of fulfillment she could definitely get used to. With a smile reminiscent of her ecstasy plastered on her face, Norah's large chest rose and fell as she released a cute sigh of pure satisfaction; Totally unaware her little toy was an unwilling prisoner of circumstance currently suffocating under her gigantic sweaty ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now you were wishing you could be anyone but the name on the license, Hunter Woods. In the span of the past hour you had been pounded mercilessly under both of Norah's socked feet, used to soak up their unending waves of perspiration, massaged between them, squashed between your aunt's powerful jiggly thighs, and now buried underneath her titanic booty. And this was all just in the first hour of the duration of your license: the rest of your life. Not to mention she was asleep for half of it for god's sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to hope and pray something would change. You had to set this record straight. All you needed was one big break, for the chance to reach Norah's face and wake her up to explain this was all a BIG misunderstanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if granting this one request, Norah actually rolled onto her side once more. You were grateful she was apparently such a light sleeper, at least while napping. You were still a sticker smooshed against her taut rear, but with a bit of time you managed to reform and finish climbing the hellish mountain that was Norah's post-run ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking across Norah's side was no problem, while her tank top left her tight stomach exposed, you had much less trouble making it across and to her shoulder. You gulped nervously seeing Norah's massive cleavage, dangling there menacingly threatening to swallow you whole if you so much as took one wrong step. But thankfully that wasn't meant to be on this day as climbed Norah's couch arm to come face to face with the familiar sight of your own aunt. Or more accurately, her glossy lips, as they were larger than you and took up most of your vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Norah! Wake up! I need to talk to you!\" You called out, cupping your hands over your mouth to try and amplify your meek voice. You only heard a tiny murmur from Norah as her lightly smiling face didn't react at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou released a defeated sigh as you realized you'd need to get right next to her ear to have a chance at waking her up. You looked around for any kind of stray strands of hair you could climb, but seeing her hair tied back tightly into a ponytail, you looked at your only other option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching the curvy redhead's lips, you wished you had any other option, but resigned that this was probably as close as you were going to get to a chance. You reached a hand out and felt the plush, warm, and inviting feeling of her silky lips, but took hold to try and climb atop her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing you couldn't take into account was how hungry your sweets-loving aunt would be after her run. You were perched exactly halfway up her bottom lip when her lips clamped down on your body, hard. A steaming hot, and slimy presence soon joined the assault as Norah's tongue shot out to coat her lips in a fresh slather of saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmmmm...I'll have...vanilla...\" Norah slowly murmured out, answering why she had to lick you now of all times. The words booming from Norah's mouth threatened to burst your eardrums and washed steamy hot breath over you, despite her speaking in a mere whisper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah continued to smother you in her lips, occasionally having her overwhelming tongue snake out to probe you while hungry moans groaned on. You were flat as could be, a tiny spot on your aunt's plush lips, trying to keep as much gooey saliva from getting in your poor mouth as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this grueling torture droned on for another twenty minutes, Norah's sweet dreams seemed to finally be beat by her real hunger as she awoke and stretched her arms above with a long yawn that blasted you in sweltering air once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooo that nap was just what I needed after such a great run. I am dying for a bite to eat though...\" Norah was speaking to herself and swung her legs off the couch to allow her feet to plant on the floor. Wiggling her toes in their socked confines, Norah felt something tickling her mind. Something that had to do with why her feet felt so totally refreshed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Hunter! Sorry my little toy I forgot I left you down there! Oh, you know me!\" Norah tapped her foot on the floor a few times for emphasis, hoping to drum into you what she meant by 'down there' and giggling at her forgetfulness that she knew you had so much experience with. \"It's so sweet you don't blame me for being a bit scatterbrained sometimes, hopefully for you if I ever forget you it's because you're stuck to me somewhere! Which I guess we know is most likely since you're so attracted to me like a cute little magnet!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah finished her self-indulging speech, one you were forced to endure from your vantage point of her mouth, when she finally checked the bottoms of her socks for you. \"Huh? Hunter? Where are ya, little guy?\" Norah checked her other foot and swiped at her rear before huffing out. \"Oh geesh, don't tell me I've lost you already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe irony of that right after her speech was lost on her as you attempted to make a tiny squirm. Norah's sensitive lips actually picked up your vibration and Norah's eyebrows raised in surprise!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? What's this lil bump?\" Norah mused, crushing her lips together in an attempt to get a feel at what the heck was on her lip. You were smeared in their crushing embrace and ground back and forth as Norah took her sweet time in probing you before she took a finger and peeled you free from the hot and loud prison that was the opening to her mouth. Perched between her thumb and forefinger, you dangled in front of Norah's curious eye, begging for recognition so you weren't trashed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gross, what is this, some bit of food? Not very ladylike of me...\" Norah said preparing to flick you away carelessly. It was only your last ditch attempt at a squirm that perked Norah's attention that maybe you were slightly more than a scrap. Good thing too, as if you had been tossed, <i>who knows</i> where you would've landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunter! Is that you?! What were you doing all the way up on my face?\" Norah's head tilted in a look of curiosity that soon warped more into confusion. \"Up on my.....lips?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough blurred vision, you could see Norah's face reddening up to a point it nearly matched her hair. You tried to reform your mouth or anything but Norah really had done a number on you with her lip-grinding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made your way all the way up from the coffee table just to rub up on my lips?\" Norah's eyes were darting around and you worried where her mind was wandering. \"Hunter you were...you were making out with me while I was asleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your stomach drop like a rock as Norah let her statement hang in the air. You tried to fight, only managing to swing your flattened body a tiny bit in Norah's grasp. \"I...I had no idea you liked me...like that! I guess I should have known...wanting to...<i>be mine</i> and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But kissing me...you really let your actions speak louder than words. It's just so much to take in!\" You fought with relentless intensity against Norah. You couldn't let her keep making things up based on the awful situations you were coincidentally finding yourself in! Without any way of speaking though, you were forced to dangle helplessly at her mercy as she bit her lip in thought with a dark blush all over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really wasn't expecting this so soon, Hunter. But I have to tell you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Acceptance. Norah explodes with overbearing emotion at the fact you love and accept her fully. She somehow has even more vigor to use you now, and in all new ways since she isn't worried you'll feel differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Rejection. Norah still loves you, but only as family. She's a bit put-off by this development but she legally feels responsible for you and your use now. It's all business now, but she still wants you to be happy, so she continues to use you heavily but with less to no interaction from now on. And perhaps she can try and teach you to fall out of love once you see how relentless she can be in using you for her every need.</span></div></div>",

I really only think of you as my object now. I just don\u2019t have the same romantic feelings for you that you have for me!\u201d Norah said to you, still dangling precariously between her thumb and pointer finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t believe your ears. Norah always had a tendency to misconstrue situations as well as certainly misunderstand your feelings at any given moment, but this one took the cake. You had spent the past day painfully crushed and swamped with sweat by practically every part of her body. You desperately wished that you didn\u2019t approach her lips earlier, as it seemed like that was the final evidence to push her over the edge into believing another bizarre reason for your behavior. Of course, in reality, the literal only reason you ever approached this titan of a ditz was to either get her help or to simply remind her of your existence. But of course she didn\u2019t realize that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a fear in the back of my head that this moment would come someday, Hunter. Oh god this is all my fault.\u201d Norah exclaimed, accidentally shaking her fist dramatically and unknowingly whipping your flattened body around like a piece of string. \u201cEver since you\u2019ve been little I\u2019ve been too careless with throwing my body around whenever I was around you! After all, I knew you were such a good sport about my forgetfulness that you didn\u2019t really mind if you ended up under my toes or between my cheeks or anything else like that. But I never considered the possibility that all of those moments were unintentionally causing you to develop feelings for me! Ugh, it all makes so much sense now.\u201d Norah\u2019s idiotic rant drove fear straight into your heart. In no shape or form did the countless hours you spent decimated under her body make you begin to feel any level of genuine attraction to the woman who was tormenting you. Of course you always knew Norah was objectively an attractive woman, but that still never meant that you wanted to be romantically involved with her! Once more you begged for your mouth to open up so you could explain, but it couldn\u2019t, instead Norah\u2019s words filled the silence once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope I\u2019m not breaking your tiny little heart Hunter but I just don\u2019t see you the same way. Especially now with your usage license, I really consider you more of an object than anything else now. And don\u2019t get me wrong you\u2019re the sweetest most helpful item I\u2019ve ever owned, but it would be kind of weird to try to date a random useful thing, right? I mean imagine if I tried to start a relationship with a tissue or a sock or something! That would be pretty strange!\u201d Norah said, stunning you once more with how unknowingly callous she was acting towards your existence. Clearly she still liked you as a family member, but at the same time she was quite literally referring to you as an object and directly comparing you to tissues and socks. You couldn\u2019t believe your ears. The last thing you needed was Norah to start forgetting to treat you like a human, and it seemed like that was on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promise I\u2019ll uphold our contract together and use you as much as you want to be used! Eventually your feelings towards me will fade away, Hunter, I promise that too. Maybe if I stop holding back and really push you to your limits you can see a bit of the grosser side of me or something! Like, I know my ass looks nice and all but it can literally become a swamp at the drop of a hat. Look!\u201d Norah stood up and struggled to shimmy her sweat-soaked, stretched shorts free from her cheeks. But in a moment she did, each of her globes popping free and jiggling like no tomorrow. Then came the true horror. With her shorts sitting just below her cheeks, Norah grabbed your upper body with her other hand and stretched you out roughly, drastically increasing your surface area into a still relatively small rectangle. Without another word she slammed your now square body into her doughy cheek and your body\u2019s absorbent qualities immediately went to work. You felt her warm, salty sweat begin to soak into every square millimeter of your current towel-like form as she scrubbed one cheek, then the other, before finally plunging you aggressively between her buns. Nearly her entire hand disappeared up to her wrist in her crack, with you miles deeper. In here you felt the true source of the river of sweat that had been soaking her entire ass. And in mere moments your cursed body had sponged every drop of it up. Norah then pulled you out and swiped a hand across her now dry ass, her eyes opening wide with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly cow, Hunter, I forgot how good you are at that. My ass is never this dry!\u201d Norah exclaimed, clearly briefly forgetting the point of what she just did to you. After a moment more of amazement it seemed like she resumed her train of thought, \u201cOh yeah, but see how nasty that was?! I promise I\u2019ll use you for all of the nastiest uses I can think of and your feelings for me will fade away in no time! Plus I get to really use your awesome little body to the fullest, a win-win for both of us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah was ecstatic with her idiotic plan. She felt like she was now somehow doing you a favor by exposing you to some sort of even grosser side of her that she thought you weren\u2019t aware of. You cursed god, cursed the shrinking pandemic from before you were born, anything you could think of at that moment as you felt your rag-like body dangle lifelessly and soaked through with sweat from Norah\u2019s ass crack. With Norah\u2019s mind set to scrub away your perceived romantic feelings for her by forceful exposure to her darkest needs, your future seemed quite bleak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Hunter, this is for your own good. I would say I\u2019m sorry but I know deep down you still want to be useful to me no matter what. I am sorry for accidentally leading you on for so long though, I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me someday for that. But for now, let\u2019s work on Operation Gross Exposure! I think the next thing you should experience should be\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201c\u2026my hairband.\u201d The smile that slipped onto Norah\u2019s face with that comment was apologetic, though not for the reasons you may have hoped. \u201cI know it\u2019s probably a bit tame for you but I promise it will just be temporary. Give me some time to think and I\u2019ll come up with something much better.\u201d She bit her lip at that, her eyes twinkling with a combination of child-like joy and a deep-seated desire to make you hers. \u201cAh, but, you did select accessory as a favourite as well, so hopefully this will be fun for you anyway. I know I\u2019ll enjoy just having you with me and knowing you\u2019re mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was bad. Really bad. The gentle and affection smile on your aunt\u2019s face made you want to cry out in frustration as her warm hands continued to run across your body, kneading and stretching as she continued to chew at her lip. You knew that if you could just make her understand that you hated this, that you didn\u2019t want to be used, that she would stop. That she loved you enough not to take advantage of Isabella\u2019s cruelty. But you also knew that even if you could speak to her, with the way your luck usually ran she would likely misunderstand. So many times in the past you had been mistaken as a willing little man ready to serve her needs. By now, the idea of her nephew as a boy who would do anything to help her was firmly planted in Norah\u2019s subconscious. A self-reinforcing belief that would have readily seen you used by her even without your new permanent licence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you were glad that your initial use would be as something less intense that you had feared, you knew that it was only the prelude for what was to come. Already the blush on the redhead\u2019s face was intense enough that it was reaching her ears, and her breath was coming out in short hot pants as she raised you to her face, bathing you in warmth. You shuddered at what may come as you tried to speak, but already Norah\u2019s fingers were at work on your body, and you didn\u2019t even have the chance to make a peep before her thumb blurred your mouth into uselessness. Grasping hands were slick with nervous sweat as they grasped your limbs and pulled, stretching you out before beginning to twist your arms and legs together as a single mass. The thumb descended once more, and what was left of your face was pushed down into your chest, smoothing out your features until it was no longer clear which end was which, only your eyes remaining intact enough to provide a tiny clue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she worked, Norah began to speak again, her voice hushed and intended for you alone. \u201cIt must have taken a lot of bravery to be so honest with what you wanted Hunter. I\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d She sighed, a self-deprecating sound. \u201cI\u2019ve been such a coward. Even though you were always so helpful to me, I could never admit that I\u2026 that I have always been interested in you. Not just as my darling little nephew, but as a tiny man who has done so much for me and who I\u2026 who I just wanted to have all to myself.\u201d She sucked her lower lip for a moment, leaving it slightly red as her dexterous fingers began to twist and pinch your body into a more cylindrical form. \u201cEvery time you agreed to take on one of my jobs I couldn\u2019t help but think that I didn\u2019t want to share you. That you were just for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of Norah\u2019s fingers were working together now, pulling and stretching to form you into a broader circle as she continued to spill her heart to her \u2018willing\u2019 nephew. \u201cI always told myself that I mustn\u2019t. That family was more important than whatever my base instincts might be telling me to do. Even if part of me always knew you wanted it as well.\u201d She smiled again, soft and loving and chilling you to the bone. \u201cThere were so many times when I would find you beneath me, or stuck to something of mine, or replacing something of mine. So many \u2018accidents\u2019.\u201d She chuckled. \u201cI was such a fool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could well remember many of those so-called \u2018jobs\u2019 Norah had sent you on, and had you been given the option back then to go on the job or just stay with your aunt, you would have picked the redhead in an instant. But, you had never realised back then that these kinds of thoughts were being directed towards you, and now you wondered just what could have happened to you back then if things had gone differently. You rapidly began to review years of past discussions, wondering just where you had gone wrong to generate the lingering basis of such an ingrained delusion. Was this the result of Tracy\u2019s actions from back then? Or had these thoughts been there from the start?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to wriggle, to pass on some kind of message at least, but Norah was already pulling her hair back into a loose bun with one hand, as the other brought you closer and she placed a single lingering kiss on your stretched-out form. The remains of your face and half your chest where pressed into the pillowy mass of the redhead\u2019s lips as a blast of warm air washed over you from a single shaky breath. Then you were moving again as you were brought around behind your new owner and slipped around the waiting bun, your last view of the outside world being a bird\u2019s eye view of the bulbous booty below before you snapped into place and everything went dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time Norah had used her cute nephew as an object, knowingly or otherwise, but this time she felt a pleasant chill run up her spine as she let go and confined you to her hair. Before it had always been a temporary thing. Even when you had agreed to days or weeks of use there had always been a time limit to dread. Now though, there was no longer any need to hold back. More than that, there was a legal imperative for her to act. To not use you would be to violate your rights in accordance with Baker\u2019s Law. To deny you the right to be what you wanted to be. Before, a misguided sense of propriety had held her back. Now better informed, it compelled her to act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to go so far as to get this licence to make me see Hunter.\u201d Hands now free, your aunt retrieved the licence from her pocket and ran her thumb across it with a sense of reverence, pausing as the digit came to rest on your own tiny card embedded in her own. \u201cBut I promise, from now on I\u2019m going to do everything you want me to do. You\u2019ll come with me everywhere, be with me always, and I\u2019ll use you for everything I can.\u201d Hazel eyes ran down the seemingly endless list once more as warmth filled her at just how much you wanted to be with her. \u201cI swear, we won\u2019t miss a single thing on this list. Even if it takes the rest of my years, I\u2019ll make you as happy as I can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried desperately to respond, but even as you managed to produce a slight vibration you knew it was hopeless. The cushioning layer of your aunt\u2019s hair rendered such slight movements meaningless, and even had she felt them she would likely have thought you were trembling in joy. Every word she spoke drove you further into despair as you realised there may never again come a time when someone would treat you as an actual person. That as far as the rest of the world, and the law, was concerned, you were Norah\u2019s property now. An object to be used as she saw fit. Even her kind words did nothing to lift your spirits, knowing her fundamental misunderstandings would turn that goodwill against you. The last words spoken by your aunt as she moved to leave was a gentle \u201cI love you\u201d that made you want to cry. After all, the one thing that wasn\u2019t on that list was a request to be human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella raised her head as your aunt stepped back into her office, suppressing a smirk at the blush still colouring the older woman\u2019s face and the fact that you were nowhere to be seen. \u201cAll set? Already putting the little guy to good use?\u201d In response, the redhead turned her head slightly to show off her hair, indicating your location with a shy smile. The corrupt licensing officer was a bit disappointed with such a tame use but smiled slyly as Norah went on to explain that she was keeping you there while she made plans for the future, and that you would get much more use later. To your aunt, it was confirmation that she would follow the law. To Isabella it was music to her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would forever surprise you how people could smile so maliciously without being suspected of ill-content. \u201cWe\u2019ll send out a notification to anyone who received a copy of the previous general licence to let them know of the change. Just so there won\u2019t be any trouble.\u201d Or, more accurately, to make sure that there was no way you could weasel out of this. Isabella motioned to Norah like she was going to share some deep secret, before speaking again in a more conspiratorial tone. \u201cIf you ask me, you\u2019ve got a great one there. I was a bit worried about him wanting to select everything like that, but he was adamant that you were deserving of his everything. I talked him into accepting a general licence temporarily while he thought about it overnight, but his conviction hadn\u2019t changed.\u201d It took all her self-control to keep from laughing as your aunt\u2019s face lit up with obvious glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wished you had the strength to kill Isabella in that moment, wondering what kind of monster could do this to someone just for having the gall to call her and her friend on their obvious lies. Her behaviour seemed so practiced. So assured. Who else had she doomed to this fate? How many of the Baker\u2019s Law tinies in these parts were begging for release as they suffered at the hands of their misled tormentors? While you screamed inside, in the world beyond the women were all smiles as they parted, though Norah\u2019s face was still burning red as she stepped outside and took a deep breath. A shaking hand raised to lay against her chest and feel the rapid beat of her heart as she smiled softly and thought of you, and just how much you had gone through to make sure she was happy. To make sure both of you were. The joyous laugh that escaped her then was one of a woman who had found her purpose in life, and there was a skip to her steps as she headed\u2026</span></div></div>",

If only you weren't sealed to this redhead's hair with your face on the inside, you'd have some idea where you were headed but unfortunately you could only wonder. You gulped, if your aunt was headed straight home that would make her and Isabella the only people on the planet who knew you were legally chained to being Norah's property. Of course Isabella had to cover her tracks and notify everyone of the cancellation of your general use license, now not even your family would think anything of it besides it being a simple paperwork mistake. You could only pray that Norah would be as loud and forthcoming as possible with your family to reveal to them you were in this predicament...that is if they even questioned it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking the horrifying thought from your mind you heard Norah's cheery voice call out, \"Oh hey Hunter, let's make a stop at your old apartment; I'd hate for your roommates to wait up when you won't be needing the space anymore!\" Norah giggled to herself as she noted how little space you took up anyway. Still, she wanted to tie up any loose ends she could for you, to make sure there were as few interruptions as possible in fulfilling all of your deep, dark desires. It would be nice to get some more congratulations on her sort of...<i>union </i>as well. A bright red blush filled Norah's cheeks as she thought of how good that sounded to hear you two tied together. With a perky pace, Norah hurried towards your old domicile; wanting to get home both before dark and as soon as possible to have more time with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cheered mentally as you heard Norah's mention of seeing your roommates. With how things went this morning, you knew for sure they'd be able to clear things up. You finally felt a glimmer of hope return to your mind as you imagined responsible Morgan tearing you from your overly attached aunt and letting you feel like a human again. You felt the hair around you grow a bit damp from Norah working up a good sweat on her run, and you winced praying that moment would come as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally reaching the steps of the apartment, Norah was panting hard and dripping on the doormat of your(former) apartment. Knocking, Norah waited for a moment before the shining face of Avery filled the frame as she opened the door. \"Norah! Welcome back!\" Avery was as warm and welcoming as ever despite the fact she had just met Norah that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah, despite her fatigue, returned a bright smile and responded, \"Ahhh, Avery! Short shift today? I was worried no one would be home and I'd have to leave a note.\" You winced imagining your very fate laying in the hands of a flimsy scrap-paper-note left on your door. A strong gust of wind would've been the difference between years of serving Norah or a bright future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yea, nothing too much today. You look exhausted! Why don't you come in and get some water?\" Norah graciously accepted and stepped in, following Avery to the kitchen with you bouncing along behind her. \"You really worked up quite the sweat, you'll have to show me your routine some day!\" Of course these two scatter-brains were getting along swimmingly as they made small talk about yoga and cardio. As Norah caught her breath and re-hydrated, you felt a tug against your leg as Norah grasped at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, we can totally do a session someday! I bet yoga could be an amazing help in your modeling with enough effort!\" As Norah spoke she was casually pulling you wider and wider until you went from a band to a wide flat square. Running you along her arms and chest to lap at her dripping perspiration, Norah was continuing to chatter on as Avery interrupted, \"Woah, wasn't that your hairband a second ago? What is that, some new MicroFlex tech?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah nervously giggled, that familiar blush returning to her face as she withdrew her usage license with one hand while getting to rubbing you along her waist methodically with her other. Presenting it proudly to Avery, Avery's jaw dropped in shock as she read the tiny print. \"Oh. My. God. You didn't!\" Hearing Avery's reaction made you sigh in relief even while getting a mouthful of Norah sweat. Wouldn't be long now until this was all straightened out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is <b>amazing</b>! I'm so happy for you two! It's so rare a tiny finds someone they're willing to sign themselves over to. And woah, forever at that!\" Easily excitable Avery wasn't even beginning to think that maybe this was some misunderstanding as she leapt at Norah, enveloping her in a great big hug despite Norah's current soaked state. The girls were giddily jumping in each other's embrace, all while you were mushed between them getting flatter by the second as their overwhelmingly bountiful chests smothered you constantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterrupting their mini party, Morgan and Quinn arrived home from work and walked in on their embrace in the kitchen. \"Woah, what's going on in here? And who's this?\" Quinn asked plainly but with a genuine curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally breaking from her hug, Avery introduced Norah and she happily showed off her new usage license. While Norah peeled you off her chest sheepishly, Morgan and Quinn's jaws dropped but this time for the actual right reasons. Collecting their thoughts, the girls made their way to the living room where Norah was getting a bit more comfortable taking her shoes off and plopping on the couch. Morgan was the first to get to business as she sympathetically had her eyes locked on to your flat form laying in Norah's lap. \"I really think there must be some kind of misunderstanding...Hunter straight up fainted when I told him he had a license this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah merely laughed aloud at the idea of that, she imagined your large smile before toppling over in bliss thinking of her. \"Fainted in excitement of course! You girls really don't know my nephew like I do, he's a quirky little guy like that!\" Norah gave you an affectionate squeeze before she continued, \"I mean really, he's been working up to this his whole life!\" Norah had begun sliding you down her smooth thighs and calves before coming to her damp, not to mention sweltering, socked feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think that could possibly be true, he just signed up to move in here after all. He told us all about all these plans he had for the future!\" Quinn stated, actually getting into this seeing as how wrong she thought your aunt was. Norah had begun pressing you firmly into the sole of each foot, forcing you to get a face-full of sweaty fabric that would've dripped onto the carpet if not for your body's desire to soak it all up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, really! Ever since he was little he was always disguising himself as all sorts of useful little objects he somehow knew I needed, or magically getting himself stepped on or sat on. He really was like a little magnet for his favorite auntie!\" Norah affectionately rubbed you deeper into her foot before satisfied with her work at drying her feet. Standing, she turned around and laid you flat on the couch before presenting her rotund booty to you. You watched her black spandex shorts stretch to their limit as Norah's ass widened as she sat. You shook feebly as it descended like a meteor onto your helpless body with a 'Whump!'. Norah bounced in place a bit saying, \"Sorry, I really shouldn't have sat my sweaty behind on your nice couch, but don't worry, Hunter will help us out!\" You screamed into an endless abyss that never produced a single sound at both Norah's words and her noxious tasting ass sweat that was seeping from her shorts onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn and Morgan exchanged nervous glances watching you while Avery nodded along approvingly. Truly Avery had no idea why her sisters were acting so investigative. Hunter signed the paperwork, what's their deal? Morgan spoke up again, \"Really, Miss, I think this is all some big misunderstanding...\" But Norah was quick to cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, I have dozens or maybe even hundreds of stories that would blow your mind! I'm not surprised you're a little confused but trust me when I say I just want what's best for him!\" She felt a tiny itch in her ass and smeared it away with a wiggle on you before continuing, \"Seriously, there was a time when he was little where he snuck into my dang suitcase masquerading as some kind of funny little rag!\" Norah bellowed in laughter and fond remembrance shaking you beneath her, \"He's sneaky too! I was none the wiser for quite a while, giving him more than enough use! I can't remember <i>exactly </i>how or why he eventually revealed himself but I'm sure he was as sad as I was!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems you and Tracy never backtracking with Aunt Norah about her childhood tricks was really coming back to bite you. You swore if you ever got out of this you'd set the record straight. At this point Quinn and Morgan were feeling defeated and Quinn made one last plea, \"If that's the case, why don't we just talk and ask him what he think-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my is it getting dark out already! Yikes, I'd better get going girls! Thanks so much for taking care of Hunter for a bit but he's my responsibility now! I hope to see you girls around, maybe we could do that yoga sesh Avery?\" Norah had peeled you from the couch and was out the door before Quinn could finish her thought or Morgan could protest. You swung in her grip as she took off jogging home. \"Don't worry, Hunter. <i>I know you</i>. I won't let <i>anyone </i>take you from me.\" A chill ran down both your spines but for entirely different reasons. You just prayed your roommates wouldn't give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Morgan, we'll figure something out...\" Quinn patted a dejected Morgan on the back as they watched her run off. Morgan was wholly unconvinced. She saw that forged signature this morning and knew something was amiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah made good on her promises, using you as a shower wash cloth and couch cushion before getting to bed with you tucked deep in her warm and cozy yet suffocating cleavage. Eventually...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Isabella slid the documents towards you with her well manicured hand, she grinned at you, chewing on the gum in her mouth. She blew a bubble at you teasingly and you swear you could see the faint outline of a face before it burst and she drew it back into her mouth. Her full, plump lips closing and blocking the poor unfortunate man she was tormenting from your view.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry though Hunter, if any of these ones don\u2019t suit you I\u2019m sure I\u2019d be able to find another girl who would suit your needs here,\u201d she said this with a smile to Norah, who smiled back. What you noticed that Norah didn\u2019t was the amused smirk as she looked back to you and continued. \u201cI\u2019ve got some good friends who love tiny guys like yourself and would treat you exactly how you deserve.\u201d<br>\r\nWith her thinly veiled threat in mind, you looked over the three documents that Isabella had laid out in front of you and none of them looked very appealing. <br>\r\nAunt Norah was a bad choice, her forgetfulness and seeming eagerness to use you now that you had the general usage license made you reluctant to sign a license that gives her sole rights to use you. She would be very likely to mould you into something and then forget about it, and you really didn\u2019t want to spend weeks at a time as her insole or underwear. That\u2019s not even including the potential for using this newfound power over you to send you out on tiny guy jobs she\u2019s struggling to fill at her job. The fact that this was also a permanent license, that could only be cancelled if both you and Norah agreed to it, was very off putting.<br>\r\nThe second one you looked at was also a permanent license, not a good start. However, the name was not one you recognised, Becky Wallace. Maybe she was related to Quinn, her last name was Wallace. Maybe this Becky person would be as caring as Quinn seemed to be under her harsh exterior. But that wasn\u2019t something you wanted to risk. You couldn\u2019t sign your life away to a woman you didn\u2019t even know.<br>\r\nThat left the last license. Looking at it, it was only a year, which was better than the other two, although it couldn\u2019t be cancelled even if both parties consented. Speaking of the other party, you began to question how Isabella had managed to make the license with the shortest time so unappealing when you read the name of your mother, Helen Woods. Helen, to put it lightly, would not be pleased to find out you had signed one of these contracts. You couldn\u2019t be sure how she\u2019d react exactly, but you could guess some form of punishment would be involved. She may decide to \u201cgive you exactly what you asked for\u201d for the years duration of your license to teach you a lesson.<br>\r\nIn the end you found it very difficult to choose anyone but your mother, her license was only a year and you were sure you\u2019d be able to get Helen to see the truth of your situation eventually. You hoped.<br>\r\nIsabella raised an eyebrow in surprise when she saw you signing your mother\u2019s license. She had expected you to refuse to sign any of them, you knew that much. She probably had contracts prepared for herself and her friend from the beach stashed somewhere that she\u2019d probably have forced you to sign if you had refused. You were glad to have robbed her of that at least. Although you still felt, and could tell from how she was smirking at you she felt that, she had won. <br>\r\nNorah beamed behind you, \u201cAw Hunter, that\u2019s so sweet of you to want to help out your mom like that.\u201d <br>\r\nYou turned to correct her and hopefully explain the situation as it really was, but before you could Isabella stealthily knocked over her pencil holder, which squished you, leaving you unable to talk.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that Hunter,\u201d she smirked. \u201cAnyway while you\u2019re reforming I\u2019ll explain how this works. Your usage license with your mother will last a year after which it will expire. Your mother will be notified a month before this happens and will have the option to come in and have me extend it. If she chooses not to your general usage license will kick back in and you\u2019ll be available for other women to use to their heart\u2019s content. So I\u2019ll get this registered and send word to your mother via email.\u201d<br>\r\nAfter laminating a card for both you and your mother, Isabella started helping Norah with her paperwork, a temporary usage license for one of the tiny guys she recruited for a job. You couldn\u2019t get a word in over them talking about it to explain to Norah what was really going on and before long she was carrying you out of Isabella\u2019s office, Isabella waving goodbye to you with a sadistic smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah wrapped you around her wrist again and jogged back to your apartment.<br>\r\nOnce there you could see two figures looking out the window. You could see Morgan, obviously the first home from work. The second one made your blood go cold, it was your mother, Helen Woods, and she looked angry, very angry.<br>\r\nMorgan looked incredibly nervous as your Aunt approached the apartment with you in her hand, having taken you off her wrist and given you some time to start reforming in her hand. You hadn\u2019t fully reformed as Norah approached the front door and dropped you into Helen\u2019s waiting hand alongside your laminated usage license cards. As Norah said her goodbyes, Helen replied with a goodbye without her eyes leaving your slowly reforming form. She looked deep in thought, her scowl changing to an expression that made it impossible for you to tell what she was thinking. <br>\r\nHelen followed Morgan back into the living room before speaking up,<br>\r\n\u201cMorgan dear, could you give me and my son a moment alone? I need to discuss this with him in private.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah sure, no problem Mrs Woods,\u201d she gave you one last concerned glance before leaving the room. Leaving you, just finished reforming on your mother\u2019s palm as she stared down at you in judgement.<br>\r\n\u201cHunter... would you care to explain to me how you could be so stupid to get yourself into this situation?\u201d You felt like you would crumble under her angry gaze as she spoke to you. You had never seen her this angry before.<br>\r\n\u201cW-well, It all started at my new job...\u201d you started to explain.<br>\r\n\u201c I mean I thought I raised you better than this Hunter!\u201d She shouted, interrupting you. \u201cWhat, was life in the real world too difficult for you? You want to take the easy way out be becoming a thing instead of a person, is that it?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo that\u2019s not...\u201d you tried to defend yourself, explain what actually happened before you were interrupted again.<br>\r\n\u201cI think I know what we\u2019ll do here, I think I\u2019ll give you exactly what you want. Show you what it\u2019s really like to be someone\u2019s property. After a year of being given exactly what you\u2019ve asked for here maybe you\u2019ll see what a mistake you\u2019ve made here!\u201d Her voice had calmed, changing from high volume shouting into that of a disappointed parent. As she finished speaking her hand closed around you, compacting you into a little ball before you could explain yourself.<br>\r\n\u201cI know you\u2019d come up with some sort of half-assed excuse so I don\u2019t even want to hear it,\u201d Helen said coldly.<br>\r\nWithout another word to you she flattened you out while she took off her right shoe and dropped you in. You were facing upwards and were able to see her enormous socked foot, slightly damp with sweat descending and eventually blocking out the light as it entered the shoe and started to compact you even more as it took up all available space within the shoe. You were mostly underneath the heel of her foot, since she had just dropped you in , and you braced yourself as best you could in your flattened form.<br>\r\nYou heard the muffled sound of your mother informing Morgan that she was going to take you home to decide what to do with you and then she took her first step towards the door.<br>\r\nHer first step, and the next few steps afterwards, compacted you further underneath her damp, musty sock. You were steadily spread out under her foot until you started to take a shape similar to her insole. The pressure on your body being exerted by every footfall, along with the constant movement, disorientated you and made you feel slightly nauseous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce your mother had left the apartment, she began walking towards her car. She seemed to be purposefully putting extra pressure on you now that she was outside, letting out some of her anger at, as she viewed it, your stupidity. She got in the car and started to drive off home. The car journey wasn\u2019t as bad as her walking, but the increased heat in the car caused Helen to sweat a fair bit. This increased the humidity in her shoe and made the sock resting on top of you grow damper and some of that sweat began to soak through it and drip onto you. Your body greedily absorbed all the sweat that dripped onto you, and even started to leach the sweat from the sock resting on top of you. Helen noted that her right foot felt slightly drier than her left, and smiled faintly.<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe this next year won\u2019t be so bad for me after all. Although Hunter is going to hate it,\u201d she chuckled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an excruciating car journey you finally felt your mother take a step out of the car, crushing you under her foot once again. After around 10 minutes of her walking to, and then around the house gathering various things to deal with you, you finally saw light as the foot that had been grinding you down into it\u2019s smelly embrace for the last forty minutes was slid out of the shoe, revealing Helen\u2019s slightly frowning face, framed by her long, sandy brown hair.<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how did it feel to be my insole? Enjoying yourself yet?\u201d The sarcasm in her voice told you she did not expect an answer. \u201cSo I think I might as well turn you into something now. You signed up to be my property for a year so I might as well get the use out of you.\u201d<br>\r\nAs her hand came down, peeled you off her insole and pulled you out of her shoe you were greeted with the sight of the kitchen table. Arrayed on top of it were various tools to turn you into something she could use.<br>\r\nWhat was she going to turn you into?</span></div></div>",

A year underfoot aught to show you exactly why this was so stupid, and just in case you do for some reason like it I've got some things your Aunt left here to make it just a bit less pleasant.\" You saw what she had on the table, you had seen some of the stuff before just sitting around at Norah's house but the one that caught your attention the most was the 'press' with a shoe size adjuster. Simply put it was a device that would pull you out over the whole insole and then she could 'glue' you into shape so you didn't reform while she wasn't wearing the shoes. You never tried to reform so fast in your life, you were scared sure but you needed to set the record strait with your mom right now or you might not get the chance. She had dropped you down while she fiddled with the device and you hurried yourself focusing on your mouth. On the other hand, your body sort of reformed from the effort you tried to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom listen That No--\" Helen made a face at your mostly reformed body and had pinched you between her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I don't want to hear your excuses young man. Honestly, you can't even listen NOW, I hope you get yourself strait in the next year\" She shook her head \"Now don't struggle or you'll make it worse\" She sighed bringing your feet towards the beginning of the device, a sort of double rolling pin or pasta maker thing. You of course tried to resist ending up putting your knees in first instead of your feet, which Helen took note of but instead of reprimanding you again she snickered slightly. Your face of course still flattened could scream out when it flattened and widened your knees doing the work of minutes of pulling in seconds, not to mention the increased pain as it passed your crotch and then your head. You cried a little inside when you realized that because of her cutting you off mid sentence your mouth was basically all the way open. Your cloths of course were long since shredded away. The machine deposited you on a slightly squishy surface, You were looking up through the plastic device, your mother's hand was on a leaver and connected to it a foot shaped press. Your vision was dark as she pulled it squashing you into the material below and pressing it flat. when it lifted you felt you were somewhat pressed around the edges as it reflated. The machine spit you out the other side, Helen holding up a mirror to show you what you looked like. \"I told you not to struggle, if you had just stayed still you'd be positioned a bit better, well not that it makes a difference to your function, it's just more pain for you. Maybe that's what you wanted though hmm.\" She was talking about your crotch, you were in the shape of an insole alright but your crotch had ended up right under the ball of her foot, where as if you hadn't struggled against her it might have been under the arch. \"Either way, I don't want weird looks so I'm going to use the black spray, that way you match my regular Insoles. And remember Hunter, that's all you are for the next year because of your stupid choices, my insole.\" You couldn't scream if you wanted as she sprayed the paint on you. It added a tint to your vision like wearing sunglasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were starting to despair as she got a phone call and stopped paying attention to you. You had always remembered Helen as a fair mother, why was she being so unreasonable! You could only hope that she would calm down after a couple of days but you were not looking forward to even that. She was walking back and you could see her holding it in her hand, it was her work shoes, the raised heel pumps. \"Well it looks like I've got another business trip, time to get you settled in.\" She said lifting you and placing you into the shoe. You now looked up at her as she walked away again to get ready. There was a familiar running around but the anticipation of what was coming was making a pit in your stomach. Once she was done, she slipped her now stocking clad foot into your shoe the crushing weight of it all hit you literally and figurately. The shoes were shaped just so that her resting position was still like standing directly on your crotch and her steps lifted you up only to crash right back down. The swift walk was so much worse than the one that had brought you here, you weren't sure you would last a week of this, let alone the full year of torture. Not only the pain but it was only a few moments before her nylons were just as sweaty as her socks had been, although your body was absorbing her right foot's rather well. You were starting to black out, you couldn't handle it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know how much time had passed but when you woke up...</span></div></div>",

You feared how her view of you could change, plus it would basically give her free reign to send you out on any jobs she needed you fill in for her own job as a tiny recruiter.<br>\r\nYour mother, Helen, also wasn\u2019t ideal. Even though that license only had a one year limit, the embarrassment of signing your life away to be used by your mother wasn\u2019t something you wanted to deal with, plus you imagine she\u2019d view her year of full control over you as her opportunity to punish you for getting into this situation.<br>\r\nYou had no idea who this Becky Wallace was, she had the same last name as Quinn so she was probably some relation to her. If she was related to Quinn then she\u2019d hopefully be as level headed as she was and would be less likely to abuse the power you were about to hand over and even if she was, Quinn would be likely to step in and speak up on your behalf. <br>\r\nYou contemplated refusing to sign but a brief threatening look from Isabella put those thoughts out of your mind, she already managed to forge a general usage license for you, she could likely do it again. <br>\r\nYou grudgingly signed your name on the form that would leave your life in the hands of Quinn\u2019s mom, hoping she\u2019d be kind enough to not abuse the power you just handed her. <br>\r\n\u201cExcellent! I\u2019ll make sure a copy of these documents reach Mrs Wallace,\u201d Isabella exclaimed as she quickly pulled the document away from you before she filled out the necessary parts. \u201cNow I\u2019ll handle your paperwork Norah.\u201d<br>\r\nAs Isabella handled your aunts request, a temporary usage license for one of her workers. You sat and contemplated what you had just done. You handed your life away to a complete stranger. You were immediately filled with panic and regret, at least if you had chosen one of your family members you\u2019d at least have known what you were dealing with. Why did you take that sort of gamble? It\u2019s not like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your aunt got her paperwork filled out by Isabella she scooped you up and walked out of the office to take you home. As you were leaving Isabella waved to you with a smug grin.<br>\r\n\u201cBye Hunter, feel free to drop in at any time. I\u2019ve got <i>plenty</i> of time for you,\u201d she teased you with a wink.<br>\r\n\u201c I think someone likes you Hunter,\u201d Norah whispered to you with a smile. If only she knew, Isabella seemed to be more of the type to torture a tiny man than date them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah wrapped you back around her wrist and jogged back to your apartment, you were greeted at the door by Morgan. Who thanked your aunt for bringing you back. You chatted with Morgan and told her about what happened at Isabella\u2019s office and she reacted with shock and some confusion.<br>\r\n\u201cHunter, why didn\u2019t you pick your mom or your aunt?\u201d She asked, baffled. <br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, my mom would probably put me through the worst tories as a sort of punishment for being so stupid, sort of giving me what I asked for to make sure I wouldn\u2019t do it again,\u201d Morgan listened intently to what you said, her face softening out of pity for your situation. \u201cThen with Norah, the possibility of her moulding me into a shape and then forgetting about me was really high. I\u2019d end up spending weeks at a time as her insole or something like that. Plus she\u2019s a recruiter for tiny specific jobs and the ones she could send me out on now that I have a usage license would be just horrible. I didn\u2019t want that future to be my whole life. At least with Quinn\u2019s relative, whoever she is, Quinn might be able to convince her to cancel the usage license, since you need both parties to agree.\u201d<br>\r\nMorgan opened her mouth to respond, but was interrupted by both Avery and Quinn returning home. They both walked into the living room.<br>\r\n\u201cHey cutie, how was your day?\u201d Avery winked at you.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, any word on the license situation?\u201d Quinn asked.<br>\r\nYou explained the situation to them and got as far as signing Becky\u2019s usage license before Quinn interrupted you.<br>\r\n\u201cYou WHAT!\u201d She cried out in shock. This was the first time you had seen Quinn show this much emotion, which worried you. You tried to explain how awful it would have been with your mom or aunt before Quinn interrupted you again. \u201cNonono Hunter you don\u2019t understand! My mom hates tiny guys! She\u2019s made so many of my friends disappear I\u2019ve lost count, and that was without her having sole rights to decide what happens to them. If she find out about this she will have free reign to do whatever she wants with you!\u201d <br>\r\nWith Quinn\u2019s words the reality of exactly who you had signed your rights over to dawned on you. A tense atmosphere descended over the room as everyone came to terms with what Quinn has just said.<br>\r\n\u201cQuinn, is there any way you could get me out of this?\u201d Your voice came out shaky as your panic levels were rising.<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019d be half tempted to just let you suffer the consequences of being so stupid!\u201d Quinn snapped, surprising you at how hash she could be. \u201cBut I\u2019ve lost too many friends to her so yeah, I\u2019ll help you.\u201d <br>\r\nHer expression softened as she saw how much she frightened you. She stood up to go get her phone to call her mom to explain the situation and try to convince her mom to spare you. She came back a few moments later saying that her mom wasn\u2019t picking up her phone so she\u2019d have to try again later. So you all decided to try and relax for a while till she could reach her.<br>\r\nLater that night, as you were all watching tv, there was a knock at the door. Everyone froze, all turning toward the hallway leading to the door. Quinn looked at you and gave a look of reassurance before going to the door, you heard the faint sound of her greeting someone before she returned to the living room with a grim look on her face followed by...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) ... Her mother, Becky Wallace. Holding her copy of the usage license. Can Quinn convince her in person to spare you? <br>\r\n2) ... Isabella and Rachel, both grinning evilly. They are holding the usage license that you signed, but it has one of their names on it! <br>\r\n3) ... No one, it was a pair of kids playing a prank who ran off afterwards.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The woman that followed her was clearly her mother but you hadn't been prepared for just how dead sexy she was, Quinn hadn't shown you any pictures or anything but this was well beyond anything you would have imagined. It was no wonder she could utterly decimate tinies and nobody would come down on her about it, you were sure there would be guys, especially dumb teens, that would totally brush off anything besides blatant outright telling them she was doing something on purpose. You knew better though, because Quinn had told you so any sort of act about doing something accidentally would be wasted, she didn't look unhappy to be here though, clearly Quinn was more uncomfortable with the situation than Becky. You realized that your mouth had dried out as you caught sight of the massive woman and you swallowed. Morgan and Avery were up off of the couch before you could break yourself out of your stupor blocking you from sight from your position on the coffee table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Wallace, what a surprise, did you come to visit Quinn?\" Morgan tried to go with a bluff but you saw Quinn shake her head from off to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my no, While I do love my Quinnie she hadn't told me where she was living yet. Why I was just so surprised when she answered the door I can't wait to spend some more time with her but I found you all in a round about way.\" She smiled at the sisters warmly as she pulled the card out from her back pocket, it was her copy of the usage license, Isabella did not mess around when she said she would make sure that Becky got it. \"I just came over to pick up my things and I'll be out of your hair.\" She didn't even acknowledge that you were a tiny person, just 'one of her things' that sent chills up your spine of what she was capable of. That was when Quinn cleared her throat and stepped up beside Morgan and Avery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't let you do that mom, not this time. Hunter is a person and he's been framed, that nasty bitch of a notary basically forced him to sign up for that card. You have to think that's wrong please mom. He just got a job and everything.\" Quinn pleaded knowing that in this situation she was 'technically' in the wrong if anything legal got involved, Denying a Tiny their chosen person who had already agreed to have them was likely to get at least a fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeh, plus if you do use him you gotta do all these other things he had before getting a license. He's got a rent contract and work as a lifeguard...\" Avery added but trailed off when she didn't seem to be getting any response out of Becky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky made a pouty face \"That's all? I already signed on for all of that though. Little angel I love you but this is why I didn't want you to move out, you care to much about these little bugs even when one is so stupid that he signs himself up as a toy just based on looks. He had plenty of chances to avoid this.\" She made no move towards you but her presence, the authority that she stated things as if they were fact was suffocating. You could see the girls flinching trying to find a way to explain things to her so that she wouldn't take you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn was the one that had the light of an idea shine in her eyes. \"Actually Hunter had no idea what you looked like,\" She said with confidence. There was an idea working very quickly in her mind and it seemed that the other two might have caught on to it when that actually gave Becky pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan picked up where she left off. \"That's right, hunter was so shocked to learn that you didn't like tiny guys he didn't even ask. Quinn was so worried about you coming and doing something to him. But like he didn't even know before this whole situation got out of hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were looking hopeful that the situation was turning in your favor as Becky seemed to seriously consider the words. Avery piped up \"Yeh, he choose you because Quinn is so calm and collected that he figured that you had to be the same if you raised her.\" Becky considered those words for a moment. For a moment it looked like she might be considering it but then she seemed to brush the idea aside for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all well and good but I thought you said he was forced into this, and now you said he 'chose' me. I think if he had a choice and he didn't want to get used he should have requested one of you no? I'll tell you what, I'm a generous girl just for you girls and my little Quinnie, I'll look into that Notary, but you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn was the first one to have her eyes widen \"Wait really? Having money behind this sort of investigation would be huge mom! What could you be thinking about to stop you?\" Quinn actually seems to have realize that it wasn't just your ass on the line but if Isabella got away with this often it would be a huge scandal. You had to admit for not liking Tinies she was being strangely considerate of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's just, If I go to cancel this wouldn't such an <i>evil</i> girl just find some other way to disappear your little guy. and if that happened wouldn't you loose your best evidence?\" Becky reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn opened her mouth to argue but the argument died on her lips. \"That... is true. What are you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky clapped her hands together. \"Well as long as I don't cancel it then she will be unaware of our little investigation, but well, if I don't use him and he still has the license we could get in trouble. Oh Quinnie I just don't know what to do.\" Your jaw dropped as soon as you realized what was happening, somehow she was convincing them that she had to keep you 'for the better' and fooling them into thinking she didn't want to. Quinn was even wavering and Morgan and Avary seemed to be completely on board with the idea. \"Oh but you're worried about me loosing him... well hmmm.\" She pressed her finger to her lips \"Oh I know, I'll make sure to spend weekends here and Little B-Hunter can be however he wants then. after all he's still got a room here it's perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn was suffering from whiplash of confusion at how fast Becky was running through her ideas, she was sure that her mother hated tiny guys she was always trying to get rid of them. But for some reason there was no fault in her logic, if she cancelled Isabella would probably instate the general use back and if she had it but didn't use it Becky could get in legal trouble. She looked over at you, wondering how many tiny guys had been put in a similar situation. \"I-i get it but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky cut her off \"Quinn, what is there to 'but' about are you going to tell me all that talk about caring for tiny guys is just lip service and you'd rather keep <b>one</b> little guy out of trouble and let who knows how many just have the fate you are trying to keep him from and you had the chance to prevent it.\" You wanted to speak up but... that was a masterful use of convincing someone using their own ideals and honestly you had no argument either, if this was all an elaborate ruse just to get you it was working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn looked down \"O-okay but, I'm going to check with him every week. and I'll help the investigation.\" She moved to the side as did the other two girls, Quinn mouthed 'I'm sorry' at you as Becky stepped up to tower over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made the right choice girls, I'll be back next Saturday with all the starting info.\" She said leaning down and pinching you between her fingers, still not talking to you directly. You were tucked into her giant cleavage cutting you off from the rest of the conversation, you didn't even get to say anything. There was a jiggling as you were smothered by the soft melons and in a few minutes you were pulled out, she was standing in front of her car with the door open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sure was a surprise, well I suppose I should thank you but well, I don't need to thank my belongings.\" She didn't stop smiling, as if she didn't think anything differently of talking to you like that and talking sweetly to her daughter. She had started yanking you out, pulling until you were a simple tan square and then pulled you over the seat of her car. The speed she did it didn't give you any time to cope with the pain before her gargantuan cheeks where descending on you, barely contained in the jeans she was wearing. As she started the car you cried out internally for someone to save you from this crazy woman.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The car journey was unpleasant, to say the least. You spent the whole half hour of the journey smeared over the car seat underneath your cruel new owner. Her massive bubble butt covered every square inch of the seat, and subsequently you, and the rough fibres of her jeans ground against you every time she shifted to get comfortable, or went over a bump in the road, or even when she pressed down particularly hard on a peddle. Any time her glutes tensed, you were pressed hard into the fabric of her seat, which would normally have been a soft cushion that would have made the journey a bit more bearable, but it had been worn down over years of use by Becky and any cushion it had left was compressed down under the weight of the immensely curvy woman on top of it, so it offered you no respite from the crushing weight on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like hours of crushing, you felt the car come to a stop. The crushing weight of Becky\u2019s rear was removed as she stood up and, without even sparing you a glance, began to peel you off the seat. She hadn\u2019t been sat on you long, but her monumental behind had done a lot of damage to your flattened form. It took her several good tugs to free you. After which she finally looked down at you, her plump, full lips curled in a look of mild irritation that made you slightly scared, this was the first time her smile had broken since you had first seen her. The look barely lasted a second before she looked ahead and her beaming smile returned. You tried to turn your attention to what she was looking at, but before you could she stuffed you back into the cramped confines of her cleavage. You were once again immersed in her slightly sweaty cleavage. As she began to walk towards wherever it was she was going, her breasts, seemingly unrestricted by her bra, began to bounce and jiggle, pummelling your flattened form and making you feel almost like you were seasick. You were buried deep down in her cleavage that no part of you was visible to the outside world.<br>\r\nAfter a short walk the jiggling masses seemed to slow their intensity as she appeared to stop moving. You heard her greet someone before a female voice answered her, familiar but you couldn\u2019t place where you knew it from. You were suddenly compressed as the breasts surrounding you met another, smaller than hers but still immense to you, pair of breasts as the two women hugged each other.<br>\r\nYou heard a door close as Becky followed the mystery woman into what you assume was her home.<br>\r\nAfter a few more moments of walking you felt a sense of weightlessness as your captor dropped down onto a couch, before the breasts surrounding you slapped together as she landed, smashing you even flatter.<br>\r\n\u201cDid you get him,\u201d you heard the mystery woman ask. Who was this woman, and why was she so interested in you?<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I retrieved my property. Quinnie was very reluctant to give it over but I managed to convince her and her little friends by giving a story about me keeping it close and using it being the best way to bring that \u2018evil notary\u2019 to justice,\u201d she said with a laugh. You didn\u2019t like how she was referring to you as an \u2018it\u2019, you realise she still hadn\u2019t referred to you as a person. <br>\r\nAs the two women laughed you heard the muffled sounds of a third person entering the room.<br>\r\n\u201cAh you\u2019re here,\u201d the third woman spoke up as she saw Becky. \u201cCan we see him? I\u2019d love to rub this in.\u201d<br>\r\nAs she said that you felt the fingers of your captor wrap around your flattened form before fishing you out of her cleavage. You were unceremoniously dumped onto the coffee table of the living room that you could now see you were in, and sitting on the couch with Becky, grinning evilly down at you, were the last two people you wanted to see, Isabella and Rachel, the two women who had put you in this situation in the first place! <br>\r\n\u201cSurprised? I\u2019d be surprised if you weren\u2019t,\u201d Rachel smiled down at you with a look of smug satisfaction.<br>\r\n\u201cLet us clue you in,\u201d Isabella had a similar expression to Rachel, but hers was also partially an expression that showed happiness at a job well done. \u201cYou see, after you disrespected Rachel like you did at the beach we were both pissed. So for our little payback to go off without any blowback on us I had to do my diligence. I saw that with just giving you the general usage license you wouldn\u2019t get the full punishment you deserved, since your roommates seem so sympathetic to you little bugs, they don\u2019t see things the way we do.\u201d<br>\r\nAs she said the last part she smiled at the two women beside her.<br>\r\n\u201cSo I looked into who was connected to you in one way or the other to come up with some cruel ways to punish you with the people you know. Your mom and aunt were the front runners until we had a chance reunion with Becky at a local burger joint, Sinclair Sandwiches. We both owe Becky here quite a lot, she gave us jobs in her warehouse that helped put us both through college. So when she said that she was missing her little girl, who hadn\u2019t even told her where she lived yet, we thought we\u2019d have been cruel not to help her out,\u201d Isabella looked to Becky with a friendly smile, which Becky returned. \u201cSo I added her as a third choice for you, knowing you\u2019d jump at any choice that wasn\u2019t your ditsy, tiny recruiter aunt or your disciplinarian mother. That way Becky gets more time with her daughter and you get to spend your life as property.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you fell right into our trap,\u201d Rachel beamed. \u201cWe know your friends are probably thinking of a strategy to get this license revoked but I think you\u2019ll find that Isabella covers her tracks well, little Tony here has been serving as my thong for around a year now and no one has come looking for him yet.\u201d She emphasised this point by tugging the waistband of her underwear out from her hip from under her jeans and letting it snap back into place.<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this for years, even before Baker\u2019s law came into place we could make tiny guys disappear but thanks to that beautiful airhead Amy Baker we now have the law on our side when we do it,\u201d Isabella laughed. \u201cHell, the amount of tiny guys Becky here made disappear through her shipping company as well, I lost count!\u201d<br>\r\nAs she said this Becky finally spoke up.<br>\r\n\u201cYes I made quite a few of my Quinnie\u2019s little bug friends disappear by shipping them to my customers. It was all quite simple really, if a woman wanted a piece of clothing I\u2019d sometimes just take one of them, mould them into the clothing in question, dye them and spray them with something that stops them turning back to their original shape. Then they\u2019d go all the way across the country, far away from my sweet little girl. It was a win-win for me really, I keep those tiny little creatures away from my daughter and also save on buying in products on occasion to boot. Actually when I heard your name I looked through my records and I\u2019m sure that your mother and sister received a few of them,\u201d Becky\u2019s warm smile contrasted so harshly from the words leaving her mouth it made your head spin. You couldn\u2019t believe your ears, this cruel woman had sentenced countless tiny guys to serve as clothing to unaware women, and apparently some of them were even in your mom\u2019s house without anyone\u2019s knowledge!<br>\r\nBy this point in the conversation you had managed to reform yourself. You shakily stood to your feet and looked up at your three giantess tormentors.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you telling me this? And for that matter why are you doing this to me, all I did was inconvenience you slightly at the beach!\u201d As you shouted up at them Isabella and Rachel\u2019s smirks grew larger, however Becky\u2019s smile faded to a cold look. Before you could utter another word Becky\u2019s hand slapped down on you, flattening you again.<br>\r\n\u201cAs my property you would do well to remember to not speak unless asked to do so. We don\u2019t want your opinion on anything in the same way I wouldn\u2019t ask my bra it\u2019s opinion on our current situation,\u201d this was the first time you had seen Becky\u2019s warm, motherly personality shift to match the words coming from her mouth and it terrified you. She continued. \u201cAnyway as to why they are telling you this, it\u2019s to torture you with the information. Personally if it wasn\u2019t for these two I probably wouldn\u2019t have said another word to you. Since all you are is my property, an object for me to use as I see fit, after all. You\u2019re no more a person than this couch cushion, and now the law finally sees you the way you should be seen. And if you speak a word of this to my Quinnie, I\u2019ll have you shipped to Europe as a thong before anyone can figure out what happened to you!\u201d<br>\r\nAfter that they stopped acknowledging you and began to talk strategy on how to prevent your roommates from exposing Isabella and undoing all her work. Becky would continue to feign that she was helping with the investigation, while feeding information to Isabella so she could counter them. Meanwhile you were sinking deeper into despair, was this your life now? To be used as nothing more than an object by this cruel person?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long series of discussions surrounding covering Isabella\u2019s illegal activities Becky scooped your flattened form up off of the table before depositing you back into her cleavage, returning you to the crushing, slightly sweaty prison between her breasts. <br>\r\nAfter a long drive home she took you out and without a word and, after removing her shirt and bra, freeing her monumental breasts, began stretching you out smearing your top half and bottom half while stretching out your limbs. She then wrapped you around her torso, the two \u201cdisks\u201d she had shaped your body into serving as the cups of the bra she had turned you into. With that she slipped a nightshirt over you and went to bed. This was going to be a long week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the next weekend rolls around, what has happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Isabella has made it difficult for the girls to figure out how to free you.<br>\r\n2) The girls have made some progress but not a lot.<br>\r\n3) Isabella is struggling to keep the girls at bay, freedom may be within sight. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Racheal mercilessly squeezed the air out from your soft squishy body for leisure while removing her highly priced designer sunglasses. Her pale blue eyes captured your attention after witnessing them for the first time behind the shades. She stared back, giving an ominous smile of response at how you almost outwitted her. \"That was a clever trick, little guy. You almost had me going there. But I'm done delaying, and we both know it's time for what you're only worthy of,\" Racheal replied arrogantly with a smirk, reminding you of the dominance she held. You were immensely intimidated, struggling harder to escape her grasp. She was way out of your league of expertise to bicker with further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, keep fighting! I adore when you little men think you're capable of escaping. Although, try best to keep some of that feeling for when I have you wrapped around me.\" Racheal moaned softly with pleasure, biting the temple tip of her sunglasses over your exertion. You watched her swiftly stand, body glistening in the sun from sweat. She disregarded Tony's cry of agony being engrossed by her enormous ass from the action. She waved over to Isabella, showing you off as a new trophy to her best friend. Isabella playfully nodded with a humorous sigh accompanied by giggling as you recognized she clearly understood Racheal's plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as Racheal's mood transformed from serious businesswomen to a cheery teen. \"You see that, little lifeguard! Tomorrow Isabella will fix up a friendly usage license for you privately for my pleasure. But why should I wait when you have a beautiful date with my ass already,\" Racheal expressed snickering, bringing you in front of her big ass to witness as she gave it a jaunty slap. You were terrified, overhearing Tony's sob as her colossal butt jiggled widely against him as she entered the changing area. The room packed with girls undressing as Racheal brought you over towards her locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, the first thing I need is to smooth you out.\" Racheal gleefully announced, by performing a ruff sculpting of you out with her butt. You felt suffocated as she stretched you by the arms and legs. \"Hold on, do I want you to be facing my ass rather than my pussy?\" Racheal uttered in turmoil as she squished you back up to try again. \"Nah, I liked the way I had you the first time,\" She laughed, halfway finished before starting over a third time. You were in constant agony as Racheal divided your body into sections until finally settling on your design. You tried screaming, lying helpless in your new form. But Racheal put a quick stop by pinching your lips shut before shimmying Tony off her body. You watched her wickedly smile, twirling him around her finger like nothing. \" Well, I won't be needing Tony anymore. But it is a shame for him to go to waste?\"  asked, looking at you, not that she would consider what you lectured to aid him. You watched in horror as Racheal took Tony over to another girl's bikini bottoms laid out and switched him off with them. Racheal was unarguably cruel, showing no tolerance for your kind. \"There we go,\" she grinned, as you both watch a teenage girl pass, sliding Tony on unaware. \"Man, is my ass getting bigger?\" the girl questioned,  striving to fix Tony from being an annoying wedgie in her butt but decided to give up and enjoy the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, he's already found a new owner. I'll leave his license behind so she won't have issues later. But as for you!\" Racheal replied, standing over you, removing her earrings. \"You know, I got this excellent tip from my one of my girlfriend's that bands or rings help keep you guys in a structure better, and since I only have my jewelry, I'll have to use them.\" She said, fastening your arms and legs apart to wrap them tightly on her bangles. Racheal's face showed you she must be loving how you were turning out. She didn't seem to offer much care for your howls of pain in the final process. \"You turned out gorgeous! But what this?\" she screamed, lowering you down in place, seeing your erection. Your eyes widen, wanting to explain. But her massive ass was inches away as she inserted both legs and fastened you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Racheal's ass immediately consumed your face, stretching you out to a thin strip that halted tightly against her butt hole and slid your dick inside her. \"umm, yes, I love it,\" she utters, molding you off. She could feel you helplessly fighting against her as she went back out to the beach, continue tanning. You fought as best you could, feeling her ass sweat trickle down. She even managed to massage your dick with her thighs. You hoped one of the other lifeguards might come looking for you soon.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your optimistic attitude held for the first hour of your brand-new job. Though the sun was bright and hot, the water rolling in from the sea was cool, and the windy breeze steady. Not a single person\u2019s life came anywhere near danger, and peace reigned in your little tiny section of Sanderson Beach. A few guys wanted pointers on swim techniques, and another tiny accidentally lost his miniature wallet, so you handled those minimal issues with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as time crept past that first hour mark, you kept hearing rumbling sounds in the distance, like an engine blaring. You assumed it was someone\u2019s souped-up motorcycle in the parking lot, until you realized that it was actually coming from the direction of the ocean, not behind you outside of the beach. Leaning forward in your chair, you squinted off into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you spotted what appeared to be a rather large speedboat piloted by two wild sorority girls. It was racing up along the shore, bouncing along the waves and splashing water in its wake. Worryingly, the speedboat was quite close to the beach, and in genuine danger of hitting a swimmer or surfer who couldn\u2019t move out of the way in time. Worse still, from what you could spot (your vision was quite good), the driver of the speedboat seemed intoxicated out of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping to your feet in a panic, you thought frantically about what to do, wondering how someone of your size could possibly make a difference. Still, acting almost without thinking, you leapt from your lifeguard stand down onto the sand, and ran out into the middle of the tiny section. You motioned frantically to all of your fellow tinies, signaling them to group up near the middle of the tiny section. If any disaster struck (though you were still unsure of what that would entail) you would be ready. In minutes, all fifty or so tiny guys had grouped up around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, and a loud voice cried out from far off to your left. \u201cHEY! STOP THAT BOAT! STOP THAT BOAT RIGHT NOW!\u201d The voice yelled loudly and forcefully. You jerked to follow the sound of the voice, tracing it all the way to Quinn over at the middle tower, some hundred yards away. She was standing and pointing while holding her megaphone up to her mouth. She looked furious, terrifyingly so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls in the boat clearly heard her, and thankfully had just enough common sense to stop their drunken antics. However, before powering down their boat, they steered it closer to shore. The driver whipped the boat around in a hairpin turn while haphazardly docking the boat, and the rear end of the speedboat dug into the waves, dredging up a considerably forceful wake. This explosion of water, which took the form of a wave, surged out from behind the boat\u2026and right towards the tiny section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the fifty other tinies did nothing but stare in abject shock and horror as the surging water from the speedboat\u2019s reckless turn surged towards the shore. Though no more than two feet in height in actuality, that scale was more than enough to qualify as a tidal wave disaster, and as the wave hit the beach and pressed on up, it showed no signs of slowing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seemed to crawl though, and in those final moments, you noted several things. One: you took note of how every normal-sized beach goer around the tiny section had their eyes firmly on the antics of the boat and on Quinn, not on the tiny section crisis. Two: you similarly noted that Quinn was too busy marching towards the drunk girls and their boat, angry beyond belief at their potentially life-threatening joyride, and she didn\u2019t notice what was going on in the tiny section either. Three: you numbly reconsidered that ramifications of clumping all the tinies in the section into one place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seemed to unfreeze, the tidal wave hit, and all hell broke loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the other gathered tinies became a confused mess of screaming and panicking as the wave scooped all of you up into its cold, merciless embrace. You were all knocked off your feet and sent spiraling into different directions. Some tinies were tossed aside to relative safety, some coasted along the cusp of the wave, and some were submerged fully in the salty depths. Of course, the only logical course of action for an outgoing wave was to wash back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the water was pulled back into the sea, at least forty of the gathered tinies went with it, you included. Your screaming and cries of terror continued, a chorus of horrified tinies echoing out in unison. Sadly, your paltry noises were just about entirely muffled by the simple crashing of the wave, and were definitely imperceptible to anyone close by. Quinn\u2019s fury over at the boat was still the center of attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your superior stamina and skills in swimming, you managed to stay afloat at the crest of the wave, and were finally deposited right on the water\u2019s edge. Coughing and sputtering, you wiped saltwater from your eyes and watched in horror as at least thirty other tinies were swept away into the ocean. Though only a few feet out from shore at most, that distance was miles in terms of a tiny\u2019s perspective. You were stricken with grief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat grief gave way to something much more when you heard voices from behind you a minute later. Though faint at first, your ears eventually picked up the distinct sound of laughter. Turning around, your eyes widened, nearly bulging out from your sockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA group of three giantesses, towering high, were strolling directly towards the tiny section, laughing and smiling. You took a step to move towards your lifeguard stand and retrieve your megaphone to yell up at them, assuming that they were also distracted by the boat incident and weren\u2019t noticing the clear signs that signaled the tiny section of Sanderson Beach. However, you only took one step before freezing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour megaphone wasn\u2019t anywhere to be seen. For that matter, neither was the entire lifeguard stand itself. For that matter, neither were any of the spikes in the sand, or the bright red rope that cordoned off the tiny section. The wave had picked them all up, dragged them across the sand, and swept them away to sea. Every single discernible marker for the tiny section was gone. Those three girls weren\u2019t ignoring the tiny section\u2026they didn\u2019t know it existed at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, there\u2019s never a spot empty this close to the shore!\u201d The oldest giantess, a brunette woman probably around thirty or so, exclaimed, smiling warmly. \u201cWhat a perfect day!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second girl, a blonde roughly twenty years old, shrugged. \u201cJust don\u2019t get me wet while getting out of the water. It\u2019ll ruin my tan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older woman laughed heartily. \u201cI don\u2019t plan on leaving that water for quite a few hours, sweetheart. I came here to swim, after all.\u201d She gestured proudly to her swimsuit of choice, and you gaped at her body. For a moment, you forgot all about your plight and the fates of the tiny section patrons, and your entire world became ogling the woman\u2019s curvy, hourglass figured body. She was wearing nothing but a skimpy string bikini top and bottom, that looked more like strands of floss pressing against her smooth bronzed flesh than real clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger giantess rolled her eyes and began rolling out a towel to lie down on. As she did so, you watched a tiny get buried under her heel, and then another hidden beneath the towel. As the girl kneeled on her towel, she stripped off her two-piece and lathered tanning lotion on herself. You couldn\u2019t help but watch, though you felt awful at secretly observing a naked giantess stranger. You justified this staring when you spotted an unfortunate tiny be mashed under the girl\u2019s breast as she lied out on her stomach to begin tanning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaken from your staring by thunderous footsteps, you dove to the side as the older woman ran into the ocean with glee. Two more tinies found themselves molded into the sand by the woman\u2019s heel as she ran, and then a cascade of water rained down as the thick giantess splashed into the sea. One tiny was left mangled in her aftermath, but with his head above the sand, so you walked over to help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could reach him, though, the third giantess, a young brown-haired girl about ten years old, skipped happily up towards you, bucket in hand. Without noticing you at all, she swept her bucket through the sand, and scooped up the poor tiny you were going to save right into her plastic bucket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling gleefully, the girl trotted several steps away. \u201cThis is gonna be the best sandcastle ever!\u201d She laughed, and then dumped the bucket contents out. You could just barely see the tiny fall into the pile of sand, and you could also make out at least three other tinies caught up in the young child\u2019s building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing back at the curvaceous giantess in the water, your jaw dropped open at the sight before you. The woman had stood up for a second, the water up to her quite massive buttocks. Her stringy, barely-there thong had shifted a bit, revealing her full butt crack to the world. The woman was in the midst of adjusting her wardrobe when a wave washed a frantically paddling tiny right into her ass. You could only watch as the woman snapped her thong back into her crack, smiled, and swam off, totally oblivious to the passenger she was now carrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weight of the world on your shoulders was crushing. One look far down the beach showed Quinn dragging the drunken sorority sisters off to Brigitte\u2019s office, confirming that she would be of no help to you. Saving the tinies now suffering was the sole job for you, and one that you now had to face with steely resolve. You were a tiny lifeguard, dammit. Time to guard the lives of tinies!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking from girl to girl, your mind flip flopped between the decisions that laid before you. None of these tasks would be easy, but you had to pick one. First you ruled out the tiny guys stuck in the sandcastle, unfortunately. You know based on experience that dealing with young girls was one of the riskiest things you could do as a tiny guy. More often than not they didn\u2019t understand the ramifications of messing with you guys, and it was practically impossible to get them to see reason. With a sigh you wrote that off, at least for now. Now looking at the tanning giantess, you briefly considered approaching her. But upon closer inspection you saw that she had put in bluetooth earbuds while you were looking away! Getting her attention would be nearly impossible through sound alone, and digging around underneath her breasts to save another guy seemed like a surefire way to get called a pervert or simply get smashed yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back and looking into the water, you saw the older woman had already made it a fair bit off the shore. You knew for certain it was her, as her comically oversized butt was somehow sticking out of the water while she swam. The mere 30 feet or so she had gone may as well have been an entire ocean to you, inducing enough fear in you to give up on the last of the possible rescue operations. But then, fate seemed to smile upon you for the first time that day, as another girl walked up a bit to your side. Turning and looking at the woman, you could tell that she wasn\u2019t the typical beachgoing type. She was wearing a massively oversized t-shirt as well as a shady hat, practically blocking her entire body from the sun. Even so you could tell based on the outlines underneath her shirt that she was seemingly well-endowed. Now typically, another giantess encroaching on what should have been the tiny guys\u2019 section would have struck more fear into your heart. But when you saw what this mystery girl had in your hands, you practically jumped for joy instead!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her hands was a relatively small RC boat and a controller! She approached the water, with the now gentle waves lapping gently at her toes. You knew immediately that enlisting this girl\u2019s help was your only hope. You walked up behind her, and shouted up to her. Without your megaphone, you weren\u2019t as commandingly loud as you wished you were, but nevertheless she turned around. Although it seemed to be completely random when it worked and when it didn\u2019t, the shrinking epidemic still did come with an inexplicable ability for regular sized girls to hear the voices of shrunken guys\u2026 at least when the girls weren\u2019t too distracted. Truth be told nobody knew when it would work and when it wouldn\u2019t, but thankfully this seemed to be one of the times when it worked in your favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hey down there little dude, I hope I didn\u2019t step on ya.\u201d The girl noticed you rather quickly, your small but bright red lifeguard uniform standing out among the yellow sand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh no you\u2019re fine, but please, I need your help! I\u2019m actually a lifeguard here, there were a ton of guys in this section and we all just got hit by that huge wave caused by those reckless girls a few minutes ago! Long story short, I saw a tiny guy get carried by the wave\u2026 right into that woman\u2019s butt out there.\u201d You rambled on to the girl, not wanting to waste any time trying to explain the existence of the men\u2019s only section of the beach. Every second wasted was another second that guy had to suffer between the swimming giantess\u2019s cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah that\u2019s crazy\u201d the girl exclaimed, looking out at the woman you pointed at. \u201cYou talking about that lady with the enormous butt?\u201d She said while pointing directly at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes that one! Please just--\u201d you tried to plead but she interrupted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly it\u2019s kind of absurd how big it is. First that lifeguard down the beach, now this lady. I mean I thought my butt was pretty big but compared to them sheesh. How is it even sticking out of the water like that while she sw--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMISS PLEASE TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE\u201d you shouted up to interrupt her tangent. In any other situation you would have joked around with her for sure, but every second counted. \u201cI know this is weird but if I ride in your boat can you drive me up to the woman out there?! If you pull up alongside her maybe I can jump out onto her and rescue the guy!\u201d You explained your plan to the girl, while she put on an amused smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to do once you get there, it seems more likely than not that you\u2019ll just slip between those oversized cheeks and get trapped in there as well.\u201d The girl picked apart your plan easily, causing you to briefly rethink it. But as she talked, she gently placed her boat down into the water, and grabbed you in her now free hand, dropping you off in the driver\u2019s seat. Before you could change your plan, she continued, \u201cBut honestly that plan sounds so rad I have to see it happen! It\u2019s like a real life movie! Let\u2019s hit it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to scream out at the last second, but the girl hit the throttle at max speed, sending you and her RC boat skimming across the water. The hard plastic of the seat was rough on your body, but you had to admit it felt kind of cool riding in a \u201cvehicle\u201d that fit you for once. You snapped back to reality when you saw the ass of the swimming giantess on the horizon like some sort of bubble-shaped, moving island. In a matter of seconds, the speedy RC boat pulled up alongside the woman. Now seeing up close just how powerful the movement of this woman\u2019s massive legs was, you gulped with fear. Your new friend\u2019s cautionary words against your plan rung in your head as well, but it was too late to turn back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up you steadied yourself on the edge of the boat precariously. Now praying to every god you knew of you prepared to make the heroic leap, and get this rescue mission underway!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does it go?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The swimming giantess had slowed her speed considerably, but she was still powering through the water at a steady clip. As such, your newfound friend back on the shore had to keep the RC boat stable alongside the oblivious swimming woman, close enough for you to reach her but not so close as to actually smack into the woman and hurt her. Frankly, your partner in all of this was doing an amazing job, and you made a mental note to thank her upon your (hopeful) safe return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the situation at hand was what commanded most of your attention. The woman\u2019s massive derriere was even more gigantic up-close, nearly the size of Quinn\u2019s meteoric rear end. Each cheek was like a globe of tanned, jiggly flesh, the woman\u2019s smooth and supple skin on full display thanks to her ludicrously immodest thong bottoms. Noting them, you realized they had shifted once more, pried a few inches back from the cavernous abyss of her crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a final deep breath, and sending some prayers up to whatever deity of fate would listen to you, you leapt from the prow of the RC boat, kicking off with all of your might and flinging out your hands to grab onto the woman. Time seemed to slow to a crawl as you soared through the air towards the woman\u2019s booty, though the distance was a scant few inches, and the actual time it took no more than two seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColliding with the woman\u2019s squishy butt cheek almost ended your rescue attempt immediately. Your tiny body bounced off of her plump cheek, ricocheting backwards while rolling along her slick skin. You scrambled like mad, desperately digging your hands into her flesh for any support to stop your momentum. Thankfully, the woman was so well-developed that her doughy cheek was easy to grab, that you soon caught yourself and steadied your position on top of her right cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still swimming though, so you couldn\u2019t relax. Her quick speed caused jets of water to spray up into your eyes, and her overall speed threatened to send you flying off behind her if you relaxed your grip too much. This was to say nothing of the up and down motion of the waves rocking the woman like an unending rollercoaster. You felt a bit of nausea in your stomach, but you pushed onward, determined to not leave your fellow tiny trapped and alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff to your side, you saw the RC boat peel away and drive back to shore, no doubt returning to its owner who knew you had jumped by now. All alone in your mission from this point on, you began army-crawling across the woman\u2019s thick butt cheek, one fistful of doughy flesh at a time to pull you along. The wetness of her skin helped to slide you faster towards the giantesses\u2019 awaiting butt crack, and in another minute, you were peering over the edge down into the dark canyon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, there was no trace of the tiny you\u2019d come to rescue, so that ruled out the possibility of this being a quick and easy rescue. Sighing, and wishing nothing terrible would come of this, you let yourself roll off the top of the woman\u2019s right cheek, sliding down the inside of her ass cheek and plummeting inside of her crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the space to move grew smaller and smaller inside of her ass, you were eventually able to brace yourself by pushing your legs into her squishy left cheek and hold your back up against her right cheek. It was significantly darker by now, about halfway into this woman\u2019s ass crack, and you couldn\u2019t immediately see any sign of the guy you\u2019d come so far to rescue. Chances were, if he was really stuck, he\u2019d be blending in quite well with the woman\u2019s fairly neutral tan skin tone. Heaven help him if he\u2019d already been pulled fully inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cleared your throat. \u201cHey, are you in here? Anyone stuck here?\u201d You called out to the darkness. A particularly rough wave hit the woman then, shaking her and jostling her jiggly butt thoroughly. You yelped and slid in another inch before managing to hold yourself in a bracing stance again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quiet voice answered you. \u201c\u2026yes. I\u2019m in here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened in surprise and relief. \u201cOh, awesome! In that case, my name is Hunter, and I\u2019m here to rescue you!\u201d Another jostling shake almost toppled you again, but you held steady. \u201cI can\u2019t see you though. How stuck are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reply was still quiet. \u201c\u2026only my head is free. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, hey! It\u2019s not your fault. I\u2019ll try to follow your voice.\u201d You replied, suddenly realizing exactly how\u2026young\u2026the voice you were hearing was. \u201cSo, what\u2019s your name? And how old are you, if I can ask that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice took a second to reply, delaying you in following them to their location. \u201cMy name is Brady\u2026and I\u2019m twelve.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced. Only twelve? This kid was way too young to be smushed inside of a curvaceous woman\u2019s rear end, smeared so flat only his head could reform. From the trembling in his voice, this was the first time something this drastic had happened to him, a fact you sympathized with but also were a little jealous of (for comparison, fate had it out for you ever since you were a little child).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Brady. I\u2019m coming. We\u2019ll get through this, I promise you.\u201d You kept talking while you followed Brady\u2019s voice, inching your way a bit deeper into the woman\u2019s monumentally sized ass. It grew darker, danker, and a bit smellier, but eventually you felt Brady\u2019s squished body with your hands. You\u2019d made it to him, and as you feared, he was well and truly glued in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could get to work on freeing him, you felt the entire world around you shake and rumble. Jamming your hands and feet into the woman\u2019s doughy cheeks, you cried out from the strain of holding yourself as the woman shifted and moved. You quickly realized that she was standing up, but for what reason, you didn\u2019t know yet. All that mattered was keeping from sliding out of her ass and falling out into the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen everything stopped moving, the angle of the woman\u2019s crack had, of course, moved from horizontal to vertical, but the circumstance remained the same. Shifting yourself to keep your balance, you began scratching and pulling at Brady\u2019s mashed body, ever-so-slowly peeling him off of the woman\u2019s skin. The whole time, you assured him all would work out, and he incessantly thanked you for saving him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of the woman\u2019s ass, in the light of the sun, the woman had stopped because she was finally taking notice of her unruly swimsuit and its tendency to require readjustment. She took care of her top first, pulling the stringy fabric of her barely-there bikini into place so as to fit snuggly around her titanic tits and cover her nipples. Though stopping her swim was a nuisance, the woman couldn\u2019t help but smile at the light and heat of the sun. She loved the ocean so, so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was fixing her bikini, a second woman waded through the waves up to her, catching the first woman\u2019s attention with a friendly wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there! My name is Debbie.\u201d The second woman said, smiling brightly. \u201cCouldn\u2019t help but notice your speed and efficiency while swimming. It was perfect form.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman who had you and Brady in her ass laughed appreciatively. \u201cThanks. Swimming is my passion, I guess.\u201d She offered her hand to Debbie for a handshake. \u201cMy name is Lisa.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Lisa.\u201d Debbie shook her hand. \u201cCare for a race? I consider myself a swimming pro too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour giantess, named Lisa apparently, cocked an eyebrow. \u201cThat so? Heh. Might have to take you up on that offer. No holds barred, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie grinned. \u201cExactly. Fastest one out to that buoy\u2026\u201d Debbie pointed to the marker indicating the end of the safe swimming zone, far out to sea. \u201c\u2026and then back to shore wins. Loser buys ice-cream. That work for you, Lisa?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa\u2019s confident smile grew, and she rolled her shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re on, Debbie. Let me just\u2026\u201d Lisa trailed off as she reached a hand behind her back, snagged her unruly thong, and let it snap back into place around her doughy ass, her flesh rippling from the impact. \u201c\u2026alright! All set, on your mark!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside the dark confines of Lisa\u2019s ass, you\u2019d been hard at work on Brady, and had just managed to peel all of his body free when you saw the light of the sun (what few traces were visible) vanish completely as Lisa snapped her thong back into its rightful place. The rippling vibrations of her flesh a nanosecond later knocked you loose, and you slipped a few inches deeper into her butt crack before catching yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHunter! Are you okay?\u201d Brady exclaimed. \u201cShe just sealed us up in here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grimaced. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Brady. And yeah, this is looking rough. Just hold in there, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully, you had absolutely no idea what to do now that your only exit had been so efficiently covered up. Maybe you and Brady working together could push the thong aside and escape, but with the woman\u2019s constant moving, it\u2019d be tricky. Not to mention, if she started swimming again, it would become a chaotic hell inside of her crack. You couldn\u2019t begin to imagine keeping both yourself and Brady safe in that scenario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the muffled mounds of butt flesh, you just barely heard a faint voice say <i>\u201cReady? Get set. Go!\u201d, </i>and then your whole world was movement. Uh oh. Looks like you weren\u2019t getting a choice.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the oblivious woman who\u2019s ass had trapped you and Brady began to swim, your position between her cheeks became a chaotic hell. You barely managed to keep the walls on either side of you and Brady from closing in and crushing you both completely, it was taking literally all your strength to do it, but you could feel your arms and legs begin to soften and compress under the relentless assault. <br>\r\nBy this point, Brady\u2019s arms and torso had started to pop back into shape slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk Brady, we\u2019re going to start to move towards the outside, I\u2019m going to keep a hold of you, but it\u2019s going to take both of us to move her swimsuit out of the way, ok?\u201d<br>\r\nIn the darkness you could barely see Brady\u2019s head nod faintly, the poor kid must have been terrified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the oblivious woman swam out towards the buoy, neck and neck with her competitor, you and Brady were slowly but surely crawling your way out from between her planetary butt cheeks. Both women were conserving their energy for the final stretch of the race, a fact that you could tell based on the fact that you and Brady had made it this far without being completely obliterated by the shifting masses on either side of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both made it to her thong just as they reached the buoy, and with a great amount of effort, you and Brady managed to shift the swimwear just enough for you to slip out one at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk Brady, I\u2019ll let you go out first. I\u2019ll be right behind you, but just in case we get separated I have a friend who helped me get out to you. She has an oversized T-shirt and is using a RC boat. Find her and ask her to take you to a lifeguard and tell them what happened. If you can\u2019t find her go to the middle lifeguard tower and find a lifeguard named Quinn, I\u2019ll find you there, ok?\u201d As you gave these instructions, Brady nodded. Just as he was about to start crawling out you felt the cheeks around you tense up, you could tell that they were about to spring into action again. Thinking quickly, you grabbed Brady by the arm and threw him as hard as you could out of the woman\u2019s ass crack into the water with a splash. However, that moment of not concentrating on holding her cheeks at bay cost you dearly, as they sprung back to life, the grinding cheeks, each one taking turns to tense and squeeze as she swam, grabbed hold of your legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicking you let go of the walls with your other arm and attempted to pull your paper-thin legs free, but you just felt yourself getting dragged further and further in, the cheeks steamrolling your body slowly as you were dragged between them. You let out one last unheard cry for help before your head was flattened by the shifting, doughy flesh. <br>\r\nYou fully expected your flattened form to stick to her cheek, and it almost did, but a slightly larger than usual wave surged from behind your unaware captor. This did two things, it made the skin that was currently smothering you too wet for you to stick to, but it also forced your flattened body even deeper between her cheeks. Between the force of the wave and the constant tensing of each cheek shimmying your body deeper and deeper. You reached very deepest part of this oblivious woman\u2019s ass before she had even made it halfway to the shore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour poor, paper thin form eventually settled on the last place you ever wanted to be near, the wrinkled surface of Lisa\u2019s butthole. The water hadn\u2019t reached this deep into Lisa\u2019s cavernous asscrack, so the pressure exerted by her globular butt cheeks pressed you firmly into her anus. Your body stuck to it, with your head and torso stuck on one side of the ring, and your flattened legs laying across the actual hole of her anus. Thankfully it was closed at the moment, so this was the furthest you could go. Eventually you felt the gravity shift as your captor emerged from the water, now standing up straight, but you were buried so deep in her ass that it made no difference, you wouldn\u2019t be escaping this prison without outside assistance. <br>\r\nThis was really bad, the only person who knew you were in here was Brady, and you didn\u2019t know what had happened to him after you managed to get him out of here. You just had to hope he would manage to get word to Quinn and she\u2019d be able to free you, otherwise you could be trapped in here for a while because you imagine this woman wouldn\u2019t be able to find you this deep in her ass without someone helping since it\u2019s probably too big for her to see inside on her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa waded out of the water, frustrated. She had just lost by a hair to Debbie, the woman who challenged her to a race, and Lisa was a sore loser.<br>\r\n\u201cYay, looks like I win,\u201d Debbie playfully stuck her tongue out at Lisa. \u201cLooks like you owe me an ice cream.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah I know, let\u2019s go and I\u2019ll buy you one,\u201d as Lisa grumbled, she felt that her bikini bottoms were needing adjusted again. She hooked a finger around them and discreetly pulled them back to the centre of her ass. What she didn\u2019t notice was the tiny stowaway who had been hanging on to them to get back to shore, who now fell to the sand below with an inaudible thud. Lisa was tensing in frustration, clearly very upset at losing the race, and anyone standing behind her would be able to see that she was clenching her but cheeks as well, a small habit when she got angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two women passed by her, the woman with the RC boat looked at Lisa\u2019s monumental, giggling ass with concern. Had you managed to escape, or were you also stuck in there. She turned her attention to the shore, hoping to see you swim out of the sea any moment now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two women walked to the snack bar in the middle of the beach, Lisa started to feel a small itch deep in her ass, right on her asshole. It felt like a flat piece of fabric brushing against it from the movement of her cheeks, most likely a small piece of thread from her bikini bottom. She groaned inwardly, knowing she couldn\u2019t reach her hand into her ass to adjust it in public like this.<br>\r\nShe also felt a building pressure in her gut, her rapid swimming had clearly caused some gas to move down her intestines and now it was waiting to be released. Lisa smiled, thinking she could possibly solve two problems at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to Debbie, who was currently a few feet in front of her, Lisa could see that she was focusing on the snack bar. All of the other beach goers around her also seemed distracted, so now was a good time. <br>\r\nLisa smiled, and began concentrating on letting out a small fart, just enough to ease the pressure building in her bowels and to shift the thread that was tickling her, she could get the rest later. <br>\r\nAs it came out, she was happy that it made no sound, and the tickling sensation in her ass disappeared as well. Clearly her silent toot had been enough to move it away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your unaware captor walked to get ice cream. Your poor, battered form was pressed into the sticky creases of her asshole by the constantly clenched cheeks. All except your legs, which had enough space over the actual hole of the ring of muscle to flutter around as each step bounced your prison up and down, brushing against the horrible, wrinkled skin your body was currently stuck to. You just hoped that the ticking your legs would likely cause her would get her attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnluckily for you, your legs did get her attention, but not in the way that you wanted. As her walk continued, the clenching cheeks subsided slightly. This gave you the chance to see, now that your eyes had adjusted to the very dim light, two things. First, your flattened body was beginning to be pressed into the folds of the smelly ring of muscle it was adhered to, which caused you a great deal of panic, if this kept up then you could become engrained into the skin of this oblivious woman\u2019s asshole, nothing more than a little living tattoo on the least visible part of her body. The second thing you noticed was the asshole that you were stuck to was starting to bulge out, almost as if it was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sphincter opened and unleashed a torrent of gas into the small chamber you were trapped in, filling it with the scent of Lisa\u2019s bowels. The winds sent your legs fluttering outwards, before it suddenly stopped. As your legs flopped back onto the rapidly closing butthole, they passed through it, and as the sphincter closed, clamping around your midsection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour upper half was now pressed onto the outside of Lisa\u2019s asshole, while your legs were trapped on the inside. Panicking, you tried to thrash or buzz, anything you could do to get this bottom heavy woman\u2019s attention, but you found that you couldn\u2019t move a muscle. The damage that this woman\u2019s ass had done to you in the space of ten minutes meant you couldn\u2019t do anything to get her attention, and if this punishment kept up, you never would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two women sat down and Lisa begrudgingly paid for their ice cream, you consoled yourself with the fact that you at least managed to stop Brady from having to go through this. However, as Lisa shifted in her seat, smearing you further into the folds of muscle that you were stuck to, it was a small consolation. You just hoped Brady could get someone\u2019s attention and get you out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Brady gets either Quinn, or your new friend\u2019s attention. They find Lisa and get to work on freeing you, but will they succeed? <br>\r\n2) Brady gets someone\u2019s attention and they find Lisa, but she doesn\u2019t believe them or doesn\u2019t care.<br>\r\n3) Brady is unable to get anyone\u2019s attention, you remain stuck as Lisa and her family head home.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The stark contrast between your current experiences and Lisa\u2019s were night and day. You were suffering in unimaginable horror, engrained into the curvaceous woman\u2019s puckered butthole and coated in sweat and stink. She was enjoying a cold ice cream and gradually returning to her more cheerful demeanor, glad that she\u2019d found a new friend in Debbie. She was already letting go of her annoyance at losing the race, and with the itch deep in her crack taken care of, Lisa was back to her happy self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women conversed pleasantly, complimenting each other on their swimming skills and talking about their family and friends. As five minutes became ten, and then twenty, the two giantesses still showed no sign of moving, having already ordered seconds of ice cream. Every few minutes, Lisa would casually shift her position in her seat, grinding her meaty cheeks into your battered body. The pressure clenching all around you was overwhelming, and it was everything you had just to avoid passing out from the stress of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, Debbie glanced over to her left, and spotted another beachgoer walking away from the snack bar. Her eyes fell on the sight of a plastered tiny stuck to the bottom of the girl\u2019s flipflop. From the looks of it, the girl had no idea the tiny was there, and soon the girl was out of sight. Debbie snorted, causing Lisa to look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Debbie? Something funny?\u201d Lisa inquired, slipping another spoonful of delicious ice cream into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie grinned. \u201cSort of. I just saw one of those tinies stuck to a girl\u2019s flipflop, and she didn\u2019t seem to have a clue. Poor thing is probably gonna be smushed all day at this rate!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa gasped. \u201cWhat? That\u2019s awful! The poor guy!\u201d Your captor frowned. \u201cWhy is his pain funny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie sobered up, and looked carefully at her new friend. \u201cO-oh, sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to laugh.\u201d Debbie shrugged. \u201cI guess I just don\u2019t know any tinies personally, so their experiences are kind of foreign to me. None of my friends or family were shrunk. Seeing one today just\u2026hm, I don\u2019t know. They just seem funny to me.\u201d She gulped down a heaping helping of ice cream. \u201cI suppose they are still people, weird as they are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa put a hand on her well-endowed chest. \u201cThey are people, yes. I actually love tinies, and really try to look out for the little guys. Being so small and vulnerable all the time must be so hard on them! I am always willing to go out of my way to help a tiny in need.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie nodded, impressed. \u201cPretty noble of you. That can\u2019t be easy though, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa shook her head glumly. \u201cIt isn\u2019t. I\u2019ve had my share of accidents with tinies in the past, and always feel just so guilty afterwards! To know that I was responsible for causing a tiny pain? It\u2019s awful.\u201d She unconsciously picked at her thong. \u201cPlus, my darling daughters are much less\u2026careful\u2026around tinies than I am, so I often have to keep them in line too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa\u2019s ironic dedication to protecting tinies while simultaneously claiming your body with her ass was, predictably, entirely lost on you. Pressed in so deep, clenched on all sides by Lisa\u2019s sweaty cheeks, you couldn\u2019t hear a single sound from the outside world. Her passionate speech was nothing but inaudible murmurs, and your only take away was being smeared just a tiny bit more as Lisa adjusted her thong and wiggled in her seat again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still unaware of what was going on in the outside world a few minutes later, as fate cut you break for the first time that day, and your potential saviors ran over to the snack bar: Quinn, the RC boat lady, and Brady!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn put her hand on Lisa\u2019s shoulder, causing your captor to jump in her seat from surprise, and let out a cute yelp. That little jump, though miniscule in importance to all who saw it, dragged your flattened form another millimeter into Lisa\u2019s asshole. Your pancaked form slipped across the wrinkled muscle, and you mentally screamed in panic for someone, anyone to stop this from being your final fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, but are you Lisa?\u201d Quinn asked, forcefully but not rudely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa blinked her eyes, then nodded slowly. \u201cY-yes\u2026I am. Am I in trouble, miss?\u201d Lisa wondered, taking note of Quinn\u2019s lifeguard uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling awkward, Debbie stood up and pointed off in the distance. \u201cI\u2019m going to go use the restroom, Lisa. I\u2019ll catch up later!\u201d She backed away from the snack bar, and the RC boat lady took her seat on Lisa\u2019s right side. Quinn was standing by Lisa\u2019s left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t in trouble.\u201d Quinn assured her. \u201cYou\u2019ve just, potentially, done something on accident, and we need your cooperation in fixing it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa paled, but nodded. \u201cOf course, I\u2019ll help however I can! Although\u2026what exactly is it that you need from me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrady can explain better.\u201d Quinn motioned over to the RC boat lady, and to the young tiny resting on her shoulder. Brady looked weary and on edge, but also had a glint of determination in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cleared his throat and began talking, nervously at first. \u201cW-well\u2026my name is Brady. I was here at the beach with a few friends, when that big wave pushed us all out into the water. Next thing I knew, the flow of water pushed me right inside of\u2026uh\u2026\u201d He faltered, looking at Lisa\u2019s innocent expression. \u201c\u2026inside of your butt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa\u2019s jaw dropped, but Brady pressed on before she could say anything. \u201cI was squished pretty bad when you started swimming. Then, right as I was breaking down crying, this tiny guy named Hunter showed up from basically nowhere. He kept me calm and told me it would be alright, then he pushed me out to freedom.\u201d Brady wiped a tear from his eye. \u201cBut he was left behind, and he might still be there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked on the verge of passing out. \u201cS-so\u2026you\u2019re saying that a tiny named Hunter\u2026is trapped in my ass?!?\u201d She exclaimed, her pitch rising to feverish heights. Quinn grabbed her by the shoulders and whispered gently in her ear for her to calm down, demonstrating a startling level of considerate care you\u2019d yet to see from her (and, technically, still hadn\u2019t).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe MIGHT be. That\u2019s why we need to check.\u201d Quinn explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe RC boat lady smiled ruefully. \u201cBrady managed to get my attention a few minutes back, explained the situation to me, and then the two of us found Quinn. This little guy went above and beyond to return Hunter\u2019s favor.\u201d She winked at Brady, who blushed adorably. \u201cAlso, I\u2019m Gigi. Don\u2019t think I\u2019ve introduced myself yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa leapt to her feet, nearly spilling her remaining ice cream, and causing her prodigious breasts and ass to wobble like jelly. \u201cWell, what are we waiting for! Let\u2019s go to the locker room or something and help Hunter out!\u201d Lisa proclaimed, then glanced backward at her alluring derriere. \u201cOh, I hate knowing I\u2019ve done awful things to tinies. It\u2019s the worst!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn put a confident hand on Lisa\u2019s back and began leading her to the locker room. \u201cHey, it wasn\u2019t your fault. Let\u2019s just help Hunter out, and then you can apologize and have a genuine introduction to him. He\u2019s a pretty great guy.\u201d Quinn said, then paused. A faint flush filled her cheeks. \u201c\u2026or whatever. He\u2019s alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later, and the group of four (five if you included yourself) were in the employee locker room. Quinn had chosen that spot so that they wouldn\u2019t be interrupted by any public beachgoers coming in and out. Then, without hesitating a second, Lisa had stripped off her thong and laid out on the bench, letting her incredible bare booty stick up into the air. She also grabbed one fleshy globe-like butt cheek in each hand and peeled them back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven still, this barely did anything for you. You were simply buried so deep in her butt (a butt that was already unfathomably massive), that even with her bikini taken off and her cheeks peeled apart, the majority of your body was still clenched tight by her butthole. Trace amounts of light filtered down onto you, and a small whiff of fresh air, but it was nowhere near enough to clear the miasma of rank sweat stench from your nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn took a cursory glance into Lisa\u2019s ass, wrinkling her nose at the unpleasant smell. She couldn\u2019t see you at all, so she motioned to Gigi. Taking her cue, Gigi flicked a small switch on the side of her RC boat and turned on the boat\u2019s front lights. For such a small toy, the lights were surprisingly bright, and Gigi aimed the white beams down into Lisa\u2019s crack, illuminating the woman\u2019s booty abyss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn took a second look, but still couldn\u2019t see you. She was beginning to grow frustrated by this point, until her eyes focused in on a gross sight that was a little off. The woman\u2019s brown anus had a splotch on it that was a slightly lighter shade of brown. It was your hair that Quinn was seeing, and as she peered even closer, she could just barely make out one of your eyes, gazing up at her pleadingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn cursed under her breath. \u201cI see him, and it\u2019s really bad. He\u2019s more than halfway inside of your anus, Lisa.\u201d<br>\r\nLisa groaned miserably, but thankfully didn\u2019t move. Gigi leaned against the bench to steady herself, and kept the boat light\u2019s trained on your body. Quinn, too, kneeled down to get closer to Lisa\u2019s ass, and looked at your pitiful form. Brady, still on Gigi\u2019s shoulder, was panic-stricken at seeing how thoroughly demolished you\u2019d been by Lisa\u2019s cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough often one to let tinies fight their own battles as a form of tough love, Quinn knew that if she didn\u2019t act now to save you, the possibility of you being irrevocably sucked into Lisa\u2019s butt was a true threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProblem was, not even Quinn had a single clue how to go about freeing you now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Seeing your crumpled form plastered to Lisa\u2019s anus, Quinn was panicking, even if she wasn\u2019t outwardly showing it. One wrong move could potentially damn you to spending a long time trapped inside Lisa\u2019s colon, a fate that she was one of the few people who could save you from. <br>\r\nLooking nervously to Gigi and Brady, Quinn could see them looking to her for guidance, also completely unsure what to do. Quinn gulped nervously and started Quickly trying to think how to free you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou meanwhile were looking up at the people who would hopefully be your saviours fearfully. Your position on Lisa\u2019s butthole felt like you were being slowly swallowed by some dangerous animal, every slight shift from this woman had the potential to slide your body slightly further into the depths of her ass, if the three people above you didn\u2019t interfere your life would likely be over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn\u2019s fingers slowly and carefully approached your head, hoping that she would just be able to grab you by the head and pull you out. She hoped, rather optimistically, that the simplest solution would prove the most effective. However, she was proven wrong. As Quinn\u2019s fingers approached you, they brushed against the sensitive skin of Lisa\u2019s inner ass crack. The proximity of Quinn\u2019s comparatively cold fingers caused Lisa\u2019s anus to twitch and pucker on reflex. You would have screamed out in horror if you could as your puny, crumpled form was dragged another few millimetres into Lisa\u2019s colon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLisa, can you please not do that. You\u2019re dragging him in further,\u201d Quinn, in her panic at seeing you slip away with her, said these words fairly aggressively to Lisa. Not out of malice, but genuine panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sorry, I can\u2019t help it! Your fingers are just so cold!\u201d Lisa was on the verge of tears knowing that her unconscious movements were inching a poor, defenceless tiny closer to being trapped inside her, potentially never to be seen again. \u201cI\u2019ll try my best to not move, please just get him out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn turned to Gigi for ideas, as the two women were at a loss on what to do next, both of their attentions were grabbed by Brady, still perched on Gigi\u2019s shoulder.<br>\r\n\u201cI-I think I can get him out,\u201d Brady was attempting to put on a brave face but in truth he was terrified. In the end though, you had saved him so he had to at least try to return the favour.<br>\r\n\u201cOk Brady, don\u2019t worry though we\u2019ll be here to guide you. Plus I can keep you illuminated,\u201d Gigi smiled reassuringly towards the young tiny, lifting her RC boat up for emphasis. <br>\r\nBrady smiled nervously back to Gigi, as Quinn approached and wrapped a small piece of string around his waist. <br>\r\n\u201cJust so that we can definitely get you out, and maybe give you a bit more pulling strength to get Hunter out as well,\u201d Quinn\u2019s neutral expression broke and she gave Brady a small, nervous smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile that was all going on, you could feel Lisa\u2019s anus squeezing tighter and tighter, and you could feel it starting to bulge out slightly. She was going to fart again, and there was no telling what was going to happen to you when she did. Images of you being blown out of her ass by the force of it were swiftly replaced by the much more dangerous prospect of your tiny body slipping inside fully while it was yawning open. You began to panic, and hoped that Lisa would at least tell your friends of what was stirring in her bowels. To your shock she wasn\u2019t saying anything, maybe she was embarrassed about her gas? If that was the case, her embarrassment could potentially cost you your freedom if she farts before you could be rescued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrady was slowly lowered towards you by Quinn while Gigi kept the inside of Lisa\u2019s crack illuminated. As Brady was lowered, you could feel the anus you were attached to quiver as it strained to hold back the gas that was building up behind it. Every second seemed to crawl by as Brady was lowered onto the skin just above Lisa\u2019s butthole and began to clamber down. The anus didn\u2019t quiver to his touch, but it wasn\u2019t because Lisa couldn\u2019t feel him, it was primarily because the smelly band of muscle was straining to hold back her gas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several seconds of Brady being out of your sight, being hidden over the lip of the bulging ring of muscle, he appears over it, only an inch away from you. <br>\r\nHe scrambled over to you and started to pull and tug at you, his small fingers actually managing to get between your skin and Lisa\u2019s!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe strained for a few seconds in silence before an ominous gurgle pierced the silence. Eyes wide, Brady began feverishly peeling you from Lisa\u2019s skin as quickly as he could. Looking up, Quinn and Gigi\u2019s eyes were also wide, clearly the gurgle was loud enough for them to hear as well. They each gave Lisa a look of pleading, clearly they were silently begging her to hold it in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease hurry up little guy! I don\u2019t know how long I can hold this for!\u201d Lisa\u2019s pleading made you feel sorry for her, she wasn\u2019t intentionally doing this to you, her body was betraying her efforts to aid your rescuers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrady\u2019s feverish peeling managed to loosen every part of your body still outside of Lisa\u2019s bowels within a few minutes. He looked up to Quinn and signalled that she would have to pull you out the rest of the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn nodded and began to pull Brady out, with Brady clinging as hard as he could, but your body just wouldn\u2019t budge. Lisa\u2019s butthole had your torso and legs in a vice-like grip. Brady was straining to keep a hold of your body, his arms actually stretching out slightly as he and Quinn were essentially using your body in a tug of war with Lisa\u2019s anus, a game which the anus seemed to be winning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter around a minute of this stalemate, Lisa\u2019s anus twitched, and before you could react, an explosion of gas surged out of Lisa in an explosive fart. <br>\r\nThe fart must have lasted ten seconds, and the force of it buffeted Brady all over the space between Lisa\u2019s wobbling cheeks. Brady struggled to keep his grip of your flattened form which was being blown in all directions, but he did manage to keep hold of you. You noticed with an immense feeling of relief that Lisa\u2019s gigantic fart had blown your lower body out of her anus, freeing you!<br>\r\nAs Quinn quickly pulled you and a gagging Brady free, you noticed both her and Gigi\u2019s noses were crinkled in disgust at the horrible smell which infused the whole room, although it wasn\u2019t nearly as bad as what you and Brady endured at point blank range. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry guys, I just couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore! Please tell me you got him,\u201d Lisa\u2019s voice was laced with embarrassment and worry. As you were pulled out from her ass crack, you could see her face looking back over her shoulder at her mountain of an ass was bright red with shame. That was until she saw Brady clinging to your flattened form. Before you could even blink, Lisa flipped over and grabbed you. Holding you close to her generous chest she began showering you with apologies. You couldn\u2019t even respond in your flattened state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you quite a while to reform, Lisa\u2019s ass had done considerable damage to you. You now sat, fully reformed in Quinn\u2019s palm, surrounded by your rescuers and Lisa. Brady sat in Quinn\u2019s palm with you, having not left your side since Lisa had relinquished you after showering you with apologies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain, I\u2019m so sorry Hunter, if I had known that you were back there I\u2019d have tried to free you in an instant,\u201d Lisa still looked upset, even now that you were free. She continued, much quieter than the first part.\u201c... and I\u2019m sorry I farted on you\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly Lisa, it\u2019s ok. It wasn\u2019t your fault, and it all worked out in the end,\u201d you smiled up at Lisa, who\u2019s frown softened at your acceptance of her apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Hunter, anyway I\u2019ve gotta go, my kids will be wondering where I am, see you guys around,\u201d with that Lisa left, and you couldn\u2019t help but stare with no small amount of fear at the bouncing bubble butt you were almost lost in. <br>\r\nTearing your gaze away from Lisa, you turned to your friends who helped rescue you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you all so much, I don\u2019t know what would have happened if you all hadn\u2019t interfered.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, no problem little dude! As much as it was a bad situation it was pretty fun sending you out on my little boat, if you need any help with that sort of thing again, give me a call!\u201d Gigi exclaimed. She was clearly back to her excitable, slightly nerdy self now that the damaged had passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I\u2019ll be sure to do that!\u201d You turned to Brady. \u201cThanks a lot kid. You did great, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have gotten out of there without you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-Thanks Hunter... I think I should be the one thanking you though. If it wasn\u2019t for you Lisa wouldn\u2019t even have been aware anything was wrong. She\u2019d have left the beach with me still back there and... and...\u201d he trailed off, not wanting to think about what could have happened to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to Quinn. \u201cThanks Quinn, I knew you\u2019d have my back, partner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn glanced down at you, trying to act unconcerned, but hearing your words she responded.<br>\r\n\u201cT-Thanks Hunter... glad you\u2019re ok...\u201d you noticed a small blush on her pale face as she said it. As quickly as it appeared, however, it disappeared. \u201cWe should probably go and tell Brigitte what happened. Gigi, you ok to get Brady back to his friends?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGigi nodded and, with a small smile to Brady, carried him off to find the people he came to the beach with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens when you reach Brigitte\u2019s office?<br>\r\n1) Brigitte decides that you and Gigi did such a good job with the boat rescue that she offers Gigi a job to help you patrol the beach in her RC boat.<br>\r\n2) Brady\u2019s family arrives later on and wants to thank you.<br>\r\n3) Brigitte asks you to help find the other tinies that are still missing after the wave.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brigitte huffed out a laugh. \u201cWow, that\u2019s one hell of a story, you two.\u201d She shook her head ruefully. \u201cNot a single day on the job done, and you\u2019re nearly sucked right inside some woman\u2019s ass? A tiny life\u2019s a rough one, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced nervously at Quinn, who was holding you out in her hands towards Brigitte, then looked at your redheaded boss and managed a small laugh. \u201cUh\u2026y-yeah. Yeah it is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this moment in time, Quinn had taken you to Brigitte\u2019s office without incident, and the two of you in tandem had explained everything that had transpired. The tidal wave in the tiny section, Brady stuck inside Lisa\u2019s ass, Gigi and her RC boat getting you to Lisa, freeing Brady, almost being claimed by the monumental booty, and then the combined team effort that freed you. Honestly, you were still a bit frazzled by how closely you\u2019d come to doom today, and Brigitte\u2019s blas\u00e9 attitude was off-putting (not that you\u2019d say as much to her face).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging her shoulders, Brigitte interrupted your train of thought by leaning forward at her desk. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m incredibly impressed by all of you. Quinn\u2019s quick-thinking saved your life, Hunter, and your own selflessness saved that young boy\u2019s. Also, that girl with the boat\u2026Gigi, right? Her resourcefulness enabled you to get the job done as well.\u201d Your boss smiled approvingly. \u201cRound of applause for everyone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, ma\u2019am.\u201d You said, graciously, and Quinn did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat being said, I think you two have both done enough for one day. Go home a bit early, why don\u2019tcha?\u201d Brigitte offered. You breathed a sigh of relief at those words, and sank back into your roommate\u2019s steady hand. Quinn as well turned to leave, but Brigitte spoke up once more. \u201cOh, Quinn! Before you go, find that Gigi girl and send her to speak to me. Alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing, boss.\u201d Quinn replied, and then the two of you left Brigitte\u2019s office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, Quinn set you down on a bench in the lifeguard locker room and ran off to get Gigi. It only took her a few minutes, and then she was back. She changed out of her ill-fitting uniform (while you politely looked in the opposite direction despite the incredible temptation), and then Quinn scooped you up again and headed out to the parking lot. The two of you got into her car and drove home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the night passed as predictably as possible. You and your new roommates enjoyed a nice dinner, and the four of you passed the time by talking about your respective days, as well as a few general icebreakers (favorite hobbies, favorite movies, superpower of choice, and the like). Avery sat on you twice by accident, and Morgan almost unknowingly dragged you into her shower when she ended up squishing you between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, your own strength and willpower saved you each time, a fact that seemed to impress Quinn. In fact, Quinn offered you a small space in her own room to sleep, as she managed to clear her incredible clutter and mess aside. Avery teased her relentlessly for rooming with you, but finally peace and quiet came as you and your new roommate and friend slipped into slumberland. Day one at Sanderson Beach had been a day you\u2019d never forget (not with nightmares sure to follow), and you could only hope future days would be much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning was standard and routine, and it wasn\u2019t long before you and Quinn were both dressed, well-fed, and off to Sanderson Beach. Going through the motions was painless and easy, as Quinn carried you along with her into the lifeguard locker room so she could put her stuff away and change back into her scandalously tight and revealing one-piece. Your mental fortitude was a bit weaker than the previous day, but all it took Quinn was a press of her big toe to squish you flat when she caught you attempting to sneak a peek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrying your papery form with her, Quinn left the locker room and strolled into Brigitte\u2019s office. The fiery redhead and sent Quinn a text that morning asking her to stop by before heading out to her shift at the left tower, and Quinn was more than willing to comply. What she (and you) were NOT expecting was to see a familiar face standing in Brigitte\u2019s office, RC boat tucked under one arm, and bright red lifeguard uniform clinging to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGigi\u2019s conversation with Brigitte the previous day had obviously been about applying for a job, because it was clear to see that she\u2019d both applied and been hired on the spot, and was ready to start her first day. She smiled at you and Quinn, and as you finally reformed from your much-deserved squishing, you got your first good and proper look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGigi appeared to be in her mid-to-late twenties, and around 5\u20198\u201d or so. Her short, curly brown hair framed her cute face well, and a light dappling of freckles on her light tanned skin brought out her hazel eyes and dimpled smile. As you\u2019d surmised the previous day, Gigi was no slouch in the proportions department, a fact highlighted by the slimming lifeguard one-piece. Though nowhere near someone like Quinn, the swell of her chest was sizable, as was the heft of her rear end. She was definitely an attractive girl, for sure, and you had to keep yourself from staring too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLong time no see, huh?\u201d Gigi smirked playfully. \u201cGuess I\u2019m here to stay now, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn folded her arms (you were resting on her shoulder). \u201cBrigitte roped you into applying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte scoffed. \u201cYou make it sound like this place is a chore to work at, Quinn.\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cAnd hell, if it isn\u2019t sometimes\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGigi laughed, but shook her head. \u201cNo no, I was more than eager. I\u2019ve honestly just been kinda drifting through life lately. Brigitte gave me the opportunity, and I really had no reason to turn it down!\u201d She began to twirl a strand of her hair. \u201cAnd, if I\u2019m totally honest, yesterday was a lot of fun. Only because it all worked out in the end, though!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFully reformed, you spoke up. \u201cGlad to have you aboard, Gigi! I couldn\u2019t have saved Brady without you, and I probably wouldn\u2019t have been saved in turn without you as well! Thank you so much!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGigi blushed faintly, and waved off your praise. \u201cIt was nothing, dude. Always happy to help. Actually, speaking of that\u2026\u201d She glanced knowingly at Brigitte.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour boss cleared her throat. \u201cYeah, right, so\u2026I\u2019ve got an assignment for you two. Hunter and Gigi, from this day and onto the next few weeks, I want the two of you as a pair. Partners, if you will. Yesterday showed me that having a tiny on staff presents its own set of challenges, but also opportunities.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d You inquired, looking between her and Gigi. Gigi was smiling at you with understanding, and it was clear she had already been briefed on this partnership.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBasically, I want you too patrolling the beach, but making use of Gigi\u2019s special little vehicle.\u201d Brigitte gestured to Gigi\u2019s RC boat. For the first time since entering the room, you took note of how the RC boat had been painted bright red, and a little sticker of the Sanderson Beach logo was glued onto the hull of the boat. Brigitte continued. \u201cJust like you saved Brady, the two of you can help out so many more people by working together. Am I understood?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked for a second, buying yourself time to process this information, but finally nodded. \u201cO-of course, ma\u2019am. Gigi and I will be the best partners on this whole beach!\u201d You pumped your first excitedly, earning a giggle from Gigi, an approving nod from Brigitte, and a wary eyeroll from Quinn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your black-haired roommate handed you off to Gigi, you could\u2019ve sworn you saw a brief look of apprehension (and maybe something more) cross her face, before it was immediately replaced with nonchalant apathy. Was she worried about your safety, Gigi\u2019s reliability, or the fact that you wouldn\u2019t be spending time with her? Regardless, Quinn then merely gave you a wave and left the office, leaving you to turn and look up at the gigantic smiling face of your new partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCradling you delicately in her palm, Gigi and you said your goodbyes to Brigitte and then left her office, headed out towards the beach for your first day as patrol partners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce at the ocean\u2019s edge, Gigi stepped out into the lapping waves and set her RC boat down, and then gently lowered you into the small plastic driver\u2019s seat. Once in the seat, you realized that lying beside you was a replacement miniature megaphone to make up for the one you\u2019d lost the other day. You tested it out by calling up to your new partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey up there! Steer me well!\u201d You joked, and Gigi laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will, Hunter!\u201d She twirled the RC controller around dexterously. \u201cI\u2019ve been piloting and driving these sorts of vehicles since I was four. They\u2019ve always been kind of an obsession of mine.\u201d She blushed lightly again, obviously a bit embarrassed of her dorky hobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave her a thumbs-up. \u201cSounds awesome to me! They\u2019ll be calling us the dynamic duo before long!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGigi\u2019s grin widened at your remark, and seeing her towering form illuminated by the shining morning light cast her in a radiant aura. It was like looking at a beautiful goddess. It wasn't as ludicrous as it was on Quinn, but the tight one-piece still clung to her decently sizable curves appealingly, and showed off a fair bit of skin. Admittedly, you were a bit anxious about this whole RC patrolling partnership, but if it had to be spent with a good-humored and gorgeous girl like Gigi, then it surely wouldn\u2019t be too bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before you could ponder the potential issues that would come with your new assignment, you felt the RC boat surge into motion as Gigi manoeuvred it forward. She was sure to avoid most of the larger waves, displaying a skill at controlling the vehicle that you hadn\u2019t had the chance to fully appreciate yesterday, during the emergency situation that you had last ridden on the boat in. <br>\r\nAlthough she did at one point steer the boat straight into a small cresting wave, which soaked you. You turned back to see her smirking and suppressing a laugh, and you could only chuckle to yourself, amused by the slightly older girl\u2019s immature joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spent the next thirty minutes sitting in Gigi\u2019s boat as she drove it along the shore as she walked along the shore keeping pace with you. Aside from keeping an eye out for trouble you didn\u2019t have a whole lot to do, it was pretty relaxing. You were too far out to be able to converse with Gigi while you patrolled, but you recall Bridgitte saying that if this partnership worked out she would look into getting a tiny sized walkie talkie for you to be able to communicate easier with Gigi, plus you were sure you would be able to get to know her better when you two stopped for lunch. <br>\r\nJust as you were starting to get a little bored, you noticed a teenage girl, maybe around fourteen or so, who seemed to be struggling to swim and was fairly far out to sea, you looked back to Gigi, and saw that she had noticed her as well. Gigi gave you a thumbs up and began steering you out towards the struggling teen. <br>\r\nThe boat was pretty fast, so you made it out to her in record time. You couldn\u2019t really make out a whole lot about her, as she was flailing and struggling in the water, all you could really make out was her long, red hair and pale skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approached you pulled out your megaphone.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ok? What\u2019s wrong? I\u2019m a lifeguard so I\u2019m here to help,\u201d you said these words with confidence, but you weren\u2019t sure exactly how you would be able to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI- ugh,\u201d she seemed to be struggling to keep her head above water and thus wasn\u2019t really able to communicate what was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, if you\u2019re struggling to swim just lay back and try to float, ok. Can you do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl didn\u2019t seem to acknowledge what you had said, but she shifted in the water and managed to, after a small struggle, start to float on her back. The motion of her body shifting like that so close to the boat rocked it slightly in the water, but you managed to keep your footing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to be struggling to keep herself afloat and her plain, freckled face was contorted in pain. Her posture seemed off, she seemed unable to lie straight on her back, her skinny body was hunched slightly as she clutched her midsection. Now that she wasn\u2019t struggling to keep her head above water she turned to speak to you, revealing a mouth filled with braces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hi... I\u2019m Sandy, s-sorry for the trouble, I just got cramp and started to panic,\u201d she blushed in embarrassment at the trivial reason that she was struggling. \u201cI-It\u2019s just that I didn\u2019t want to come out this far... B-but my sister and her friends sorta forced me to come out this far or they said they\u2019d tell a boy at school that I liked him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said this you followed her eyes to a group of girls sat on the beach laughing at her. They looked older than Sandy, you would guess around eighteen or nineteen, and in terms of looks they were a far cry from the scrawny girl you were helping. Each of the four girls were absolute knockouts, even from this distance. <br>\r\nOne in particular grabbed your attention as you surveyed the group. She sat in the middle of the group, that fact along with the approval seeking looks that the others gave her as they chatted, which made you think that she was at the top of the pecking order. She was similar in appearance to Sandy, sharing her red hair and pale skin, which told you this was probably her sister, however the resemblance ended there. Her sister was a bombshell, she looked incredibly tall, with long, toned legs. You could see where her younger sister was thin and scrawny, this girl was curvy and toned. Her body looked sculpted by years of athletics, and her face was incredibly pretty, even if it was currently twisted in a mean spirited smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tore your gaze away from the gorgeous older sister back to Sandy.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t worry about them. They sound like jerks. The best thing you can do right now is just breathe, the cramp will go away if you just relax and breathe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou coached Sandy\u2019s breathing for a few minutes until the cramp went away. She gave you a small \u201cT-thanks\u201d before paddling back towards the shore. You could tell from the way she swam back to shore that she wasn\u2019t a confident swimmer, and seeing her older sister and her friends teasing her made your blood boil. Gigi didn\u2019t seem to notice the group of mean girls, as her gaze was fixed on the ocean, and you. <br>\r\nPutting your anger to the back of your mind you began to scan the rest of the beach as Gigi steered you further down the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Gigi had just patrolled all the way down to the left hand side of the beach with very few incidents, you had to be driven out to tell some kids to turn around as they were swimming too far out to sea, but that was about it. <br>\r\nYou were patrolling back up to the middle of the beach when you spotted a commotion further out to sea. Looking to Gigi, she nodded before steering you out to check it out. <br>\r\nThe section of water that you were speeding across wasn\u2019t very deep, which meant that most people could stand up in it, with the water coming up to an average person\u2019s stomach, but it was still quite a distance out and your boat moved much faster through the water than it would take Gigi to wade through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pulled closer to the source of the commotion you saw what was causing it. A familiar group of four girls were cruelly cackling as their leader repeatedly dunked another girl headfirst in the water over and over. As their victim was pulled up for air you recognised the gasping face of Sandy. Your blood boiled at the sight of this young girl being picked on like this. You knew how it felt to be picked on by someone massively larger and more powerful than yourself, so you sympathised with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your boat zoomed towards the group you pulled out your megaphone.<br>\r\n\u201cHEY!\u201d You shouted out, loud enough for them to hear thanks to the megaphone. The four girls were momentarily distracted by your voice as they tried to figure out where it was coming from. As your boat drifted to a stop you continued. \u201cDown here. Stop picking on people, the last thing this beach needs is a group of bullies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they all turned to look down at you, their looks of confusion turned to amusement as they spotted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, lookie here girls, it\u2019s a little shrimpy tiny. What\u2019s the plan tough guy, you trying to help my little wuss of a sister?\u201d The lead girl smirked down at you with her hands on her hips. She was an intimidating sight for sure, she was tall enough that the water lapped at her belly button, so you were at the same height as her lean stomach. You looked past her to see Sandy slipping away while her sister was distracted. Her sister noticed this and turned to watch her scamper off.<br>\r\nSatisfied that you had allowed Sandy to escape, you turned and tried to signal for Gigi to steer you away and surprisingly, Gigi noticed you and started to steer you out of there. A split second after the boat started to move, you struggled to keep your footing as it lifted from the water to the face of Sandy\u2019s gorgeous, vindictive sister lifted the boat up, preventing your escape. <br>\r\n\u201cLeaving so soon?\u201d She pouted. \u201cBut you\u2019ve already lost me my entertainment, it would be rude not to make it up to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around for any kind of escape from these gigantic bullies, you spotted Gigi wading her way towards you in the relatively shallow water. You sighed in relief knowing that your partner would be able to help you out of this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Gigi talks the girls down and they thankfully recognise her authority as a lifeguard. They leave you alone.<br>\r\n2) The girls intimidate Gigi and she has to leave to go get help, but it takes a while, so the girls have free reign to torment you.<br>\r\n3) The girls intimidate Gigi and she has to leave to go get help. She returns later quickly with Bridgitte and Quinn, and they save you. Bridgitte decides you need some training to \u201ctoughen you up\u201d before she can send you out with Gigi again. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Seeing your crumpled form plastered to Lisa\u2019s anus, Quinn was panicking, even if she wasn\u2019t outwardly showing it. One wrong move could potentially damn you to spending a long time trapped inside Lisa\u2019s colon, a fate that she was one of the few people who could save you from. <br>\r\nLooking nervously to Gigi and Brady, Quinn could see them looking to her for guidance, also completely unsure what to do. Quinn gulped nervously and started Quickly trying to think how to free you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou meanwhile were looking up at the people who would hopefully be your saviours fearfully. Your position on Lisa\u2019s butthole felt like you were being slowly swallowed by some dangerous animal, every slight shift from this woman had the potential to slide your body slightly further into the depths of her ass, either that or you could potentially get flattened even further and engrained onto her anus like some kind of horrible tattoo. Either way if the three people above you didn\u2019t interfere your life would likely be over. <br>\r\nAs you stared up at Quinn specifically she seemed to lock eyes with you, her sympathetic expression replaced with one of determination when she saw your pleading eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn\u2019s fingers slowly and carefully approached your head, hoping that she would just be able to grab you by the head and pull you out. She hoped, rather optimistically, that the simplest solution would prove the most effective. However, she was proven wrong. As Quinn\u2019s fingers approached you, they brushed against the sensitive skin of Lisa\u2019s inner ass crack. The proximity of Quinn\u2019s comparatively cold fingers caused Lisa\u2019s anus to twitch and pucker on reflex. You would have screamed out in horror if you could as your puny, crumpled form was dragged another few millimetres into Lisa\u2019s colon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLisa, can you please not do that. You\u2019re dragging him in further,\u201d Quinn, in her panic at seeing you slip away with her, said these words fairly aggressively to Lisa. Not out of malice, but genuine panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sorry, I can\u2019t help it! Your fingers are just so cold!\u201d Lisa was on the verge of tears knowing that her unconscious movements were inching a poor, defenceless tiny closer to being trapped inside her, potentially never to be seen again. \u201cI\u2019ll try my best to not move, please just get him out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn turned to Gigi for ideas, as the two women were at a loss on what to do next, both of their attentions were grabbed by Brady, still perched on Gigi\u2019s shoulder.<br>\r\n\u201cI-I think I can get him out,\u201d Brady was attempting to put on a brave face but in truth he was terrified. In the end though, you had saved him so he had to at least try to return the favour.<br>\r\n\u201cOk Brady, don\u2019t worry though we\u2019ll be here to guide you. Plus I can keep you illuminated,\u201d Gigi smiled reassuringly towards the young tiny, lifting her RC boat up for emphasis. <br>\r\nBrady smiled nervously back to Gigi, as Quinn approached and wrapped a small piece of string around his waist. <br>\r\n\u201cJust so that we can definitely get you out, and maybe give you a bit more pulling strength to get Hunter out as well,\u201d Quinn\u2019s neutral expression broke and she gave Brady a small, nervous smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile that was all going on, you could feel Lisa\u2019s anus squeezing tighter and tighter, and you could feel it starting to bulge out slightly. She was going to fart again, and there was no telling what was going to happen to you when she did. Images of you being blown out of her ass by the force of it were swiftly replaced by the much more dangerous prospect of your tiny body slipping inside fully while it was yawning open. You began to panic, and hoped that Lisa would at least tell your friends of what was stirring in her bowels. To your shock she wasn\u2019t saying anything, maybe she was embarrassed about her gas? If that was the case, her embarrassment could potentially cost you your freedom if she farts before you could be rescued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrady was slowly lowered towards you by Quinn while Gigi kept the inside of Lisa\u2019s crack illuminated. As Brady was lowered, you could feel the anus you were attached to quiver as it strained to hold back the gas that was building up behind it. Every second seemed to crawl by as Brady was lowered onto the skin just above Lisa\u2019s butthole and began to clamber down. The anus didn\u2019t quiver to his touch, but it wasn\u2019t because Lisa couldn\u2019t feel him, it was primarily because the smelly band of muscle was straining to hold back her gas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an agonising wait, Brady emerged over the rim of her butthole. Scrambling over to you, he quickly got to work peeling you free.<br>\r\nBefore Brady had even managed to get your head free, the anus noticeably bulged out and you heard an intense gurgling coming from below you. Hearing this, you and Brady exchanged a worried look during the few seconds of calm before Lisa\u2019s butthole erupted. The force of her fart blew Brady upwards and out of her ass, losing his grip on you. You were pressed to the side of her anus and you could feel the force of the fart pushing you slowly out of her asshole, in sticking you from her anus, but not blowing you out like it had just done to Brady. The disgusting stream of hot gas suddenly ended, leaving you woozy, and you felt your body rapidly slip past the butthole and deep into Lisa\u2019s ass as you fell into unconsciousness...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god that stinks!\u201d Gigi coughed as she had o turn her face away from Lisa\u2019s backside. \u201cCome on Lisa, give us a little warning next time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, it just sorta slipped out. I\u2019ve been holding it since I sat down to get ice cream!\u201d Lisa, embarrassed, was going on the defensive. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to fart on him again and I thought I could hold it till he was out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn, crinkling her nose in disgust, quickly pulled a retching Brady away from the miasma that was expanding out from Lisa\u2019s ass and placed him on her palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease tell me you got him out,\u201d Lisa was mortified, but her number one concern right now was your safety. When she looked over her shoulder and saw Brady in Quinn\u2019s palm without you she paled. \u201cOh no. Is he ok? Someone check on him please!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFanning the smell away from her face, Gigi brought her RC boat over to illuminate Lisa\u2019s buttcrack. When the light illuminated her anus, Gigi gasped in horror. You were nowhere to be seen!<br>\r\n\u201cOh god, I don\u2019t see him! Did he maybe fly out? Brady, did you see what happened to Hunter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrady, still retching and trying not to vomit all over Quinn\u2019s hand, shook his head. <br>\r\nGigi looked to Quinn.<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think...\u201d her eyes drifted to Lisa\u2019s now closed butthole. Both women hoped you had been blown free, but deep down they both knew exactly what happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease tell me you\u2019ve found him!\u201d Lisa was growing hysterical. She hated this whole situation, but deep down she also knew what had happened. \u201cOh god...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke in an unfamiliar environment. It was hot, humid and it stank like a sewage pipe. You couldn\u2019t see a thing but you couldn\u2019t move so you assumed you were still flattened. The undulating wall that you were laying on was damp and sticky. <br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take a genius to figure out that you were trapped inside Lisa\u2019s ass. This was really bad, your chances of escaping this situation were diminishing by the minute.<br>\r\nYou tried to listen carefully to figure out what was happening in the outside world, but the sounds of Lisa\u2019s insides, the flow of blood through her veins in the walls around you and a heavy gurgling sound from deeper inside her, drowned out any muffled sounds you would be able to make out from the outside of this immensely curvy woman\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your surroundings shift as your unwilling captor moved around. The walls compressed inwards, pulling you deeper inside her before your body seemed to stick to a wall, halting your movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou silently prayed that Quinn and the others were working on a plan to free you. You just hoped you would get free before Lisa needed to use the bathroom, but as a torrent of gas passed over you towards the exit, renewing the awful smell in this chamber you were trapped in, you doubted it. If Lisa did use the bathroom with you in here, there was a good chance you\u2019d be permanently plastered to the wall of her colon. You had heard horror stories of tiny guys stuck in this exact position who never got out. Most hospitals wouldn\u2019t operate to remove a tiny from this position unless the person getting the surgery could afford it, so most tiny guys who got trapped inside a woman ended up in there permanently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the walls of Lisa\u2019s ass compressed you once again you just had to silently pray that a miracle would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Unable to handle the thought of you inside her, Lisa ran off in a panic. Quinn and Gigi are looking for her.<br>\r\n2) It\u2019s getting close to closing time for the beach. Lisa has to head home because she has to go to work and she can\u2019t miss it, you remain trapped while everyone brainstorms ways to save you.<br>\r\n3) Lisa is still in the changing room with Quinn, Gigi and Brady while they try to figure out a way to free you, do they come up with anything?</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s a two mile stretch that comprises Sanderson Beach\u2026so it\u2019ll take a while for someone of your size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, but were a little confused. \u201cI can do that. Any particular reason?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte smiled. \u201cOf course, dude. I need you to help anyone who might be in need. Maybe someone is lost? Maybe someone lost someTHING? Maybe a kid wants a friend to play with for an hour? Maybe someone wants a quick lesson in proper swimming postures?\u201d Brigitte shrugged casually. \u201cIt could really be anything. You never know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, okay. Thanks for the heads up!\u201d You said. You were about to turn and end the conversation when your new boss held up her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! One catch first, man.\u201d She sat back down and leaned forward in her chair, steepling her fingers. \u201cI need to hear you tell me exactly who you helped and what you did for them at the end of today\u2019s shift. If you didn\u2019t help out at least one person\u2026\u201d She made a cutting motion with her hand across her throat. \u201c\u2026the deal\u2019s off. Got it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slightest bit nervous, you nodded anyway. \u201cO-of course! Got it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then!\u201d Brigitte beamed, then turned her expression on Quinn. \u201cQuinn, girl, go ahead out. Drop Hunter off when you make it to the middle tower. He\u2019s on his own from there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn dipped her head almost imperceptibly. \u201cOf course. See you later.\u201d With that, your black-haired roommate turned on her heel and strode out of the door. You clung to her thumb to avoid falling off her palm, especially as the flat pavement gave way to the sandy dunes of Sanderson Beach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was beating down like crazy today, and the temperature was quite sweltering. Thankfully, you\u2019d lathered up in a bit of sunscreen earlier, and because of your small size, the slightest breeze felt like a storming wind. Thus, you kept cool relatively easily. Still, you were surprised how packed the beach was for still being before noon. Apparently, everyone else was willing to brave the weather for a nice and relaxing day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Quinn reached the base of the middle tower, she gently lowered you to the ground. With relief, you found the sand to be just firm enough to hold your weight without you sinking in. It was still an overwhelming experience to look out from the ground all around the beach. It was like a vast desert wonderland\u2026or perhaps wasteland was the better term.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing up at Quinn, you shielded your eyes from the sun and gave her a thumbs up. Surprisingly, Quinn returned your thumbs up, before sliding on sunglasses and scaling the ladder up to the top of the middle lifeguard tower. You were momentarily distracted (for the third time in less than an hour) by the sight of Quinn\u2019s magnificently shapely butt bounce as she climbed the ladder, and then you began walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it wasn\u2019t much more than a speck in the distance, you could make out the right tower. If you had to guess, it was a little less than a mile away. Once reaching that tower, your plan was to double back, pass the middle tower, and then hit the left tower. You would then have completed one and a half laps across the beach, and taking your size into account, it would probably be time to go home by then. Hopefully you would have helped at least one person by then, and maybe even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first five minutes of walking were simple and easy. Because of your size, walking across the sand was more like walking on normal ground, just with a few small hills and valleys every so often. It wasn\u2019t too bad, all things considered, though it was a little disheartening to turn around and see the comparably small distance you\u2019d covered from the middle tower in that time. Still, your whole life had prepared you for this, and you had more than enough stamina and endurance to keep up a good pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first troubling encounter happened after fifteen minutes. You had been walking in the direction of a woman who seemed nervous, and she was glancing around. Inferring that she was in need of a lifeguard such as yourself, you doubled your speed towards the woman, growing closer by the second. However, this single-minded drive to reach the woman had the obvious downside of blinding you to everything else in your peripheral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such, you were caught completely off guard when a young girl came sprinting by, laughing and giggling. Like a truck slamming into you, the little girl\u2019s foot crashed down onto you, her petite heel digging into your body. In the blink of an eye, you were crushed flat. The girl\u2019s weight also indented the sand around your body, leaving a curved imprint in the ground. When she took another step and raced off, you were left stuck to the ground by the pressure, though thankfully not too crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was only slightly relieving, as a second later, the girl\u2019s titanic mother strolled above you, her giant feet on either side of you. She was calling out to her daughter in an amused tone, warning her to slow down. While you were still reforming, the mother, never once looking down, rolled her eyes at her daughter\u2019s antics and then unfurled a towel from her bag. She then began to spread the towel out\u2026directly over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpurred on by this horrifying sight, you focused all your efforts and popped back into 3D, but you were a millisecond too late. The towel, a large, fluffy thing decorated in flower patterns, descending, falling over all of the ground around you like a veil from above. It touched the sand, forcing you onto your stomach, but thankfully not squishing you. You were still able to crawl along your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, crawl you did. You dashed madly along the coarse sands, scrambling like a demon-possessed crab. You had no idea where you were going in the darkness, but finally a sliver of light revealed itself. Pushing out into the light, you popped out from under the towel, and basked in the sunlight. A moment of reflection revealed that you had lost your shirt, probably when scrambling under the towel. It must\u2019ve ripped off. At least you still had your red swim trunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back, you saw the woman who had inadvertently thrown such a wrench into your day settle down onto her towel and pull out a novel to read. Looking away from her, you glumly saw the woman you had been intending to help all along graciously receiving aid from Quinn, of all people. In reality, you were still no more than fifty yards from the middle tower, and so your roommate had taken it upon herself to help out the nervous woman. She had no clue she\u2019d robbed you of your goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also had no clue that you were so close, a fact evidenced by how close she came to stomping on you as she walked back towards the tower. You had tried to call out to her, only for your voice to be drowned out by a cawing seagull. As such, you had dove to the side to avoid her powerful stride, and watched as she sauntered on by, presumably off to help someone else in need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was beginning to dawn on you that perhaps signing on to be a lifeguard was a bad idea, but you were far from ready to throw in the towel yet. You had to prove yourself to Brigitte and Quinn that you were capable of doing this. You had to prove to YOURSELF that you were a strong and dependable tiny that people could rely on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked for another thirty minutes, never once giving up on scanning your surroundings for people in need or threats to your safety. Twice more you spotted someone who looked like they could use assistance, but after having to dodge someone stepping on you, found that Quinn had made it to them first. It was beginning to tick you off, but you were angrier at fate for being cruel than your roommate for just doing her job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you came upon a group of college-aged girls rounding up enough volunteers to start a volleyball game. None of them looked like they needed help, so you kept walking, but you were quite distracted by just how beautiful the girls were, and how revealing their swimsuits were too. There were seven gorgeous giantesses gathered on the sandy court by the volleyball net, and they seemed to be looking for one more to join them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that you heard pounding footsteps coming from behind you. Eyes widening in panic, you whirled around to face another girl who was running towards you at top speed. She had an excited expression on her face, and her eyes were locked fully on the volleyball group behind you. You realized that she was probably going to join them as their eighth player. You also realized how oblivious this girl was to your existence, and how close her pounding feet were getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTensing up in a panic, you willed yourself to dodge out of the way of her slamming feet and find safety. How successful are you?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(name changed from Becky to Betty to avoid future confusion)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, though you only tensed up for a split second, it was exactly that moment of hesitation that cost you. You dove to the side to avoid the girl\u2019s foot, but a bit too late. Her powerful stride carrying her forward at a fast pace, the girl didn\u2019t feel a thing as her big toe slammed into your miniscule body. Already moving to try to avoid her, the impact sent you flying twice as fast and far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpinning around in circles, your limbs flailing, and your cries of shock drowned out by the wind, your bug-sized body sailed through the air with ease. Flying another twenty yards down the beach, a strong breeze carried you an additional distance alongside the oblivious girl\u2019s knockout kick. While she happily joined the other college girls for an exciting game of volleyball, you were quite literally tossed aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you came to a landing, impacting rather roughly onto the plush red towel of some beach goer. The impact flattened your body, but you soon began reforming. Popping back to normal shape, you sat up and took notice of the giantess beside you, who was digging around for something in her bag, her back to you. She looked to be in her thirties, and was quite beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could think of speaking up (or before you could decide if you even wanted to speak up, or just keep walking), the woman swore under her breath and turned around. However, her eyes didn\u2019t scan your miniscule body, and were instead behind you. Turning your head, you noted a second bag behind you, and also realized just how large this towel was, spread out to its full length. It was probably accommodating two people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was hardly a pressing concern though, as the woman shuffled over to the second bag, sliding her knees along the towel. Not wanting to be steamrolled by her, you scrambled out of the way, just barely avoiding her. You rolled aside, dodging her knee, but the woman\u2019s foot still slapped into your body, knocking you off balance and onto your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecovering from that, you vaguely took note of the woman retrieve a pair of sunglasses from the second bag, smile victoriously, and put them on her face. She then shuffled back towards you, but you were far enough away that her legs and feet weren\u2019t close to crushing you. Feeling safe, you rolled onto your back and pushed yourself up to your feet. Clearing your throat in preparation to talk to this woman and ask if she needed help, you paused to catch your breath and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat same breath came out in a sputtering gasp, causing you to cough. In the seconds you\u2019d been looking away, the woman had casually undone the straps of her bikini behind her back, and was now lying her top down. She was utterly naked from the waist up, and her gigantic boobs swayed gently as she smiled and stretched. Her perky tits then began to get closer and closer, and some muted part of your brain screamed at you that she was lying down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat muted part didn\u2019t matter much, and you merely stood there, slack-jawed, as the gorgeous woman laid out on her towel. Her left breast, gargantuan in size, crashed down onto you, smooth pillowy flesh smooshing you flatter than a pancake. The weight crushed you down, molding your miniscule body into a blobby shape beneath her tit. The pain and the pleasure of the situation fought for control over your emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain won out, especially as the woman wiggled a bit to get comfortable, her hefty breasts dragging across the soft towel back and forth, copious flesh jiggling substantially. Her left boob ground you to dust beneath her, the weight and pressure easily enough to smear your pathetic little body. In seconds, the woman smudged you into a smear on her flesh, your own body easily sticking to her own, especially with the faint layer of sweat already accumulating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, you felt the woman stop moving, and knew that she had finally gotten comfortable. By now, your moral and logical senses had returned, but it was far too late now. All you could do was feel immense shame that you\u2019d let yourself be crushed because you were too busy ogling a naked giantess. Of course, you also felt pain and discomfort, but that was to be expected. You were buried entirely beneath her breast, no light or air reaching you. You were just under her nipple, and sticking to her more and more each second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate, however, actually decided to throw you some semblance of a bone. At that moment, the woman\u2019s good friend (who you had inferred to exist) returned from the brief errand she\u2019d run off to do. Walking up to the towel, she grinned and waved a modest-sized bottle in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRose! I got the suntan oil at the beach shop!\u201d The woman said cheerily. \u201cCan\u2019t believe we forgot our own.\u201d She finally made it to the towel and plopped down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of what she had said went unnoticed by you, as the majority of sounds from the outside world were a muffled, muted mess. The woman lying on you, apparently named Rose, had breasts easily heavy and plump enough to bury you so thoroughly that sounds were blocked out. However, you could feel the vibrations of the other woman as she sat, and you were able to hear Rose\u2019s reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice. Bout time.\u201d Rose replied, sleepily. She yawned. \u201cGod, I\u2019ve needed this day to relax and tan. Stephanie drives me crazy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other woman laughed. \u201cReally? I think your daughter is a perfect little angel!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose laughed and sighed, the action causing her breasts the vibrate, hot flesh slapping against your body. \u201cYou only say that because your own kid is away at college, Betty. Stephanie can be a monster if she\u2019s throwing a tantrum.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other woman, Betty, smiled, and began shaking the bottle of tanning oil. \u201cIf you say so, Rose. But yes, you\u2019re right. This day will certainly be heavenly for the two of us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose, knowing she needed to fully lather up before drifting off to sleep, managed to pull herself back up into a sitting position. Stuck as you were to her tit, all you could see was darkness, but you could once more feel fresh air and the sun on your back. You did have to fight the urge to not vomit though, as the act of Rose sitting up caused her prodigious chest to shake gratuitously, jostling you around as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then! Hit me! Lather me up!\u201d Rose said, spreading her arms out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty rolled her eyes. \u201cUgh, Rose, what are you? Ten? We\u2019re both adults, and we both know that after I lather you up, you\u2019ll fall asleep before doing me! Don\u2019t you know how hard it is to rub that oil in all the right spots by myself?\u201d Betty, with a faint blush, gestured to her curvy body, comparable in size to Rose\u2019s own hourglass figure. Their developed bodies made sense, as they were both in their thirties, but you couldn\u2019t help but notice how many gorgeous giantesses life kept throwing you at (literally, in this case).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose only grinned, lowered her sunglasses, and winked at Betty. Betty groaned, but knew it was no use arguing with stubborn Rose. Sliding closer to her friend, Betty popped the cap on the tanning oil, but then her eyes zeroed in on you. Rose, having not tanned in a while, had a skin tone that was a shade lighter than your own tanned color. Thus, you stood out, but only as a weird smudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh. Hold on, Rose. Got something stuck to you. Little sticker, maybe?\u201d Betty suggested, licking her finger for leverage and then jamming it into Rose\u2019s left breast, right above your body. Angling her finger, Betty wedged her fingernail between you and Rose\u2019s hot flesh, and managed to peel you free in one swift movement. Rose bit her lip the whole time, lest she break out into ticklish laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, Betty didn\u2019t spare more than a second to flick you off of her finger and down onto the ground. You didn\u2019t drift far, landing by Betty\u2019s leg, but the curvaceous woman had already turned her attention back to Rose. While you lie in a heap on the ground, slowly working on reforming, Betty methodically and tirelessly oiled up all of Rose\u2019s body. The entire process took ten minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as you nearly reformed, Betty finished, and Rose gave her a thumbs up. \u201cThanks, Betty! I\u2019ll be looking sexy in no time!\u201d The woman laughed, and then laid back down on her stomach. Thankfully, you were a far enough distance from her, but the sight of her now oiled-up boobs impacting on the towel still gave you a minor fright. True to Betty\u2019s statement earlier, Rose was totally forcing Betty to do her own oiling, which was a little rude. In moments, Rose was breathing peacefully, seemingly asleep already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd\u2026she\u2019s out. Already. Wish <b><i>I</i></b> had some help.\u201d Betty rolled her eyes. Sighing, the giantess unhooked her own bikini top, and then moved to set her top down. As she did so, her eyes finally aligned with your own, and the two of you locked gazes. By this point, you were back on your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, your frantically prepared speech explaining who you were fell apart because of Betty\u2019s unexpected disrobing. Once more, you found yourself incapable of speech or thought, eyes glued to Betty\u2019s large, perfectly round, and perfectly nude breasts. You fought with every fiber of your being to look Betty in the eye and explain this whole situation, but she beat you to it, opening her mouth to speak.</span></div></div>",

How cute!\u201d Betty gushed, her gorgeous face breaking out into a pleasing smile. Her reaction was not at all what you expected, and it threw you off even more than you already were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped, trying to stammer out a coherent response. \u201cU-uh\u2026um\u2026y-yes. Yes. That\u2019s me\u2026uh\u2026the t-tiny lifeguard.\u201d You fumbled your reply, earning a giggle from the titanic giantess. Your eyes frantically flicked all over the place, from the towel at your feet, to Betty\u2019s radiant face, to her utterly gigantic bare breasts that jiggled just a bit as she laughed at your embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Mister Lifeguard\u2026what\u2019s a cutie like you doing here with me? A bit naughty to spy on a woman naked and ready to suntan.\u201d Betty theatrically pouted, curling her sensual lips into a mock frown, and she tsked at you. Your face burned bright red at the remark, and Betty laughed again. \u201cI\u2019m kidding, poor thing. I\u2019m not angry\u2026I\u2019d actually say I\u2019m flattered, if anything. Been a while since an adorable thing like you paid me any mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew she was referencing her age, but you found her statement hard to believe. Betty was a vision, even if she was in her thirties. Honestly, maturity had only developed her beauty further. Her reddish-brown locks framed her alluring face, her smooth milky white skin free of any blemish or mark. Her aforementioned curves were truly off-the-scale in terms of roundness and bounciness. Though you weren\u2019t perverted enough to spend your days scouring the internet for porn or explicit content, you did know exactly what term Betty would be described as: a milf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, you tried to steady yourself. \u201cY-yes, I was just hired by Sanderson Beach. Today, in fact. My first job was to look around the beach for anyone who might need help, and then aid them if I can.\u201d You gave Betty a thumbs-up, causing the giantess woman to smile warmly. \u201cSo, since I\u2019m here, give me a task and I\u2019ll set right to it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brown-haired woman\u2019s eyes widened at your bold claim, then settled into a happy look of contentment. She grinned, her perfect teeth nearly shining. \u201cWell, how generous of you, you little stud. I was just lamenting about how I didn\u2019t have anyone to help me with\u2026this!\u201d She said, reaching behind herself to grab the bottle of tanning lotion. That one simple movement along shook her abundant chest wildly, drawing your gaze right back to her naked breasts. You couldn\u2019t help but gape, and this didn\u2019t go unnoticed by Betty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodness.\u201d Betty smirked playfully, the faintest hint of pink in her cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019d think a tiny like you had never seen a woman before!\u201d She laughed as you feebly attempted to clamp your jaw shut and look you in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m so sorry\u2026for staring. Being here on the beach is\u2026overwhelming, to be honest.\u201d You admitted. \u201cYou ARE very beautiful, too.\u201d You added, hoping that a compliment would smooth things over. The last thing you wanted was to get fired on your first day for perving on the beach goers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effect was unintended, to say the least. Betty\u2019s smile vanished, replaced instead by an open-mouth expression, and the blush in her cheeks burned brighter. She recovered a moment later, easing back into her warm, alluring smile. She also shifted forward, scooping you up into her palm with warning, while simultaneously lying out on the towel on her back. You bit back your cry of surprise, and let her dangle you then place you on the expansiveness of her lean stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t guessed, you adorable charmer, I need you to help lather me up for my tan.\u201d Betty explained, winking at you. \u201cI\u2019ll drop some tanning lotion onto my tummy, then you can spread it all around my body\u2026and I do mean, everywhere. I wouldn\u2019t want any uneven tan, right?\u201d Betty\u2019s angelic face radiated mischief and a hint of sensuality. \u201cSomething tells me that you won\u2019t mind giving me a rubdown, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny sort of reply fumbled out of your mouth after a tease like that, and you merely gave the nude goddess a weak nod. Betty laughed once more, her stomach shaking and nearly tossing you off, before she uncapped the lotion bottle and deposited a hefty glob right beside you. After doing so, she slid some sunglasses onto her face, and propped her head up on a pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead, little guy. Lather me up!\u201d She grinned, and winked again. \u201cCould even be a reward in it for you if you do a good job. I\u2019ll definitely make sure your boss knows that you\u2019re the best, hottest lifeguard on this beach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverwhelmed by the brown-haired woman\u2019s words, you gave another pitiful nod, and then approached the glob of lotion. Knowing the quickest way to finish the job was also the grossest, you slapped your whole body into the veritable mountain of lotion, coating your body in the sticky substance. You then began walking across, rolling across, and rubbing your hands across Betty\u2019s smooth stomach, effortlessly gliding over her skin while effectively covering her in tanning lotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above, you noted the bemused smile on Betty\u2019s face, and figured that she was no doubt satisfied with your work and surprised by your ingenuity. Truthfully, you\u2019d done this exact same thing to your mother plenty of times in the past, though she always had at least SOME clothes on, and of course never teased you about it. Your experience was coming in handy now, though, but you definitely wouldn\u2019t say that you had expected to lather up a sexy, nude, flirtatious woman your first day on the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t too long before Betty\u2019s stomach was all done, including along her sides. Of course, that left only her titanic tits in need of a good lotion lathering. Reapplying an almost armor-like coat of lotion onto yourself, you trekked over to Betty\u2019s breasts, and had to pause to stare at the sheer size of them. Twin peaks, massive yet perfectly rounded, with just the right amount of jiggliness. Their incredible size just about blocked out Betty\u2019s face from the angle you were at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScaling them proved to be an entirely different beast, and one that your tiny body almost couldn\u2019t complete. As slick as you were, it was nearly impossible to scrambled up Betty\u2019s right breast. Her skin, perfectly smooth and soft as it was, offered nearly nonexistent grip, and a faint sheen of sweat all across her body certainly didn\u2019t help. You only succeeded by dashing up in a quick, desperate burst, sinking your hands and feet into her plump boobs to balance yourself out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Betty\u2019s perspective, this was nothing short of adorable hilariousness, and she couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Her breasts swayed and shook as she giggled at your plight, and you stumbled backwards. Flailing your arms to keep from falling back down, you pitched forward, but merely ended up falling on your face instead. Well, you fell on your face, but your entire body also fell right onto Betty\u2019s pink nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty\u2019s laughter stopped abruptly, replaced instead by a playful smirk. \u201cOh? Is the little lifeguard getting a facefull while still on the job? Shame on him. What a horrible tiny perv?\u201d Betty\u2019s expression was one of mock indignation, and a faint blush had returned to her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to push yourself back up to your feet, when you were suddenly shoved down hard into Betty\u2019s nipple. It was Betty herself, daintily poking your body with her finger. Though she smiled innocently, anyone could see the glint of mischief and something more in her eyes. Lazily, she traced a circle around her nipple, dragging your body around and around while still squeezing you into her doughy breast flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was maddening for multiple reasons, both the fact that Betty was interfering with the job, and the fact that this naked woman was massaging you into her nipple. The feeling welling up inside you for the past fifteen minutes finally burst forth despite your honest attempts to stop it, and you felt yourself growing aroused. Of course, your hardening crotch was instantly squished flat by the force Betty was applying on your miniscule body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it had still been quite clearly felt. Betty\u2019s eyes widened, as did her triumphant grin. \u201cAh, so you ARE enjoying this, huh, cutie? My, my! This really might be the best beach day ever!\u201d Betty laughed melodically, and looked over at her friend, Rose. Rose was still sleeping like a rock, and Betty knew she\u2019d remain that way for hours if left undisturbed. Betty was pleased with the knowledge that she truly had you all to herself. Maybe it wasn't proper, but it was so much fun, conduct be damned. You were just irresistibly cute to her, and your own obvious attraction to her naked glory was icing on the flirtatious cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty released you, finally, but only after you felt the ground beneath you harden and begin to poke into you. It only took you a second to grasp the fact that Betty was being aroused by her teasing and playing with you, and that doubled your panic. This naked woman, to put it bluntly, had total control over you in this intimate of a situation. There was no telling what she\u2019d do if her desire to mess with you kept growing. Even still, you weren\u2019t about to quit this job until you\u2019d lathered her up completely. You weren\u2019t the type to give up, no matter the adversity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking yourself up and trying (and failing) to hide your erection, you avoided looking Betty in the eye and went back to rubbing lotion across her boobs. Your peripheral still caught the sight of Betty\u2019s sensual gaze and her softly biting her lower lip. That image sent shivers down your spine, and you hoped that ignoring it would keep her \u2018playfulness\u2019 at bay.</span></div></div>",

She was a vastly curvaceous woman wearing a yellow flower-patterned swimsuit that complimented her shapely, slightly rubenesque physique. She was white, with slightly tanned skin that brought out her mesmerizing dark eyes, her lips were coated in bright red lipstick. Her head was framed with long, flowing blonde hair that radiated with volume. She was truly a captivating sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were quite mesmerized at the beauty of this woman as she sauntered her way toward you, her hips swaying and chest slightly bouncing in a hypnotic display as she approached. Snapping yourself out of your daze, you realized you that you now have a chance to help someone new! Seizing the opportunity, you began to jump up and down like a maniac, yelling for this new woman\u2019s attention. Miraculously you caught her attention, stopping her in her tracks as she turned her gaze downwards toward you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde beauty was casually walking along, super excited to spend a relaxing day at the beach, suddenly she looked down and saw an interesting movement on the sand. It took her a moment to realize it was little guy jumping up and down. A broad smile grew on her face, tinies are just the cutest little things!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill craning your neck upwards, you were happy that this woman noticed you. She slightly bent her knees and leaned forward to get a closer look at you. Her smiling face was quite inviting! You assumed a greeting would be appropriate. \u201cUm... hi there!\u201d you squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh myyyyyy...\" the woman spoke with smooth, elegant maturity with a slight trace of a southern accent. \u201cWell hello there, little cutie!\u201d The way she called you a \"cutie\" you made you feel slightly apprehensive as she eyed you endearingly. She reached down to pluck you of the ground, standing back to her full height as she cradled you in her palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name little one?\u201d The southern woman asked you in melodic tone. \u201cM-my name is Hunter!\u201d You awkwardly stuttered as her hands moved you closer to her face, your inexperience with woman was on full display, amusing the massive blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hello there little Hunter! My name is Pamela! I'm actually from Nashville. I\u2019m out of town on vacation and chose to stay at the Sanderson Beach hotel, I came to the beach hoping to meet a cute guy! Looks like the lord answered my prayers!\" She finished her sentence with a wink and a grin that froze you with fear. How would you like to come live with me in Tennessee with me, hm?\" Pamela asked with a hint of desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart skipped a beat and your face turned beet red. \"N-no! No! That's okay, I actually work he-\u201c The giant woman cut you off with a giggle that boomed all around you. \"I'm only teasing of course! Though I must ask: what's a sweet little tiny like you doing in a place so dangerous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.. uh.. I'm actually a lifeguard here.\" You answered. \"And it's my first day, I was just patrolling the beach to see if anyone needed help with anything... so, uh. H-how can I help you?\u201d You were almost afraid to ask that question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow... a tiny lifeguard?\u201d Pamela gasped in awe. \u201cAww that is just so adorable! How thoughtful of you trying to help protect us beach-goers!\u201d The southern belle\u2019s heart started to flutter, she loved tinies very much but there was something special about you. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve come across many tinies in my day. However, you are hands down the cutest one I\u2019ve ever met!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh... um, thank you.. uh, I guess.\u201d Pamela\u2019s eyebrows raised slightly, and her plump lips curled back into a sweet smile. Your awkwardness and shyness only increasing the \u201ccutie\u201d factor in her eyes. You tried to change the subject back to your job before she gets any other ideas. \u201cSo... is there anything I can help you with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm...\u201d Pamela curled her lips into a teasing smirk and raised a single eyebrow as she took her free finger and tapped against her lips in a playfully pensive manner.</span></div></div>",

She was absolutely delighted at this situation, she didn\u2019t expect to meet such a handsome tiny during her vacation! Her mind swirled with ideas on how to optimize the hand fate dealt for her today. What neither of you knew is that Quinn happened to walk by and saw Pamela flirting with you. She observed how awkward you were in reacting to her advances, which oddly amused her. For a moment she thought about ignoring you and leaving you in your new friend\u2019s clutches, you needed to learn how to handle yourself in uncomfortable situations regarding women at the beach. However, she decided against it, only because it\u2019s your first day. She changed her course and headed towards the curvaceous blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me miss. Sorry to interrupt but I need my partner back.\u201d Quinn bluntly declared, slightly startling Pamela. That declaration was music to your ears! \u201cHunter, Brigitte wants me to show you how to observe the beach from the watchtower. So we have to go. Now.\u201d Quinn finished her demand by holding out her palm to receive you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no worries, sweetie. Here you go!\u201d The southern woman kindly passed you over to Quinn, unphased by her dull attitude. \"Good luck on your first day on the job! Hopefully we'll meet again!\" Pamela then kissed her finger and seductively bopped you on the face with the same finger, which made you shudder with embarrassment. \"Bye bye now!\" she said as her curvy bikini clad figure sashayed across the beach. Despite your discomfort, you couldn\u2019t quite take your eyes off the southern woman\u2019s voluptuous tushy as it bounced almost intentionally in a tantalizing fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn \u201cAhem!\u201d erupted from Quinn\u2019s throat, snapping you out of your trance. She rolled her eyes as you quickly averted your eyes back to your roommate, clearly embarrassed. \u201cWow Hunter... You haven't even been here an hour and you\u2019re already attracting the ladies!\" Quinn teased in a condescending manner. \"Yeah, but not necessarily the girls I'm trying to go for.\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno man...\u201d Quinn continued. \u201cYou sure seemed to be having a fun time!\u201d You glared in response, not amused by Quinn\u2019s jokes in the slightest. \u201cHey. Come on.\u201d Quinn shifted her tone. \u201cYou should be thankful I rescued you. Brigitte never told me to come find you, I lied so I could help you. I could have just left you to fend for yourself. You\u2019re gonna have to learn how to handle yourself if you want to become a true lifeguard. Being a tiny is no excuse!\u201d Quinn\u2019s words were definitely true, even if they were a little harsh. \u201cYeah! I guess you\u2019re right! Thanks Quinn!\u201d You stood up and flashed a thumbs up to your roommate. \u201cNo prob. Now let\u2019s get to it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReunited with your partner, you both made your way to the tower to continue your first shift...</span></div></div>",

The one walking in the middle looked familiar to you, but they were all wearing sunglasses. When she got close enough, her mouth gaped in joy and she happily ran towards you both. As she got closer, you realized it was Avery, you and Quinn\u2019s bubbly new roommate. \u201cOh geez...\u201d Quinn groaned as Avery closed the distance. The giddy brunette was dressed a bright pink, heart-pattern bikini with that hugged her curvy figure, she was also wearing heart-shaped shades with a pink frame... which was appropriately fitting for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHIYA ROOMIES!!\u201d Avery cheerfully greeted. \u201cI thought I\u2019d come visit you guys!\u201d Her attention turned towards you. \u201cAlso had to come check out the hunky new lifeguard.\u201d She tilted her shades down, revealing her hungry eyes, winking as she raised her eyebrows suggestively. \u201cOh! U-uh well hi there Avery!\u201d her sudden flirtations leaving you flustered. Avery giggled at your response, she found you super cute and attractive, your shirtless physique only fueling her infatuation. She was kinda jealous you chose to work with Quinn, so she was hoping a fun day at the beach would give her a chance to spend some quality time with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeehee! I brought some friends!\u201d Avery gestured behind her as the two other girls caught up. They were both absolutely stunning. One of them was a girl of Hispanic descent in her mid-20s. She had tan skin, dark hair that was tied in a long ponytail, and shared the same curvaceous body proportions as Avery. She was wearing a red two piece bikini that also embraced her curvaceous figure. She was about to introduce herself to Quinn before you caught her attention. Her eyes widened in surprise as she took off her shades, Avery had mentioned she had an adorable new roommate, but she didn\u2019t know you were THIS cute! \u201cWell hello, hello!!\u201d The Hispanic beauty said as she leaned towards you, making you uncomfortable. \u201cGreat to meet you, Hunter! My name is Sandra! Avery has sure told me a lot about you!\u201d Her plump lips formed a giddy grin as she bit her lower lip. \u201cUh. Great to meet you... Uh yeah!\u201d you were wondering how many flirtatious girls you were going to have to deal with today... guess it can\u2019t be helped when you\u2019re working in an environment like the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to see Avery\u2019s other friend join her at her side, she had creamy white skin, wavy brown locks, and was wearing a green two-piece bikini. Her body was a little more slender, and less curvy than the other three girls you were with, but she was still well-endowed in all the right places. If you had to guess, you would say she\u2019s around mid-20s. She moved her shades to her forehead, revealing her beautiful green eyes that matched her swimsuit. She looked down at you and smiled sweetly as she made eye contact. Your heart skipped a beat, she was the most beautiful girl you have seen in your life! If you could pick your ideal \u201cavatar\u201d for a potential girlfriend, it would be her to a tee!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! You must be Hunter!\u201d her voice was so pleasant, sweet, and mature. It sounded so perfect! \u201cMy name is Michelle! Nice to meet you!\u201d She put out her pinky finger to 'shake hands' with you, which was pretty adorable. You smiled like an idiot as you shook her giant finger with both of your hands. \u201cYeah that\u2019s me! Great to meet you too, Michelle!\u201d Quinn rolled her eyes, and there was a hint of jealously in Avery\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell uh... Quinn! We were wondering if Hunter could take a break and come hang of us!\u201d Avery boldly requested. If it was just Avery and Sandra, you would have protested, but meeting Michelle changed everything! \u201cYeah Quinn that sounds awesome, that cool with you?\u201d Quinn was clearly annoyed by this situation and wanted to get away from Avery and her friends. \u201cNo. You\u2019re on the clock, Hunter. Sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, Avery, and her friends all sighed in disappointment. You shot a quick glance to Michelle and saw a slight frown come over her, causing you to blush, she seemed to want to get to know you! You had to convince Quinn to let you go with them for her sake! \u201cWait, Quinn! How about I patrol the beach with them? You said yourself Brigitte still wants me to help people, and I can move faster if I\u2019m with them!\u201d Everyone was impressed with your logic, especially Quinn, even though she\u2019d never admit it. \u201cHm. Alright, that\u2019s fine... I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe life returned to everyone\u2019s face at the news, you then felt a couple fingers pluck you off Quinn\u2019s palm. You were raised to the animated face of Avery as she hugged you to her cheek. \u201cOh yay!! This is like, totes amazing!\u201d You were almost flattened to her cheek before she pulled you away. \u201cHunter, I\u2019ll come back for you later.\u201d Quinn instructed before turning her attention to Avery. \u201cKeep him on task, yeah?\u201d Avery responded with an adorable salute. \u201cYup! Roger that Quinnie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn headed for the tower while Avery happily bounced along the beach with her friends walking beside her as she hugged you to her chest, which was slightly uncomfortable and awkward for you. You didn\u2019t mind though, you were just happy to get a chance to hang out with Michelle! This day was going great!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Avery carried you along the beach with her friends, they all seemed really excited to hang out with you. \u201cHey guys how about we relax a bit first before we start walking around?\u201d You were hesitant at first, you didn\u2019t want to slack off on your first day. However... a little relaxation never hurt anyone! \u201cUmm... sure... yeah I guess I can just take my break early!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all found a solid spot at the beach to unwind, Avery and her friends set some towels down and were ready to kick back! They all started to apply sunscreen, which was quite the sight for you. Being surrounded by three attractive girls lathering themselves up wasn\u2019t something you experience everyday, but you tried to be respectful and not to gawk. The trio chatted with each other as they applied the lotion, you turned and caught Sandra staring at you suggestively and giving you some flirty looks, making you feel uneasy. You awkwardly forced a grin before turning your attention towards Michelle. She was a total beauty, you saw the way she communicated with her friends and was in total awe. Her laugh made you melt, it was just so soothing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d say Hunter is the luckiest guy at the beach right now!\u201d Avery turned her attention down towards you as she continued to lather her flawless skin in an effort to tease you. You blushed and started to stutter in an effort to change the subject. Sandra let out an titillating \u201cOoooo!\u201d While Michelle gave a cute \u201cAwww!\u201d and a giggle causing you to go beet red! The three beauties laid down with you on the towels, Sandra and Avery each made sure to lay down next to you. Unfortunately that means Michelle was on the other end of the towel while you were stuck between Avery and Sandra, their giant, shapely bodies dwarfing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHunter I totes just realized we never gave you any lotion! Sorry about that man, here you go!\u201d Avery grabbed the bottle of lotion and squeezed a giant glob out. \u201cWh-whoa wait! Avery! No don-!\u201d You were cut off as a giant slimy puddle of suntan lotion tackled you. Avery then took her finger and began lathering you up, sliding you all around the pile of lotion, much to your humiliation. \u201cYes! Wouldn\u2019t want a sunburn now would we?\u201d Sandra sang as she joined in the fun. You tried to protest and tell them to stop but couldn\u2019t get a word out, plus your vision was blurred from the lotion so you were completely disoriented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis really sucked to be honest, it was hard to find a moment of relief as you were flipped and rolled around. Avery and Sandra were enjoying feeling up your shirtless body, \u201cOooo\u201d-ing and \u201cAhhh\u201d-ing as they fawned over you. This was extremely uncomfortable for you... and slightly violating. If you had it your way, you would have chosen to be next to Michelle. You wished she would help you, but she just smiled at the situation, thinking that you were all enjoying yourselves as her attention shifted back to relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the girls put an end to their teasing after all the lotion was spread, leaving you with an oily looking texture which only increased the arousal of your two admirers. As you all soaked up some rays, the chatter between the girls seemed to slowly decline as some of them were starting to get sleepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Sandra and Michelle fall asleep, leaving you alone with Avery who tries to make a move on you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Avery and Michelle fall asleep, so Sandra seizes the opportunity to take you somewhere more private!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Avery and Sandra fall asleep, giving you an opportunity to bond with Michelle!</span></div></div>",

It took about a full minute for you to sneak around Avery\u2019s massive legs before seeing Michelle come into full view. Your heart started to beat rapidly as you approached, you wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re a Casanova when it comes to the ladies, so you were hoping this would go well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked towards her face, admiring her flawless body on the way. She heard your approach when you reached her shoulder and she turned to look at you. \u201cOh hey! I thought you were asleep!\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cHaha I thought you were!\u201d you replied. \u201cThe other two fell asleep. So... I guess it\u2019s just the two of us.\u201d You wondered if you were doing a good job of hiding your nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup! Looks like it!\u201d Michelle sat up and looked to her left and saw her two friends sleeping. \u201cWell, looks like they might be out for a bit. Why don\u2019t we take a walk together?\u201d Your eyes widened at her proposal, she actually wanted to hang out with you! \u201cOh, yeah! Sure that sounds great!\u201d Michelle smiled at your reply as she started to stand up. \u201cSweet! This beach ain\u2019t gonna patrol itself, y\u2019know!\u201d Your smile faded slightly as you realized she meant a walk regarding your job. \u201cOh yeah right. Patrol. Yes. Got to patrol the beach!\u201d Michelle chuckled as she placed her hand on the ground, inviting you to climb aboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you were technically working, you were still happy this was giving you a chance to connect with Michelle. You both had a pleasant chat and got to know each other a bit. She was fascinated hearing about your life from the perspective as a tiny, she said she always had massive respect for what tinies have to endure. You learned that she works as a receptionist at a massage parlor, and is studying to become a physical therapist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour time patrolling the beach was pleasant, most of the beachgoers didn\u2019t need any help, though you were hit on quite a bit by most of the women you both approached. One girl who came to the beach alone just wanted someone to chat with for a bit. It was really cool to connect with the beachgoers on a personal level. One kid needed help with his sandcastle, and another needed help finding her lost mother. The way Michelle was so compassionate and nurturing to the children was so sweet, it took your breath away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter awhile, you both were starting to get hungry so you decided to grab a bite together at a Fish &amp; Chips restaurant on the beach. You obviously only needed one order of food due to your small stomach. Michelle was kind enough to pay for the meal, justifying it by saying she\u2019ll be the one eating most of it. You both grabbed a table and continued conversing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man! Fish &amp; Chips is one of my favorites!\u201d Michelle exclaimed. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s one of mine too!\u201d you replied, even though just a few nibbles to the normal person was more than enough satisfy you. \u201cSo what made you want to get a job here at the beach of all places?\u201d Michelle asked. You finished chewing your current bite before answering. \u201cWell, I figured I\u2019d be able to handle it. I mean, I obviously can\u2019t save people effectively, but I can help assist the other lifeguards and maybe brighten people\u2019s days! \u2026 As cheesy as that sounds...\u201d Michelle listened intently to you, her smile slowly grew into a sweet expression as you expressed yourself. \u201cAww! That\u2019s not cheesy at all, Hunter! It\u2019s actually really sweet!\u201d You blushed and smiled like a dork as she continued. \u201cI mean, like I was saying before; I have massive admiration for you tinies! Coming into an environment like this is super brave, and you definitely made a positive impact on some of the people here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle\u2019s words were super encouraging! You hate to admit it, even to yourself, but you struggle with your own self-confidence from time to time. So hearing this from a girl like her really gave you a boost! \u201cWow that really means a lot to me, Michelle, for real! I appreciate you helping me out there, especially with the kids! You were super compassionate... it was really inspiring to be honest!\u201d Butterflies swarmed in your stomach as you commended Michelle, you\u2019re not used to being this vulnerable with a woman. \u201cAwww... Hunter!\u201d Michelle blushed and smiled softly at you, your words warming her heart. \u201cThank you so much for saying that! Yeah I love helping others, that\u2019s why I\u2019m pursuing physical therapy, it\u2019s a solid outlet to improve lives... I just wish I was further along on my path. This isn\u2019t where I thought I\u2019d be at 28.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were slightly taken aback by learning of yours\u2019s and Michelle\u2019s age difference. \u201cYou\u2019re 28? I definitely thought you were closer to my age.\u201d you expressed. Michelle smiled again, flattered by your words. \u201cAw, you\u2019re too sweet! And how old are you?\u201d You cleared your throat before answering, trying to sound as mature and confident as possible. \u201cI\u2019m 21!\u201d Michelle\u2019s eyebrows raised at your answer. \u201cOh wow! You\u2019re such a baby!\u201d Her comment was endearing, but you were now worried she\u2019ll only see you as a friend because of the age difference. You were wondering if you should try to see if she\u2019s willing to hang out with you some more outside of your work environment. She\u2019s a really cool person, and you\u2019re starting to really like her!</span></div></div>",

As much as you appreciate Avery, and Sandra seems cool despite her flirtations, you were kind of bummed that your alone time with Michelle was interrupted. It only got worse as you turned to meet Sandra\u2019s gaze, she winked at you as she eyed you with intention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHiya! The nap was SO refreshing! What have you both been up to?\u201d Avery asked joyfully. \u201cOh nothing much, we patrolled the beach earlier, and just had some lunch! This place is awesome!\u201d Michelle happily expressed. You were happy that she had a good time with you! Avery was also happy you two were getting along so well \u201cOh cool! That sounds uber awesome! Anyway, I wanted to tell you both that we decided to throw a pool party at Sandra\u2019s tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pool party sounded awesome to you! You love the water! \u201cThat sounds cool! I\u2019m down!\u201d Sandra smiled at your eagerness. \u201cOh yes!

Michelle pondered for a moment. \u201cHmm.. that does sound fun..\u201d she said. \u201cYeah! You should totally go! It will be fun!\u201d You chimed in, encouraging the opportunity to spend time with your new friend. Michelle smiled warmly at your request. \u201cOk! Sure! Why not?\u201d Avery was elated. \u201cAwesome! Yaaaay!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to get going!\u201d Sandra declared. \u201cSome other girls are going to come as well, so I have to stop by the store, grab snacks, and clean my place!\u201d Sandra texted Avery and Michelle her address. \u201cEverything should hopefully be ready by the time Hunter is off work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll come with you and help out!\u201d Michelle piped up. \u201cOh that would be awesome, thank you Michelle!\u201d Sandra said graciously. \u201cAvery, are you okay with staying behind?

I\u2019m just gonna relax!\u201d Avery answered. \u201cGood luck though!\u201d You were about to begin another trek along the sands, your newfound confidence from earlier lighting a fire within you. Before you could take your first triumphant step, a giant shadow cast over you. You turned around and saw Quinn towering over you. \u201cHey. How\u2019s the shift going?\u201d Seeing your partner again made you happy. You were excited to tell her how well you\u2019ve been doing as you told her the events from your patrol with Michelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah? Good for you. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d Quinn doesn\u2019t seem like the the type to give praise easily, so you were very humbled by her words. \u201cAnyways. Brigitte wants me to show you the watchtower... for real this time.\u201d Part of you was slightly bummed that you couldn\u2019t go around and talk to people again, but you were excited to learn another position for your job! \u201cOkay! Cool let\u2019s get going! Avery I\u2019ll catch you later!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wait, Quinn!\u201d Avery said before Quinn could walk away. \u201cMy friend Sandra is throwing a party tonight, Hunter and I are going. Wanna come too? It\u2019s gonna be totes fun, yo!!!\u201d Quinn usually isn\u2019t one for parties, especially with over-the-top girls like Avery. She would rather just go home and chill instead. \u201cYeah, no. I\u2019m gonna pass.\u201d she shot down the offer without a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww bummer! Oh well!\u201d Avery seemed unaffected by Quinn\u2019s rejection. \u201cWell I guess I\u2019ll see you in a bit Hunter!\u201d She shifted her gaze back to you, beaming like a cartoon character. \u201cYup! Sounds good!\u201d you replied. \u201cI\u2019ll just swing by here once our shift is over and we can head out!\u201d Avery gave you a cute grin with thumbs up before Quinn sauntered over to the watchtower.</span></div></div>",

She placed you on her shoulder so you can get a good view of the beach. It was pretty cool seeing the beach from this new perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing exciting happened, Quinn pretty much just told you what to watch out for and what to do if someone needs help. After about an hour and a half another lifeguard came to relieve you both, it was finally the end of your first shift as a lifeguard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight on Hunter. You survived your first day in one piece. I\u2019m impressed.\u201d Quinn congratulated you again, which made you feel pretty good about yourself! \u201cNow we just have to go see Brigitte so she can evaluate you.\u201d A part of you was nervous to be evaluated, it sounded so formal. Fortunately the day went as planned for the most part, so there shouldn\u2019t be anything to worry about!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both made it to Brigitte\u2019s office with no issues. Brigitte was sitting at her desk, awaiting your arrival. \"Hello there you two!\" Brigitte said. \"How was your first day Hunter?\u201d You were glowing with accomplishment as you gave her a summary of your first day! Quinn even gave a few praises on your behalf at how well you did. \u201cWell isn\u2019t that splendid!\u201d Brigitte was pleased with her new hire. \u201cI was just looking at some of our reviews from today, and quite a few of them mentioned a brand new tiny lifeguard. All of them were positive reviews on how kind, helpful, and cute you were! Good work, Hunter! I think you\u2019re going to be a great fit here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe review comments were very flattering! Though the \u201ccute\u201d ones kind of made you cringe... It didn\u2019t matter though, you killed it on your first day! Nothing could go wrong at this point! Brigitte finalized her evaluation before going over your schedule for the next few weeks. A short time later you were dismissed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack outside with Quinn, you were both getting ready to part ways for the day. \u201cThanks for your help today Quinn! I really appreciate it.\u201d You expressed immense gratitude to your roommate for helping you get this job, you swore you saw a faint hint of a smile curl at the corner of her mouth. \u201cSure thing. You did great dude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to go to the party?\u201d You asked. \u201cIt\u2019d be great to have you there!\u201d Quinn paused for a moment, almost reconsidering... but then she pictured what it would be like to be at a party with Avery\u2019s energy and that dissuaded her instantly. \u201cNah. Thanks though. Us introverts need our alone time.\u201d Quinn then turned and looked down the beach, she could still see Avery sunbathing on her towel. \u201cYou want me to give you a lift back to Avery so you don\u2019t have to walk all the way there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned your head as well and, like Quinn, could also see Avery a ways down the beach. It was definitely a walk, but nothing you couldn\u2019t handle. \u201cNo thanks, Quinn! I got this! Besides, like you said; I need to get used to handling situations like this myself, yeah?\u201d You finished your sentence with a confidence wink eliciting a slight chuckle at Quinn who was impressed by your wit. \u201cAlright then. Guess I\u2019ll see you later!\u201d Quinn walked back towards her car and drove away from the beach back to your shared home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow on your own, you started to head back towards Avery. Your thoughts shifted back towards the upcoming party as you stepped across the sand, super excited to see Michelle again. However, Sandra was also going to be there too, her forward, flirty behavior today was a tad much, and you were hoping that she wouldn\u2019t try and get in the way of your time with Michelle. It sounded like there would be other girls there too, which sounded... interesting to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time you saw you were getting closer to Avery! All you had to do was make it over to her and you both can head to that party!</span></div></div>",

Avery, I\u2019m off now. Ready to go?\u201d She still didn\u2019t respond. You stood there momentarily confused before trying again, raising your voice a little louder this time. \u201cHEY! AVERY CAN YOU HEAR-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZZZZZZZZ....ZZZZZZZZZ....\u201d Your voice was cut off by a loud snore from your roommate who was slumbering away. \u201cAre you kidding me? She\u2019s sleeping again?\u201d It seemed Avery really enjoyed her naps... \u201cWell, guess I\u2019ll just have to wake her up myself.\u201d Determined to get to that party, you walked to the midsection of Avery\u2019s voluptuous physique. You used her bikini bottoms to scale upwards. Luckily she didn't shift at all during your climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you reached the top, you walked across Avery\u2019s soft belly. It was a challenge to keep your balanced has her breathing created an unstable surface. Eventually you centered yourself along her abdomen. You stared ahead and saw that her face was covered by her massive boobies. For a moment you were entranced at the view, but quickly snapped out of it. It was now or never!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began jumping up and down on Avery\u2019s hefty belly. \u201cAVERY!! IT\u2019S TIME TO WAKE UP!!!\u201d You desperately shouted. \u201cRISE AND SHINE!!!\u201d After about a minute of shouting, your voice was already starting to get raspy, causing you to get slightly frustrated as you continued hopping and yelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Avery shot up. \u201cWh-what what? What was that?\u201d Avery was a little dazed as she woke. She sat up causing the surface you were standing on to tilt, sending you towards her crotch. You blushed in embarrassment as you landed on her pink heart-patterned bikini bottom. It took you a moment to get to oriented and back on your feet again. \u201cHuh... could have sworn I felt something...\u201d Avery pondered as she looked around. You were about to make another attempt to get her attention. \u201cHEY AVERY! DOWN HE-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH SHIT! I\u2019m running late!\u201d Avery blurted out, drowning out your pleas. \u201cI gotta get to going to that party!\u201d Hearing those words made you somewhat relieved, she was supposed to be your ride there after-all! However, you were blindsided as Avery suddenly scrambled to her feet, causing you to tumble off her body onto the towel. She quickly began gathering her things, still unaware of your whereabouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started jumping again, hoping Avery would spot you. Unfortunately your roommate didn\u2019t see nor hear you as she grabbed one end of the towel and started to shake all the sand off of it, sending you flying several feet away from her. You screamed as you soared through the air before crash landing onto the sand, tumbling and rolling across the dunes before finally coming to a stop. \u201cUghhh...\u201d you groaned as you tried to stand up. Looking ahead, you saw that there was now a bit of distance between you and Avery as she folded up the towel. You had to hurry back to her! She was almost ready to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery quickly finished folding the towel as she grabbed the rest of her things. She was about to start walking back to her car when she had the sudden feeling that was forgetting something. As you ran towards Avery, you saw that she was deep in thought as she scratched her head. \u201cAVERY! WAIT\u201d you yelled, hoping that she\u2019ll remember that she needed to find you before leaving the beach. The air-headed Avery took another few seconds to think before coming to the incorrect conclusion that she\u2019s all good to go! \u201cNope. I think I\u2019m all set! Yay!!\u201d She happily declared before beginning a brisk walk towards the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart started racing as you saw Avery take off. <i>\u201cAre you serious?? How did she forget about me??\u201d</i> you thought to yourself in absolute frustration towards Avery\u2019s ditziness. You took off in a full sprint towards your roommate in one last attempt to reach her. \u201cAVERY, WAIT! AVERY, STOP!\u201d You shouted. \u201cYOU\u2019RE FORGETTING ABOUT ME! AVERY!\u201d This was super annoying, you were having a hard time keeping up as Avery was pulling further away from you with every step. Her bouncing tushy swayed from side-to-side as she walked, it was almost as if her booty was taunting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery was walking slightly faster than she normally would as she got closer and closer to the exit of the beach, completely unaware that her cute, little roommate was right behind her, desperately trying to get her attention. The only thing on her mind was the excitement of meeting up with everyone at Sandra\u2019s party! She hummed happily to herself as she strolled along, rendering any chance of hearing your calls an impossibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no no no no no!! This can\u2019t be happening!\u201d Your panic increased tenfold as Avery was getting closer to the exit and even further away from you. How would you get to the party if she leaves without you? You were starting to second guess rejecting Quinn\u2019s offer to take you to Avery in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere has to be something you can do! Looking around you saw there was a lifeguard walking towards you, you could try to get her attention, but there\u2019s the risk she might not notice you. You also spotted a group of four women sunbathing nearby, you could try to get help from them. However, you might not be able to get their attention in time, and even if you do there\u2019s no guarantee they\u2019ll be much help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelying on strangers was risky... but you had to make a decision and FAST!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before you can make up your mind, a Volleyball comes out of nowhere and rolls on top of you, flattening you to the leather sphere. A few moments went by before a woman came by and picked it up. The beachgoer carried the ball at her side as she walked back to the direction the ball came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were plastered to the ball, the side you were on was facing away from the woman, almost like fate as taunting you by giving you a view of Avery who at this point was going to be impossible to reach. Your heart sank as you saw your roommate's car leave the parking lot, leaving you stranded at the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman carrying the volleyball was walking towards a Beach Volleyball court, there was some sort of tournament going on. There was a set of bleachers with an enthusiastic audience waiting for the player to bring the ball back to resume the exhibition!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one noticed the tiny stuck to the ball as the game resumed! You were tossed, served, set, and spiked several times as both teams rallied the ball back and forth. Eventually one of the best players on the leading team was up for a<br>\r\nserve, they served the ball so hard that the ball nearly burst! The force caused you to separate from the ball!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gust of wind picked up, sending your paper form towards the bleachers. You glided through the air for a minute or so until you landed on one of the empty seats. Suddenly you saw an approaching woman from the corner of your eye. You saw the long blonde hair, yellow flower-pattern bikini, and the giant dark red lips.... It was none other than Pamela, the southern woman you met earlier today, it looked like she was looking for a place to sit to watch the Volleyball game. You desperately sent signals to your body to reform, hoping she won\u2019t accidentally sit on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs fate would have it, it seemed like she was heading straight for the spot you were currently occupying. You managed to finally reform, but as her curvy form looms over the bench, you realize you have no time to get her attention over the noise of the crowd. You scramble up to your feet and move for the edge of the bench, but freeze as her creamy flesh towers over you. Finding yourself stunned at the sight of her large, round booty, you shake yourself out of it and make a move to escape, but it's far too little far too late...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>SLAM!!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPamela\u2019s massive backside plops down onto the seat, its owner completely unaware that she's crushing you flatter by the second beneath its girth. Instead, the blonde smiles happily as she watches the game, a sense of nostalgia overcoming her as she reflects on her days as a Volleyball player from years back! She shifts slightly in her chair, not knowing that even her smallest movement sends grinding, crushing torment through the adorable lifeguard she met this morning. Even if she knew of your whereabouts, the situation would probably be just as bad for you if not worse based on her affectionate actions from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cursed your timing and libido for slowing your get away. While being pressed up against Pamela\u2019s soft, sexy backside was better than being rolled over by a Volleyball, you were still steadily getting flatter and flatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter awhile, the game ended so Pamela decided to head back to the sand to sunbathe. You're left bouncing and swaying on the blonde's round ass as she walks along the beach. With an ass like hers, she must be getting looks. How could nobody see you? The only explanation you could think of was that you were being dismissed as a sticker on her bikini bottom. That or no one wanted to out themselves for checking her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were starting to get pretty nauseous from the constant swinging motion of Pamela\u2019s tushy as she walked along the sand. Fortunately, it ceased once she made her way back to her spot from before. She reapplied some sunscreen, still unaware of the cute tiny still stuck to her bum. The southerner laid down on her towel and resumed her tanning.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately you were still stuck to her bum as she was lying on her back sandwiching you between her bikini fabric and the towel. Eventually she turned over on her stomach, relieving the pressure off of you. Despite that, you still couldn\u2019t free yourself from Pamela\u2019s giant rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, fate decided to smile upon you for the first time in awhile when Pamela felt a slight itch on her butt cheek as she slept, in fact it was the exact spot where you happened to be plastered to! The scraping of her nails kind of hurt at first, and the scratching caused her butt cheek to slightly jiggle, sending you into a daze. After a few scratches you were scraped off her butt onto her fingers. She shifted back over to lay on her back as she placed her hand on her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour flattened body tumbled from her hand onto her belly. After a brief effort you finally managed to reform and pop back up, you turned around and saw that Pamela was still asleep, much to your relief. You figure that nothing beneficial would come from her spotting you. Pushing all fears aside, you slowly tried to tip-toe along her soft skin, struggling to keep your balance as you ventured towards her hip, from there it should be easy to jump down to the towel and sneak away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPamela was enjoying a blissful nap when out of nowhere a slight tickling sensation woke her from her slumber. It felt like a little bug was crawling on her belly, she was about to swat it away but decided to take a look first. What she discovered brought immense joy to her; Hunter, the cute little lifeguard from earlier today was paying her a visit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well... If it isn't my favorite little lifeguard!\" Your entire body froze in petrification, never has a southern accent made you tremble with as much fear as you have right now. Turning around, you saw that Pamela was wide awake with an expression akin to a child on their birthday as her giant hand reached for you. \u201cWhoa! Whoa! Hey! No no!\u201d you made a mad dash along her stomach in an attempt to get away. It was pointless though, the giant blonde giggled at you trying to run, eliciting a quiver from her belly. The unstable surface caused you to lose your balance and you fell face first onto her soft skin. Your heart raced as you felt her thumb and index finger grab you by the legs, and you were lifted towards the giant woman's face dangling upside down. \"Hello there, Hunter! I sure missed you my little cutie!! I just knew I would encounter you again! Are you just checking up on little ol\u2019 me?\u201d Pamela batted her eyelashes at you seductively as she studied you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell uh... actually, I\u2019m off the clock. My roommate was supposed to give me a ride home. But she kinda ... left without me.\u201d You hoped that explaining your predicament to Pamela would benefit you. She isn\u2019t your first choice for a savior, but maybe she can help you. \u201cAww! How rude!\u201d Pamela\u2019s expression changed to a more sympathetic expression as she stroked you with her other hand. You gave her a summary of how Avery left you stranded at the beach, the incident with the Volleyball that landed you on the bleachers, and ultimately getting stuck to Pamela's butt. The southern belle blushed in embarrassment. \u201cOh my word! I\u2019m so sorry that happened to you, sweetie! And I\u2019m so sorry I sat on you, that must have been terrible. I must make it up to you somehow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou appreciated the blonde\u2019s attempts to make amends, sure she made you a little uncomfortable, but she seems to be the nurturing type! All hope wasn\u2019t lost just yet, you realized that if Pamela can take you to Brigitte\u2019s office, you can use the phone to hopefully get ahold of Avery and ask her to come back to get you. \u201cThanks! I appreciate that, actually if you take me to-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about you come stay in my hotel room tonight?\u201d Pamela abruptly boomed out, cutting you off. \u201cWe can have a relaxing evening, and I\u2019ll take good care of you! Besides, I actually used to be a lifeguard myself, so maybe I can help you out with your CPR?\u201d her plump lips curled into a suggestive smirk on that last bit. Her offer caught you completely off guard. \u201cWhoa! Oh No! No no no! That\u2019s okay! Actually if you just take me to my boss\u2019s off-\u201c your protests were silenced by her giant finger covering your mouth. \"Shhh, hush deary! I won't take no for an answer!\" The blonde dropped you from her grasp and you fell towards her chest, you bounced a couple of times on her boobs before plummeting into her canyon sized cleavage. Pamela giggled as she looked down at you, only your head was visible between her bountiful breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not good at all! You looked up toward the happy blonde and tried to make one last attempt to protest but barely got past \"Wait! You don't understand, I'm supposed to go to a par-\" before her finger affectionately stroked your head before pushing you further in, trapping you completely out of sight. Any attempt to climb back up proved to be futile, as the giant breasts rendered you completely immobile, much to your dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should be safe in there for now!\" Pamela assured you as she got up from her chair and began a leisurely stroll towards the opposite end of the beach towards the hotel. Her yellow bikini booty bounced happily in delight as she hauled her unwilling little friend far and away, completely oblivious to the fact that she just ruined any chance of you making it to that party...</span></div></div>",

It wasn\u2019t the first time you\u2019d found yourself in a position like this obviously, as your size made such things a frequent occurrence. It wasn\u2019t exactly ideal, especially since you\u2019d be missing the party with Michelle, but you tried to comfort yourself with the knowledge that Pamela, unlike others you\u2019d been trapped with in the past, at least knew you were there. And maybe if you were lucky she\u2019d give you a chance to explain once you reached the hotel, and you could clear up this misunderstanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the warm flesh rubbing against you from all sides, it was a struggle just to maintain your basic shape, let alone try to escape, and you refocused your efforts on trying not to become adhered to the slightly tanned skin. Fortunately, a day spent lounging around at the beach had left Pamela relatively clean, if slightly damp, and her skin wasn\u2019t as sticky as it could have been, but it was still a struggle as each step brought her breasts slamming together, crushing you rhythmically between them in a seemingly endless barrage. As much as you appreciate the blonde\u2019s attempts at being helpful, if this was what she considered to be a comfortable ride, you were deeply concerned over what she might intend to do to you in the name of having a good time. If past experience was anything to go by, getting her to listen to you was going to be both pivotal and unlikely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeedless to the thoughts of her little passenger, Pamela was just happy to have her new little friend in tow as she practically skipped towards the hotel, her large rear jiggling happily with each step. As far as the Nashville-native was concerned she was just helping out a vulnerable little man who needed someone to look out for him and keep him safe. Her parents had raised her to be a good neighbor, and she always tried to be helpful to those she met, but this was probably the first time she felt like she was really doing good by someone else. Plus... she's been lonely for quite some time, so getting the chance to have such a handsome tiny all to herself excited her! The thought brought a smile to her face and even more of a bounce to her steps, your weak attempts to struggle now even further overwhelmed as the movements of her chest increased, pulling you down further to be crushed within the very depths of her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching the gate between the beach and the attached hotel, Pamela waved happily at the worker watching the entrance, receiving a notably forced smile in return but missing the raised eyebrow and small frown that the girl shot at her retreating back as she passed. For the worker, she was half tempted to ask what had the woman so excited to be bouncing along and shaking her booty like that, but she let it drop rather than risk getting in trouble for harassing a customer. Unimpeded, Pamela headed through the gate and into the hotel grounds proper, quickly scanning the barcoded wristband she wore at the security gate inside and stepping into the outdoor pool area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo many of the guests the outdoor pool of the hotel seemed a little pointless when there was a beach just next door, but that just meant that those who wanted a little peace and quiet could use it without being bothered by the rowdy groups of teens and young adults that often congregated in such areas. Pamela in particular was delighted to see that right now the pool and its surroundings were completely empty, the late hour having driven most guests inside, meaning she\u2019d get to enjoy some alone time with her new little friend. The blonde knew full well that she\u2019d have to let you go once her stay here was done, but for both of your sakes she intended to make the best use of what time the two of you had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom your perspective the incessant movement around you finally ceased as Pamela stepped up to the edge of the pool, and for a moment you dared to think that the torment was over but then the entire world around you seemed to shift and become weightless for a moment before gravity took hold and you felt yourself rushing downwards even as the flesh around you began to lift. Hearing a delighted giggle from above you realized what was happening just a moment before your captor entered the pool, a torrent of lukewarm water bursting up between her breasts as they broke the surface and hurling you out of their embrace. The ripples and torrents created by the passage of Pamela\u2019s body threw you all over the place, and it was impossible to get your bearings as bubbles streamed past you and your eyes struggled to adapt to the underwater world. Spinning in place you caught just a brief glimpse of a looming shadow beneath you, like some rising whale before you were struck by a warm surface and propelled back up into the waning sunlight and breathable air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat for you had been a whirlwind of chaos had for Pamela just been a quick dip into the water before rising back to the surface, and she hadn\u2019t even realized you\u2019d been pulled free until she felt your little body collide with her right breast, rebounding off the rising flesh and travelling in a small arc before splashing down in the water a couple of feet away. The blonde laughed at the uncoordinated display as you splashed and spluttered, a soft coo emitting from her throat as she casually swam over so that her slightly buoyant chest bumped gently against you. \u201cNot particularly graceful in the water there are you deary? Are you sure you can be a lifeguard with those skills?\u201d Though partially teasing, she was also legitimately concerned for you, wondering if maybe she should have a talk to your boss and try and find something a little bit less dangerous for you, like maybe being a rentable guide for guests who needed help finding their way around the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpitting water out of your mouth and taking a few greedy gulps of air, you forced yourself not to glare at Pamela for the comment on your abilities, instead giving her a more neutral look. Though you wanted to get back to the subject of the party, or at least your own home, your pride wouldn\u2019t let you just take such criticism, regardless of its intent, and you tried to puff up your chest as you responded. \u201cLifeguarding is a lot more than just swimming around ma\u2019am. I may not be able to pull people from the ocean but I\u2019m very observant so I can look out for trouble and alert my partner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPamela looked unimpressed by the response, frowning slightly in contemplation. \u201cYour partner wasn\u2019t with you when I found you though.\u201d Not waiting for a response she continued before she could give you a chance to defend yourself, her frown only becoming deeper. \u201cAlso, you said your roommate was at the beach too? And she left without you?\u201d The blonde shook her head with a wry little smile. \u201cNow I\u2019m not trying to tell you how to live your life, Hunter, but you should be careful of the company you keep, especially if you\u2019re going to be working at the beach. A cutie like you, and all those women, well\u2026 you\u2019d be lucky if one didn\u2019t decide to take you home and eat you up. Heck, if I was a few years younger I might just be tempted to do the same myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were pretty sure Pamela meant \u2018eat\u2019 in a metaphorical sense, but the way she showed her teeth as she smiled didn\u2019t exactly fill you with confidence. Frankly, you were at a loss for words for how she could analyze the potential danger posed to you by your roommates (though you admit Avery was a bit of an airhead) while remaining totally oblivious to her own misunderstandings. You knew that now was the time to try to make yourself clear, or else you might end up spending the next few days with this woman! However, are you finally able to convince her of your plight, or do the misunderstandings continue?</span></div></div>",

While you were somewhat use to women treating you as \u2018cute\u2019, the word was usually used in a more childish and vaguely condescending manner, whereas the blonde\u2019s intentions seemed more\u2026 mature. Caught off-guard, you tried to slowly paddle backwards as you looked up at her expectant face, nervously clearing your throat as you struggled to change to subject. \u201cAh, well, anyway\u2026 like I was saying, there\u2019s a lot more to lifeguard work than just swimming. It\u2019s about helping people and keeping an eye out for any trouble or troublemakers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Pamela\u2019s smile only spread at your words, and what little space you were able to create between you was instantly undone as she casually moved forward, the thin fabric of her bikini bumping against your chest and face. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t doubt that you want to be helpful little guy. Like I said before, I used to be a lifeguard myself when I was about your age so I can help you out. Ah!\u201d Her smile turned into a wide grin and her eyes sparkled as she remembered your conversation from earlier. \u201cThat reminds me! Every lifeguard has to be well trained in CPR, and you still haven\u2019t shown me your skills yet have you deary? Well, we can\u2019t have that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it was possible your eyes would have bulged out of her skull at the implications of those words, and you hurriedly started to wave your hands, desperately trying to swim backwards as Pamela smacked her lips at you. \u201cOh no no no, that\u2019s fine. Really, I wouldn\u2019t want to inconvenience a guest like that. Don\u2019t worry, I know how CPR works, and even if I can\u2019t do it myself I can assist the other lifeguards so....\u201d your protests trailed off as you saw Pamela\u2019s hand reaching down to claim you. Gasping you tried to turn over onto your front and swim away as fast as you could, but barely made it two strokes before you were dunked down deep underwater by the descending palm, the air pushed from your lungs before you were yanked back out of the water and towards her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to your attempts to flee, Pamela snatched you up with contemptuous ease, not even noticing your struggles and distress as you were briefly dunked under. Flipping her hand over, she smiled down at your soaked spread-eagled form gasping for breath, blowing a soft breath over you as she brought your tiny body towards her lips. \u201cOh don\u2019t you worry about that little cutie, it\u2019s no trouble at all. I'll be honest with you Hunter, I\u2019m still not sure about you being a lifeguard, but if that\u2019s what you have your little heart set on I\u2019ll do everything I can to help.\u201d The blonde smiled gently as she looked down at her new friend, overwhelmed with a sense of affection for the brave little tiny who just wanted to help others. \u201cNow, I think the first step for you to know how to do good CPR is knowing what it feels like to put your lips on the lips of a girl many times your size. I\u2019m sure it would be awkward to do it with one of your colleagues, so I\u2019ll make it easier for you and do it myself, okay sweetie?\u201d Impressed with her own logic, the blonde lifted her hand and puckered her lips, ready to get down to business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom your perspective, the whole horizon was now dominated by Pamela\u2019s face, and her full lips looked anything but inviting as they descended towards you, the meaty tongue that briefly emerged to run along the red-tinged flesh doing nothing to make you feel any more comfortable. Every instinct in your body screamed to escape, and as her eyes slipped shut you took your opportunity to roll as quickly as you could to the edge of her palm. You knew a long fall to the water below awaited you, but it had to be better than staying here, so you took that leap without hesitation, hurling yourself into the air and quickly splashing down into the pool. Your momentum alone plunged you deep beneath the surface, but this time you were ready for it, and took the chance to propel yourself as far away as possible before breaking the surface and swimming for the edge for all you were worth. Friendly or not, you\u2019d had enough, and wanted to get away as quickly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it didn\u2019t take Pamela long at all to realize you were gone. While kissing her own palm wasn\u2019t particularly unpleasant, it hadn\u2019t been what she expected, and her eyes immediately sprung open when her lips failed to locate your body. Momentarily confused, and concerned for your safety, her gaze flicked down to the pool, and quickly located your small body in the otherwise empty expanse of water, barely a few feet away from her belly button despite your best efforts. Confusion quickly turned to playfulness, as she interpreted your actions through the lens of her assumptions, and emitted another soft coo. \u201cOh I see. Going to make me work for it huh? I guess you do need to practice your swimming as well.\u201d She giggled softly, before lowering herself up to the neck into the pool, pursing her lips again as she commenced her playful pursuit. \u201cWell you better watch out hon, because I\u2019m coming for you now, and when I catch you I\u2019m going to smother you with kisses.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor you the blonde\u2019s pursuit was anything but playful, and the kissing noises and faces she started to make were far from comforting. You tried to swim harder, but ultimately you knew it was pointless as your pursuer closed the gap without effort, kept at bay only by her own playfulness as she remained a couple of feet behind you, making small waves to disrupt your attempts to swim and splashing at your heels but never quite reaching forward enough to actually grab you. Not for the first time in your life you were reminded of just how helpless you were in these situations, and genuinely started to wonder if you\u2019d made the right decision coming to the beach. If even someone whose intentions seemed, more or less, kind, if misguided, could give you this much trouble, than you had to wonder what you would do if you encountered someone who actually meant you harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she continued to playfully splash at you, Pamela had to admit she was impressed by the speed you managed at your size, her playful smile turning more genuine as she fell back another foot. \u201cWell what do you know, you\u2019re actually pretty fast for a tiny, hon. Guess you\u2019re more fit than I gave you credit for huh? And you know what they say about fit young men.\u201d She giggled and made another kissy face. \u201cBut that\u2019s just making me want to kiss you more cutie. I\u2019ll get a good idea of how strong you really are when I cover every last inch of that body with my lips.\u201d You shivered at Pamela\u2019s tender flirtations, her desire to kiss you was growing, and she surged forward with renewed vigor before diving under, her whole body disappearing from view, with your last sight being her substantial rear rising up then dipping below the waves, followed by the long expanse of her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anything, your inability to see exactly where your pursuer was only made you more nervous, and you redoubled your efforts to escape, the edge of the pool finally coming into sight as you powered forward. Fixing your attention ahead, you put all your strength into reaching that edge, thinking that if you could just escape the pool you could maybe get Pamela to finally listen to what you had to say, or maybe just get away from her altogether. For a fraction of a second you even fooled yourself into believing you were going to make it, but then an immense shadow rose from the depths below, and with an eruption of water and a great sucking force your world exploded into motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, sometimes your life felt like fate was deliberately conspiring against you. Your time with Pamela had been a constant series of misunderstandings and accidents, and now was no different. It had been the blonde\u2019s intention to come up just behind you, creating a great deal of waves and bluster and knocking you off course but generally leaving you unharmed. And in regards to the emergence of her head her aim had been true, and it had indeed burst free just an inch behind your kicking feet. Unfortunately, in her excitement she had kicked off with too much force, and her entire upper body had burst forth, including her rather prodigious chest sticking out several inches past her sternum, so while her eyes were squeezed shut against the spray your small body was sucked down into the yawning cleavage like water being pulled into a drain, the expanse of flesh creating a great deal of suction as the displaced water was pulled through the gaps together with your form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising her hands to wipe the spray from her eyes, Pamela chuckled deeply as her lips curved into a smile. \u201cSorry about that cutie, just testing your reflexes a bit. Now about that kiss.\u201d Finally pulling her hands away and fully opening her eyes, the smile remained on the blonde\u2019s lips as she searched for her tiny friend. But what has happened to your body, and is the playful Pamela able to find you?</span></div></div>",

Buried face-first between her bountiful breasts, your whole body down to your waist had been sucked into the abyss, with your legs kicking feebly in the air. For you it was a suffocating embrace that did nothing to calm your nerves, but to Pamela it was an adorable and hilarious sight and she soon descended into a fit of laughter as she started to bounce around, shaking her hips and jiggling her chest in excitement as she watched you being battered by her bosom. \u201cHehe, you just couldn\u2019t stay away could you little guy? Well, if you wanted to go back so badly you just had to ask. You\u2019re welcome in my cleavage anytime cutie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you were capable of responding you would have called out in protest as your attempts to struggle were instantly undone by the blonde\u2019s movements, but there was little you could do as the flesh of her chest was pounding against your head, muffling your cries and threatening to crush your face altogether. You wanted to tell her that you were certainly not enjoying this, though you were frustratingly aware that that wasn\u2019t completely true, as a certain part of your anatomy began to involuntarily react to the warmth and scent of a woman\u2019s body pressed so tightly against your own form. The continued cooing and flirting from above, and the way the sounds reverberated through the breasts that surrounded you certainly wasn\u2019t helping, and your attempts to cross your legs to hide your growing erection were hindered by the continual movement of the bouncing flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Pamela got over her initial excitement from seeing your new position, settling her movements and finally reaching down to retrieve you. She was happy that you were having fun as well, but she was eager to kiss you, and there would always be time to return you to her cleavage later. In fact she may just put you there to sleep tonight, snug and warm and safe. For now though, she fully intended to\u2026 The southern woman\u2019s train of thought derailed slightly as she noticed what looked suspiciously like a third leg poking at the front of her new friend\u2019s shorts, and her cheeks almost hurt at how wide her smile had suddenly become. \u201cOh my\u2026 Well what do we have here cutie? I knew you were having fun, but I didn\u2019t realize you were that excited by little old me.\u201d She couldn\u2019t help but blush a little bit herself at the attention, thrilled to think that she was still attractive enough to excite you in such a way. \u201cWell then, why don\u2019t we take a closer look.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you couldn\u2019t see your captor\u2019s movements, you could tell from her words what she intended and frantically tried to kick as her fingers descended towards your shorts, but with your body in this position your already unimpressive strength was reduced further and when your feet collided with her fingers it felt to Pamela like a gentle caress, doing nothing to deter her as her fingers closed around the edge of your shorts and pulled forcibly. With a sharp rip that caused your heart to plummet but didn\u2019t even register to the blonde\u2019s ears the garment pulled free, casually thrown aside without a second thought as your body and shame were revealed to the massive woman\u2019s hungry gaze. A loud exhale from above blew a wave of hot air over your exposed privates, and only made things worse as the temperature difference prompted yet a further reaction from the appendage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Pamela hadn\u2019t set out looking for something like this, she couldn\u2019t deny that she was excited by the sight. It had been awhile since her last partner, and she did have needs after all. She could tell from your vibrations that you were enjoying yourself as well, so there was no need to hold back. Just some harmless fun for the two of you before settling in for the evening. With a small squeal and another jiggle of her chest she reached down again, a sultry look taking over her face as she licked her lips. \u201cNow doesn\u2019t this look like fun. Don\u2019t worry little guy, it\u2019s just you and me here, plenty of time for us to get to know each other.\u201d Pursing her lips, the blonde blew another breath across your exposed erection before closing the last of the distance and finally making physical contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as you knew it was coming, nothing could quite prepare you for that first moment of contact as Pamela\u2019s finger ghosted along the length of your member. Twin quivers of shock and pleasure ran through your body at the gentle caress, most of you trying to shy away while the appendage itself reacted quite differently, almost seeming to reach towards the touch. It was almost a tickling sensation at first, but it quickly grew in intensity as you involuntarily shuddered, the distant seeming sound of Pamela\u2019s voice filtering down to you as she commented appreciatively on the length and girth of her find, words you would have liked to hear in other circumstances but which right now filled you more with dread than anything else. Your attempts to respond were muffled by the surrounding flesh, and the words died in your throat anyway at the blonde\u2019s next actions.</span></div></div>",

Sometimes the touch was nothing but gentle, a soft caress that lingered at the edge of your perceptions, but other times it was sharp and strong, your delicate anatomy caught between two fingers as they ran across its length and squeezed just shy of painfully tight. Your small size made you an easy target, and from tip to base every part of you was touched over and over again. Muffled groans rose from your throat at the attention, a mix of protest and pleasure as you tried to keep your thoughts straight, blood rushing from your limbs and leaving you ever more defenseless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were conflicted, Pamela was having the time of her life. It wasn\u2019t by any means the most stimulation she\u2019d ever experienced, but it was certainly a new adventure to have a little guy squirming around in her cleavage while she played with his prominent erection. Wanting to feel as much as possible, she made sure to keep her body in constant motion, hips swaying side to side in the water and making little waves, causing her round, voluptuous rump to bounce around with glee underwater. Her chest bobbed around on the surface, her breasts vibrating around your body as you bounced rhythmically with them. To anyone looking from a distance it would just look like the blonde was dancing in the pool, happily lost in her own little world with a broad smile on her face. It was the most fun she\u2019d had in ages, and unless you could do something major to dissuade her, she was going to make sure you gave a repeat performance for as long as she was able to stay at the hotel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't avoid moaning in pleasure once again, her advances were driving you absolutely wild! This and your lack of protest due to being smothered by her boobs seemed to delight Pamela even more as she puckered her lips and smacked them together, teasing you with kissy noises. Pamela blushed again, her heart fluttering with happiness that this handsome little man found her so attractive! Sure, he was quite a bit younger than her, but something about this arrangement just felt so... right. \u201cMy, oh my! I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re enjoying yourself, Hunter! This worked out perfectly! We\u2019ll have plenty of time to practice your CPR once I kiss you all over! Muah muah muah muah muah!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now your senses were in complete overload. Your body was screaming for release as Pamela got more and more lost in her efforts to please you, the rate and pressure of her touches increasing as she seemingly tried to work you to a crescendo. Stubbornly you held on, feeling as if it would all be over if you gave her the satisfaction of watching you climax. With your blood either rushing to your member or pooling in your head, it was hard to remain conscious as the flesh around you continued to jiggle and heave, and playful fingers stroked at every bit of you they could reach, alternating between soft tickles and light tugs. The lingering thought of what it would be like to be in this same position with Michelle was doing nothing to calm your stiff erection, something you knew would only drive Pamela on harder, but you found it impossible to fight off. As your mind began to drift between utter bliss and the yawning chasm of unconsciousness you couldn\u2019t help but wonder distantly what Avery was up to. Has she noticed your absence yet? Was she on her way back to beach to look for you? And what kind of fun might you be having right now if you\u2019d managed to make it to that party?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Avery was far and away from the beach at this point, still driving in her car singing along to the pop radio station. She was about halfway to Sandra\u2019s house by now, the bubbly beauty was really excited to get to that party to hang out with all of her friends, plus her cute roomie! Her ditziness won over as she totally forgot that the reason she stayed behind with you in the first place was to give you a ride to the party once you were done working. She entered the on-ramp to the freeway and stepped on the gas as she sped away, unknowingly leaving you to your fate while she headed off for a night of fun with the girls...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no knowledge of the party you were missing, Pamela happily assumed that you were having the time of your life right now, giving your member a couple more strokes as she smacked her lips a few more times and jiggled her cleavage. \u201cY\u2019know Hunter, I can\u2019t remember the last time I\u2019ve had this much fun with a man! You certainly are a special little cutie.\u201d Feeling a little adventurous and spurred on by your seeming appreciation, she gave you a slightly harder squeeze, not enough to be truly painful, but definitely enough to get your attention. \u201cI\u2019m in town for a few more days... so I think I\u2019ll just have to keep you until the end of my stay here!\u201d Pamela had butterflies in her stomach as she sweetened the deal. \u201cOr... maybe I really should take you back with me to good old Nashville!! The two of us could have a lot of fun together! I could introduce you to all of my friends, they absolutely adore tinies like you! You can just move in with me, so you wouldn\u2019t even need this job anymore! And I promise <i>I</i> will never leave you behind or let you out of my sight! Doesn\u2019t that just sound delightful? What do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cOh man, she can\u2019t actually be serious about that...right?\u201d</i> You thought while shivering at Pamela\u2019s words. <i>\u201cOh no no no no no!\u201d</i> The blonde knew you couldn\u2019t actually answer buried face-first between her breasts, but that was fine, since she was just joking around about her proposal. Being a single woman at her age can be lonesome at times, so it was a nice thought, a really nice thought, but she couldn\u2019t just take a tiny halfway across the country on a whim... However, that doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t still keep you while she\u2019s a guest here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonally, you wished you could know whether she was joking or not about Nashville. You\u2019d thought it was probably a joke the first time, but now you weren\u2019t so sure. Given the incorrect assumptions she was certainly drawing from your uncontrollable erection, she might very well have felt you wanted to go home to Tennessee with her, even if nothing could be further from the truth. Her continual flirting and air kisses weren\u2019t helping your confidence, but it was hard to struggle or even contemplate escape as the stimulation of your manhood continued. Intense pleasure mixed into every throb and the movements you were able to make were mostly just pushing your member further into the blonde\u2019s probing fingers, which only encouraged more touching as she giggled suggestively in adoration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost hopeless at this point, you\u2019re completely naked, trapped with a giant woman who seems intent on keeping you for at least the foreseeable future, and to top it all off, no one else has any idea where you are. You wondered how Brigitte was going to react if you stop showing up for work, even if Pamela only plans on keeping you while she\u2019s in town, you\u2019ll still miss your next few shifts. Brigitte might assume you just quit and hire someone else to replace you instead. The likelihood of this scenario made your heart sink. Even with Pamela seemingly unaware that her plans potentially put your job in jeopardy, you tried not to direct any frustration towards the blonde. Despite her frequent misunderstandings she actually seemed really kind and down-to-earth, she probably just wants someone to keep her company. Plus, you had to admit... she was pretty hot. However, she just wasn\u2019t what you were looking for right now. And besides, she was almost twice your age! This was not the way you wanted your first time with a real woman to go! Thoughts of spending the next several days (or longer) getting kissed, cuddled, and played with by this giant woman filled you with dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPamela happily continued to tease your penis with tantalizing tickles. Her butt still swaying back and forth beneath the surface as she continues to dance on cloud nine. The buildup brewing between your legs was getting harder to contain as your penis started to twitch uncontrollably... You\u2019re not going to last much longer. <i>\u201cOh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!!!\u201d</i> you thought to yourself as you squirmed and frantically kicked your legs, desperate for some sort of escape! \u201cOooooo! Oh my word...\u201d the southern belle cooed in fascination, smiling to herself as she observed your flailing appendage, thinking that you must be in absolute heaven at this point. Another tickle against your sensitive flesh sent a shiver up your spine and almost broke you then and there, clenching every muscle you could, you managed to fight off your urge to cum for now. Still, you could feel yourself teetering on the edge, and you knew that if Pamela didn\u2019t stop soon you weren\u2019t going to be able to keep it all in.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>(special thanks to Azazel-8 for helping me with this chapter)</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, Pamela was either unaware of how close she had brought you, or was honestly convinced that you would like nothing more than to express your pleasure in this moment. Your futile squirming continued to be perceived as shivers of pleasure which, to be fair, wasn\u2019t entirely inaccurate either despite your attempts to fight such reaction down. And though blood continued to rush to your ears you could still hear the flirtatious giggling of your host as dexterous fingers continued to assault your manhood in a maddening rhythm of flicks and languid strokes. \u201cHehe, I must stay you\u2019re standing quite proud there aren\u2019t you? Such a little trooper you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been awhile for her, but Pamela did have some experience with this kind of thing, if not exactly with someone of your particular scale. That said, she was the kind of person who thought she was a lot better at reading her partner\u2019s then she actually was, her forceful personality generally overriding any gentle attempts to correct any misunderstandings. Part of those misunderstandings was that she had convinced herself that all men liked to be teased with the potential for release, which for once went in your favor as she stopped her ministrations just short of what would surely have tipped you over. You weren\u2019t out of the woods yet, but at least you could catch your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment there was stillness, then a tight pressure around your ankles and a sudden surge of movement as you were ripped into the light, your upper body emerging from its fleshy prison with a wet slurp. The glare of the sun had you blinking momentarily, as you felt your body invert and then slap down onto a solid surface, belatedly realizing you were now in the palm of Pamela\u2019s left hand. Her joyful face looming above your prone body as she eyed the rapid rise and fall of your partially squished chest as you fought to regain your composure. Fighting to regain your breath so that you might try to talk some sense into your captor, you watched in silent horror as those eyes shifted to your still prominent erection, and a single manicured eyebrow raised together with a teasing pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPamela giggled again as she confirmed that her little man was still raring to go. \u201cHmm\u2026 if I recall correctly, I was going to help you out with your CPR, yes? So, prepare yourself for some kissy kissy cutie!\u201d She smacked her lips audibly and kissed the air a couple of times, savoring the anticipation which she was sure was now building in them both. For a moment it looked like her tiny companion wanted to say something, likely an encouragement to get things moving, but she cut him off as her deft fingers descended to play across the small ridges of his ribs, still dragging out the moment as she teased you with tickles and kissy faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling in a breath, you experienced a brief hope that you would be able to call out a protest, only for that hope to be dashed as the southern belle\u2019s fingers descended and the words on your lips were cut off by an involuntary laugh. You tried to hold the sounds in, but there was little you could do as the assault continued, your squishy flesh as vulnerable as anyone\u2019s to such ministrations. Though you would generally prefer such treatment over what you had just experienced, you knew that right now it was robbing you of what could have been your one chance to escape this fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegrettably, your uncontainable laughter just convinced the oblivious Pamela that you were enjoying this experience every bit as much as she was, if not more so. Though you had been shy at first, it seemed now that you were finally starting to let loose. Ceasing her assault, she puckered her lips once more, finally bringing her mouth down fully upon you, the first strike nearly burying your whole body beneath her glossy lips as she pressed you hard against the palm of her hand. The heat and the pressure was overwhelming as she pushed you deep before separating with a loud <i>\u2018MUAH\u2019</i> and a wet popping sound. You were left slightly delirious from the blow, not to mention red-tinged from the blonde\u2019s lipstick, moaning and twisting feebly as you regathered your senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Pamela it looked like you were shifting around in pleasure and basking in the euphoria of such a wonderous kiss, which perhaps you would have been if it had been with someone more within your\u2026 target demographic. Such moments can be vastly affected by who you experience them with. Case in point, as those full lips descended once more, you felt not the excitement of another kiss with a person dear to you, but rather the fear that this would never end. As it was, those lips would descend upon you again... and again... and again. You groaned in pleasure and moaned in frustration as the blonde peppered you with a mix of prolonged smooches and light pecks accompanied with exaggerated noises, and a near ceaseless undercurrent of mirth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttempts to struggle just pushed you more into the hungry lips as your exposed flesh was further covered with Pamela\u2019s dark red lipstick, mostly obscuring your embarrassed flush. You quickly felt blood pumping back to your privates with each kiss she gave you, so you tried to curl into a fetal position to shield yourself from this barrage as much as possible. Unfortunately, the rapid consistency of Pamela\u2019s kissing denied you of any defenses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you thought it couldn\u2019t get much worse, Pamela\u2019s mouth parted and a warm burst of air washed across you, before being followed by the wet mass of her tongue as you ran across you from your feet to your head. The wet stickiness was bad enough, but to make things worse you could tell that she was deliberately flicking her tongue across your member with each pass, ensuring you had no chance to calm your raging hormones. Her incessant teasing certainly didn\u2019t help, pouring out between every lick and kiss, giving you no chance to get a word in edge wise. Right now you didn\u2019t care to know how good you \u2018tasted\u2019 or whether or not you were the cutest little thing she had ever seen. You just wanted to get away from her and, if at all possible, get back to someone who might actually take care of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the rain of kisses finally petered out you found yourself once again on the very edge of being lost to pleasure, and your ragged breathing gave you no chance to speak as a broad smile spread across your captor\u2019s lips, sparkling eyes once again drifting to your throbbing manhood. You wanted to correct any suggestion that you were \u2018happy\u2019 right now, but there was little you could do as another joyful giggle heralded the parting of those lips. You clenched up, expecting the tongue to come again, but what followed was so many times worse as the open mouth came down on you and started to suck like some kind of human vacuum cleaner. Desperate, you clasped at the nearest finger for purchase, only to ripped away from the hand altogether as your legs and lower body were pulled into the waiting maw, the rest of you saved only by the lips closing once again, pinning your chest between their sticky masses and leaving you stuck with half your body within and half without.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside of Pamela\u2019s mouth was a moist and humid cavern, and your feet struck the undulating mass of her tongue as you kicked feebly within. With what little strength you could muster, you tried to part her lips with your arms, but your hands were simply sucked in as well, leaving you trapped as her mouth tightened around you and a pleased \u2018Mmmmm\u2019 boomed out. From this vantage point you could look up almost directly into your tormentor\u2019s eyes, but you were blurred to her from so close and the terror in your gaze went unseen as she began to suck on you like a human lollipop. The lips around you shifted as they began to rub against your upper body, pushing the air from your lungs as your chest began to compact from the force, and sticking your hands to their glossy surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf within and half outside of Pamela\u2019s mouth, you wonder what fate has in store for you next.</span></div></div>",

The first sign of real trouble was a shift in the unseen world within Pamela\u2019s mouth and a brief tickle on your sole as the tip of her tongue touched your foot. Instinctively you tried to draw back the affected appendage, only to have the muscular organ follow in its wake and then pass it by altogether, heading for its real target. You realized what was about to happen the moment before it did, though the sensation of the tip of her tongue touching your own tip was not the kind of thing you could mentally prepare for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitting her mark, Pamela\u2019s lips twisted into a smirk around your trapped body as she began to lap playfully at your waiting member. Your gasp at the sudden contact just drove her on harder, and attempts to cross your leg were battered aside with ease as the ravenous tongue made its mark. That sound that emerged from your captor\u2019s throat was more of a purr than a moan as she began licking in earnest, your vision blurring momentarily at the sudden rush of unwanted pleasure. It was like nothing you\u2019d ever felt before, and with too little air in your lungs to form words you could do nothing but pant and moan as you struggled futilely. The blonde\u2019s saliva mixed with your own sweat as you were languidly sucked on, your rapidly stiffening erection clearly felt as the sounds of the matured woman\u2019s pleasure only grew higher, clearly enjoying this situation immensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point it was taking everything you had to keep yourself together, clenching muscles you didn\u2019t even know you had in an effort to keep yourself from exploding. You would be lying if you said that there was no pleasure for you in this, but this wasn\u2019t how you had envisioned your first time with a woman going. Pamela was attractive in her own way, and if you were older you could see her being the kind of lady you\u2019d like to do something like this with, but even then you\u2019d want it to be by your own volition, not as the result of some twisted misunderstanding. Why couldn\u2019t it have been Michele doing this to you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConvinced that you were squirming in pleasure and gasping in joy, Pamela began to swing her hips back and forth in the waist-deep water as she basked in the mutual pleasure of herself and the little man who had already made this whole vacation so much better than she could ever have imagined. Feeling your stiff member thrusting against her tongue as you shivered in pleasure, she allowed her breathy moan to mix with your own as she brought you ever closer to release. To the blonde you were a treat greater than anything she had tasted before, and for a moment she entertained the thought of making this a more permanent arrangement. You certainly seemed to be having fun, and she was sure the girls back home would be more than happy to bring your pleasure to new heights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a pleasant dream for the bodacious beauty, enough that her heart began to speed up at the thought, but she let it pass for now. Pamela reminded herself that her handsome little lifeguard had a job to do and that she shouldn\u2019t undermine his self-confidence by taking him away from it. Even if she did think you\u2019d be a lot better off coming to Nashville. Well, that was a discussion for later. For now, she would just take her time and make sure that the two of you enjoyed the next few days you had together. Redoubling her efforts to lick every inch of your prominent erection, her swaying broke into a full-blown happy dance as she began to do circles in the water. Far below, her bouncing booty made waves as it shook in concert with its owner\u2019s joy, cheering both of you on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end of course, no amount of mental fortitude could save you from Pamela\u2019s relentless assault. The final ounce of stamina abandoned you as an electrifying screech of pleasure erupted from your throat. Every muscle in your body contracted as your joystick spasmed out of control, blasting all over the insides of your captor\u2019s mouth, shame and ecstasy washing over you in equal measure as the last shreds of strength left you and you went limp. Even then it didn\u2019t stop, and your body continued to shudder as further squirts fed the blonde\u2019s appetite, her tongue greedily lapping up every last drop of your seed. While your screech trailed off, the sounds of Pamela\u2019s moans only increased in volume, a particular long and drawn out \u2018Mmmmmmm\u2019 as she swallowed the mouthful after savoring its unique taste. Her heart beat now was loud enough that you could feel it vibrating through your own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUtterly spent, you offered no resistance as the tongue returned once last time to push you free of the mouth, its length wrapping around your lower half briefly as a parting gift. A moment later you were in free-fall before slapping down onto a waiting palm with a wet splat, your exhausted body now covered head-to-toe in smeared lipstick, saliva, sweat and the remnants of your own climax. You found yourself unable to move, all strength drained from you from the rush of endorphins flooding your system. For a brief blissful moment you closed your eyes and allowed yourself to just bask in the afterglow of your first time, pushing all other thoughts from your mind. It passed though as warm breath washed across you and you were reminded of just how vulnerable you really were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beaming smile that met you as you opened your eyes chilled you to the bone, not helped by the teasing words that struck out at you. \u201cSorry about that little guy, maybe I went a bit too far, but you were such a delicacy I just couldn\u2019t help myself.\u201d She laughed, her entire body vibrating with it. \u201cStill, you can\u2019t say you didn\u2019t enjoy it huh?\u201d She raised her unoccupied hand in a shushing motion to fend off any attempt to respond. \u201cI know, I know, you\u2019re spent for now. Don\u2019t worry, Hunter. I\u2019ll let you rest for a bit. We\u2019ll have plenty of fun later though. After all, our time together is just getting started.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shuddered as her words sank in, still unsure if she actually intended to take you back to Nashville with her. Having to endure this for even another few hours seem unfathomable to you right now. The prospect of being stuck in this situation indefinitely was a whole other level of terrifying. You tried to muster the up energy for one last attempt to reason with Pamela, but the words left you as you stared up in abject horror as your tormentor\u2019s face descended once more as her puckered lips nearly swallowed you. The muffled \u201cgoodnight\u201d vibrated all around you as one kiss turned into several. Not as hard or as fast as those that had bombarded you before, but more than you could deal with in your current state. Though you tried to fight it, not wanting to be any more vulnerable than you already were, it was a lost cause. After a dozen or so blows, you found yourself drifting into a fitful unconsciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove, Pamela cooed as her little man took a chance to rest, mind swirling with ideas of what the rest of the day, and night, might hold for the two of you, as she headed for the edge of the pool.</span></div></div>",

Sometimes the touch was nothing but gentle, a soft caress that lingered at the edge of your perceptions, but other times it was sharp and strong, your delicate anatomy caught between two fingers as they ran across its length with a light squeeze. Your small size made you an easy target, and from tip to base every part of you was touched over and over again. Muffled groans rose from your throat at the attention, a mix of protest and pleasure as you tried to keep your thoughts straight, blood rushing from your limbs and leaving you ever more defenseless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were conflicted, Pamela was having the time of her life playing with her cute little lifeguard. It wasn\u2019t by any means the most stimulation she\u2019d ever experienced, but it was certainly a new adventure to have a little guy squirming around in her cleavage while she played with his prominent erection. Wanting to feel as much as possible, she made sure to keep her body in constant motion, hips swaying side to side in the water and making little waves, while her chest bobbed around on the surface, her breasts vibrating around your body. To anyone looking from a distance it would just look like the blonde was dancing in the pool, happily lost in her own little world with a broad smile on her face. It was the most fun she\u2019d had in ages, and unless you could do something major to dissuade her, she was going to make sure you gave a repeat performance for as long as she was in town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, another woman entered the pool area and sat down on one of the poolside chairs. Pamela noticed this instantly, and at first she was a little frustrated that someone interrupted her private time with you. But after her initial reaction settled, she remembered she has you all to herself. Wanting to keep you a secret, this was the perfect excuse to take you to her room and keep playing all night! Your face was totally buried between Pamela\u00b4s melons, her flesh blocking your vision completely. You quickly felt the movement produced by Pamela, and you didn't understand what was happening until you heard a familiar flirty tone whispering to you. \u201cWell cutie, it seems like the pool got a little crowded, so how about continuing our fun in my room, maybe for the rest of the night?\u201d Hearing this your face went pale and you frantically kicked your legs, trying to protest but you only got a mouth full of boob flesh. Pamela saw your attempts and totally misunderstood your protests for joy and agreement, causing her to giggle. \"My, oh my! Looks like we are on the same page, Hunter, so lets go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart sank in defeat as you realized that your attempts to communicate were pointless. There was no way around it, you were stuck in your lovestruck captress\u2019s cleavage until she decided to pull you out. The giant blonde waded her way through the waist-deep water of the pool as she continued to touch you all over. You couldn't avoid moaning in pleasure once again, her advances were driving you absolutely wild! This and your lack of protest due to being smothered by her boobs seemed to delight Pamela even more as she puckered her lips and smacked them together, teasing you with kissy noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sexy southerner used the stairs to exit the pool, she paused her touching to grab her towel to dry her body, this gave you a chance to try to calm your throbbing erection. After a few minutes Pamela finished drying off before discarding her towel. She began to walk back towards the hotel entrance with her yellow bikini booty bouncing happily in delight every step of the way, anticipating the upcoming fun with her little boy. The other hotel guest watched the abnormally happy blonde walk into the building, but she just shrugged it off and goes back to her tanning, totally oblivious of the poor little man in that woman\u00b4s clutches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPamela stepped into an elevator, and was pleased to see that it was empty. Taking advantage of this, she happily resumed fondling you as she stroked your member. The unexpected sensation of the blonde\u2019s giant index finger greeting your penis again caught you off guard as it brushed along its length, eliciting a shocked, muffled gasp from you. Your reaction caused Pamela to blush again, her heart fluttering with happiness that this handsome little man found her so attractive! Sure, he was quite a bit younger than her, but something about this arrangement just felt so... right. Overcome with joy and infatuation, the southern belle began a happy little dance in the elevator, shaking her hips as she continued to touch you. You bounced rhythmically with her boobs as the swell of her hips swayed side-to-side, causing her round, voluptuous rump to bounce around with glee. \u201cI\u2019m really glad you\u2019re enjoying yourself, Hunter! This worked out perfectly! We\u2019ll have plenty of time to practice your CPR once I kiss you all over! Muah muah muah muah muah!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now your senses were in complete overload. Your body was screaming for release as Pamela got more and more lost in her efforts to please you, the rate and pressure of her touches increasing as she seemingly tried to work you to a crescendo. Stubbornly you held on, feeling as if it would all be over if you gave her the satisfaction of watching you climax. With your blood either rushing to your member or pooling in your head, it was hard to remain conscious as the flesh around you continued to jiggle and heave, and playful fingers stroked at every bit of you they could reach, alternating between soft tickles and light tugs. The lingering thought of what it would be like to be in this same position with Michelle was doing nothing to calm your stiff erection, something you knew would only drive Pamela on harder, but you found it impossible to fight off. As your mind began to drift between utter bliss and the yawning chasm of unconsciousness you couldn\u2019t help but wonder distantly what Avery was up to. Has she noticed your absence yet? Was she on her way back to beach to look for you? And what kind of fun might you be having right now if you\u2019d managed to make it to that party?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Avery was far and away from the beach at this point, still driving in her car singing along to the pop radio station. She was about halfway to Sandra\u2019s house by now, the bubbly beauty was really excited to get to that party to hang out with all of her friends, plus her cute roomie! Her ditziness won over as she totally forgot that the reason she stayed behind with you in the first place was to give you a ride to the party once you were done working. She entered the on-ramp to the freeway and stepped on the gas as she sped away, unknowingly leaving you to your fate while she headed off for a night of fun with the girls...</span></div></div>",

Your admirer stepped out of the elevator and began the stroll down the hallway towards her room. With no knowledge of the party you were missing, she happily assumed that you were having the time of your life right now, giving your member a couple more strokes as she smacked her lips a few more times. \u201cY\u2019know Hunter, I can\u2019t remember the last time I\u2019ve had this much fun with a man! You certainly are a special little cutie.\u201d Feeling a little adventurous and spurred on by your seeming appreciation, she gave you a slightly harder squeeze, not enough to be truly painful, but definitely enough to get your attention. \u201cI\u2019m in town for a few more days... so I think I\u2019ll just have to keep you until the end of my stay here!\u201d Pamela had butterflies in her stomach as she sweetened the deal. \u201cOr... maybe I really should take you back with me to good old Nashville!!

You can just move in with me, so you wouldn\u2019t even need this job anymore! And I promise <i>I</i> will never leave you behind or let you out of my sight! Doesn\u2019t that just sound delightful? What do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cOh man, she can\u2019t actually be serious about that...right?\u201d</i> You thought while shivering at Pamela\u2019s words. <i>\u201cOh no no no no no!\u201d</i> The blonde knew you couldn\u2019t actually answer buried face-first between her breasts, but that was fine, since she was just joking around about her proposal. Being a single woman at her age can be lonesome at times, so it was a nice thought, a really nice thought, but she couldn\u2019t just take a tiny halfway across the country on a whim... However, that doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t still keep you while she\u2019s a guest here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonally, you wished you could know whether she was joking or not about Nashville. You\u2019d thought it was probably a joke the first time, but now you weren\u2019t so sure. Given the incorrect assumptions she was certainly drawing from your uncontrollable erection, she might very well have felt you wanted to go home to Tennessee with her, even if nothing could be further from the truth. Her continual flirting and air kisses weren\u2019t helping your confidence, but it was hard to struggle or even contemplate escape as the stimulation of your manhood continued. Intense pleasure mixed into every throb and the movements you were able to make were mostly just pushing your member further into the blonde\u2019s probing fingers, which only encouraged more touching as she giggled suggestively in adoration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost hopeless at this point, you\u2019re completely naked, trapped with a giant woman who seems intent on keeping you for at least the foreseeable future, and to top it all off, no one else has any idea where you are. You wondered how Brigitte was going to react if you stop showing up for work, even if Pamela only plans on keeping you while she\u2019s in town, you\u2019ll still miss your next few shifts. Brigitte might assume you just quit and hire someone else to replace you instead. The likelihood of this scenario made your heart sink. Even with Pamela seemingly unaware that her plans potentially put your job in jeopardy, you tried not to direct any frustration towards the blonde. Despite her frequent misunderstandings she actually seemed really kind and down-to-earth, she probably just wants someone to keep her company. Plus, you had to admit... she was pretty hot. However, she just wasn\u2019t what you were looking for right now. And besides, she was almost twice your age! This was not the way you wanted your first time with a real woman to go! Thoughts of spending the next several days (or longer) getting kissed, cuddled, and played with by this giant woman filled you with dread. Every step she took towards her room made it closer to becoming a reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPamela happily strolled along, her butt still swaying back and forth as she traversed the halls. She turned a corner and saw the door to her room come into view! \u201cWe\u2019re almost there, Hunter!\u201d Pamela cheerfully declared as she continued to tease your penis with tantalizing tickles. The buildup brewing between your legs was getting harder to contain as your penis started to twitch uncontrollably. \u201cOooooo! Oh my word...\u201d the southern belle cooed in fascination, smiling to herself as she observed your flailing appendage, thinking that you must be in absolute heaven at this point. Clenching every muscle you could, you managed to fight off the urge to cum for now, but still found yourself teetering on the edge. Suddenly, you felt the flesh around you cease in movement. Pamela put out her hand, using her wristband to unlock the door to her room. Your stomach churned as you heard the lock on the door beep in confirmation as it unlocked. <i>\u201cOh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!!!\u201d</i> you thought to yourself as you squirmed and frantically kicked your legs, desperate for some sort of last second escape!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\ud83c\udfb6 Here we aaaaare! \ud83c\udfb6\u201d the southern woman sang, giggling at you as she opened the door, stepping into the room before shutting it behind her. The sensor locked the door again with a \u201cclick\u201d upon it shutting, trapping you in Pamela\u2019s room and sealing your fate...</span></div></div>",

However, unlike a moment ago, he wasn\u2019t in front of her. She turned around and looked behind her and still couldn\u2019t spot you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Pamela, when she breached out of the water her busty chest gobbled you up, and you once again found yourself trapped within the familiar cavern of your giant admirer\u2019s cleavage. Your entire body was buried between her gorgeous globes that pinned you together, making any escape impossible as you couldn\u2019t move a muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde\u2019s momentary confusion turned to apprehension as she couldn\u2019t seem to locate you anywhere. \u201cHunter? Where are you at, sweetie?\u201d Pamela softly called as she continued to wade through the water, scanning the surface for any sign of you. \u201cOh... I hope he\u2019s okay..\u201d She started to feel terrible that she lost the cute little guy who was so passionate about keeping the beachgoers safe and sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the southern woman waded about in the waist-deep water, her curvy body made sudden turns and rotations as she searched for you. These movements caused her boobies to quiver and jiggle, causing you to bounce in a nauseating rhythm with them. As you pondered your predicament, you took some comfort in realizing that with Pamela not knowing your whereabouts, you were able to avoid her affections... at least for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite that, you felt slightly sorry for Pamela; she truly seemed like a kindhearted woman who cared about your well-being. Plus... even though she was almost twice your age, you had to admit she was pretty hot. She just wasn\u2019t really within your target demographic though, and you wished she was slightly more self-aware of how her flirtatious advances must feel from your perspective as a tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPamela paused her search for a moment to gather her thoughts and assess the situation; she knew you couldn\u2019t have gone far and must still be in the pool somewhere... she wondered for a moment if you were hiding underwater in an attempt to play \u201chide-and-seek.\u201d However she quickly realized that it\u2019s been several minutes and that you would have needed to come up for air at some point, it was a still a possibility though. Or maybe you got splashed out of the pool when she burst out of the water earlier? Pamela contemplated her next move for several minutes before finally coming to a decision.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Given your tiny size, you'd dodged your fair share of giant feet in your life, though running on sand certainly made it harder. As soon as her shadow passed over your body, you dived forward with everything you had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crash of her foot hitting the sand right next to you rattled your eardrums, but that's all. With another bounding step she was gone, leaving you watching her bouncing ass as she strode to the volleyball court. Still, the volleyball girls were far too busy to try and talk to, and they didn't seem to need any help. With a sigh, you continued down the beach, keeping an eye out for those in need of assistance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, you came to a giant brunette woman laying on her stomach on a beach towel. She looked about your age. Her bronzed skin contrasted sharply with the hot pink color of her bikini. Her bikini bottoms at least seemed to have their work cut out for them, barely containing her large rump. You walked up in front of her face, though her dark brown eyes seemed distracted by her cell phone at the moment, and she didn't see you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello miss, can I be of any assistance?\" You asked, trying to sound more confident than you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess looked up from her cell phone, surprised by your voice. When she saw your tiny body standing in front of her, hands on your hips, she couldn't help but giggle. \"And who might you be little guy?\" She asked, putting her phone down on the towel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Hunter, and I'm a newly hired lifeguard.\" This seemed to be going well so far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Hunter, my name is Dana, and you caught me at a perfect time. I do have a bit of a situation and I could really use some help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Whatever you need!\" You were thrilled that you found someone who needed your help, and couldn't accept fast enough. Your job was on the line after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! I'm so glad, it's very lucky you came along. You're the perfect size for what I have in mind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a little caught off guard by that. Your tiny size usually caused problems for you, so it was pretty surprising that she thought it would actually help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? What exactly do you need?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana smiled and reached down and picked you up off the sand, bringing you towards her face. She smiled as she whispered her answer to you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. \"I've got a bunch of sand in my ass and it's driving my crazy, I was hoping you could handle it.\" Dana lays on her stomach and slides you into her bikini bottom, demanding that you clean all the sand out of her butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. \"It's too hot today, I could use a sweat rag for my tits.\" Before you can object, she smushes you flat and uses you to mop the sweat off of her breasts before tossing you aside and returning to tanning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. \"I'm starving, and I think you'll hit the spot.\" Dana shoves you into her mouth and starts to chew on your gummy body. Will Quinn notice?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">(Inspired by and set in the world of A Shrunken College Student - <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2178043-A-Shrunken-College-Student\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2178043-A-Shrunken-Colleg...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Backstory (written by Hectic)</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot has changed in the past 25 years since the great shrinking epidemic swept across the world. In an event that some called a medical mystery and others called an act of god, a type of shrinking virus spread to every corner of the earth, affecting part of the population while leaving another part completely fine. Those who fell victim to this virus rapidly shrunk down to one inch tall, but at the same time gained a strange durability and malleability that has baffled scientists and doctors alike. However, the tiny people were not ones to complain about these newfound characteristics, as they were the only things preventing their lives from being taken by a stray step or anything else of that nature. The third most interesting aspect about this inexplicable shrinking is the fact that only men seem to have suffered from it, with women across the world remaining completely unaffected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the first day of the shrinking event it was expected that society would change drastically, and while it definitely did, surprisingly much of it remained the same. There was no evil women\u2019s takeover or forced servitude of the now smaller men. For the most part, many men who had a job that did not require physical labor of any kind were able to continue living somewhat normal lives. Certain laws were put into place which prevented too much malicious behavior from befalling the tiny men, but these were really only enforced when a woman would purposefully try to kill, kidnap, or otherwise torture them. The vast majority of the time women would get away with any accidents between them and the tiny guys with a small slap on the wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Your Story</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been 25 years since the shrinking pandemic, and the world has fallen into a pretty standard cycle once more. People have (more-or-less) adapted to the drastic changes in daily life, and the abnormal has become routine. You were born tiny, and have lived your whole life at the measly size of one inch. Life's been rough sometimes, but you're still alive and kicking. You've just graduated from Wentworth University after four years of college life, and have no idea what to do next. Searching for a cheap apartment online, you found a spacious offering in a suburban community called \"Sanderson\", with a deal to spilt the rent four ways, with three other people. Agreeing to these awesome terms, you got caught up in your excitement and forgot to click the <i>\"Apartments for Tinies Only\"</i> button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Main Characters</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Hunter Woods (You)</u> - The main character, and 21 years old. You have tanned skin, and are decently muscular due to how often you find yourself climbing/lifting things. You've got a head of sandy brown hair and similarly brown eyes, and you tend to consider yourself fairly attractive. You're good at a lot of things, but never settled on a specific career path and instead went with a basic degree in Communications (how clich\u00e9). You tend to be pretty outgoing and extroverted, which can get you into trouble from time to time. You aren't sure of what your future holds for you, but you're open to all possibilities. You can also be slightly perverted, but not in a truly creepy way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Morgan Sinclair </u>- One of your new roommates, and 22 years old. She has dark tanned skin, long and wavy chocolate brown hair worn straight down, and hazel eyes. She stands at 6'0\", and her presence can be a bit intimidating due to her height and her toned, decently muscular body. This, however, is a complete disservice to her personality. Morgan is energetic, friendly, compassionate, and has a good sense of humor. She's willing to help out anyone in need, at any time. She just so happens to also love exercising and playing sports, which has lent itself to her tanned skin and toned physique. It's hard to ignore her physical charms too, as her sizable, firm curves are incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan has just landed a job as an employee at the local gym, \"Workout World\", where she is assigned to help patrons in need, clean up used equipment and the like, and occasionally teach weekly yoga classes. In her spare time, Morgan exercises constantly, and has joined up with the Sanderson community basketball team that plays matches down at the local park. She makes friends easily, and isn't above teasing those closest to her. People can always turn to her for camaraderie and support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Avery Sinclair </u>- One of your new roommates, and 22 years old. She is Morgan's twin sister, though the similarities mostly stop there. While she has the same dark tanned skin tone, her hair is dyed with streaks of bright pink, and often worn in a ponytail. She's a fair bit shorter, standing at 5'8\", though still miles taller than someone like you. Avery possesses Morgan's positive traits, but dialed up to eleven. She's extremely happy-go-lucky, bouncy, and carefree. Prone to fits of laughter and huge smiles, Avery brightens the day of everyone she comes into contact with. She's blessed with the same bountiful body as Morgan, but due to a little less exercise, her curvy chest and butt are a bit heftier and jigglier than her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery recently scored a well-paying gig as a model at a local photo agency, \"Starlight Studios\", which has always been a dream of hers. Smiling for the camera while clad in some of the most scandalous and revealing outfits imaginable is nothing to a girl with so much body positivity. This confidence bleeds over into her social life, as Avery can come off as overly affectionate and flirtatious from time-to-time, along with being a bit of a prankster. On top of this, Avery is frequently teased by Morgan for being scatterbrained and oblivious, often at the worst possible times. Avery doesn't let this get her down (and by extension, doesn't try to fix her airheaded tendencies). Heaven forbid someone gives her any alcohol. She is also openly bi-sexual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Quinn Wallace </u>- One of your new roommates, and 23 years old. Quinn has paler, smooth and milky skin in comparison to the Sinclair sisters, and her dark black hair is cut in a short bob, bangs covering one of Quinn's piercing blue eyes. Quinn is a tad shorter than Morgan, standing at 5'10\", and her demeanor frequently turns people off from her. Quinn is soft-spoken and reserved, with a seemingly apathetic attitude towards life. When she does speak, it's usually biting sarcasm. In reality, Quinn just doesn't know how to fully open up and express herself, and doesn't mean to push others away. Ironically, Quinn still draws in so many people wanting to know her, and for a reason completely out of her control: her body. Quinn won the genetic lottery, and is a very curvaceous young woman in all respects. She thinks of herself as \"fat\", but most people would call her \"thicc\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn applied for a job on a whim in an attempt to get outside more often, and was actually hired. As such, she's the newest lifeguard working at \"Sanderson Beach\", tasked with looking over the beach and helping any one in need. She hasn't had to actually rescue anyone yet, and always lathers up with veritable buckets of sunscreen to keep her pale skin safe in the heat of the day. It takes her a long time to open up to other people, and she can be standoffish until she fully trusts someone. She shares some of Avery's obliviousness, but half the time it is because nothing really bothers her enough for her to take notice. If it involves tinies, she'll often treat them in a manner akin to \"tough love\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Minor Characters</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Tracy Woods</u> - Your younger sister by one year, making her 20 years old. She's got your same nicely tanned skin tone and sandy brown hair, though she wears her hair long and braided. She also has the same pleasant brown eye color as you. Compared to most girls that fate cruelly threw you in the path of all during your life, Tracy's always been on the tamer side of things in the looks department. She stands at 5'6\", and possess a lithe and lean build. Her curves are much more subdued than the other giantesses in your life, but Tracy is no less beautiful. Of course, she's your sister, so you never viewed her in any weird way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she's one of your best friends in the present day, Tracy could be a little bit of a menace when she was younger. From the time Tracy was in sixth grade up until around eleventh grade, she grew a nasty persecution complex, wrongfully believing that you more loved and cared about than she was. This perceived mistreatment spiraled into full-on jealousy, and Tracy began going out of her way to treat you in a mean-spirited manner. Sometimes she'd act callously towards you, sometimes she'd pull some mean or degrading pranks on you (frequently involving other family members without their knowledge), but on truly awful days, Tracy could be a nightmare. She's since apologized profusely for her younger days, but whenever you think back on them you shudder. Tracy is currently a photographer and reporter for a local newspaper, with ambitions to reach a higher position one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Helen Woods</u> - Your mother, who has just recently turned 40. Even reaching the mid-point of her life, Helen has not let her age hamper her good looks. Still quite stunning, Helen has your family's shared tanned skin and sandy brown hair, but she styles and crops her hair to frame her face and fall to her shoulders. Her eyes are a piercing blue color, a stark difference from you and your sister. Perhaps most prominently, Helen is a fairly endowed woman in the chest department, and her derriere is similarly developed. She's put on a bit of weight over the years of busy office work, but that weight seems to feed into all the right places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStriking the perfect balance between compassion and punishment, Helen was the dictionary definition of a strict but fair mother. If you or Tracy acted up, she'd mete out due retribution. If you and Tracy were on good behavior, she'd kiss you goodnight and make breakfast for you the next morning. Contrary to what Tracy believed for years, she treated you no differently despite your tiny size, expecting the same effort from you in all your daily endeavors that she would from a normal person. Maintaining a high-paying job as an international correspondent for a famous tech company, Helen was frequently away on business trips during your childhood, leaving you alone and at Tracy's mercy (or sometimes Helen's sister, and your aunt, Norah).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Aunt Norah Woods</u> - Your mother's older sister, who is 42 years old. Norah lived a few hours away from your childhood home, but due to the nature of her job, she worked from home with a comfortable salary. As such, she could drop everything at a moment's notice to babysit you and Tracy whenever your mom left on one of her frequent business trips. Good looks run all throughout the female members in your family, and Norah is no different. She has tanned skin, medium-length hair usually in a bun (and dyed a soft red color), and hazel eyes. She's a fairly curvaceous woman, but she keeps her developed body toned through daily yoga sessions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah's a fun-loving and energetic aunt, but often in a bad way for a tiny like yourself. For one, Norah never considers the consequences of her actions. If Norah accidentally squishes you, you'll get a sheepish wince and a quick apology from her, and then Norah will forget all about the incident entirely. It's like she has a hard time realizing how difficult daily trials are for a tiny like yourself. She also barely punished Tracy for bullying you back in the day, if Norah happens to notice at all. Notoriously airheaded and frequently forgetful, Norah was Tracy's favorite target to humiliate and torment you with in the past. Norah's job as a tiny recruiter didn't help either. Paid a sizable salary for finding willing tinies for occasionally unsavory jobs, Norah's earnest attitude had a way of roping you into some dangerous jobs on last minute notices. You love her as family, but she's a handful when she's around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Kathryne \"Kat\" Woods</u> - Your cousin, the adopted daughter of Norah, and is 24 years old. When Norah herself was 24, jealousy of her younger sister Helen's two kids drove her to adopt her own child, which ended up being 6 year old Kat. Kat is Mixed Caucasian/Hispanic, with silky dark-brown hair almost always in an immaculate ponytail, smooth deeply tanned skin, and rich hazel eyes. She stands at 5'10\", and strikes a gorgeous and stunningly beautiful physique. Slimmer and more subdued than other giantesses that life throws your way, Kat is none-the-less a supermodel in terms of appearance. A modest, perky bust, cute and firm butt, and alluringly long legs frequently draw eyes. Kat knows she's beautiful, and dresses to impress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn point of fact, Kat is essentially the perfect package, and she knows full well that she's hot stuff. Alongside her stunning looks is her impeccable intellect. After achieving valedictorian status in high school, Kat headed off across the country to attend college and study for a PhD in physics. Her attitude, however, is where Kat falters. Pampered by Norah for being an only child, blessed by the genetic lottery, and possessing high IQ all contributed to her developing a superiority complex. She believes herself better than anyone else, and the only person she truly expresses genuine love to is Norah. At the same time, Kat hides this from others, and puts up a front of being a flawless and almost angelic girl. She's treated you like dirt since the moment you met her, but not out of sadism or malice. She just finds your squishy, helpless nature the perfect cure to her unending boredom. At the start of this story, you haven't seen her in four years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Becky Wallace</u> - Quinn's mother, and a 42 year old woman. One look at Becky, either in person or through a photograph, is enough to clue anybody into where Quinn got her impressive curves from. Somehow, Becky is even thicker and more developed than her daughter, sporting an hourglass body women around the world would kill for. She has black hair, like her daughter, but she keeps hers long and cascading down her back. She has fair, milky smooth skin and blue eyes. Her measurements are off the charts in all departments, from her perfectly perky chest to her prodigious posterior. She's seemingly oblivious to her overflowing sex appeal, and is blissfully unaware of what people mean when they refer to her as a \"milf\" on her social media comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowards Quinn, Becky is as motherly as anyone ever has been before. Devoted and doting to a fault, Becky can come across as clingy due to how lovingly she treats Quinn (who she refers to as her \"sweet angel\" and \"Quinnie\"). Becky is a fun-loving gal always willing to try new things and spoil her only child. However, add a tiny to the equation, and Becky's personality 180s. Whereas she treats all girls (and normal sized guys) with respect, she possess a monumental loathing for tinies. Distasteful of them, she finds tinies nothing more than pests at best, and gross bugs at worst. She won't hesitate to do what she has to do to take care of any tinies she's deemed a nuisance. This includes removing all tinies from contact with her daughter, as she believes them to be beneath her and unworthy of associating with normal people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Lilyana and Mariah Sinclair</u> - The mothers of Morgan and Avery, a lovingly bi-sexual couple, and both 40 years of age. They both have a habit of being filled with optimism and energy, brightening up any situation with their happiness. The couple met in high school, and dated for a few years before marrying. Lilyana was a Russian exchange student, and she still possesses a slight, adorable accent. Her skin is nearly porcelain white and silky smooth, and her blonde hair is so bright its practically sheer white in color. She has an elegant appearance, less curvaceous than other women, but tall and shapely, like a fashion model. Mariah is half-Hispanic, and has the chocolate brown hair that was passed onto their twins (to clarify, Mariah is the one who gave birth to the twins after utilizing a sperm donor). Mariah has a good deal more weight on her than Lilyana, but in all the right places. She frequently draws eyes with her hourglass figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilyana is a professional celebration organizer, or \"party planner\". She knows how to have a good time, and knows how to help others do the same. Not a week passes by where she isn't helping to set up birthday parties, bachelorette hangouts, and extravagant weddings. Mariah is the proud owner of a small local burger restaurant called \"Sinclair Sandwiches\". It isn't much, but it turns a profit. Mariah spends most of her time as the head chef in the kitchen, whipping up delicious meals to her valued customers (and sampling quite a bit of the food herself). The two women are as in love with each other as the day they first began dating, and they flirt incessantly. Lilyana finds tinies to be curious and fascinating, and Mariah thinks tinies are adorable little things that just beg to be played with. Though they aren't meanspirited by any stretch of the imagination, neither woman truly views tinies as real human beings, but more like cute pets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>More to be added in the future!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Quick Rules</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story is written in second person (you, your, etc.) Please keep it that way. However, if you want to write a bit from someone else's perspective, third person can work for that when needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter cannot die. He can only be squished, squashed, flattened, stretched, and anything else you think of. He will reform in time, given the chance to do so. Keep the story going!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry not to write chapters that are exceptionally short. A bridge chapter from time to time is just fine, but too many and the story starts feeling weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, avoid heavily sexual/insertion content and any giant male content. Basically, just don't introduce any other guys into the story, UNLESS they too are tiny. That could be interesting (just make sure Hunter is always the main character). Everything else goes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRead, add, and enjoy!</td>",
