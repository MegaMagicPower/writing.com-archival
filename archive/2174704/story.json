You did hear about it of course, maybe you were a high schooler at the time, finding it while you searched for porn. Maybe you were an expert in the field when you came cross it in a paper one day. Maybe a coworker told you about it some time. Maybe you heard about it from the crazy lady in the back of the room with tentacles for arms. Maybe you were just briefed on before the business you work for is going to send you there. How you heard about it hardly matters. The real question is why. What drives you to go to such a bizarre alien world. Why do you have access to this strange planet, how did you get past the quarantine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you a researcher, looking to collect samples to study, and possibly sneak off planet. Maybe you work for the Empire, or maybe for one of the many galactic spanning mega corporations, either way you are here to learn about the strange planet blow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps your from the U.E.E. military, on a mission on the planets surface. The Rouge Sector in close proximity means you could be trying to remove an enemy instillation on the planet that got past the quarantine. You might be chasing a dangerous fugitive that slipped by the quarantine system. You might be leading a team to try to build a base in the name of the Empire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course where there is a planet there is profit to be had. You might be interested in the precious metals and gemstones the planet is famous for. You could be sent there by a corporation for the usual gold and silver, or maybe they are looking for something more exotic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, you might just be a curious average Joe that applied for a pass to go there. Your boring life could use a change, and you'll certainly find it here. Now and then the Empire will approve a visiting pass to the planet. Its not a comfortable trip, but they let you go and do as you please for the most part. It certainly wan't free though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again... who said you got a pass at all. </span></div></div>",

Whether it be independent research, government funded organizations, or for corporate gain, experts often find themselves drawn to this planet where the impossible lies behind every corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you Lance Palrmer, the young 21 year old Climatologist assistant. Your have come down to this planet with a full team of experts that you hope to learn from, even though your still getting used to swallowing your pride around the experts. You grew up as colonial nobility, youngest son in the Trethewey family, with no pressure to carry on the family business and all the money to explore your passions. You'll be investigating the mysterious Velvet Oasis, situated in the middle of the Malevolent Flatlands, the hottest desert on the planet. The Oasis seems to exist consistently at below freezing temperatures for no known reason. You are a 178 cm (5'10\") a Your skin has a natural tan, and you have black hair in a crew cut, with a matching well groomed pencil mustache. You have a tattoo, your first, on your right arm, a 3 eyed alien skull surrounded in blue flames, and you have plans for more in the future<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you Renee Rivera, the biotechnological prodigy at 27 years old. You work for the prolific Houndsun corporation, and are trying to become head of the biotech companies research and development. When the company asks for volunteers to study the organisms of the Hamplants River on TF-J3FF, you are the only one that jumps on the opportunity. Your 163 cm (5'4\") tall. Your body is a temple and you intend to squeeze every year out of it. You have dark skin, and are naturally bald, but your smooth head and square jaw combined with your trained body makes you an imposing man all the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you Cynthia Paterson, 43 years old respected exo-paleontologist. You've raised enough money to take a small group of scientists to the planet's surface to try to learn about the history of life on the planet, your search is starting in the shale deposits on the edge of the modern day Tortoise Swamp. Your a sturdy woman woman, standing at 168 cm (5'6\"), your overweight. Most of your weight is in your hips, but you also have your share of muscle and fat, and sport a comfortable B cup.

You are heading to this planet to examine a race of reptilian humanoids that live at the base of The Moaning Mountain, an active volcano. You suspect they may be not only intelligent but truly sapient. You were 180 cm (5'11\") and the automated systems of your life support suit are barely able to maintain though you are frail. your suit covers that nicely, making you stand at nearly 214 cm (7ft) tall and weighs a monstrous 137 kg (302 lb) empty. The armored exoskeleton has everything you need to live, and cannot be removed without severe repercussions, meaning you've been put under every time its been removed. you haven't seen your true body in decades.

Some function more like law enforcement in this vast empire, others were trained for the front lines of war whether it be against the Rogue Sector, or the rare hostile alien race. Often they provide escorts to sensitive materials and play on the defensive side, fighting against rebels and anarchists. Due to planet TF-J3FF's critical strategic position, there is almost always military in and around the planet, at least maintaining and enforcing the quarantine zone. So who are you and what is your mission Soldier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you the rookie, Private Second Class Mack O'Brien, age 18, having enlisted young to get out of what he saw as boring farm life. you have proven your self something of a savant taking to military life like a fish to water, working your way through basic training, and through more advanced training to become a private second class in the UEE Space Marine Corps, and wound up placed in the Sunn AO-75 company. You were destined to wind up in over your head, as your first mission was to clear out a Rouge Sector encampment set up in the perilous Chahead Abyss on TF-J3FF. You stand 175 cm (5'9\"). Your a blonde man with deep set eyes, but an over all soft look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you second Lieutenant Elsie Mueller, age 25, and A pilot in the UEE Containment Unit. Your job is to enforce the quarantine zone around the planet and to intercept, and if need be chase down those who break it and bring them to justice. Your something a dare devil pilot and you love your patrol craft, a modified Torricelli R-3. Mere moments ago some hotshot zipped past you, ignoring your hails  and the quarantine warning, so you are about to get in your Torricelli and pursue him to the planet's surface. It seems the mystery ship is headed for the blistering The Efreet Plains along its equator. She is about 163 (5'4\") tall, with a C cup breasts. She has curly brown hair and a distinct accent that gives away her childhood in Scandinavia on Earth. She is also missing her left pinky, but has a prosthetic glove to give her a temporary mechanical digit to keep her grip up to standard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you Captain Bernadette Thomson, age 29 of the UEE Mechanizer Division. The Mechanizer Division is in charge of the UEE's extensive library of fast deploy machines (FDM), and are tasked with deploying armor, beacons, communication lines, modular aircraft, and, most importantly, rapid base building. A well trained Mechanizer can create a defensive perimeter in moments, and a fully functional military base in days though the proper application of fast deploy machines. And that is your job. You have been tasked with taking a ship load of FDM to build a base on the Mountain of Remains, what seems to have once been a a town of some long lost civilization. As much as it angers exo-archaeologists this base was paramount for the UEE, and the civilized galaxy depends on this outpost. Your confident that you can set up your machines in a way that won't damage cite though. You stand at 150 cm (4'11\"). Your body is all hips and legs with a petite A cup. You have a rich tan skin, almost a golden tone, with short, nearly dark brown hair. While not under direct supervision you do like to wear civilian clothing, especially when working alone on a distant planet. You've only been caught once and you had a serious write up for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you Major Jessie 'Scrapyard' Davies. At the age of 65, you have seen more combat than most soldiers will ever see. You fought against the Menops in the hive wars of 22X2 and lost most your right arm in a struggle for your life. In that moment you felt more alive than you had ever felt before, and when they went to replace it you asked for upgrades across your body. No one asked you to become a super soldier, you volunteered, one lost body part at a time. The sensation of super human superiority brought you to life, and ever sense you seek to prove your mettle and metal in combat. You are the leader of the infamous ZF-0 company of UEE Space Marines, known for being the best of the best. Your mechanized body is unique in the entire army, with all limbs replaced by super human mechanized replacements as well as your right eye giving you an extended visible spectrum activate automated systems with your vision alone. Your gear is also custom, giving you access to some of the most powerful weapons imaginable. Your mission is to search Crimson Station on Phoenix Island. A research team working for the UEE on top secret projects on TF-J3FF have stopped reporting in, and with Rogue Sector activity on the rise they assume the worst. Save who you can, destroy what you can't, what they were working on mustn't fall into the Rogue Sector's hands.You're a man that stands at 180 cm (5'10\") and your metal limbs bring your weight up to 146 kg (322 lb) and requires a specialized suit to keep them from tearing you apart. you also have far lighter limbs for general usage, but you only use them when absolutely necessary. You have dark skin and your grey hair betrays your age, but aside from that you have never felt stronger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Missions on the transformation planet are not uncommon, and you could be some one else. </span></div></div>",

Orbital scans have detected traces of what could be the extremely rare and valuable substance known as Pruotrium used in hyper light and durable alloys since its discovery in 21XX.

You stand at 168 cm (5'6\") tall, and your body is beginning to weaken, your tortured body ready to retire from the frankly unethical conditions its been put through for your company. Your already missing a leg, it replaced with a cheep cybernetic one that has a bad habit of freezing and sending back pain. Your skin is bruised and weather beaten, tanned by alien suns, and you keep your head shaved, cause you can't bear the thought to see your brown hair turned grey. You secretly hope something terrible happens to you on this trip, and you can't return to Sunware. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you Lorraine Ryan, age 22. Tasked by the United Earth Empire to bring back core samples from Ellispond Canyon, you have a ship equipped with a high grade mining laser that should be able to do the job. UEE contracts are rare and the fact they are being so secretive as to what they are looking for... means you might be able to squeeze a little more cash out of them. Your 173 cm (5'8\") with long brown hair in braids, caramel color skin, and perky C cup breasts.

Now the real question is, who are you, and where are you going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you Martin Mendoza. 20 years old, born and raised on the nearby Eterna Base, a space station in the same sector as the mythic planet. Though you work as a laborer for the mech mega corporation Wolf Industries, your real love is of archaeology. You will likely never be able to afford to go to school, but when your estranged grandfather passed away he had just gotten a pass to TF-J3FF you see opportunity where all of his other family see adversity. You decide to take the opportunity to visit the Amrey Bluffs, a cliff face you remember reading showed some evidence of a long dead alien civilization. Yes it was on a planet you had heard nothing but bad news from, but you'd never get this chance again. Your an earth male, with groomed brown hair, chiseled, hard features, leading to a serious but handsome face. Your body is toned from hard labor, and your left hand has been replaced by Wolf industries after the original one was mangled in an industrial accident. Its capabilities were only a little beyond a normal hand, but you've grown to enjoy it. Your 180 cm (5'11\") and ripped with muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you Toby Johnson the 18 year soon to be adventurer extraordinaire. From a young age you decided that the laborer's life was not the one for you, so from the day you were old enough to write your name, you applied for a pass to visit the mysterious transformation planet while you were much to young to consider the consequences. Even as you grew older and learned what it could mean you were determined to escape your home and family to find worlds unknown. It all comes together as you get your pass the same day your savings bonds set up by your grandparents mature. You plan to go to one of the most hostile environments on the planet, the White Fields, an alabaster desert that spans miles. Aside from satellite maps, no one had really explored the harsh region, believing it to be a wasteland of no value and no life, but to you, its just the place to start your adventuring career. Toby comes from the slums of earth. your skin is a mocha tone, covered in scars where hard earth life has challenged you. Your a female with a modest figure; petite breasts and slim hips, you find you can pass yourself off as a short man with the right wardrobe. You have black curly hair and green eyes and you stand at 163 cm (5'4\") <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you Adam Carter, age 19, a proud patriot human from the Martian Capitol of Cydonia Prime. You have been enrolled in the prestigious Muskatron university and are perusing a history major with a focus on Mars's human history, from its first settlers to its modern day prosperity. You fancy yourself a renaissance man though, having learned how to hunt, becoming a proficient marksman with your side arm of choice, and have taken up a love of painting. You applied for a pass a while ago after you heard of the Hillrial Forest, a forest with living trees of stone, with leaves like stained glass. It had always been described as an beautiful place, but you had never seen a picture. With your love of painting, and ability to defend yourself, a brief visit to this exotic world to paint a glorious picture is an opportunity you had to shoot for. Your not the fastest or strongest man your age, but you keep up. Male, with fair skin, blonde straight hair, and piercing blue eyes, you look like the average human martian. Your slightly chubby, standing around 173 cm (5'8\")<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you Hoang Martin, age 38, and nearly life long employee of Antler Limited. Recently you've gone back to school to become a biologist, luckily on Antler Limited's dime. You have gone from exotic planet to exotic planet to catalog exotic life forms, and now that you'll be working in the lab you miss the old days of going planet hopping. You applied for a pass for old times sake, to go to a new exotic world and take pictures of new exotic wild life. You have an interested in the Applebo Prairie, a remarkably bio-diverse grassland even by TF-J3FF standards. You've heard of the dangers but, frankly, you couldn't give a damn, you were determined to enjoy yourself. Your a 168 cm (5'6\") woman. Your blessed with a cute round face, a soft slightly tanned complexion, average curves with a C cup breast, wavy black hair, and distinct purple eyes. You seem a little exotic just about anywhere you go and you travel a lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you could be some one completely different. </span></div></div>",

Your ship is just as legendary as you, an old cargo frigate refitted to become the the dreaded 'Gravity Behemoth' named after your weaponized artificial gravity generators that dot the outside of the vessel to effectively grapple your targets and redirect munitions. Your ship was untouchable until mere moments ago, when you were baited into battle just above the quarantine zone in what is officially Operation Endless Night, but historians will remember it as 'Hand Grenades Last Stand'. You don't know that, and after you survive an attack from a devastating new Imperial weapon, your forced onto the planet below to effect repairs on the Gravity Behemoth. Forced to chose a location fast you aim for Black Water Enclave, a strange island with a great big crater filled with an odd substance that emits high levels of radiation that should shield your ship from detection,though it will likely be hazardous to your health, but between death by radiation, and losing to some Empire weapon, you'd rather choke on your own blood than give them the glory. Your 180 cm (5'11\") and built like a truck, though you have to keep jamming needles in your arm to keep your strength up. A side effect of being constantly pumped full of performance enhancing drugs is your face looks like death. Your dark skin is pulled tight over your skull, and your eyes have turned completely grey, though your eyes still function, but only when your doped up, and hair is but a distant memory, being one of the first things to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you could be here for some other reason</span></div></div>",

Your leaking fuel, you crew is dying, and in these final moments you think of your survival. After all you are the legendary Herbert 'Hand Grenade' Davies. You rise from your captains chair as your ship rocks as its peppered with smaller munitions, exploiting the hole that was made in your anti missile gravity defenses. You turn to your first mate, Renzo Augusta, a wiry pale young man with greasy black hair, but two inches shorter than you, but in personality you tower over this welp. \"Renzo, seal all effected decks off. The men are as good as dead.\" Your thinking fast. Whatever had hit you hadn't been nearly as effected by your anti missile defense as usual. An energy weapon? One capable of doing that much damage in a single shot would take a while to cool. Your First mate sighs as he begins to seal the decks, dooming the men to their fate. You pace along your bridge, the floor made of view screens letting you see all around your ship at once. You pace for a few moments. Time was short, options were limited. You pause as one of the view screens  shows the planet below. To retreat would be bad for morale... but there is no recovery from death. \"Renzo, plot a course into the planets atmosphere. I estimate we have mere minutes before whatever that dreadnought fired at us is is ready for a second shot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenzo hesitates. \"You... you intend to leave the battle? We have our forward guns loaded, we could about face and unleash-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A grand last stand? for what? We land, we make repairs, and we prepare for a second match.\" you say as you scratch at your scruff. a shaky hand reaches for a syringe. You jab yourself to keep your dose going as you think. \"The atmosphere will warp any energy weaponry coming at us. Look for areas with high gamma wave radiation to disguise our ships engines.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour tactical officer is already scanning as your ship screens change color as it scans for gamma radiation. you gesture with the toe of your boot to an area that sticks out. Your tactical officer informs you, \"Black Waters Enclave. Its more than just gamma rays that are pouring out of that... crater. I don't know if our shielding will protect us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give him an icy look, \"then we'll have to effect rapid repairs.\" you sit down and pull an inter com microphone around to your face. \"All hands, this is your captain, brace for reentry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenzo stands in front of you. \"Captain! I employer you! we can't just run with our tail tucked between our legs. We must retaliate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ponder this... Leaving now would ensure that you would have less to repair and more material to repair it with. However... the top side of your ship still had its weaponized gravity generators. if you maneuver it right you might be able to drag this new vessel down with you. Your damage would be far more severe with the kind of strain it would put on your ship, you were trying to grapple a dreadnought with a heavy frigate after all, but a dreadnought would be torn apart in reentry. It would be a glorious act of defiance, even if it does set you back. </span></div></div>",

Either way your in for a shock when you get off here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you Ralph Simpson, the runaway from the nearby NJ-55 space station. You've been running for a few years now after a fight with your step father. Today would have been your 18th birthday as you hop aboard some kind of space military vessel. You learned a trick where you can hide in the maintenance passages if you bring your own food and oxygen. You couldn't carry much but hopefully they would stop a planet where you could restock. It turns out this ship is a military escort to lead civilians with passes down to the transformation planet, this one in particular is headed to Mount Mayree, a volcano on the coast of the Scarmis Sea.

But your not as young as you used to be at 48, so you were looking to get out after one more job. Having conned your way across the known galaxy your final big con job was out in the rogue sector. This one was going to be legendary as you scam the entire Enigma Council... and it almost went well. You got their money into your protected account, and you got off the planet and even back into Empire space by sneaking aboard a pirate space ship.Where it turned sour is just over the boarder they discover you. They toy with different ideas of how to torture you for the pain you caused the Rouge Sector, when they realize they are passing by the infamous Transformation Planet. They drop out of warp, and shoot you at the surface from a small escape pod through a small gap in the quarantine sensor array. Your pod safely lands on a mysterious island. You have no idea where you are, or how you'll get back, but your determined to get off this rock and spend your hard scammed money. At 165 Cm (5'5\") tall you don't cut a naturally imposing figure. Your a bit soft and doughy, as you'd expect with how you'd party after every major job. You have dark skin with big blue eyes, a soft round clean shaven face, and well groomed hair black hair, you look like a sweet old man, but that is all part of the con. You look innocent, but your brain moved a mile a minute and once some one's guard was down you could scam the shirt off their back, drain their accounts, and get them to legally change their name to 'Sucker' before they realize what just happened. Your a fast wit and a social manipulator, which won't do you much good on a lonely island in the middle of some unknown ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you could have a completely different story</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">The planet TF-J3FF was found in 22XX by the Earth Exploration Team. At first they just noted the presence of many rare isotopes and a lush biosphere, capable of supporting life. Also in their initial report it was mentioned that it could hold a fantastic strategic position for the growing United Earth Empire and its colonies, as it existed not far from the Rouge Sector: a group who refuses to accept United Earth rule. Rouge colonies, colonies that act independently from the United Earth Empire aren't uncommon but the Rouge Sector is a conglomeration with enough military might to be a concern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe planet's information was updated in a later survey. There are signs of multiple species of potentially intelligent life on the surface, but it seems that almost everything on its surface has profound mutagen capabilities. Venom and toxins from animals cause a wide variety of transformations, almost always ending in the researcher being altered permanently, barring surgery and/or therapy. The planet was placed on a level 2 quarantine, restrictive enough to stop a causal cruise from stopping by unannounced, but those with official business can easily receive a pass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few years, government funded scientists, corporate research teams, independent prospectors, and clever curious people have made their way to the surface, and brought back strange and exotic species, treasures of precious metals, and stories. Stories of the strange shit they saw, stories of their parties going missing, bit by spiders and turned into horny monsters, fondled by tentacles and dragged into the darkness, lost in transformative swamps of toxic goo and some going mad. It was hard to separate the fact from the fiction, as a tale from one eyed jack was gripping and realistic, but had no groundings in reality, while trustworthy scientific journals detailed flowers that made men into cheerleaders over the course of 24 hours. The planet became myth, legend, and even as the rare surviving members of teams made it back to civilization with world changing samples, whether it be because the sample leads to a scientific breakthrough in gene therapy, or becomes a plague ripping through planetary systems, talks of it are treated often more as folklore than fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you are destined to go on an adventure there. The Transformation Planet holds many secrets, and many more dangers. Few who enter ever leave, and even fewer leave recognizable as who they once were, especially the men. How long can you survive on TF-J3FF, the biosphere of the bizarre, the Transformation Planet?<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\n+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules interactive chapters<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is an interactive story with written with passive reading in mind. As a result I would like to start with a few guidelines. They are not hard and fast rules, but rather pet peeves that may lead to an edit from me in certain contexts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerspective: This story is in 2nd person perspective. The reader is the character in question which means its not 'I opened the door' or 'Jack opened the door' but rather 'You opened the door'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReader's Choice: Reader's Choice is an extremely powerful tool that, in my opinion, should be used sparingly. Many times a reader just wants to follow the story to see where it goes. An option listed as Reader's Choice has nearly limitless potential in the hands of a writer, but tells the reader nothing about the choice they may be selecting in the future. If you feel you must add blank options for another writer making it 'other choices' leaves rooms for more options for the reader, that can now be clearly labeled by another writer that comes across it later. I do understand the appeal of Reader's Choice, but it will likely lead to a later edit from me when some one fills in the readers choice for the option to reflect the direction the story goes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Other' Chains: On the other end, when other option chapters chain into each other it can become frustrating to page through chapter after chapter, especially when you just want to continue the other story. This is especially true when those adding the chapters can only have 2 options, leading to 'the possible choice' and 'other'. If you find yourself in an other chain that is starting to get long in the tooth (lets say 5 others deep) feel free to treat that final other as a 'reader's choice' or if you see it getting that way, it is acceptable to use 'reader's choice'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFetishes: I like to believe Planet Transformation to have a little something for everyone. That being said, I am human and I certainly have my preferences (cough cough TG cough). I would like to keep fetishes involving bodily waste out of this. Planet Transformation is meant to ride the line between campy tongue and cheek fun, and drama from the implications there of. As a result I would like to see minimal depictions of torturous situations (a quick rule of thumb, if the person is screaming in pain, take a full minute consider the tone of the chapter and story line.). Death should also be kept to a minimum, but it is still possible for the main character to die if put in a truly fatal situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEndings: Ending a plot line is fine, but should be considered. A never ending story will never have a satisfying conclusion. If you've taken a plot line out to a point where there are no more interesting decisions to be made, feel free to give it a proper ending. That being said some writers may want to add to your ending and/or still play with the ideas in that particular line. I would suggest making it a soft ending. Instead of having no continuation options, you can leave behind a single continuation option called epilogue. Aside from that please give 2 options at the end of each chapter unless its a true complete ending, or for an epilogue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChapters: Chapters don't need to be massive, or even spectacularly descriptive, especially chapters that serve more as branching out points, but they should be important. They should describe why you the character might think of the options below if there isn't much to describe before making another decision, or they should give some degree of insight, some clue as to what might come ahead. At the same time giving a book for a chapter may be a bit too much. It really is a common sense measurement here. What is important is that the chapter is complete. For example, don't give a plot hook set up as a character enters a room, with the options below being, 'description of the room' 'reader's choice' 'reader's choice'. Commit to your vision for your chapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPictures: Pictures aught to be used sparingly here. A visual aid is fine, but you probably don't need more than one per chapter. Of course there may be specific instances where multiple aides are appropriate, but I'd rather see people flexing their imagery than their imgur. Also a reliance on pictures puts a hard limit on your creative expression. This is a world where just about anything goes, and you could turn the characters into some very exotic beauties. If you need to rely on images, I understand, but consider this a challenge from me to all of you to try to describe the images you find rather than post the picture itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFun: Most importantly the entire setting and concept is to be played with. Its not meant to be taken to seriously. Its a planet with an excuse for some erotic transformation based fun. You can make arcs trying to uncover deeper mysteries, or you could just see how many creative ways you can describe growing boobs you can think of. Whatever floats your boat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuestions: I'm always open to a PM if you have questions, want advice, or you see something strange of off-putting in the story. I intend to keep this story well groomed for everyone to enjoy. </td>",
