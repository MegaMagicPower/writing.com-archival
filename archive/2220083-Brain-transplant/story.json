You see a letter on the table. You open it and it says \u201chello Samuel I\u2019m dr. David and you have been selected to make money by testing out a experimental brain surgery\u201d. You then think to yourself. \u201cI\u2019m tight on cash ever since my mom and dad stopped providing me money so I guess this could help\u201d. You then get into your car you have outside and you drive to the hospital that was on the note. You then get out of your car and go into the hospital. You tell the secretary you wish to see dr. David. She then points to a door on the left and you head that way. You then arrive at dr. David\u2019s office. You talk to him about how you want to do the surgery. You then sign a few papers and he leads you to a back room with a huge book filled with peoples pictures. He tells you to pick who you want to do the brain transplant with. You look through the book. You then tell him you want to have your brain put in?</span></div></div>",
