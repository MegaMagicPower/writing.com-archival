            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ashley Saunders was abruptly woken up by a loud noise somewhere nearby.  Opening her eyes, she reached over and turned on the lamp on the wall above her.  Sitting up in bed she glanced over to see her boyfriend, Jamie Lincoln, asleep in bed next to her.  Jamie had a habit of, much to Ashley\u2019s annoyance, snoring quite loudly \u2013 this time, however, that wasn\u2019t the source of the loud noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing out of bed, she grabbed her robe from a nearby chair and turned to walk towards the door.  She stopped when she heard the rustling of sheets behind her; turning around, she saw Jamie sitting up in bed.  Still half-asleep, he said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard a noise; I\u2019m going to check it out.\u201d Sighing, Ashley said, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back, you go back to sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie lay back down in the bed as Ashley silently walked out of the bedroom.  Seeing that a nearby door was open, she quietly walked down the hall and peaked inside the room Caleb shared with his mother Grace.  A smile crept across her face when she saw Caleb sound asleep in his bed.  They may not be related by blood, but that didn\u2019t stop Ashley from having maternalistic feelings for Caleb.  Because of everything they\u2019d gone through over the past year, it wasn\u2019t a stretch to say the four of them had become a family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only after leaning down to give Caleb a quick forehead kiss that Ashley realized Grace wasn\u2019t in the next bed.  Suddenly the sound of glass clanging together brought Ashley back to reality.  Quickly adjusting Caleb\u2019s covers, Ashley sighed as she left the room \u2013 as a sinking feeling washed over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley followed the sounds into the kitchen area, where she found Grace leaning against the fridge surrounded by an assortment of empty beer bottles.  With her face a mixture of disdain and concern, Ashley knelt in front of Grace and said, \u201cSeriously Grace, you\u2019ve been doing so well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time Grace had drunk herself into a stupor; but it had been several months since the last incident.  While none of them had had it easy over the last year, Grace had taken their situation particularly bad.  \u201cS-Shut u-up, Ash...\u201d slurring her words, Grace said, \u201cI-I\u2019m not in th-the conditio-condition to...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks to me like you\u2019re not in a condition to do anything.\u201d As she went to kick the bottles away, she picked one up and sighed, <br>\r\n\u201cSeriously Grace, you drank an $5000 bottle of scotch by yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d looking at the bottle in Ashley\u2019s hand, Grace said, \u201cFor $5000 that sure tasted like shit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelping Grace to her feet, Ashley said, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get you to the couch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was some stumbling along the way, but eventually Ashley got Grace over to the couch.  Lying on the couch, struggling to cover herself with a blanket, Grace started to tear up a little.  \u201cI-I\u2019m sorry; it\u2019s just th-the last few days have be-been really rough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley could sympathize with what Grace was talking about; in a few days it would be the one-year anniversary of when the world ended.  One year since an asteroid forced Ashley into an underground bunker with Jamie, Grace and 4-year-old Caleb.  \u201cYou think it hasn\u2019t been rough for me and Jamie?\u201d with a heavy sigh, Ashley looked down at Grace and said, \u201cDo you think this is how we imagined our lives would be?  Trapped in an underground bunker for 5 years all because of a 2-mile-wide piece of rock?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about, Ashley.\u201d Turning to look at Ashley, while barely keeping her eyes open, Grace said, \u201cToday would\u2019ve been my 5th wedding anniversary; but then my husband died and left me to raise Caleb by myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley looked off in the distance for a moment, hurt by Grace\u2019s comment about raising Caleb by herself.  By her reckoning, she and Jamie had been quite helpful taking care of him; especially when Grace was in one of her moods like right now.  \u201cYou know what Grace, I don\u2019t...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley stopped speaking once she realized Grace had fallen asleep on the couch.  After adjusting the blanket, she got up and walked over to the nearby railing.  Looking down at the expansive hydroponic garden, she thought back to the events that led to her current situation.</span></div></div>",

Samson\u2019s discovery had been front page news due to being over two miles wide and close enough to Earth to be a potential threat.  The concerns of the astronomical community grew over the next few weeks until they made a devastating discovery \u2013 Samson was going to strike the Earth in July 2020.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile publicly promising to do everything that they could to avert the coming disaster; world leaders were privately discussing ways to ensure the survival of the species.  In the end, it was decided that each nation would build bunkers large enough to hold a select number of survivors.  Due to the limited space in each bunker, they would be filled with the help of a lottery system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe public realized the bunkers were their only hope for survival after a robotic mission to nuke the asteroid failed spectacularly.  With only three months before Zero Hour, the lottery system was put in place.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>Evacuation Site Alpha-2<br>\r\nNorthern Virginia<br>\r\n36 Hours before Zero Hour</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was absolute chaos at the Ridgefield High School as the few remaining National Guard soldiers tried to gather up the few remaining evacuees.  No one was able to hear themselves think over the noise from the rioters outside the secure area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie found himself feeling sorry for the people on the outside; while he and his family had been lucky enough to get spots in the Appalachia Bunker, he knew there was little chance those people would be alive after Samson struck.  The fact that Samson\u2019s predicted impact was only 100 miles only added to the likelihood that they wouldn\u2019t survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shove from behind brought Jamie back to reality as gruff voice said, \u201cKeep moving buddy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReadjusting his backpack, Jamie caught up with the line going through security.  Once through security, he was inside the gymnasium and able to take off the air filter that he\u2019d been wearing for the last couple weeks \u2013 ever since fragments of Samson broken off by the failed mission started striking the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found a quite spot in the corner to sit down while he waited to leave; hoping that his parents and little sister were safe at Appalachia.  A computer error had kept him from being evacuated with them; his mom and sister jumped to the conclusion that he\u2019d somehow been left off the list.  But a tech savvy guard ensured them that Jamie was in fact on the list, they were just unable to access it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Jamie and about two dozen others were told to come back today \u2013 leaving on one of the last two busses to Appalachia.  After ensuring that his belongings were secure, including a flash drive with every family photo and home video on it.  A smile crept across his face when he caught sight of the stuff lion toy at the bottom of his bag \u2013 a lion named Rory that he\u2019d had since he was born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie looked up to see a familiar face nearby, Ashley Saunders.  The two of them were in the same grade; having grown up together.  That wasn\u2019t to say they were friends \u2013 casual acquaintances at best.  They may have shared some classes over the years, but they weren\u2019t in the same social circles at school \u2013 her family\u2019s immense wealth and the fact that she was a cheerleader would explain all that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite that, Jamie was pleasantly surprised when she threw him a quick wave as she walked by with her boyfriend.  Eric Sullivan was the school\u2019s star Quarterback and, to put it mildly, he was dumb as a rock.  This is stark contrast to Ashley, who got a nearly perfect score on her SATs last year and had kept a 3.8 GPA all through High School.  Jamie often wondered why she\u2019d be with someone who was dumber than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Jamie, Ashley was currently thinking the exact same thing; especially after the dimwitted remark Eric had made on the ride over from his house.  He thought the bunker they were going to was underneath the school.  Ashley tried to hide her disdain for Eric, but it was difficult.  <i>God, how could I possibly be dating someone so stupid?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile moving to take a seat nearby Ashley spotted an adorable little boy running through the crowd with a couple, who didn\u2019t look that much older than Ashley, chasing after him.  The woman called out, \u201cCaleb, stop running!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone waited for close to an hour before the busses finally arrived; Jamie was already onboard, as was the couple with the young boy.  Ashley was frantically looking for Eric; he may be an idiot, but she didn\u2019t want him to be left behind.  She hadn\u2019t seen him for the better part of the last 25 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d searched the building to the extent that she could but found nothing.  She was on the verge of giving up when she heard a noise coming from the nearby men\u2019s room \u2013 it sounded almost like a moan.  Her curiosity got the better of her as she walked into the men\u2019s room.  She stopped in her tracks when she saw Eric and her best friend Amber making out against the back wall.  To make things even worse Amber was topless and Eric was fondling her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing over to separate them, in a fit of anger, Ashley yelled, \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric and Amber separated while the latter scrambled to cover herself.  Looking at Ashley, Eric said, \u201cBabe, I can explain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better, bucko; because I\u2019ve spent the last 25 minutes wondering where you were.\u201d Fuming, Ashley said, \u201cOnly to find you making out with my best friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI swear, babe, this isn\u2019t what it looks like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please, how could it not be what it looks like?\u201d shoving Eric, Ashley said, \u201cYou had your hands on her breasts!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric looked like he was going to say something; until Amber, now fully clothed, stepped forward and said, \u201cShut up babe, you\u2019re just making things worse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBabe?\u201d stunned, Ashley turned her attention to Amber and said, \u201cDid you just call my boyfriend babe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, we\u2019ve been screwing around behind your back for months.\u201d With a look of contempt on her face, Amber said, \u201cHow could someone so smart be so oblivious?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was justifiably upset at this point; it wasn\u2019t enough that the world was ending, now she discovered her best friend and her boyfriend were having an affair.  Before she could stop herself, Ashley made a fist and punched Amber square in the nose \u2013 blood gushing everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere must\u2019ve been some guards walking around outside; because before Amber could retaliate, four soldiers burst into the room.  One of them, an older man, said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt weird to make a big deal out of this under the circumstances, but Ashley was upset.  Pointing at Amber, holding her nose, Ashley said, \u201cI caught her screwing around with my boyfriend, sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older soldier looked at the others in disbelief before turning back to look at Ashley.  \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re all understandably upset about that; but, under the circumstances, I don\u2019t think now is the best time to hash things out.\u201d Sighing, the man said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you all wait until we get to Appalachia to discuss things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment Ashley realized she\u2019d been given the opportunity of a lifetime.  \u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary, sir.\u201d Turning to face them, with a smile on her face, Ashley said, \u201cEric, we\u2019re through; and Amber, you can go to hell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley left the bathroom before either of them could respond; smiling as she was now rid of her idiot boyfriend and backstabbing best friend.  Ashley walked back into the gymnasium to find that people were walking out through another entrance.  She quickly went back to her seat to find her bags, only to find that it wasn\u2019t there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to panic when she suddenly heard a voice behind her say, \u201cHere\u2019s your stuff, Ashley.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, Ashley smiled when she saw Jamie standing there with her backpack and duffel in his hands.  Ashley was a little surprised by Jamie\u2019s act of kindness; she hadn\u2019t made his life easy of the years.  \u201cThanks Jamie.\u201d Taking the bags from him, she said, \u201cHey, do you mind if I sit with you on the bus?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I guess; but won\u2019t Eric be upset?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley caught a glimpse of Eric walking into the room with Amber, her nose wrapped in a bandage.  Looking at Jamie, Ashley said, \u201cEric and I broke up; so, I could care less about what he thinks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Ashley and Jamie joined the procession of people leaving the gym \u2013 blissfully unaware of what was to come.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The ride to Appalachia wasn\u2019t without its problems; due in large part to the smaller fragments striking the surface in the lead up to the main event.  Just a few rows up from where she was sitting with Jamie, Ashley could see Eric and Amber were passionately making out with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley turned to look out the window at the sky, which now resembled to a perpetual sunset because of all the dust, smoke and debris in the air.  She caught sight of a fragment entering the atmosphere a few miles away, watching as it went below the tree line.  She sighed as the bus shook from the impact a few moments later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie hadn\u2019t said much since they left the school; if only because he couldn\u2019t think of anything that he\u2019d say to Ashley.  After the shaking passed, he turned to Ashley and said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking, why\u2019d you break up with Eric?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even turning to look, Ashley pointed towards where Eric and Amber were sitting.  Once Jamie saw them making out, Ashley said, \u201cI found them together in the bathroom just before we left; I thought he\u2019d gotten lost or something, but he was screwing around with my best friend.\u201d Looking at him, Ashley said, \u201cIt turns out they\u2019ve been seeing each other behind my back for months.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat really sucks, Ashley; especially with everything else going on.\u201d Pausing, Jamie said, \u201cYou seem to be handling it pretty well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019d be pretty selfish of me to think about my breakup right now, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d with a heavy sigh, Ashley said, \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be an emotional wreck once I\u2019ve had time to process everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie was mildly impressed by the way Ashley was handling the situation; if it was him, he wouldn\u2019t have handled it as well as <br>\r\nher.  \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I never understood why you were dating him in the first place.\u201d Pausing, Jamie said, \u201cI mean, yeah he\u2019s the star quarterback; but he\u2019s also a total moron.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t all bad; he could be pretty sweet at times.\u201d Looking at Jamie, Ashley said, \u201cWhat about you; how come you never dated anyone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, I\u2019m not exactly boyfriend material.\u201d Surprised that Ashley was asking about social life, Jamie said, \u201cI guess I figured there would be plenty of time after High School.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t sell yourself short, Jamie; you may not be the strongest, most attractive guy but there\u2019s plenty of girls who\u2019d love to date you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, I-I think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus they were in suddenly stopped before Ashley could respond; causing everyone to fly forward into the seat back in front of them.  Once the truck came to a stop, the evacuation leader went around asking if everyone was alright.  Caleb, the little boy from earlier, was crying hysterically but he seemed fine otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley, upon seeing Jamie clutching his forehead, said, \u201cHey, are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving his hand to show a deep gash above his eye, Jamie said, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing a band-aid won\u2019t fix.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone seemed to be getting off the bus at that moment, so Ashley said, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get off the bus and I\u2019ll take a look at that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, impact had caused a minor rockslide to cover the road in front of them; the bus Ashley and Jamie had been on was totaled after driving into a large boulder.  While the soldiers worked to fix the problem, Ashley led Jamie to a nearby boulder.  While Ashley went to work cleaning Jamie\u2019s wound, he looked at her and said, \u201cDon\u2019t take this the wrong way, but why are <i>you</i> helping me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley couldn\u2019t really blame Jamie for his confusion; she\u2019d participated, albeit reluctantly, in many embarrassing moments between the popular crowd and kids like Jamie.  \u201cJust because I made your life hell in school doesn\u2019t make me a monster.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Jamie, Ashley said, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019d do the same for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before the soldiers announced that the remaining bus would continue to Appalachia with some of the wounded from the first bus.  It would be a couple hours before a replacement bus would arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just before 3:00 in the afternoon when the remaining group, totaling about a dozen, were told the replacement bus was 20 minutes away.  Everyone got to know each other in order to pass the time; Ashley and Jamie spent most of the last hour chatting with Caleb and his mother Grace.  Come to find out, Grace was a former Marine and her husband, Carl had been studying to be a lawyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes before the bus was set to arrive, everyone turned their attention to a fragment coming through the atmosphere.  It soon became clear that it was going to hit close by; so everyone ran for cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe resulting impact caused the ground to shake and trees to fall.  Everything seemed okay once the dust settled, until Caleb\u2019s ear-piercing scream caught everyone\u2019s attention.  \u201cDaddy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only people close enough were Eric, Jamie, Ashley and Grace; the soldiers, and everyone else, were too far away to hear the screaming over the surrounding nose.  Everyone ran around a large boulder to find that Carlwas pinned against the boulder by a large tree on his leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric just stood there, in shock, while the rest went to work moving the tree.  Suddenly the sound of a soldier\u2019s voice rang through the air, saying, \u201cThe bus is leaving in 2 minutes; anyone not onboard will be left behind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley, at this point fed up with Eric\u2019s inaction, walked over to him and said, \u201cHey dumbass, go to tell them we\u2019ve got someone trapped under a tree up here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric silently nodded and turned to run down the hill towards the bus.  For a moment Ashley thought he was going to listen as he walked up to a soldier standing by the bus.  But to her shock, she watched as Eric and the soldier got on the bus just as it was driving away.  \u201cThat son of a bitch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Grace\u2019s call for help snapped Ashley back to reality as she ran back to where the others were.  Looking at Ashley as she tried to force a branch under the tree, Grace said, \u201cIs Eric going to get help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, about that.\u201d Sighing as she looked at everyone present, Ashley said, \u201cEric and everyone else left; we\u2019re on our own.\u201d</span></div></div>",

At 16 years old, she should\u2019ve been starting her Junior year in the next couple weeks; but Samson closed the door on that.<br>\r\nAs she walked through one of the many tunnels in the bunker, she realized the government must\u2019ve taken some inspiration from that game series Jamie used to play a lot \u2013 Fallout.  She never understood why Jamie, or anyone for that matter, could like that game.  But now, under the circumstances, she wondered if there was a slim chance it could have prepared people for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading towards one of the many elevators, she was about to step inside when she got a text from a friend of hers \u2013 Sara Collins.  <b>Hey girl, you want to meet at the dining area later?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara\u2019s family had come in on the same bus as Emma; but the bunker was so big it had to be divided into blocks.  Sara\u2019s family was in Block C, while Emma\u2019s was in Block E.  <b>Sure, hopefully Jamie will be here by then. </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma put her phone away, knowing it was going to be utterly useless once the doors were sealed.  As she went to enter the elevator, she wasn\u2019t paying attention as she walked right into someone walking out.  \u201cOh God; I\u2019m so sorry, I wasn\u2019t...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma stopped midsentence when she realized she\u2019d bumped into the hottest guy she\u2019d ever met in her life.  Her mood quickly gave way to embarrassment when she realized that she\u2019d spilled coffee all over the guy\u2019s Army uniform.  Looking at her, mildly annoyed, the man said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay ma\u2019am, I should\u2019ve been more careful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching out her hand, Emma said, \u201cI-I\u2019m Emma Lincoln from Block E.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Emma Lincoln from Block E.\u201d smiling as he shook her hand, the man said, \u201cI\u2019m Keith Anders, West Virginia National Guard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the introductions were made, Emma quickly moved to get on the elevator before it left.  Looking at Keith, she said, \u201cSorry again for bumping into you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith went to respond, only for the doors to close before he had a chance to do so.  He was about to turn and walk down the passage when he spotted something on the ground \u2013 Emma\u2019s cellphone.  Picking it up, he said, \u201cI should probably get this back to her.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Looking at Carl, he said, \u201cI-I\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie silently stood up and walked over to the others.

She hadn\u2019t been the nicest person back then, something which she deeply regretted. \u201cGod, you make it sound like I only went after you.\u201d Her voice soft, Ashley said, \u201cDid you ever think maybe I acted like that for a reason?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie stopped in his tracks on the side of the road, turning his attention Ashley.  \u201cWhat reason would that be, exactly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy father wasn\u2019t the savvy businessman everyone thought he was.

I thought if he saw me being aggressive, he wouldn\u2019t attack me as much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it didn\u2019t completely make up for how she treated him in High School, hearing that made Jamie look at Ashley in a different light.

Clearing her throat, she said, \u201cWhat if I told you there was a third option.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie and Grace stopped talking as they turned to look at Ashley.  \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d stepping closer, Grace said, \u201cWhat\u2019s our other choice?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe only reason I never brought it up until now was because I wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d go for it.\u201d Sighing, Ashley said, \u201cMy parents built a bunker underneath our backyard; with enough food and supplies to feed the four of us for 5 years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace was dumbstruck; and, from the looks of it, so was Jamie.  \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious, Ashley; do you really want us to head 50 miles in the wrong direction?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I know it\u2019s not the perfect solution; but I think it\u2019s the best one we\u2019ve got.\u201d Looking at the others, Ashley said, \u201cLet\u2019s say we get to Appalachia, what\u2019s to stop the guards from thinking we\u2019re rioters and shoot us on sight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie raised an eyebrow at that; looking at Grace, he said, \u201cShe has a point, Grace; in all likelihood, we would never see the inside of Appalachia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon realizing that Jamie was coming around to the idea, Grace said, \u201cWhat about your families?\u201d looking at the two of them, she said, \u201cDo you want them thinking you\u2019re dead?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe bunker has a communications system; we\u2019d be able to contact Appalachia once the dust settles.\u201d Pausing, Ashley said, \u201cI saw some abandoned cars at that gas station we passed a few miles back; we could use one of those to get back to my house in a few hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was becoming clear that Grace was now in the minority.  Seeing Caleb poke his head out from behind the rock, Grace finally relented and said, \u201cFine, we\u2019ll head to your families bunker.\u201d Turning serious for a moment, Grace said, \u201cYou better be right about this, Ashley; I\u2019m my life and that of my child in your hands.\u201d</span></div></div>",

After finding a car with a working battery and a tank of gas, it was a simple task for Grace to hotwire it and they were on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley\u2019s family lived in an upper-class gated community in the hills just outside of town; the kind of community where you\u2019d expect to find wealthy retirees and young businessman.  Given the circumstances, and the fact that they were in an SUV, Grace didn\u2019t see a problem with driving straight through the closed gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they drove up the driveway towards Grace\u2019s house, on a hill overlooking the nearby river, Jamie said, \u201cAnyone else find it strange that we didn\u2019t run into anyone on the way here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe thought had crossed my mind.\u201d Parking the car in front of the garage, Grace said, \u201cThere\u2019s not much time left until Zero Hour, so I figured most people would be underground or attempting to get away from the impact zone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sleeping Caleb in her arms, Ashley quickly led the group around back towards a shed nestled against a rock wall.  Jamie was about to question where they were going, until he walked inside and found a large steel door built into the floor.  As Ashley entered a code to open the door, he said, \u201cHow much did your folks spend on this anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the exact amount; but I think it was about $2,000,000.\u201d As the door started to open, Ashley looked back at Jamie and said, \u201cI remember my dad being more than a little upset when we were chosen in the lottery; if only because he\u2019d spent so much money on something we ended up not needing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the door was open, Grace and Jamie followed Ashley down the stairs into a small room with a sealed inner door as well as 6 hazmat suits hanging on the wall.  Still holding Caleb in one arm, Ashley used the other to open the inner door so they could walk inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere must\u2019ve been sensors built into the bunker somewhere because the lights suddenly came on without warning \u2013 revealing the spacious bunker interior.  Jamie and Grace were awestruck as they took in their surroundings; the area around the entrance consisted of a fully equipped kitchen as well as large sitting area with a big screen TV on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking towards a nearby hallway; Jamie noticed a spacious bathroom, with a hot tub, and doors leading to what he assumed were sleeping areas.  Meanwhile, Grace had made her way over to a nearby railing and looked down to find the bottom floor full of everything they\u2019d need to survive; a large water tank with attached filtration, an industrial air filtration system, as well as an expansive hydroponic garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ashley lay Caleb down on the couch, Grace and Jamie came over to her.  \u201cTh-This is impressive, Ashley.\u201d Looking at Ashley, feeling apologetic, Grace said, \u201cThis place sure beats what we\u2019d have in Appalachia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s another room down that hallway over there.\u201d Pointing to another hallway just passed the kitchen, Ashley said, \u201cThat\u2019s the bunker\u2019s command center; we\u2019ll be able to communicate with Appalachia from there, and monitor conditions in the bunker as well as on the surface.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are we going to monitor conditions on the surface?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are sensors placed at strategic points around the yard, as well as cameras and even a remote-control drone.\u201d With a smile on her face, Ashley said, \u201cBefore I forget; we have fresh water from an underground stream, and the bunker is powered by geothermal energy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three of them stood around the kitchen counter, Grace smiled and said, \u201cI think we\u2019ll do just fine here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter checking her watch, Ashley said, \"We've still got about 18 hours until Samson hits; I suggest we all get some sleep.\" looking at the others, she said, \"There's some things we need from the house, but we can get those tomorrow.\"</span></div></div>",

Can you go around to the neighboring houses and siphon as much gas as you can?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I can do that.\u201d Nodding, Grace said, \u201cOnce I\u2019m done with that, I\u2019ll see about getting in touch with Appalachia over the radio; by now they\u2019re probably thinking we\u2019re dead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect; assuming you make contact, that\u2019ll give Jamie and me a chance to say goodbye to our folks.\u201d Checking her watch, Grace said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got 6 hours and 15 minutes until Samson strikes; for safety, I think we should all be inside 30 minutes before hand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne more thing, and its kind of a big one.\u201d Placing her mug on the counter, Grace said, \u201cWho knows who we\u2019ll run into out there; what do we have to defend ourselves with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a fully stocked weapons locker in the airlock.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter telling Caleb to stay inside the bunker while they were gone, Ashley and the others left to complete their assignments.</span></div></div>",

So, after returning to Ashley\u2019s house for the car she left the neighborhood to see what she could find.  Given the circumstances, Grace chuckled at the fact that there was no traffic on a normally busy road into town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace eventually came to an apartment complex that had a dozen or so abandoned cars in the parking lot.  With her rifle in one hand, and several gas cans in the other, she went to work.  She was siphoning gas from a pickup when Ashley\u2019s voice came over the radio strapped to her belt.  \u201cGrace, you there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the siphon down, Grace grabbed the radio and said, \u201cGo ahead, Ashley.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJamie and I just noticed that the car was gone; did you take it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace groaned, realizing she\u2019d forgotten to tell them what she was doing.  \u201cYeah, sorry I forgot to tell you.\u201d Sighing, she said, \u201cI got what little gas I could from your neighbors, so I decided to venture out further.  I\u2019m currently at an apartment complex about 10 minutes from the house.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext time give us a heads up, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Grace heard what sounded like a branch breaking nearby.  Without acknowledging Ashley\u2019s request, Grace lowered the volume on the radio before grabbing the rifle.  Cocking the rifle, she started walking towards the area where she heard the noise.  She heard the noise again as she got closer to the corner of the building.  Taking a deep breath, she raised the rifle and turned the corner \u2013 to find a female deer munching on some grass a fawn doing the same behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace lowered the gun as she took in the scene in front of her; these two creatures had no idea what was coming.  It pained her to think that they wouldn\u2019t be alive after Samson struck.  She watched silently as they ate, until something spooked them, and they ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around to go back to the car, she turned the volume of the radio back up.  \u201c\u2026Ace, are you there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly then did Grace realize she\u2019d forgotten to tell Ashley what was going on.  Sensing the panic in Ashley\u2019s voice, Grace grabbed the radio and said, \u201cSorry, I heard a noise and went to check it out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChrist, don\u2019t scare me like that.\u201d Breathing an audible sigh of relief over the radio, Ashley said, \u201cI thought something had happened to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I guess my military training just kicked in.\u201d Walking over to the car, she said, \u201cI\u2019ve probably got about 50 gallons of gas; I\u2019m going to empty this last car before I head back.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Besides, he hadn\u2019t been around Ashley long enough to gauge when she wanted to debate something, or simply have him agree with her.  <br>\r\nAs he sealed up the last box, he said, \u201cIs there anything else we need from up here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, why don\u2019t you search my brother\u2019s room for toys Caleb can play with.\u201d Looking at Jamie, Ashley said, \u201cI\u2019m going to search the bathroom and see if there were any hygiene products left behind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Jamie wondered what Ashley was talking about; until he realized she was referring to <i>feminine</i> hygiene products.  While Ashley went off to search the bathroom, he went down the hall to her brother\u2019s room.

All this meant that Jamie wasn\u2019t likely to find anything that was appropriate for Caleb to play with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes of searching only landed Jamie with a small handful of stuffed animals.  He was about to leave when he saw something out of the corner of his eye \u2013 sealed container, sitting atop a bookshelf, labeled Legos.  <i>Perfect</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room looked as though it hadn\u2019t been cleaned in weeks, so Jamie had to be careful as he moved towards the shelf.  It took some effort but he managed to get the bin and place it on the bed.  Satisfied, he was about to leave when he slipped on something and crashed into the bookcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could do anything, the bookcase fell over and hit him on the head.</span></div></div>",

After getting over the shock brought on by the loud noise, she went to investigate.  Arriving outside her brother\u2019s room, she saw his bookshelf had fallen onto the bed.  She was about to move on when she saw an arm on the floor by the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, she made her way through her brother\u2019s messy room to find Jamie lying unconscious underneath the bookshelf.

Reaching for the radio, she said, \u201cYou know, <i>mother</i>; you don\u2019t need to check in on me every 10 minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace\u2019s annoyance was quickly replaced with concern, as Ashley said, \u201cJamie\u2019s hurt; a bookcase fell on him and it\u2019s too heavy for me to lift on my own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit.\u201d Throwing the car back into gear, she said, \u201cI\u2019ll be there in 5 minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was more like two minutes before Grace got back to the house; leaving everything the car, she ran inside and up the stairs.  She entered the room to find Jamie lying on the floor, and Ashley standing over him looking worried.  Getting down on the ground, Grace said, \u201cHow do you feel, Jamie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy head hurts and my leg is killing me.\u201d Looking at Grace, he said, \u201cBut other than that, I\u2019m fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Ashley, Grace was thinking the same thing she had moments earlier.  I already lost Carl, getting back to her feet, Grace said, I\u2019m not going to lose another one.  Climbing over to the other side of the shelf, Grace said, \u201cOkay Ashley, we\u2019re going to get him clear and own to the bunker.\u201d Moving to lift the shelf, she said, \u201cOnce that\u2019s done, you\u2019ll take care of patching him up and calling Appalachia; while I finish getting everything underground before we run out of time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Ashley and Grace all of five minutes to get Jamie free; and another five minutes to get him down into the bunker.  After making sure Caleb stayed out of the way, Ashley got to work tending to Jamie\u2019s injuries.  \u201cI think the worst of the bleeding has stopped.\u201d Gently bandaging his head, Ashley said, \u201cAll that\u2019s left is to make sure you don\u2019t fall asleep, in case you have a concussion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie wasn\u2019t sure what to make of Ashley\u2019s treatment of him; it was far removed from the way she treated him in High School.  Looking at her, he said, \u201cHow\u2019s my leg looking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell much without an X-ray, but I\u2019m fairly certain it\u2019s not broken.\u201d Gently lifting his leg onto a pillow, Ashley said, \u201cYou should probably take it easy for a few days; then we\u2019ll worry about making sure you don\u2019t end up with a limp.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie was silent for a moment, pondering whether he should say what he was thinking.  He eventually up his mind as Ashley turned to walk away.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I scared you earlier.\u201d Grabbing her hand, he said, \u201cBut thank you for helping me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink nothing of it, Jamie; but, please don\u2019t scare me like that again.\u201d</span></div></div>",

The bunker was nearly impenetrable; but, given its proximity to Samson\u2019s impact area, the inhabitants were sent to hardened sections until after the impact.  He was on his way to the command center with a message about one of the back-up generators \u2013 the wiring was faulty, and repairs wouldn\u2019t be finished before Zero Hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith entered the Command Center to find that it was abuzz with activity; what with Samson being 30 minutes from impact.  Walking up to an older woman, he said, \u201cColonel Westfield, I have an update on Generator 3.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to face Keith, Colonel Westfield said, \u201cWhat is it, Lieutenant Anders?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanding over the note, Keith said, \u201cI regret to inform you, ma\u2019am, that repairs to Generator 3 will not be finished before Zero Hour.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn.\u201d Looking at the note, Westfield said, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to repair the...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColonel Westfield was suddenly interrupted by a young woman from across the room.  \u201cColonel,\u201d getting to her feet, the woman said, \u201cWe\u2019re receiving an unusual transmission on the emergency channel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColonel Westfield and Keith made their way over to the communications section, where the young woman was stationed.  Looking at her, Colonel Westfield said, \u201cWhat is it, Major Reyes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman, a young Latina in her early 20s, flipped a switch on the board and a woman\u2019s voice came over the speaker.  \u201c...Lachia Bunker, repeat, Appalachia Bunker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a headset, Colonel Westfield said, \u201cYou\u2019re communicating on a restricted frequency, please cease your transmission.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, please wait.\u201d There was a hint of desperation in the woman\u2019s voice, \u201cMy name\u2019s Ashley Saunders, ID # 4142.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMajor Reyes typed in the ID that Ashley had given, and the information matched.  \u201cMs. Saunders, this is Colonel Helen Westfield of the West Virginia National Guard.\u201d As she looked closer, Colonel Westfield realized she was speaking to one of the people left behind the day before.  \u201cWe have you, and four others, listed as missing in action.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am; we were left behind in the confusion.  I regret to inform you that Carl Anderson, one of the others, didn\u2019t make it.\u201d Pausing, Ashley said, \u201cI\u2019m currently in a private bunker with Grace Anderson, her son Caleb, and Jamie Lincoln.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith\u2019s eyes went wide when he heard Jamie\u2019s name; he knew, from talking with Emma last night, that Jamie was her older brother.  While Colonel Westfield continued speaking, Keith knew he had to bring this to Emma\u2019s attention.  \u201cWe sent a unit to come retrieve you, but never heard back from them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am, they were taken out by an impact.\u201d Her voice barely audible over a sudden burst of static, Ashley said, \u201cWe quickly realized that we\u2019d never make it to Appalachia in time; so we decided to use a bunker that my parents had built in my yard.\u201d<br>\r\nKeith was sure the conversation continued after that, but he didn\u2019t hear the rest as he\u2019d left to information Emma and her family that Jamie was alive.</span></div></div>",
