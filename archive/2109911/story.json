Going off that for now and obligatory mobile apology)<br>\r\nIt had been a while since I had done anything fun, and I was tired of people giving me that boring big scary monster role. I want to show everyone real power, but how good I can be. It WOULD be easy if it weren\u2019t for the fact that I had shrank down to 5\u20196\u201d since I last did anything. Luckily, I had heard of this thing called thumb puffing. Pretty simple, name explains itself. I got started, but was dissapointed to see in 10 minutes I had grown by 2-3 inches, tops. It\u2019s still something...? Anyway, I kept doing that all day, when I finally started seeing some results. It was relatively small compared to what I was after, but still good. 8\u2019 exactly, which is pretty nice. I\u2019ll take everything I can get. When I got back to my cave, a rockslide had blocked the entrance. Welp, time to put this power to good use. I started puffing, and as it was reaching dark, I reached 12\u2019 tall, and easily threw the mass of boulders aside. I stayed up the entire night, still puffing, but never getting tired. It was fun, to be honest. I woke up to find that my head was scraping against the roof of the cave, but didn\u2019t realize this until I actually stood up and broke through the roof. I was probably about, 59, maybe 60 feet tall by now. We were finally getting somewhere. I also noticed that my muscles were bigger, not just from the general growth, but it was like my body directed more of the power into my arms, legs, etc. Either way, I kept puffing, finally reaching the 100 feet mark. I had the memories of my old self, and cringed. Man, I was stupid back then. It was beautiful, since my eyes were bigger and I was able to appreaciate the mountains I hid in even more. I looked down and saw I had a six pack. <i>don\u2019t know where that came from but I love it!</i>. I spent another day puffing, breaking the 250\u2019 mark, and I was finally beginning to get tired. I lied down, happier than ever. I woke up and did what I had been doing for 2 days now, puffing. It was peaceful. Once I hit 400 feet tall, and 300 feet wide, since I had to go out to accommodate for the muscle, I decided to go out into the world. And of course, still puffing as I went. The effects of being about 100 times your previous size are great. What was a month of running for me to get to my new home was a few hours of walking as a 500 foot tall beast. The name Godzilla makes a lot of sense now, huh?</span></div></div>",

I was about 100 times bigger than the size I started out at a few days ago, and 200 feet bigger than the size they typically see me at in the movies. I noticed the towering skyscrapers, towering over even me, and I was somewhat annoyed to be honest. So, I decided to get a bit bigger. Besides, the bigger I get, the more they'll love me! I take a deep breath, ready my thumb and puff as hard as I can. It seems the bigger I get, the easier it is to puff larger, as one puff this time gave me a major boost of like 50 feet. I look at myself, and flex my muscles a bit, enjoying the larger size. I go again, this time growing 100 more feet in size, bringing me to a total of 650 feet in size. On and on this went for a bit, as I kept huffing and puffing and growing, until I was taller than the skyscraper in the city, at about 2500 feet in size. My muscles made me as wide as 1500 feet, a huge mountain of scale and muscle. I murr slightly as I feel over my muscles. I look down at the city of tiny people, who were looking up at me with awe in their eyes. I clear my throat and do a powerful flex for their viewing pleasure saying \"Hello tiny ones! I am Godzilla! It's a pleasure to be so big in front of all of you! I hope it's a pleasure for you too!\" I state, and look down for their reaction. They were in awe but also joyful, as they loved how big I was. I knew they would love my massive size! After all, I love it so much, why wouldn't they? I start to think that maybe I should get even bigger. After all, a bigger Godzilla is a better Godzilla! So, that's what I do! I take a deep breath, ready to show the world just how big I can get!</span></div></div>",

I feel some confusion, but look down and see that I grew an extra 500 feet from that one deep breath! I was amazed and so were the tiny people. I grow just by inhaling air now! It was incredibly exciting, as now I felt so much stronger! Well, not that I wasn't already super powerful but anyway! I wonder if I can grow by exhaling too. I let out a content sigh, as I was rubbing my massive pecs, and indeed, I grow another 500 feet, up to 3500 feet total. I grin widely, and flex for the tiny people, as they cheer for me and my massiveness. I decide to reward their cheers and love of me by growing bigger and bigger and BIGGER! So big, that the whole country will be able to see just how huge I am! I start taking a long deep breath, growing at a steady rate that was also increasing exponentially, just as my puffs from before were. Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, this went on for quite a while. Eventually, I had to stop, as I now towered over the country of Japan, my shadow casting over the whole country and some of the nearby countries. My muscles made half as wide as I was tall. I flex my big bulging biceps, creating an even larger shadow, and I could hear the tiny people from down below, cheering for my incredible size and power. But I knew both they and myself wanted more. WAAAAY more! And who was I to deny that sort of thing for them! I start to take my deepest longest breath, to really get the growth in, and start exploding in size. Soon I was the size of the US, then the size of North America, then the size of Asia, growing and growing and growing, all the way until I manage to reach a size where I could hold the whole world in my hand. I smile down at it, feeling the love and affection of every human towards my massive form. Now, what else to do at this size? I could grow more, that's a lot of fun! I could also try and help humans explore space. Easier to do when you've got an ally who's the size of a planet! Hmm, decisions, decisions.</span></div></div>",

Finally, I passed all buildings, the closest one being level to my waist. This made me seem weak compared to the movies. I was nearly as wide as I was tall with muscle, and as this happened I had just about doubled in size. I got out of the city I was in, which only took a few steps, and reached the ocean. Even after I had reached what I had knew to be the \u201creal\u201d deep, it was level to maybe my knees. I physically couldn\u2019t grow now! I was nearing 10 miles tall, and about 15 miles wide. I layed down, and watched one determined person running along my body to my head. When he reached my ear (which took several days, since I grew by just living) I was 50 miles tall, and was starting to consider leaving the planet. I was pretty close to the atmosphere, but once I left, there was no turning back. The man at my ear told me that the government needed my help to bring them to the moon. (Maybe go to mars and rescue opportunity?) I agreed, and as I entered space, still breathing, which confused me, since there shouldn\u2019t be air in space, the moon was about the size of my fist at best. I dropped them off there and floated towards the sun to warm up. It felt good, but I was starting to miss being back on earth...</span></div></div>",

They said they wouldn\u2019t hurt me, and they didn\u2019t. It was really nice to see someone again, and I felt way better in all aspects. They were tired, barely alive from trying to find me, but I had more powers than just fire breath. I was able to heal him pretty quickly, and the first thing he did once he was conscious was hug me, and he didn\u2019t let go for an hour or 2. He seemed way smaller than when I first found him, but it was ok. It was already 11 pm by then, so I tried to make a bed setup for him when he pointed out he could sleep on me. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re 11 feet tall.\u201d \u201cI... I am?\u201d Didnt realize that happened. Whatever. That was a big bonus. I was worried he\u2019d roll off me and get hurt, but my chest had gotten a decent bit wider, along with my arms. I liked it, he was like a big teddy bear to me. And my thick arms were his blanket, a massive, 20\u2019 long bed. Would\u2019ve loved to be him.<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n...<br>\r\nWhen I woke up, there was a big problem in 2 ways. One was me having doubled in size overnight, and the other was that I couldn\u2019t get out of the cave I was sleeping in. Luckily, the person I found earlier had gotten off me, which was good since I would\u2019ve squished him against the cave ceiling from my growing chest. Luckily, I had gained a lot of muscle, reaching about 75\u2019 tall, and it let me break the roof easily. A faint voice came from near my head \u201cHey! I think that the more people who come to you and see you, the bigger you get!\u201d \u201cWell for you, it\u2019s more like worshipping.\u201d , my deep voice boomed.

After falling for thirty minutes, I finally hit the ground. HARD. \u201cOw...\u201d I winced as I felt a throbbing in my side. That\u2019s gonna hurt, isn\u2019t it? I walked around, looking for something, when I saw a faint green glow. \u201cWater!\u201d I said in my weak tired state. I was 9 feet tall at the time, losing a lot of size after being asleep for so long. I drank it all up, and as soon as I finished, I remembered I could breathe some fire to be able to see. As soon as I did, I wished I hadn\u2019t. I saw that the source of that green cane from a barrel with a big, obvious, yellow and black symbol that meant one thing. Radioactive. \u201cWell, shit.\u201d I decided to lay down, thinking that if I died it would at least be in my sleep(I\u2019m not killing him don\u2019t worry) and woke up to find I was cramped into some tiny craw space in the cave. I must\u2019ve rolled in my sleep. But then I heard that sickening sound of metal being crushed, and saw that barrel from however long ago. I looked at it, and saw that it had gone from nearly the size of me from earlier to about the size of my head. \u201cDid... did I grow?\u201d I said, shocked my how much deeper my voice had become. Yes. I did grow. I definetly wasn\u2019t big enough to get out of the hole yet, but it was progress. And even as I sat and tried to get in a more comfortable position the barrel had already gone from the size of my head to the size of my fist, I just had to hope I\u2019d keep growing so I could get out of here. I soon knew space would be an issue soon, so I started pushing the rocks outward. It was easier as I went on, the barrel now being the size of my eye. I looked up, and saw a faint light. \u201cDamn, I must be massive.\u201d I saw my arms and legs, which were growing faster than the rest of me, and knew this was good. This was probably the best thing that could\u2019ve happened to me. After a few more minutes of testing my new body, I broke what had to be a 100 foot thick layer of rock and dirt to find a barrel of that same waste from when I landed in the cave, but nearly the size of my body. I was big enough as is, but going faster wouldn\u2019t hurt. ;)</span></div></div>",
