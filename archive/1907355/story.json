King was not in his office, but there on the desk was the approval stamp, and no king in sight. He had half a notion to stamp the approval himself and file it away before king had a chance to notice...  He glanced around, it was lunchtime and the office was almost empty no one would know if he just went ahead and approved the man's loan.. </span></div></div>",

It seems so in vain now.\"<br>\r\nYou are steaming mad, and on the verge of boiling over, but King is our boss, atleast until he realizes what you've done, so you try to keep your cool.<br>\r\n\"mr. king, if i cant help you with anything, id like to go over a few otions available to Mr. potter so I can move on to the next client sir\" You are pleased with the way you handled yourself, and give yourself a pat on the back as King leaves your office, leaving a few more harsh words in his wake, but gone none the less.<br>\r\nWhen you are sure he is gone, and out of ear shot you open the folder and produce teh paper with the stamped approval on it, and hand it to potter, who;s eyes lit up with excitement.<br>\r\n\"how did you manage this\" he asks you<br>\r\n\"don't worry about it, i just did, but you better hurry and cash the check before im busted\" you say<br>\r\nPotter thanks you and leaves with haste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
