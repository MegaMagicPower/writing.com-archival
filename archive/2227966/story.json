            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the most part it was was a fairly basic infiltration mission, that kind Natasha had done countless times. The Moondragon compound didn't seem any different from others, except that it was nowhere near the high security type of place she was used to breaking into. The catch was that three agents had already gone in and not come out. The supposed leader of this compound, a sprawling, low-tech group of buildings hidden away from civilization in the mountains, was an unknown woman named Heather Douglas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know something about her. Her parents died when she was young. Stayed off the grid after that, didn't resurface until now. Seems to think she's an alien, or at least talks to them. We can't find any evidence of that. She could just be crazy for all we know. But three SHIELD agents into investigate and never came out. She has close to two-hundred people in her compound with more arriving every week. They're completely self-sufficient. Nothing's coming out, not even any communication that we can tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why were we even looking then? A group of fanatical ludites living in the mountains doesn't seem like SHIELD business,\" Natasha asked Director Fury. Of course, if he was paying attention, there was a good reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because one of the things we do know about this Douglas woman is a few years back she tried talking to conspiracy theories online, warning them about a threat she called Thanos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds familiar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it does. We don't know what she knows or how she knows it, but I suspect if she's gathering people in the wilderness like this she's either planning for a threat or hiding from it. But we don't know now, do we? Because some good agents who shouldn't have been taken in by a bunch of unarmed survivalists never came back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha nodded. She knew the mission now was to go in and see what happened. \"Okay, any other instructions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep yourself unseen. I don't like SHIELD agents vanishing when all we can see is a farm full of mountain folk.\"<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha made her way on foot for ten miles after being dropped off in the woods. Night had already fallen when she approached the compound and found it completely unguarded. Dozens of people farming in the fields were finishing up for the day as she arrived. She watched them, slow moving and deliberate, put up their tools and make their way to other buildings. In the distance she heard generators humming, electric lights burning in some of the windows of the wooden structures. On the way in they detected no radio signals as Director Fury had told her. She saw no signs of weapons other than simple farming tools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creepiest part, none of the people were making a sound. Natasha's keen vision could make out their expressions as blank, half asleep. They had thought this might be a cult, but judging by the way everyone moved Natasha now suspected that perhaps some kind of mind control was at work. If that was true, it would explain why highly trained SHIELD agents would have gotten captured by these docile, unarmed civilians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all signs of movement ceased, Natasha went through the fields to the nearest building to get a look. The lights had dimmed while she approached them, making her cautious, but the sounds of basic movements inside and people going back and forth in the windows told her she was still not seen, at least by them. They were going about the business of finishing up the day, probably going to sleep. They didn't look like they would be doing any late night reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Natasha approached the first building, she saw a figure standing guard right by the door. The figure was unarmed, but stood determined if, like the others, half asleep. Even in the dark Natasha recognized-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Natasha was surprised to see fellow agent Melinda Mai standing guard in front of the cabin. She stood stock still, like the other dressed in blue jeans and a plain t-shirt.  Every minute, she'd slowly turn her head left and right. It was all very mechanical, so much so that Natasha was convinced now that some form of mind control was involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat surprised her most was that May was supposed to be retired from the field. This means that Fury was worried enough about the situation that he'd send in one of his best retired agents even before her. Natasha prepared to slink back behind the cabin when May turned towards her. Whatever was controlling her wasn't hindering her observational powers or reflexes. She turned and walked in brisk pace right towards her. Natasha could barely make out her expression. It was mostly blank-not unusual for May-but there was recognition there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up, prepared to deflect the attack that was obviously coming. May jumped at her without hesitating, Natasha sidestepping the blow and grabbing her leg to pull her to the ground. She had a closer look at her now. Frustration and annoyance showed on May's face. She looked directly into Natasha's eyes, the mental strain obvious as she spoke through gritted teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to leave,\" she said, her body fidgeting, trying to attack again with only her considerable will power stopping her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on here?\" Natasha asked, then flipping May on her front as she attempted to push her off. May let out a muffled, frustrated grunt. Natasha could only imagine how frustrating, and even frightening, it must be to have her body being controlled like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha glanced around. The guard furthest from them didn't see them, they were too far in the shadows on the side of the cabin. But the guard across the way was watching in their direction, noticing May was not at her post.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heather Douglas, she's-\" and here May released a short, agonized squeak as she struggled to get the words out. Coming from May, that made Natasha nervous. \"-she's building an army to stop some alien invasion, somebody called Thano-aaa-aaah!\" May tried to stop it but apparently the mental strain was too much, and she cried out. The guard across the way took notice now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha prepared to jump and run, \"Is she right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so. But she's also crazy. She'll do anything, and she's getting worse. Get out and tell Fury!\" with that the strain was too great, and May began struggling again, expertly pushing Natasha away and getting a good few hits in while Natasha reeled backwards. The other guard was on them now, also unarmed, but also another mind-controlled SHIELD agent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Intruder! Here!\" he yelled as he rushed in. The other guard came running. Natasha was back on her feet. From the look on May's face she didn't think any of the three were going to be able to simply shake off this control.</span></div></div>",
