            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the most part it was was a fairly basic infiltration mission, that kind Natasha had done countless times. The Moondragon compound didn't seem any different from others, except that it was nowhere near the high security type of place she was used to breaking into. The catch was that three agents had already gone in and not come out. The supposed leader of this compound, a sprawling, low-tech group of buildings hidden away from civilization in the mountains, was an unknown woman named Heather Douglas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know something about her. Her parents died when she was young. Stayed off the grid after that, didn't resurface until now. Seems to think she's an alien, or at least talks to them. We can't find any evidence of that. She could just be crazy for all we know. But three SHIELD agents into investigate and never came out. She has close to two-hundred people in her compound with more arriving every week. They're completely self-sufficient. Nothing's coming out, not even any communication that we can tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why were we even looking then? A group of fanatical ludites living in the mountains doesn't seem like SHIELD business,\" Natasha asked Director Fury. Of course, if he was paying attention, there was a good reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because one of the things we do know about this Douglas woman is a few years back she tried talking to conspiracy theories online, warning them about a threat she called Thanos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds familiar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it does. We don't know what she knows or how she knows it, but I suspect if she's gathering people in the wilderness like this she's either planning for a threat or hiding from it. But we don't know now, do we? Because some good agents who shouldn't have been taken in by a bunch of unarmed survivalists never came back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha nodded. She knew the mission now was to go in and see what happened. \"Okay, any other instructions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep yourself unseen. I don't like SHIELD agents vanishing when all we can see is a farm full of mountain folk.\"<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha made her way on foot for ten miles after being dropped off in the woods. Night had already fallen when she approached the compound and found it completely unguarded. Dozens of people farming in the fields were finishing up for the day as she arrived. She watched them, slow moving and deliberate, put up their tools and make their way to other buildings. In the distance she heard generators humming, electric lights burning in some of the windows of the wooden structures. On the way in they detected no radio signals as Director Fury had told her. She saw no signs of weapons other than simple farming tools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creepiest part, none of the people were making a sound. Natasha's keen vision could make out their expressions as blank, half asleep. They had thought this might be a cult, but judging by the way everyone moved Natasha now suspected that perhaps some kind of mind control was at work. If that was true, it would explain why highly trained SHIELD agents would have gotten captured by these docile, unarmed civilians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all signs of movement ceased, Natasha went through the fields to the nearest building to get a look. The lights had dimmed while she approached them, making her cautious, but the sounds of basic movements inside and people going back and forth in the windows told her she was still not seen, at least by them. They were going about the business of finishing up the day, probably going to sleep. They didn't look like they would be doing any late night reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Natasha approached the first building, she saw a figure standing guard right by the door. The figure was unarmed, but stood determined if, like the others, half asleep. Even in the dark Natasha recognized-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Natasha was surprised to see fellow agent Melinda Mai standing guard in front of the cabin. She stood stock still, like the other dressed in blue jeans and a plain t-shirt.  Every minute, she'd slowly turn her head left and right. It was all very mechanical, so much so that Natasha was convinced now that some form of mind control was involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat surprised her most was that May was supposed to be retired from the field. This means that Fury was worried enough about the situation that he'd send in one of his best retired agents even before her. Natasha prepared to slink back behind the cabin when May turned towards her. Whatever was controlling her wasn't hindering her observational powers or reflexes. She turned and walked in brisk pace right towards her. Natasha could barely make out her expression. It was mostly blank-not unusual for May-but there was recognition there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up, prepared to deflect the attack that was obviously coming. May jumped at her without hesitating, Natasha sidestepping the blow and grabbing her leg to pull her to the ground. She had a closer look at her now. Frustration and annoyance showed on May's face. She looked directly into Natasha's eyes, the mental strain obvious as she spoke through gritted teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to leave,\" she said, her body fidgeting, trying to attack again with only her considerable will power stopping her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on here?\" Natasha asked, then flipping May on her front as she attempted to push her off. May let out a muffled, frustrated grunt. Natasha could only imagine how frustrating, and even frightening, it must be to have her body being controlled like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha glanced around. The guard furthest from them didn't see them, they were too far in the shadows on the side of the cabin. But the guard across the way was watching in their direction, noticing May was not at her post.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heather Douglas, she's-\" and here May released a short, agonized squeak as she struggled to get the words out. Coming from May, that made Natasha nervous. \"-she's building an army to stop some alien invasion, somebody called Thano-aaa-aaah!\" May tried to stop it but apparently the mental strain was too much, and she cried out. The guard across the way took notice now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha prepared to jump and run, \"Is she right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so. But she's also crazy. She'll do anything, and she's getting worse. Get out and tell Fury!\" with that the strain was too great, and May began struggling again, expertly pushing Natasha away and getting a good few hits in while Natasha reeled backwards. The other guard was on them now, also unarmed, but also another mind-controlled SHIELD agent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Intruder! Here!\" he yelled as he rushed in. The other guard came running. Natasha was back on her feet. From the look on May's face she didn't think any of the three were going to be able to simply shake off this control.</span></div></div>",

Months of successful robberies, including hijacking a Stark plane containing much of the millionaire inventor's most coveted technology, was making him careless. He knew this but almost couldn't help himself. He was on a roll, and even multiple encounters with Spider-Man hadn't stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked through his door in the dead of night knowing he had gone too far. Spider-Man had nearly captured him that time, and the only look he made off with he was holding in his hand. That was what told him he had to start being careful again. He had always went by the cardinal rule that nothing he did with his business would ever be tied to his own home, but here he was walking into his own home carrying a piece of alien technology. He and it wouldn't be there for long, but that didn't satisfy him. He played fast and loose too long and this was just too close a call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian's flight suit had been damaged in the fight. It could still fly, but he'd probably wind up getting himself killed. He sent it back to their headquarters when it became too unstable to fly, conveniently just a mile from home. If it crashed or exploded on the way, at least it wouldn't be tied to him. His associate, Phineas \"The Tinkerer\" Mason, texted him that it arrived safely for repairs just as he arrived home. It was only going to be a quick stop, get in his car, and then drive to drop off the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian made himself a glass of water. It was 1:00 in the morning, his wife and daughter asleep. He heard footsteps behind him. He quickly shoved the cylindrical device, which was emitting periodic buzzing sounds, into the drawer and turned around. He smiled when he saw his daughter. His success as the Vulture kept him away from home lately and he hadn't spent as much time with his family as he would have liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery time he saw Liz, he was struck by how she really wasn't his little girl anymore, but had become a beautiful young woman. She'd be nineteen when she started college in just a few months, graduation was three weeks away, and prom just two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, honey,\" he said, \"Sorry to wake you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, dad, what's going on? It's after midnight,\" she yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian shook his head. \"Nothing bad, just had to get some work done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded. She knew how hard her father worked. Sometimes it seemed too hard, but she couldn't complain that it didn't pay off. They had a lovely house and she got everything she wanted. She wouldn't have thought she was spoiled, although her few friends and many acquaintances could detect traces of aloofness and vanity behind her kind personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You work too hard,\" Liz said, and gave her dad a hug. She hadn't really seen him in the last few weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" he said. \"Just three weeks until the big day, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhuh. I expect to see you there on time,\" she said with a smile. Adrian might not be around all the time, but he had never missed a big event in her life, and never broke a promise he made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get to bed, sweetie,\" Adrian said. He didn't like her standing that close to the drawer with the clicking, buzzing alien machine. He took a few steps away to head to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just getting something to drink. Good night, dad,\" Liz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian went to the bathroom while Liz poured herself some water from the tap. As she did so, she head rattling in the drawer next to the sink. Then it happened again. She opened it just an inch, thinking it might be a bug or another kind of pest. She saw tape, scissors, pens and the edge of something round and silver. It shook, gave off a little buzz. Liz, always naturally curious, opened the drawer a little more when the a small crack opened in the object. It looked like a row of LEDs appeared. As she looked directly into it, they flashed at her. She covered her eyes slammed the drawer shut. Her head felt fuzzy, like she had just woken up. Her eyesight returned quickly but everything was foggy. She stumbled and took a few steps away from the drawer. As she slowly regained her ability to think straight, she felt the overpowering urge to-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Liz wasn't sure what she found in the drawer but all she knew was that she was feeling an overwhelming feeling of hunger. She wasn't sure why and she certainly didn't think it would be a side effect of LED lights. Feeling a strong hunger coming over her wasn't necessarily a bad thing and certainly nothing she needed to worry about. And at almost 19, she didn't have to worry about midnight snacks making her put on weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to look through the kitchen to find something tasty to snack on. Not finding anything that struck her fancy, she opened the freezer and found a pint of chocolate ice cream. That should do the trick she thought to herself. She pulled out the pint of ice cream, grabbed a spoon, and headed back to her room to enjoy her dessert in privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz sat down on her bed, resumed watching her favorite tv show on her laptop, and began to eat the ice cream. She had a weakness for anything chocolate. Once she started eating the ice cream, she couldn't stop. Plus she was distracted by her tv show. Before long, she had finished the whole pint of ice cream and didn't even realize it until her spoon hit the bottom of the carton. Oh my god, I can't believe I ate the whole pint she thought to herself a bit embarassed. A burp escaped her lips. She was so glad there was no one around to hear that. Especially not Peter Parker. Even though he was younger than her, she couldn't help but crush on him. He always looked at her like a goddess and she didn't want to do anything to jeopardize that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up from her bed, Liz caught a glance of her reflection in her vanity mirror. She blushed as she realized that she now had a food baby that caused her white tank top to roll up a bit to reveal the bottom part of her stomach. On the bottom, she was just wearing a pair of pink shorts. She gently patted her belly before shrugging it off. Food babys were nothing to worry about. It would be gone by tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She headed back into the kitchen where she threw away the empty carton and put her spoon in the sink.  Despite feeling a bit full from the ice cream, she was surprised to realize that she was surprised to realize that she was still hungry.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Liz's stomach growled as she looked over the kitchen for something else to eat. She rubbed it, it felt as full as it looked. She thought she should just go to bed. Even with her invincible metabolism she knew that stuffing herself with an entire pint of ice cream late at night and then going for more was a bad habit to get in. The moment she had that thought, a strange, humming stirred her stomach. It stopped quickly, but it seemed to be urging her to find food, and fast. She had the vague notion that she needed more energy, and food was energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz took a quick look into the drawer where that flash had come from and found it empty. Looking out the window she saw that her dad's car was gone. That wasn't unusual. He was a busy man who worked long, late hours, or in this case, early hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the fridge, she found mostly food that heeded to be prepared. Again, she thought that her hunger, however, powerful, shouldn't have her eating this late. And again, as she had the thought, her full tummy churned and gurgled, or rather vibrated quickly and strongly. It was like a warning. She saw leftovers of a casserole her mom had made for dinner that night. It was almost half full. She shrugged, and took it out. She'd have a small plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Grrrruuurg-bzt!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat time the feeling was more pronounced. She rubbed her stomach, letting out another little belch as her overactive tummy made room. She thought she'd just heat some up, but again her hunger, given voice by her stomach, urged her to just dig in, and she did. She sat down at the kitchen table with a ford, took the tin foil off the dish, and dug into the cold casserole. It tasted all right cold, but mostly Liz just wanted to get something else in her stomach. She was tired and just wanted a few bites. But even though a few bites were already straining her stuffed tummy, her hunger remained as strong as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz thought she was acting a little unusual, but it didn't strike her as abnormal. Like many thin young women, she came by her figure naturally, not as the result of careful dieting or exercise. She was fully conscious that she had a great body and was quite attractive, and took great pains to make herself look good, but as far as her weight went it never really changed her habits. So when she suddenly had the irresistible urge to eat, she ate. Even as her stomach grew fuller, and she tugged down on her tank top and on the waistband of her shorts when she felt the odd feeling of being so stuffed her skin was stretching over her middle, she ate, and ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd her stomach groaned happily. As Liz slowly and methodically ate the rest of the casserole, it soon got the point where she had to force each bite down. She was too stuffed now, but she kept going. Her flat stomach stuck out a few inches, full and taught, but all she registered was that she was getting really full and should stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I should really get to bed. I'm pretty full,</i> Liz thought. In truth she had never been fuller. Under normal circumstances she could never have eaten so much. Several pounds of ice cream and thick, hearty casserole were crammed into her small stomach, now bulging out enough that her belly button peeked out from between her shirt and shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like with the ice cream, Liz didn't realize how much she had eaten until she found there was no more left in the casserole dish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh-urp!\" she looked at the empty dish. Another loud belch forced its way out. She leaned back and rubbed her stomach. She almost gasped when she looked down and saw that the little food baby from earlier was now sticking out as far as her breasts. Not exactly huge, but on her slender figure it was impossible to miss. And it felt so tight, and heavy. She leaned back and groaned, rubbing it, regretting giving into her hunger. Not having seen fully how stuffed she was, she thought it strange but not completely outrageous that she had let herself indulge like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the sun began to shine. Liz had spent all night stuffing her face. Patting her stomach, she stood up with a grunt, feeling the weight in her middle, and how full and stretched her stomach was. She was also embarrassed and a little ashamed. She never worried about what she ate because she was confident in her perfect body, but that kind of indulgence made her feel like a bit of a pig.</span></div></div>",
