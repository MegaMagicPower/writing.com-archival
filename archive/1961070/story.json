            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>|| It has been only a day since arriving in the capital city of Taelna. You were torn from your homeland alongside your best friend, Korvi, captured and auctioned in the market of Seleran. It was there you were sold to the Arena Master of the Brutalias arena. You are a yearling male dragon, scarlet-ruby hide, sapphire blue eyes. You stood the height of a young German Shepard dog. Your Intelligence was that of an 11 year old human child. Since arriving in the capital, you were caged for transportation, and for the night been tossed in a cell. Now... as the new dawn rises, your new life is forced to begin. ||</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________________ _________<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________________ _________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe steel doors to your cell slammed open, striking hard and loud against the stone wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cRise and shine Shaol, its training day!\"<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nMaruk proclaimed broadly, sounding somewhat excited. You opened your eyes, a low growl of a grown escape your maw as you sat up, turning gaze to see Maruk standing in the doorway. Behind him stood six armed arena guards, their bodies fully armored. Seeing Maruk along with the guards made your blood burned with fiery hatred as your muscles tensed. You knew well that the chains attached to you would hold you bac from any attempts to lash. That fact was the only reason you sat still. Stepping into the cell, Maruk stood just out of range from your reach, where the chain couldn't exceed, the soldiers following in, three standing to Maruk\u2019s left, the other three to his right. Standing up from where you sat, you approached Maruk slowly, until the chain held tight, not allowing you any further, only a meter away from the human. You let out a low, long, deep hiss at Maruk. Grinning a bit wide, The arena master spoke, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cI hope yer well rested, for your going to need all that energy you muster, but first\u2026 Have I your full attention, Shaol?\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon being addressed directly, You growled low yet deep, your eyes hard on all the humans, mostly though on Maruk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cGood\u2026 now it\u2019s time to tell you ground rules, and it is mandatory for each and every one of them to be followed, and being a man of my word, I promise ye, you\u2019ll be greatly rewarded.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ceased growling as you heard him speak; for as much as you hated him, it would benefit you more to listen, figuring these <i>\u2018rewards\u2019</i>, could turn in your favor. Deciding to play along for the time, you gives a light nod as well as a short, sharp growl to acknowledge him. Maruk smirked wide as you showed acknowledgment, already feeling that you were worth the pay, as you were not a mindless beast as rumored. He continuing to speak;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cNow if yer to be treated and respected as my fair gladiator here, you got to learn the ropes and follow them at all times, let\u2019s aim for this Dawn to give Ya a good tour of the place.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaruk paused for a moment, assuring he still had your full attention, a wide grin spread on his face as he seemed to enjoy this\u2026 oh how you deep inside would love to tear and rip that smirk off him\u2026 along with every other piece of his soft meaty flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cYer reward, earned through this Dawn if you so do show that ye aren\u2019t a stupid beast that needs to be restrained all the time, will be your freedom from chains. We \u2018ere will test ya for the first time for the tour, yer to fall low and learn. Be warned for I\u2019ll make it clear and blunt; see these  soldiers? Will kill you for any attacks, so if you value life, three simple rules\u2026\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter such a long speech, Maruk pauses to clear his throat, as you stared deep and intensively at Maruk, absorbing in his words, and even though you did not understand everything, it was clear to you that you had to follow every rule and not attack anyone randomly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cFirst, is respect. Respect fellow gladiators of equal of higher rank, as lower ranks will respect you. Second, is honor. To hold honor by engaging in combat only the arena, outside the battle ring is prohibited and will result in severe punishment. Lastly, is obedience. Follow all set rules and instructions, <br>\r\nthen yer all good.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaruk finishes, having explained the three <i>\u2018simple\u2019 </i>rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt relieved that Maruk finally finished his long words, thinking he must practice a lot with speeches to be able to talk so much, almost fearing he would never shut up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cAlright, we wasted enough time here, the dawn\u2019s a wastin\u2019!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on a silent command, the three soldiers to Maruk\u2019s left advanced up to you, a gleam of fear in their eyes. You saw the fear despite how slight, finding it greatly bemusing. One of the guard\u2019s fingers fumbled with the iron clasp around your neck, until finally, the collar-like chain unlatched, seconds before clattering to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cAs promised, chain freedom if ye are a good boy, following the rules. Now, let us begin the tour! Do follow, my young gladiator\u2026\u201d</i></span></div></div>",

So far, You has listened to Maruk speak and speak, you almost wanted to roar at him to shut up! Willingly you followed as Maruk led the way, showing from different areas for the human gladiators, such as training areas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cHey boys look at this, a beast for a gladiator! Maybe now the Strikeath will have higher odds then what they got against us Bloodath ahahaha!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked in the direction of the voice. There were four men in battle armor; all of them were watching you walk alongside Maruk. One of them had a sneered smirk seen clearly past his un-kept grizzled beard. With a low snort, you kept walking close behind Maruk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cAnd \u2018ere we have alas, the battle ring.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrowds were heard shouting and cheering in the spectator sidelines, few bowmen on the small ledge platform above the pit. Two combatants were below, fighting each other vigorously. Maruk and you were above the arena pit where observers entered. You watched the fight intensively, Maruk too watched. <br>\r\nIt lasted well until one of the combatant\u2019s sword got knocked out of his hand, flying a distance before lodging into the sand. Before the defenseless man could react, his enemy surged forwards, impaling the disarmed combatant through the chest, before ripping the blade out, spewing his blood as the body collapsed dead. The crowds were roaring in cheer as the victor boasted, raising his sword high for the crowd. You flinched for a moment after witnessing the deathblow. Something inside chilled that if you wanted to survive, you will have to learn to fight;  to be trained good and show your enemies no mercy, for it was more than obvious\u2026 this was a death match arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cBah, there goes another Strikeath\u2026\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaruk said as he looked to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cBut hopefully you being part of the Strikeath team will boast their moral, and by any luck, their reputation. Well, let\u2019s go meet yer arena team now shall we?\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to tear his gaze away from the fighting pit, hearing what Maruk spoke. You growled slightly, for how you viewed it, this\u2026 The Strikeath team wasn\u2019t the greatest\u2026 though a slight, low smirk crossed your muzzle, for even though the team wasn\u2019t so great, well\u2026 perhaps you are just going to have to change that eventually.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Little to none of the other Strikeath members paid him any heed, few scowled while rolling their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cOh shut up Talv, it\u2019s not like we don\u2019t suck as it is with our rep rotted in the dirt with the blood of our fallen!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the fighters spat with annoyance in response to Talvan\u2019s words. A frown grew deep on Talvan\u2019s expression, retorting to the fighter,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cWatch your tongue, remember the codes? Respect those of a higher rank than yourself.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore any more words could be exchanged between the two, footsteps were heard approaching. Seconds later, the double wooden doors swung open, all the fighters watched to see Maruk, along with you, a dragon, enter the chambers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cHello lads, I\u2019d like to introduce yer newest team member; Shaol.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaruk spoke as he walked up to Talvan, You following close behind, ignoring the looks from the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cAlso, I heard some of that big talk lad. Rightly so I suppose, I mean, ye are the highest rank in the Strikeath, so you are the one who is going to help our Trainee here!\u201d<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nThe way Maruk spoke that last sentence sent chills down Talvan\u2019s spine, a look of unease crossing his expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cH\u2026how so..?\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalvan muttered while trying to seem calm. You snickered as you watched, finding it quite amusing while glancing between all the other members of the team, slight fear in all their eyes. <br>\r\nYou grinned wide, their fear was to your amusement!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cCome, come! Don\u2019t be shy, you\u2019ll see!\u201d<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nMaruk states while patting Talvan\u2019s back rather strongly, encouraging him to follow along. Talvan groaned quietly, knowing better then to testify against Maruk, muttering under his breath silently,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cI hope I\u2019m not going to regret boasting\u2026\u201d</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The arena pit was empty when you both arrived. All the spectators were gone. It was silent as well empty. You looked around, observing the area that not long ago witnessed the deathblow of one supposedly on your team, and now the ring was deathly quiet. The pit itself was made of sand and dirt; the grains felt between your claws were rough as you followed behind Maruk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cHere we have it, the fightin\u2019 ring itself! It\u2019s much different feel from being in it then watchin\u2019 above eh?\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaruk chuckled lightly, looking down at you, as you smirked with a thought\u2026 The \u2018rules\u2019 ran through your mind. Wasn\u2019t one of them about NOT killing EXCEPT in the \u2018arena pit\u2019? You  DID want to kill Maruk\u2026But no. For the time, you needed him so you could gain in power, and then kill him AND survive, as surly if you struck now\u2026 The other fighters would best you down and kill you. No\u2026 you will never allow yourself to be like the struck down team member, as you tell yourself that you WILL become more powerful by freely \u2018allowing\u2019 your owner to push you around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cWhy don\u2019t ya look around the pit for a little Shaol? I need to go check on the teams\u2026\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly looked up to Maruk, your attention snapping firmly to him as you noticed Maruk already backing away through the entryway you came in. To your surprise though, Maruk let lose part of a chain along the wall. Seconds later, metal gates slammed down, trapping you inside the arena ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cNow don\u2019t worry boy, only shut the gates to\u2026make sure you are still here! I\u2019ll be back my Shaol, I\u2019ll be back\u2026\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaruk then disappeared from view after speaking, leaving you staring blank at the gate now sealed as you growled low. There wasn\u2019t anything much of interest in the pit as you walked about in the sand, looking around. You were about to deem this wait time for Maruk to return to be a very boring wait, until you noticed a man approaching from the other entrance across the arena pit. A man in full plated armor. You growled low but very deep, as if warning the man to keep his distance. You were not in the best of moods, and this armored man did not halt. Instead he drew what appeared to be a long wooden sword before charging at you with a roaring yell. Your eyes widened,  body tensing as you tried to hold your ground, your slitted eyes looked more wild as your heart picked up speed until it thrummed hard inside. This man was attacking you! You felt dumbstruck for the moment, as this time, you were not restricted by chain, nor anyone to intervene you. Too much time wasted by standing still. You yelped loudly as the first blow struck you hard upside the head from the swing, the man now right in front of you. You snarled deeply, the sudden pain jolted you out of the dumbstruck trance, moving around the assailant. A second jolt of pain rushed through your body, being struck on your left side by the man who with ease turned himself to swing. It hurt, getting struck, it sent waves of pain rush through you, though you couldn't just back down! With a deep growl, you lunges at your attacker, in attempt to knock him down, though he was it seemed, well prepared. With one foot back, your attacker took a defensive stance to hold his ground, then with his shield, bashed you hard on the face, dazing you. Unable to help, you fell to the ground, stunned; attempting to pick yourself up to try attacking again though you were unable to, for Talvan showed little mercy, striking all out rapidly at you in a battering onslaught\u2026 All you could feel was the stinging, unending pain course through your body\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________________ _________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaruk peered through the fight gates before raising them, seeing you laying sprawled out and Talvan sitting, panting heavy as for all he done worn him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cWell, it seems ya gave him quite the beating!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaruk exclaimed with a whistle as he examined your body. The condition was quite bad; your scarlet red hide was battered and bruised from head to tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cI did as you asked Maruk, to beat the livin\u2019 hell out of him. Here you are.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Your beaten state, you was still conscious, and having just heard those words\u2026 you couldn't believe it! Maruk <b>PLANNED THIS</b>! He<b> KNEW</b> and <b>WANTED</b> you to be beaten!? Is this how training is? To be beaten and bruised to learn? The thought only made your hatred grow\u2026 one day\u2026 they will pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________________ _________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short time and with assistance, You were finally returning to your teams living quarters to sleep. You felt such the need to sleep; to recover, almost losing consciousness a few times while walking down the halls. In the main lobby as they were passing through, you noticed a large stone craving that read out the ranks of the arena, from rank fifteen to one. Staring at it tired and weak, you forced a smirk with the thought\u2026 that one day; you could become the greatest rank, and avenge yourself for all the losses.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pain started to become a common daily feeling. Six long and hard years of beatings, bruising and injury by wooden weapons was inflicted upon you. Your training was ruthless. Maruk assured that they were rough on you. You didn\u2019t understand at first to why Maruk enforced such hard training, and that misunderstanding caused more hatred to grow in your heart\u2026 Until one dawn, you overheard Maruk speak with some other person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cWhy Maruk? Why do you consist with this \u2018training\u2019 on the beast? You should of by now thrown him in the ring to fight, and if he dies well poor on him.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cWhy? Why? Let me tell ye why damn why, because fer one, ye aren\u2019t the one who paid five steel for him, two, we both know it's a rough crowd out there watchin and the Bloodath ain\u2019t gettin\u2019 any weaker, <br>\r\nso I want MY dragon fit and in top shape fer his first real match, and this is the best way. I don\u2019t have him beaten with crafted wooden arms just fer the fun of it.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaruk paused, letting out a sigh before continuing; <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cAs hard it is on Shaol\u2026 It be the best way to toughen him up to train.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other man replied with annoyance, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cSo then why all the special treatment eh? The food rations, the freedom of being loose without any chains, and all the benefits you give him?\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cOh Maruk, you act as if you <b>ACTUALLY CARE FOR THE BEAST!\u201d</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later you heard Maruk speak harsher than he ever heard before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cAnd how about then I place YE out in the arena ring, who has no training, against one of the Bloodath eh?! Then feed yer corpse to my dragon! It be mine own choice how I train and raise Shaol, and ye have bloody damn no right to tell ME the provided care I give him is wrong! Now, be off with ya, before I DO throw you in the pit!\u201d</i><br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t believe all you heard that dawn four years ago. Maruk? <b>Caring?!</b> It was a complete shock to you\u2026but it DID explain many a thing\u2026 And thus ever since that dawn, at the date 2E 358 4 2D,  You started to adapt himself to shift the view on the whole training process you are being forced upon. In the very beginning of your training, when you were but a yearling, it all started with the man in plated armor. True, that dawn you got the daylights thrashed out of you, though over short time you learned to try to fight back, so you could avoid the pain. The humans only wore armor because how weak the humans flesh is; as you have personally tasted and felt it before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n When you did achieve you first victory in training, it was a huge moment of triumph for you; having lunged at the weapon to bite at the wood, gripping it in your maw and thrashing with your head to tear it out of the attacker\u2019s hands, disarming him. That triumph was short lived though. After you disarmed them, the training session was ended or switched to a different human. You had to learn over the years to become dependent on your growing attributes, such as your reflex and agility, while slowly gaining in strength and endurance. The humans in combat though\u2026 were unlike anything you could ever manage. You had to learn how to gain advantage over them, which was nowhere near an easy task, nor achieved yet. They were skilled, who could stand on two hinds, and had flexibility unmatchable by you with body maneuverability. After slowly proving yourself to adapting to skill, new wooden weapons were introduced; round and hard. After a few encounters with the maces, it was learned fast; blunt weapons hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the day... Your training has come to an end... And that the real test was about to begin. Your first real death match.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You looked back into Maruk\u2019s eyes for a moment, your heart pounding with both excitement and fear. This was it. This was the dawn that you are to fight for real, a real death match. You were now fitted in newly forged iron armor, which was made out of many separate pieces of plate so that it could fit onto you. A single long and thick plating was securely attached to your natural chest plated scales, along with a much thinner plating that was light for your back. Those two pieces were combined and attached to act as a dragon armor suit, held together with thick leather straps. Even with the majority of your body protected, your left and right sides of your body were exposed as the two major plates protected only your spine and chest, leaving even your belly vunurable. Lastly equipped upon you is a metal helmet specificity forged to fit you, leaving your jaw unprotected by metal to freely bite and thrash, designed to only protect your skull.

The roars of the crowd, the sand under your paws... the armor on your body\u2026 It all made your heart race wild. The thrill already was making your blood rush, your eyes fully slitted, as damn right you will unleash your fury in combat; for the wild blood of a feral coursed through your veins by birth. As you stepped into the arena ring, you noticed your opponent approaching as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>~Not yet\u2026~</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou told yourself as you looked over your enemy combatant, muscles tense. He looked no older then Nineteen, equipped with an iron longsword in his right hand, chainmail upon his body, and a small round shield on his other arm. He bore a medium cap helmet. Most noticeable though was his weight, he was somewhat round and stocky, with what seemed almost like a pig-face. Only slight fear gripped you because... unlike training, this was real, and to the death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cWow, this should be easier than I thought! I feared some man with a sword, not a stupid beast!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man laughed as he looked over you, almost in disbelief that you are his opponent. <br>\r\nHissing in response you stared firm, not taking your eyes off the enemy.

A flurry of blows from the human\u2019s sword came, first a lower left swing; <br>\r\nducked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobam was noticeably over confident in himself as he pressed his attacks relentlessly upon you as if expecting to strike you down fast.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou will not let him have that satisfaction! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis strikes weren't all harmless though\u2026 minor scratches and wounds were inflicted on upon your sides, causing a sting of pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHissing with anger you backed up slowly, the crowds roaring in cheer. Most of the cheers were inaudible, though some you heard\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cComeon Shaol yer a dragon! You can do it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRip him apart!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were cheering\u2026 cheering for you! It was as if your confidence was renewing as you held your ground, looking for any weakness that your enemy showed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious that the majority of his strength was his sword, and unlike wooden weaponry that was used against you only for training, you couldn't bite the metal weapon directly\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, what about the limb controlling the sword?</span></div></div>",
