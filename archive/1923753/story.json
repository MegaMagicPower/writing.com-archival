            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chris was waiting in the lobby of the hotel building the casting office was using for auditions...He was an aspiring actor that was getting pretty popular, a couple more successful films and he could be made in the shade as a legit A-List celebrity, right now he was a bit recognizable but not drop-dead recognizable and Chris really wanted that fame...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his agent's instructions, he auditioned for the role of Tyler Meyer, the eldest kid of the Meyer family, college-bound whose family wanted to go on one last vacation as a family before college rolled around...A family comedy wasn't exactly the biggest film that Chris would've been interested in going after but once he heard exactly who was directing it, he knew he needed to get in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael Screnton, a top Hollywood director, tied up with some of the biggest Hollywood cinematic projects in years, he also had a routine with his films, after every set of big-budget blockbusters he directed, he then took a break and filmed a different sort of movie out of his supposed wheelhouse, award-bait dramas, Broadway musical film adaptations, video game films and even internet tv series!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever Screnton did, he did successfully and often times when those blockbusters came around again, it would often be cast with people from his other 'break' films, his award-winning actor from a historical drama? Major movie villain. Musical supporting actress? Female lead in his big action movie. Video game film voice actor? CGI and Live-Action performer as the main centerpiece of his project!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he wanted to get an in on Screnton's Production Posse and get rocketed up to the stars, he would need to impress him in these callbacks and when his name was called in he quickly entered the main room they were using and noted that two other actors were in there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne male actor that he didn't really recognize, possibly some small town kid that Screnton had an eye on, the other male actor in the room was someone that Chris recognized from some commercials and as an extra in some tv series filming around here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then turned his attention to the man at the center of the table and recognized Screnton right there as he said, \"If you're read up on me, you probably know that my audition processes when it gets to callbacks are a bit unorthodox, for now I want the following script right here to be read by all of you\" and pointed to three copies of the script in front of him that Chris and the other actors grabbed and looked through as Screnton said, \"In order to get a better read on how the character you want is to be portrayed, I want you to read lines for other characters you may not have auditioned for or may not even think fit you in more than one way or another, I want to see if you're willing to follow my orders to the best of your degree...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrenton soon looked over at his clipboard and said, \"Angelo, I want you to read for Tyler\" Chris looked over at the other male in the room, huh so his name was Angelo before Screnton continued, \"Derrick, read for Greg\" as Chris thought to himself, 'A little odd but that's okay' Greg was the 10-year old main kid on the cast and while it may seem odd to some, Screnton had done this before with other actresses or actors that he'd worked with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chris, read for Tommy\" and Chris soon nodded to cover up his confusion a bit...Tommy Meyer was a 5-year old soon to be 6-year old kid who was the runt of the Meyer family, the little kid who was the kid-appeal character for the movie, his stuff was either to cause mischief for his two older brothers or to have cute bonding scenes with the rest of the family...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, Chris, Derrick and Angelo all listened as Screnton said, \"Read the script from pages 45-52 and remember be the characters you are reading for\" and had his camera on to record this as all three of them quickly got into the scene they were acting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelo was a perfectly aloof older big brother to the two of them as Derrick showed the middle child syndrome fine and was perfectly at ease with being the center of the scene as Chris was perfectly fine with being a ball of energy around the two of them as they tried to get Chris out of a sugar rush...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that scene was done, they then swapped roles around to Screnton's liking and then got to play the roles they had auditioned for...Angelo had auditioned for Charlie, a best friend of Tyler who had snuck on board the family vacation trip, Derrick got to read for Cooper, the main unknown  rival for Tyler and Chris soon read for Tyler himself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all of them were done, Screnton looked over all of his notes and said, \"Thank you very much, please wait in separate rooms here while I make a decision and inform you personally...\" and then handed them room keys for the hotel, Chris taking his key and waiting in his hotel room for over an hour until the door opened and Screnton came in and said, \"I'll be honest, I liked what I saw from your audition\" as Tyler nodded and said, \"Thank you sir\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr.Screnton soon put a bag down on the couch of the hotel room and said, \"It's been said that I have quite an eye for spotting out good talent and I like what I saw in you however, I do have a slight problem\" as Chris immediately got worried as he asked, \"What problem do you have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a problem with you is that I have a problem with casting\" Mr. Screnton said before continuing with a bit of tiredness, \"I do not have any quality actors that could play Greg and Tommy, casting has been working nationwide and even into Canada to try to find kids that I liked for those roles and could act to my standards\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a hard problem\" Chris said to Screnton before he opened the bag and pulled out a bunch of pills saying, \"Are you familiar with these?\" Chris's eyes widened as he saw that he had regression pills on him and said, \"I'm familiar with them\" though was wondering why he needed to go this far...Regression pills had been out on the market for quite a while now, people knew about them and used for a variety of circumstances and here he was being offered the regression pills to play a 5-year-old, no 6-year-old kid in a family comedy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this seems a bit drastic, but I could see you had an instinctual grasp on how to play Tommy, Derrick had the same grasp on playing Greg but I cannot find anyone else that I like and can perform to my standards\" Mr Screnton said with a tired tone to his voice as if he wanted to get this over with quickly and said, \"If you are willing to do this, I am willing to cast you in any other production I put on, you want a role, you've got it, all that you would need to do is take the pills to get the role, I will owe you a fantastical debt for this, are you willing to accept this? Because I just casted Angelo as Tyler, if you don't take this offer, you don't get the role...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now Chris was in a dilemma, regression pills were monitored by the government, you'd have to register yourself as a user so that doctors could monitor you and make sure that when the time was right to reage you with age progression pills...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to work with Screnton to get him into the main spotlight of Hollywood, the work he had put in into getting into the A-List could take a massive hit because if he didn't accept this offer, someone else would and they would happily take the rub that comes with working with Michael Screnton...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what other choice could there be? Chris said, \"Alright then, I'll do it\" and took the pills that were handed to him and Screnton said, \"Very good, I look forward to working with you in the future, Mr. Miles, expect the contract to be sent to your agent, and make sure to take those pills before you go to bed tonight, you have a free day in this hotel as well as a voucher for free room service dinner so use it wisely, now I need to go and talk to Derrick as I'll be casting him as Greg\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Mr. Screnton left the hotel room leaving Chris wondering if he just found exactly where he'd be willing to go to become a star in this business...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting a call from his agent who faxed him over the contract to sign and then signed it before getting a call that his agent would be around to pick him up in the morning after his pills were taken, Chris sighed before going to use that voucher to eat dinner before getting himself ready to sleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ate the dinner with gusto before going to the shower and washed himself dry before taking the pills and going to bed naked...With how regression worked, his clothes wouldn't be able to fit him then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he slept and while he slept the regression pills did their work...</span></div></div>",

He could not sleep normally so he decided to watch TV until he would randomly fall asleep.<br>\r\nUnfortunately for him, the effect of the two pills took place on his body and shifted slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My body... It feels strange.\" Chris thought. He was right but the TV distracted him and his transformation began to change him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt first started with his height. Chris originally was a 5'10, but due to the pills, his height went down to 5'6.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah... Why does the room seem bigger? My bed?\" Chris doubted. He wanted to check but the TV show he was watching was important for his acting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to his transformation, Chris's arms began to get slim and skinny, losing all the muscle fat that made Chris look strong. His arms were feminine. Next, his stomach got smaller and thin, and all the fat around the stomach went to his hips. His hips were feminine too. This change caused Chris to freak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck is happening to me?!\" Chris freaked out. He checked his body and noticed it was changing to something.... Feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My hips are shaping my body into a sexy figure a woman has. One of an hourglass. Wait, am I becoming a woman? Those pills....\" Chris said but he was interrupted by a pain that came from his chest. His chest began to hurt a lot and it soon created two d-cup sized breasts that would attract a male's interest. Chris moaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boobs? Oh no, I am becoming a woman!\" Chris realized. But the transformation was not over. His upper body was complete, only his lower body and face remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt soon got to tge lower body, and the most unfortunate thing occur to Chris. He lost his manlihood part. It was replaced by the feminine part of a woman. Later, his legs became hairless, and they got slimmer. His feet got smaller and became a foot size seven for women. Later, his thighs gained most of the fat and got thick, thick enough to show a beatiful body. Finally, Chris witnessed his ass got an expansion to become an ass of a great quality, having the shape of bubble ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Chris cried. He could not take this but the transformation was soon shifting his face and hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face got smaller and now had a round shape, as for his throat, it got smaller and lost its adams apple. This made Chris's voice to become high-pitched to soon speak a voice of a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh... My.. Voice... It changed.\" Chris whispered with his new feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the transformation, his lips got thick and a bit smaller, his nose and eyes got small too, and his eyebrows got thin and small. Finally, his ears got small as well and his hair, which was brown, grew longer all the way to where his tailbone was abd it changed color. His hair color was now light brown with a mixture of blond color on some of his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transformation was now complete, and the new Chris was a body of a woman, and it had the good looks an actress had. But Chris was mad as she knew this event occur because of the pills. And those pills came from the director.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would he do this to me?\" Chris said in her feminine voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still nighttime, and Chris felt so tired as her body was now forever to be of a woman. A body that represents beauty and belongs to a model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Chris somehiw fell asleep in her new body and the next day she would find the director and find answers, but Chris realized she was a woman and the clothes she has are very huge and do not fit on her. She cannot go naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I can order some clothes online. Technology these days are useful for once.\" Chris commented with anxiety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she went to her computer and went to a woman's online clothing store. Chris did not know how the website worked, but she clicked on the option order. She soon came to a place where it had two categories:<br>\r\nCasual<br>\r\nFancy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris did not understood this female categories, and without realizing, she clicked on....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You reply, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you sis!  I\u2019m casted as Taylor.  I\u2019ll be your younger brother in the movie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman gives you a strange look and asks, \u201cYou are Taylor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou confidently reply, \u201cYep!  My agent said this would be an easy gig.  Filming is only like 6 months right?  I can handle running around as a seven year old boy for 6 months or so.  The paycheck will be worth it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman chuckles and you ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d  She replies, \u201cYou read the script right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, \u201cNot yet.  I\u2019m only going to be 5.  My agent said I would be able to ad-lib most of my lines.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman cracks a grin, \u201cYou know the title of the movie right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.  I just heard it based in the Victorian ages.  My agent mentioned something about two princesses fighting over who gets to become the heir to the throne?  I wasn\u2019t really paying attention.  My agent said my role has a lot of speaking lines though.  I assume I\u2019m the little brother in the drama while the struggle ensues as the two princesses figure out who is the rightful heir. \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman giggles, \u201cYou are partially right with the plot.  But\u2026..You realize that MALE heirs always receive the throne in kingdoms right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea.  So?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen how could there be a little brother casted in the movie?  Wouldn\u2019t he be the rightful heir to the throne before the sisters?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly get a lump in your throat.  \u201cUh oh!\u201d  You say.  You desperately grab the script and start paging though the lines.  You suddenly realize that \u2018Taylor\u2019 is a girl\u2019s name!  You look up at the woman with wide eyes.  She is giggling, \u201cNice to meet you Princess Taylor!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOMG!  Taylor is a princess?!!  My agent didn\u2019t tell me that!  I\u2019m casted as a girl in this movie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the woman feels her body starting to tingle.  She winks, \u201cMy transformation is starting!  I always like this part!\u201d  You watch in awe as the woman starts to lose her body mass. Her hair becomes thicker and her age begins to regress.  Her wide hips regress into a pubescent teen\u2019s body and her breasts shrink to perky A cups.  Moments later the transformation is complete.  Where a woman in her late 30\u2019s once sat is  now a 13 year old girl.  She holds her over sized blouse and pants up to hold her modesty, \u201cI\u2019m gana need some smaller clothes!\u201d  She knocks on the producer\u2019s door to let him know her transformation is complete.  The producer lets her in and closes the door.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You are interrupted while reading an article on how to grow better fingernails by a feminine voice clearing their throat to get your attention. You look up and see that a brown haired woman in her mid thirties was holding a clipboard and looked to be in a hurry. \"It would be great if you could follow me sir.\" She said as you followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You accompany the woman as she enters the elevator, you standing next to her as she punched the 56 key into the board of colorful lit up buttons. The elevator is fast as it moved up the infrastructure of the building to the desired floor, where it stops and you follow the woman to a room beyond a thick glass and airtight door lock, filled with people. \"Please wait here sir.\" The woman says as you walk into the room with the other people who identified themselves as actors and actresses. You converse for a few moments as more people open the room, but everyone is silenced after about ten minutes by the sudden slamming of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You and your peers look beyond the glass at the team of executive looking people in suits who are in front of the now revealed button on the front of the holding cell. \"Ahem.\" You hear a man say as you listen in on the speaker. \"By now, you are all probably confused as to why we have you in this machine. But fear not, I am here to tell you the reasoning behind your entrapment. We have given the celebrities who work for us a bonus, and that bonus is a little person they can have alongside their salary. The thing is, who would volunteer to belong to someone else?

Bad news is you can still feel the pain. Sorry about that.\" He then pushed the button and a strange has filled the room. You and the other people started freaking out as it got closer and closer to you. The gas was soon unavoidable, and you brothe it in just like you would the usual oxygen. The world became lighter as you drifted off into a deep sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n When you awoke you were naked, and your legs were zip tied to each other along with your arms. You seemed to make out you situation, but it was a frightening one. You must have been shrunk to six inches in height and now you were in some little paper goody bag on a table. You screamed for help, but we're just answered by someone else in your same predicament yelling back \"Shut up Dickwad! We tried it already.\" You then just rest and wait.

When she'd set out for Hollywood, she'd never imagined her first star role would be in a women in prison flick.  Still, it was the star role and she was tired of playing bit parts.  The fact she was being paid pretty handsomely for something that was essentially b-movie schlock didn't hurt either.  She could kiss her agent for arranging such a sweet deal.  If it wasn't for the money, she'd never have agreed to it, lead role or no.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd just returned from meeting with her agent and producer where she'd signed the contract and had been given a script to peruse.  She didn't know whether to laugh or groan at the title,<i>Big House Babes.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My first title role and it's in a babes behind bars b-flick,\" she muttered to her thoughts aloud.  Worst case, she could be the next Linda Blair or Pam Greer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was even an illustration on the cover, which Olivia assumed was some concept art.  It showed a young woman in a rather skimpy looking prison outfit and chains.  She was being escorted past rows of barred prison cells by two muscular men in guard uniforms.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she examined the illustration, Olivia couldn't help thinking how much the woman looked just like her.  They had the same shoulder length blond hair, green eyes, and athletic build.  Even the structure the face looked like hers.  Could they have drawn this for her, to show what her costume would be?  But no, she'd just signed the contract an hour ago and was given the script, illustration and all, on the spot.  There's no way they could've intentionally drawn it to look like her.  It must just be one hell of a coincidence.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the thought out of her mind, she sat down in her favorite chair in the living room and began to look over the script.  </span></div></div>",

He was in plenty of movies, but he couldn't get anything more than a minor role. He was called upon by many casting directors, but never for any reason other to be that guy. That guy who was just, well, a guy. An average looking middle-aged man. All he ever did was stay in the background and look as insignificant as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, he was a little tired of this. However, his hopes were brightened when he heard some exciting news from the studio. To put it simply, the studio had commisioned these pills that could only be described as \"magic\". Apparently, a simple gulp of one could turn any actor into the perfect actor for a certain role. Nobody was quite sure how they worked, but they knew for sure they did. And Daniel wanted it more than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted one so badly, in fact, that he actually stole one. He wasn't sure how he got past security and got one of the thousand dollar miracle pills from the director's desk, but he did. So, there he was with the key to his success: a tiny pink pill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Daniel honestly had no idea what role the pill had in store for him or even what movie it was for. Finn Martins directed almost everything, from heavy war dramas to children's comedy. He honestly repected the director's abilities despite never getting a real part in any of his movies. Still, the fact stood that he had no idea what this pill would do to him. All he knew was that this had to be a major role, or else they wouldn't have made a pill for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well,\" he said to himself. \"It's this are obscurity. After twenty eight years in Hollywood, I'm finally a real role, no matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in the movie studio's bathroom, Daniel Sandow swallowed the pink pill and sealed his fate. Whatever was going to happen, it had to be better than just being Customer #4.</span></div></div>",

This really sucked right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, right at that moment, he felt a buzzing in his pocket; his cell phone was going off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who could that be?\" he asked himself as he picked up his phone. The name on the message instantly spoke to him: Finn Martins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hello?\" he asked as he opened the phone and brought it to his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, this is Daniel Shallow correct?\" asked the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\" said Daniel, glad to hear from the famed director.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, good to hear from you Daniel. I remember you from that last movie you did with me.\" spoke the man with some pride. Daniel was a bit flattered to hear that the director remembered him, despite his role being nonexistent in that movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you sir. Is there something you needed to say?\" asked Daniel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, of course. I'm beginning to film a new movie later today. Since I remembered you, I wanted to know if you'd like a part in it.\" asked the director. Daniel was excited to hear that news. Finally, something good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be glad to, sir! What's it called?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The movie is called \"School Daze\". It's a story featuring a couple of children, but we need adult stars too of course. You can get more details on the plot and script later. Filming starts at 3:00 this afternoon.\" said the director.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel looked at his watch, seeing that it was about 11:30 right now. Plenty of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be great, sir.\" said Daniel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent.\" said Finn. \"Now, feel free to head out to the break room where they have a catering table for the actors. It'd be nice to introduce yourself to them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, sir.\" said Daniel. Apparently done, the director thanked Daniel again and hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, something that might be worth the time.\" said Daniel as he happily walked out of the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be worth his time all right.</span></div></div>",

He was never allowed there before, mainlt because the production staff never considered him much of an actor. But now, he already had the role. They <b>had</b> to let him in. And as soon as he reached the door, he was met by a security guard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to need to see your authorization, sir,\" the guard told Daniel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of authorization, exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your driver's liscense would suffice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, very well then,\" Daniel said while taking out his wallet. As he took out his liscense, he failed to take in that his wallet was a lightish red instead of its original brown. \"Here you go sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe security guard inspected the liscense and made sure it matched the identity of one of the actors on his authorization list. He went through the information on the list and began to mentally check off the details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel Sandow? Check. Brown hair? Check. Green eyes? Check. Age 40? The guard looked at the actual man in front of him first to make sure he looked that age. He could see that his hair had a little grey strands, but still had plenty of color. Seemed about the right age. Check enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Mr. Sandow, you can go now,\" the guard said while handing the man back his wallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, sir.\" Daniel then proceeded to put his liscense back in his wallet and walked through the door. By now, his wallet was an unmistakably hot pink and was glittering. Not that it mattered to him. All he cared about right now was getting something for lunch. He was <i>starving </i>and that pill didn't quite hit the spot. As he walked on over to the fruit cart, Daniel's newly restored hair was starting to brighten to a golden blond.</span></div></div>",

He was so looking forward to it that he didn't even notice his wallet or hair, or even the fact that the guard had said that his license said 40 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, as he grabbed a tray, someone bumped into him from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry about that.\" said a male voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel looked behind him to see a man of about 35 years or so. He looked good for his age though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's no problem at all.\" said Daniel. \"I'm Daniel Shallow.\" he said as he offered for a handshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a pleasure. I'm Thomas Drake.\" said Thomas, grabbing a tray himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are you in the movie too?\" asked Daniel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean School Daze? No, I'm not honestly. However, someone I know is in it, so I was allowed to come by for moral support.\" said Thomas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? What kind of person?\" asked Daniel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just a normal family member. Surely you understand.\" smiled Thomas. Daniel smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" said Daniel. Anyway, as they got themselves some healthy things like fruit and all that good stuff, Daniel noticed that there was a section for some sweets. You know, candy and all that good stuff. Suddenly, that stuff looked very appealing to Daniel. He had as much a sweet tooth as any normal person, but his stomach seemed especially needing for something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, guess I'll get some of those.\" he smiled as he grabbed a handful of some bags of sweets and all that. Thomas chuckled behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You grab at candy like a little kid.\" said Thomas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" laughed Daniel as the two left the food section and found themselves a seat together. As they did, Daniel couldn't see, but his license was now showing 35 years old on its front. The wallet was already pretty much changed. However, as he sat down, more stands of hair began turning to a golden blonde color, engulfing almost all of his hair, although it wasn't done yet. Also, beneath his long-sleeved shirt and jeans, the hair on his body was beginning to lesson, as strands of hair disappeared from his arms and legs, and any other place of consequence. Such a thing wouldn't be needed for later on.</span></div></div>",

All I know is that the director chose me personally and told me to come to the set at four. Must be a big one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Thomas looked at Daniel get another plate of chocolate syrup covered marshmellows. Weird. \"Say, Daniel, think you should get something more, you know, healthy to eat before lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lunch? I thought this was lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were planning on eating all those sweets for lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't like any of the fruit here and there's no real food here, so yeah,\" he brushed off while shoving another marshmellow in his mouth and brushing a strand of blond hair from his face. What he didn't notice was that said hair had become extra volumous and grown down to his neck. Even with its new lenghth, it certaintly looked better kept than his original scruffy hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, let's go. We're getting some real lunch somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Daniel quickly wiped any chocolate that was present on his face. As he did, any facial hair he possessed was literally wiped from existance. His face was now as bare as as a baby's. \"Like where?\"</span></div></div>",

I came early just in case they arrived.\" said Thomas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes sense.\" said Daniel, agreeing with Thomas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that settled, Daniel and Thomas walked through the studio normally, talking little tidbits every now and then. Daniel felt like Thomas was a good man, and he wanted to know a bit more about him. He did wonder a bit about Thomas' family. He wouldn't elaborate too much. Maybe he didn't like talking about them or something. Oh well, it was none of his personal business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, as they walked out, Daniel passed by a woman on the way out. He did a brief double take though, as he appeared to be at eye level with the woman. He was normally pretty tall, far above most women. However, he could definitely see that he was eye level with that woman, who was probably at 5'4 or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright?\" asked Thomas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel turned to Thomas, and his eyes widened as he could see that Thomas was taller than him. However, Thomas didn't grow at all. If that woman was any indication, Daniel was shorter now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.....nothing...nothing at all.\" said Daniel, not wanting to worry Thomas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas didn't pay it any mind as they walked out to his Dodge Durango in the parking lot. Getting into the passenger seat, Daniel got his seat belt on and watched Thomas get his car started. For a brief second, Daniel wondered how he started the car, until realizing that that was simple car knowledge. How could he ever forget that? Perhaps all that sugar was going to his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, without incident, Thomas drove the two of them along. The restaurant he had in mind was a nearby Red Robin, which Daniel suddenly found himself very excited to see. He hadn't been there in a long time after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This should be fun.\" he smiled to himself. He was so focused on it though that he didn't notice his hair grow even more, as his golden blonde locks now grew a tiny bit longer, finally stopping just below his shoulders in long soft strands of hair, looking as if it was taken care of daily.</span></div></div>",

No matter how much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, my family member I talked about earlier can really bring in the money. Besides, you seem like a nice guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel was about to thank the man, but all that came out was \"Awesome! Let's go!\" As if the excited outburst wasn't strange enough, his voice actually rose a pitch when he did it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they got inside, Daniel was actually having a little trouble deciding what to get. He knew he would really like to taste a BBQ Chicken Burger for the first time in years, but he didn't have the appetite for it. Maybe he ate a little too much candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whattya want, Daniel?\" Thomas asked after already ordering his sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I'm honestly not that hungry right now. I think I'll just get the Cheesy Mac 'n Cheesy on the kids menu.\" Thomas couldn't help but laugh at the fact that he used the full name of the item.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it could have just been the candy making his appetite decrease, there was an even more obvious reason to it. Daniel's stomach was starting to cave in, losing much of his belly fat that started to redeposit itself into his hips. He did pride himself for his clean figure at age 28.</span></div></div>",

He began regressing past 20 years old, looking very much like a young college student right now, although that wouldn't be where it would end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they got their meals, to which Daniel ate happily.

Not that he looked down at him, it's just that he felt more like Daniel was a responsibility. \"So, should we look in Sear's first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Look at that place!\" Thomas shouted in a <i>much </i>higher voice than usual. In fact, it would easy to mistake for an adolescent girl's.

It had an average skirt for that size, with straps since it wouldn't cover the shoulders. It looked like something you could normally wear in public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that looks cute.\" said Daniel as Thomas walked over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it does. Why don't you try that on?

Unfortunately, his feet proved too big at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid, pretty shoes,\" Daniel muttered to himself. \"Get on right-<b>OOF</b>!\" The struggle to get them on proved to be too dificult as he ended up slipping and falling on his face.

In fact, his feet were the perfect size! Nice and dainty, too, that went well with the pink nail polish on his toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel took a look at the shoes Thomas had just put on his perfectly sized feet and smiled. \"Thanks, dad,\" smiled Daniel Drake.</span></div></div>",

He had to admit he was kind of cute as he kept nearing closer towards him. In fact, he was starting to look more and more cute as he kept on nearing. In fact, he was starting to feel tingly all over as soon as he got within talking distance. Strangely, it felt the most intense on his crotch. Now he really felt the need to talk to this boy.</span></div></div>",

Are you \"Dani\"?\" asked the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's me!\" giggled Danielle, or \"Dani\" as he called her. \"But where did you hear that name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....I think it was the big guy who told me that.\" he chuckled a bit before calming down. \"I'm Max Hall by the way.

She was dressed fashionably for her age and status, wearing sporty chic leggings, a blouse concealed by an expensive leather jacket, topped off with a silk head scarf and a pair of designer sunglasses shading her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I received a call from Disney and they were really, really interested in you,\" he ran his fingers over the printed script in rapid succession, \"like first choice they thought of interested. Th-\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the first time I've heard that Cal. I'm artiste, my skills are always in demand. But the question is, is it worth it to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The money is worth it! They're offering a two million advance, eight million when it's complete. And! AND a 1% profit sharing deal! Think about it, that's more than you've made in the past decade. And to be really honest, if you don't take it I don't know for how much longer you can employ me as your agent. So I'm begging you, pleading with you, please hear this out. You haven't even heard the pitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara looked at the left hand wall momentarily. \"All right, what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Disney is wanting to reboot the classic animated movie 'Sleeping Beauty' for live action, but the twist is it focuses on <span class=\"cgrape\">Maleficent</span> is as the main character. Now if you're answer is 'no', Disney already told me they're prepared to go with their second choice, Angelina Jolie, for the part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe premise piqued Barbara's interest, \"I remember that movie when I was a little girl, let me see that script.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParsing through the script didn't alleviate Barbara's concerns about the project. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Maleficent</span> is good in this? Okay. I remember her being an evil, spiteful witch, but whatever, you can't have a villain as your protagonist in a major Hollywood production. She has a young, handsome man into turns into a raven as her companion, that might be fun.\" Reaching to the end climax brought a frown of disappointment. \"Wait. She doesn't become a <span class=\"cgrape\">dragon</span> at the end? Cal, can we get a script rewrite on this? If we can, I'll absolutely accept.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalvin grinned at her enthusiasm, \"I'll get right on the phone with Disney. We'll see what adjustments they're willing to make.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Cal called the film's producers, Barbara pulled out a tiny makeup mirror, inspecting herself. She was always considered attractive in a classy kind of way. And for fifty-five years old, she did look pretty good, years of expensive beauty treatments have preserved her looks as best as they can. A few wrinkles here and there, and her once platinum blonde locks have grayed over time. But she could not deny the fact she <i>looked</i> fifty-five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCal returned to her a few minutes later. \"Good news Barbara, Disney agreed to all of your demands! They're ready to begin filming in a month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara looked back at him, \"Give it to me straight Cal, are you sure I can still play roles like this? It seems like the job for a woman twenty years younger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Babs, that's no way to talk. With make-up and modern special effects, we could have you playing lead roles for another two decades. Really, you owe it to the world to give another patented Barbara Stewart performance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nickname \"Babs\" rankled Barbara a little, \"I've told you before, Cal, don't call me Babs. I've always hated that nickname. But thank you for the words of encouragement, I'll take that with me on day one of filming.\"</span></div></div>",

She had just finished filming all of her scenes for '<span class=\"cgrape\">Maleficent</span>'. Her feet ached and she was ready for some R&amp;R during the movie's post-production before she would have to do the inevitable media circuit to promote the movie. But in the meantime, no more more waking up at 5 A.M. for two hours of makeup sessions and getting prosthetic horns glued onto her head. But she had to admit, she had some fun playing the devious fairy and her cast mates were pleasant enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby came over to Barbara, shaking her hand enthusiastically. \"It's been an honor and a pleasure working with you Ms. Stewart! It's not everyday a director gets to work with a two time Academy Award winner and four times nominated actor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually it's two Academy Awards, and five nominations, but who's counting?\" Barbara was moderately flattered by the younger director. \"So when do you need me in the recording booth for the <span class=\"cgrape\">dragon</span> scenes? It's going to be CGI in post as is standard industry practice these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh about that, James Rothstein, our producer, wanted a word with you. Something about plans for special effects. I didn't really know much about it, it's cutting-edge stuff he and the studio have been really wanting to try it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, James Rothstein did walk on set, approaching Barbara eagerly. \"Okay, so we've shot most of the mover already, everything up to the climax and including the resolution. We just need to set up for the big scene. Here's the address to a place I need you to go to.\" He handed her a small card with an address and date: tomorrow at 1 P.M. \"They'll get you all ready for your scene.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara was caught off guard by Rothstein's curtness. \"Bobby had told me you had plans for some kind of cutting-edge special effect, is this some new kind of CGI? Do you need me to do motion capture like with all the dots on my face?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll find out when you get there. Just be there on that time tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her reservations, Barbara did as she was told, she was a professional after all, and still under contract to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*     *      *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill unsure about all this, Barbara decided to call up Cal so he could come with her. He wasn't just her agent, Cal was a friend and confidant to her. And this place was not any kind of recording studio or CGI artist studio she had ever heard of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey pulled up in the parking lot in one of Barbara's expensive little sports cars. The address was correct as far as they could tell. Barbara looked at her wrist watch: 12:52, early, but not too early. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this is the right place,\" Cal said. It was large building, industrial looking, with a high roof and very large air conditioner units on top. Blue and red colored tubes rose from the ground and reached the roof, while at the ground bent sideways to carry whatever was inside to the other side of the facility. Very large service entrances with garage doors dotted the side of the building opposite of the pipes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair walked inside where they were greeted by a secretary. \"I, apparently have an appointment here according to James Rothstein.\" Barbara told the receptionist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked younger, maybe late twenties or early thirties; then her eyes saw down at her clipboard, \"Barbara Stewart for the one o'clock consultation? Right this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis place was so strange, they haven't even said what they were or had a sign posted anywhere. Barbara looked at Cal who only widened his eyes, looked away, and awkwardly reshuffled his jacket before following Barbara who followed the receptionist. They were led back past a couple of metal swinging doors where a man in a lab coat and James Rothstein were conversing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this will give us the results we're looking for?\" James asked the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not been completely tested yet, but that's what you and the Disney corporation have been funding our research for. But all of our estimates say it should.\" This answer was good enough for James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh Barbara come here. Meet Dr. Taylor, he'll be prepping you for your final scene tomorrow back on the set.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara nervously stepped forward. \"What is this place? And what do you do here, Mr.- Dr. Taylor.\" She stumbled on his title.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Horzene Biotechnology and Research Labs.\" A technician or another doctor came from beyond presenting a hypodermic needle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this? Are you seriously injecting me with something weird substance!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames, in a surprising bit of calmness answered, \"Now Barbara, this is a simple procedure to help you fulfill your contractually obligated role. If you want your eight million dollar payout and the 1% profit share you'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara looked back to Cal for his opinion. Cal gritted his teeth, \"It's highly unorthodox... but I... think you need to go through with it Barbara.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Barbara's turn to grit her teeth, only she did not purse her lips, refusing to betray her true feelings. \"Fine,\" she uttered. Dr. Taylor took the syringe from the technician and applied it to Barbara's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon being injected Barbara started to feel strange. Her vision blurred and her skin felt itchy and burning, more so than she'd ever felt in her life. \"What the hell was in that syringe!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Taylor answered back, \"A mutagenic cocktail of specially engineered genetic components. We included many kinds of reptile material and bat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll sue you for this!\" Barbara threatened at the top of her lungs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mutation was taking rapid effect. Barbara's skin that hereto been itching and burning began to peel out as black scabrous material erupted from underneath: scales. Barbara's eyes became cross-eyed looking at the center of her face as her nose and mouth elongated into a muzzle. On the opposite side of her body, Barbara felt a racking pain build down from her lower spine and backside as a tail extended from her pant leggings, breaking a clear hole through as the tail quickly gained length and girth. Small wings, a result of the bat DNA, sprouted from her back, initially straining her white shirt before making holes in that garment too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrrrrrrr!\" Barbara bellowed a beastial growl as her finger nails sharpened into claws, her toes following in the same order, breaking her casual high heels to shreds. Then her entire body was growing in both height and width and two sharp horns burst through the back of her skull. Her clothes finally ripped off, leaving Barbara completely nude; however her nipples and breasts had all ready evaporation and covered by rich bed of purple scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We also included dinosaur DNA in the cocktail to achieve a greater size and mass,\" remarked Dr. Taylor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you get dinosaur DNA?\" Cal said, terrified at the whole situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever seen a little movie called Jurassic Park?\" Dr. Taylor replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RRRRrrrrrrrroooooooooooorrrrrr!!!!!\" Barbara roared out. Her increased mass and weight forced her position to all fours. Her eyes had taken on an eerie green-yellow glow. Her body was clad entirely in black scales with the exception of her underbelly possessing purple ones. Her hands and feet were equally black claws, while her rump and tail with thick added mass. Throughout the entire transformation, Barbara continued to swell in size and height and length; however, her small wings refused to keep up with her growth, they would remain too stunted to ever allow her flight. But this was likely by Horzene's design, according to Disney's demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara's growth finally tapped out twenty-one feet, three inches of height and thirty-two feet, seven inches in length from snout to tail. Finally, Barbara let loose one last bellowing roar, this one bigger than the last two, \"RRRRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!\" Green flames shot out of Barbara Stewart's new maw, singeing one of the facility's walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fire breathing was really the hardest part. We had to design a custom organ from scratch and embed that genetic code into the cocktail.\" Dr. Taylor said aloud, but mostly to James Rothstein.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Barbara had calmed down on her own, Cal meekly spoke up \"Barbara? Can you understand me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara, now in the spitting image of <span class=\"cgrape\">Maleficent's</span> <span class=\"cgrape\">dragon</span> form looked down at her agent. \"Cccalvin.\" She found it momentarily hard to speak with this new mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barbara, you can still talk? How do you feel? Do you need help?\" Cal wanted to help his client and friend in anyway he can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ap ap ap ap!\" James interjected. \"We now have a real life <span class=\"cgrape\">dragon</span> for our movie, Barbara, we still need you on set tomorrow for the shoot. You have to do this, you agreed according your contract. If you want those eight million dollars you'll come with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara's demeanor was instantly angry. Here she was transformed against her will for a movie and this sleazy producer was still trying to involve her in his affairs. Her countenance furious, she was staring down a movie producer on what a <span class=\"cgrape\">dragon</span> such as her should do next.</span></div></div>",

Clearly he hadn't expected her to say no, and perhaps made some promises he shouldn't have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, come on, Barbara! It's gold, and you know it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but no one wants to see a fifty-five year old woman running around in hot pink tights, no matter how famous she used to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How famous she <i>is</i>. And are you kidding me? Who wouldn't want to see ol' Babs Stewart back on the big screen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Don't</i> call me Babs. I always hated that nickname.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe agent put his hands on the table, sliding the script back her way. Barbara looked off, indifferent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The guys making this one are super passionate about getting you in this role. They're willing to do anything to make it happen. And I mean, look at the project. It's the kind of story that's a complete 180 for you, sure, but it's exactly what your career needs right now. You could be making movies a lot worse than this. This role could put you back in the spotlight, Barbara.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an old dog playing new tricks, Cal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara glanced at the mirror on the wall over her shoulder. A few more wrinkles creased in her frown, only adding to her grievances. Cal took her hand over the table, drawing her attention away from her fading features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Barbara. You don't know how perfect this could be for you. It's a change from all those small budget indie films you've been doing to pass the time. It's the chance for you to come back to the limelight where you belong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But a superhero movie, Cal? Honestly? That role's written for someone practically forty years younger than me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd be surprised what a good makeup team can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makeup's not enough anymore, Cal. I'm gonna need something a whole lot stronger than a little powder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, if you take this job, there won't be any problem making you look your absolute best. You bring the power to this role, and I swear to you everything else will work out fine. I'd bet my entire fortune, nay my entire life on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara sighed and looked her old friend in the eyes. He'd been with her since the very beginning, when they'd both been starting out. How either of them hadn't left the partnership long ago was still a mystery to her. Still, if Cal made a bet, he meant it. He never gambled with her career before now, so he wouldn't be starting now. Yet she couldn't shake her worries about becoming this character. She definitely resonated with the struggling young super girl they wanted her to play, and there were some interesting emotional high points that definitely drew on her skills honed as an actress for thirty plus years, but could they pull it off without her looking ridiculous? Could she really trust Cal on this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026I'll give it a try, but only because you haven't let me down <i>yet</i>, Cal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Barbara. You won't regret it, I'm sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat remains to be seen, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more thing for you, Barbara. I know how much you like getting into character beforehand, so here's a little piece from the prop team. It's Cosmodia's necklace. Maybe wearing it will help set your mind at ease about this whole thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the clunky charm from Cal's hands. Boy, was it weighty. Barbara let Cal clasp it for her, then turned around to look at herself in the mirror. The shimmering stone chunk around her neck looked strange compared to the waifish old body wearing it. She felt foolish. Cal seemed happy, of course. Barbara tucked the necklace beneath her scarf out of embarrassment. She then bid Cal adieu and walked out of the agency with a troubled mind. What was she getting herself into?</span></div></div>",

Where is the passion? How are we going to make \"Hearts on the Water\" if we can't find a partner for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack sighed. Hearts on the Water was a hell of a script, a movie about a 30 year old woman who decides to go on a vacation with her friends to get away from the man that broke her heart, only to find new love on the island, that man being superstar Johnny Tremaine. Thing about this script though, was that it really was a hell of a script. So good, in fact, that some people believed that this little romance movie could go on to make millions, and even win some awards, as well as turn Jack and Johnny into superstars of their respective fields.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the movie succeeding was completely dependent of the female lead. And they went through all the major actresses that they thought could play the role. But none of them took it seriously enough, and none of them have chemistry with Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnny, calm down. I have an idea I've been wanting to try for a while...\" Jack said as he got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny looked curiously as Jack retrieved a bottle of pills from the desk drawer across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are those? Drugs?\" Johnny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The latest in special effects technology.\" Jack said. \"You got to keep this secret, Johnny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, just explain them to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking for away to improve on even computer technology, scientists devised this little pill, which will transform the person who ingests into whatever we desire. Could be an alien, a dog...\" Jack started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... or a woman...\" Johnny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. So, here's my plan. We find a boy....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why a boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because with a boy into a woman we have more freedom of change. It's all very complex, I don't want to get into it. Anyways. We get a boy. An Orphan or something, some kid who doesn't have a life ahead of him. We bring him with us to Hawaii, say he is in the movie, give him this pill, boom, turn him into the actress of our dreams.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny pondered the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell, you could even marry her if you wanted.\" Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's eyes lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it safe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No harm done, unless it gets into the wrong hands. So no one can know about this.\" Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnny Tremaine will keep his lips sealed.\" Johnny replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the duo worked in secret to bring this reality to life. They found the perfect candidate, a young boy named Trent Woods, and brought them along to Hawaii. To the press, they told the had hired some complete unknown, and would be revealing her on the first day of shooting.</span></div></div>",

For the better part of his life, he lived at the Little Ones Orphanage in California. Life was simple for him; he had friends and good teachers and all of that. He was honestly looking forward to being an adult. In fact, he remembered when he got approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****A few days earlier*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent saw a man approach the front desk of the orphanage. He was asking to look around the children, wanting to have one star in a movie. However, he told the lady at the desk to not mention that to any of the kids, just so they didn't riot. Of course, the man was allowed to, and he saw Trent off to the side. The man smiled, walking over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello little one. What's your name?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trent Woods.\" the 8-year old smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful to meet you Trent. I'm Jack Pierce. I'm here on business, looking around.\" said Jack. \"Tell me Trent, what do you look forward to in life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent was a little confused, but he answered honestly. \"I can't wait to grow up. I want to be an adult.\" he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You like the idea of adulthood?\" smiled Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like all those adults who get to do whatever they want. Do you think I can be a good adult?\" asked Trent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Trent.\" smiled Jack. What luck for him. He already found his star. \"In fact, I have a proposal for you......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****End flashback*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Trent was offered a chance to play a small role in the movie \"Hearts on the Water\". He didn't quite fully understand the plot, but he was okay with that. He was going to be in a movie after all! Wait til he could tell this to his friends back at the orphanage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, the plane had landed in Hawaii, a place Trent had never been to before. Right now, it was June 8, and shooting was scheduled to begin on June 14, which was six days from then. Right now, mostly everyone was staying in hotels, Trent included. After their first night in Hawaii, Trent had woken up and got some room service for breakfast. He was surprised that he could get food like this. It was so cool for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after he finished breakfast and turned the TV on, Jack knocked on the door. Trent allowed him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, my little child star. How are you?\" smiled Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm good sir. I've never been here before.\" smiled Trent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great.\" said Jack before sitting down. \"Now, six days from now, on June 14, we'll begin shooting.\" he started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh, and I'm playing a little kid who has that little role, right?\" asked Trent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you are.\" smiled Jack. \"However, although it's small, we take our work very seriously. So, we need to make sure you're ready to go for your part.\" he said, pulling out a familiar bottle of pills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are those?\" asked Trent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are pills that we generally give to newer actors. It helps them fit in.\" said Jack. \"And you're new, so you have to take one of these a day. There's enough for the week in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" said Trent, taking the bottle. He was eager to show that he could do it. Jack picked him out of an orphanage, so he didn't want to disappoint. He took off the top of the bottle and took one pill out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll leave you to it then.\" said Jack as he smiled and left, knowing that things were in motion now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent waved good bye and ate the pill in one gulp, getting some water to help wash it down.</span></div></div>",

Trent wasn't really disappointed, though. He knew nothing really magical could happen to him like that. He was sure that the pill was making something happen inside of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, time to relax.\" Trent said, as he looked around his giant hotel room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent was excited to be in the giant hotel room, doing whatever he wanted to, like an adult! This place was much, much nicer than anything he had ever seen in his life before. He was really living life like an adult now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Trent went back and enjoyed the cartoons he was watching on the TV just now. And even though he didn't feel anything happening before, the pill was indeed starting its process as it landed in his stomach, started to digest, and began its movement through the body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the top of Trent's head, a couple strands of black hair started to grow lighter in color. They were hardly noticable unless someone was either looking very closely, or looking to find lighter hairs on his head, but they were there. Small, tiny hairs changing color. And there was still much more to come for young Trent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent stayed in his seat and watched about three or so episodes of the cartoon that was being marathoned on TV. Suddenly, there was another knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who could that be now?\" Trent said as he went to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was at the door now?</span></div></div>",

Again, Trent thought he was gonna get the fat suit, but the director has some more than that, just so the kid would never forget that moment for the rest of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent was in the set, which is the actual sized city that looked like Tokyo or New York.  Of course he would knew it would be used for the people that will perform being frightened and panicked by a giant obese kid when making special effects to make it look like real in the movies.  He comes in with his robe and had his speedos to wear, which he thinks it\u2019ll help slip in and out of the suit without making him feeling the heat with his clothes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering the set, Trent came across the director who they meet for the first time.  His name is Rob Potter, and he has been experienced making monster movies for a decade now.  This will be the biggest project yet, as he decided to do something more different than just using special effects.  Even so that he wanted to keep that as a secret for the eight year old boy, so they meet with their smiles and greeted each other with warmest of welcomes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, the biggest star of the show is here!\u201d  Nice to you Trent Woods!\u201d  Rob says with a chuckle and offered the child actor a handshake in greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe!

I\u2019ve always wanted to play as a fat giant since I was 5 years old.  I\u2019ve been practising to make it perfect, and I cannot wait to show it all off to you.\u201d  Trent was very enthusiastic about the part he\u2019s about to play, wanting to impress everyone with his skills he had for this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see!  Well I got a big surprise for you, and I wanna try this out, just for you!\u201d  Rob says, as he would get something out of the vehicle and shows Trent what item was it he brought along?</span></div></div>",

For example,  if he has a giant role, he grows into a giant.  If he has a role as a shrunken character, he would shrink down to size for real!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person in charge of the whole thing is Mary Sampson.

There were script papers can be seen on the desk, and she could only wonder if that\u2019s the film she\u2019s gonna be on?  But she remained silent for a moment, as David is about to speak about the project he wants to make a good profit of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve been keeping you a secret until now.

Although it would be impossible to make things real, she would play the part, and take a look at the movie to see the final result, making the effects look real to anybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe imagines it so much, her mother was thinking the exact same thing, and decides to use the size changing films to make her daughter\u2019s dream come true.  Mom would like to surprise her with the role, but she would like to keep it secret about the effects that she is literally making Cassie either bigger or smaller, and she couldn\u2019t wait how her daughter would react in such a surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so her Mother, named Sandra, takes Cassie to the set, where the filming process is getting some last minute adjustments in good condition, and it\u2019s when Sandra knew it was time to surprise her daughter by explaining what\u2019s happening in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, sweetie!  Do you know why I brought you here?\u201d  Sandra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAm I gonna be in the movie, Mom?\u201d  Cassie asked with her eyes widened with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes you are!  And I heard you like size changes in the movies, don\u2019t you?  Well, we\u2019re making a movie out of this, and you\u2019ll gonna enjoy some experience you\u2019ll never forget.\u201d  Sandra smiled, as she unveiled some surprises for Cassie, that the youngster had been dreaming of for a long while now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?  So what role am I gonna be in?\u201d  Cassie\u2019s was in excitement mode when she heard her imaginations could soon be realised, and couldn\u2019t wait to hear what her Mom\u2019s tells her about the role of the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when Sandra replied in response and told Cassie\u2019s she\u2019s playing the main role in what movie?</span></div></div>",

There really is no need for me to know the actresses lines for this small of a part\", you think as you walk onto the set. The set is that of a lab. It looks pretty elaborate for a low budget flick. The whole set is enclosed in a realistic isolation type set-up. You shrug and walk through the airlock. \"It'll all be over in a few minutes and I'll pick up my paycheck\", you muse. You look outside the set to see if you can locate the actress. She's supposed to be young and busty according to the script. She's also supposed to be naked for the upcoming scene. You don't see anyone fitting that description. \"Probably bashful\", you laugh to yourself. \"Action\", the director shouts. You put your game face on and go over the scene in your head one more time. \"I'm heading home, you coming Mark\", says the other actor/co-worker for the movie. He's also supposed to be the heroine's eventual love interest in the movie. The entire thought of a man getting transformed into a woman and falling in love with another man is more than a little fucked up. \"No Scott, I'm going to be working late tonight\", you say reciting your one line. Scott walks out through the airlock. \"Explosion\", the director yells!. Suddenly an explosion erupts on the other side of the lab. The lights flicker and emergency lights come on. \"That's original\", you think sarcastically. Later they'll dub in a computer voice announcing a containment breach of the mutagen. The lab starts filling with a pink chemical smoke. You nearly start laughing. \"Pink smoke, this just gets better and better. This will be direct to video\", you mutter. The smoke then hits you. You can't help but breath it in. It tickles and burns your throat and soon your whole body tingles. \"What the fuck is this shit. Figures this low budget hack would use something caustic\", you think starting to panic. You start to move towards to the airlock. You only make it two steps before your legs give out. You fall to the floor where the smoke is even thicker. You watch in horror as you clothes dissolve. Your body is on fire. \"Oh crap, I'm going to die! Maybe they'll dedicate the movie to me. Oh great, I'll forever be attached to the worst movie ever made. That may not be so bad\", you think. You go from complete terror to feeling very calm. You look down to see the last of your clothing vanish. You notice that not only has your clothes vanished, but so has nearly all your body hair. You expect your skin will be next. Almost as if on cue you see your skin start to bubble and distort. \"This is what death is like. Think God it doesn't hurt\", you think to yourself completely calm. You expect you skin will start falling off next. You're expectations are correct. Your skin and some flesh slides off onto the floor and dissolves as your clothes did. Your vision is obscured briefly by a layer coming off your face. You're shocked to see that instead of bone you have new skin where the old skin slid away, but it's not right. Ventilation fans kick in and the smoke clears from the room. As it does you regain the ability to move. You instinctively examine yourself with your hands. \"I'm alive\", you think relieved. You immediately realize something is very wrong. Not all of you in there and there are some new parts that weren't there before. As you grope your breasts you shout, \"I'm a woman!\" The director then shouts, \"Cut\"!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Several stage hands rush in and help you off the floor. \"Get her to make-up. I need her ready for the next take in ten minutes. Come on people, time is money\", the director shouts. You're still in shock as you're helped to your feet by several grabby stage hands. \"Get your hands off me\", you shout!
