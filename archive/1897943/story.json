            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Far, far from the shining kingdom of Widowwood, away from the safe confines of the Harmony Valley, past the thick expanses of the Blackfire Forest, there was a small, almost insignificant tower. A simple, two-level structure, which, unbeknownst to anyone in the kingdom or the rest of the land around it, held the impending apocalypse of this nation. All one would find inside was a single woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one time, she\u2019d been beautiful. While it was a far cry to call her ugly, even today, it was very evident that life had been hard for her. Lydia was a tall, thin woman with exceptionally pale skin, enhanced by exceptionally black and unkempt hair. She wore homely rags which hid much of her form, not that she felt any need to display it. She was an outcast, an exile, and all that mattered to her was her work. She toiled ceaselessly over blackened tombs and ancient elixirs, not stopping to eat, sleep, or bathe. She was so, so close\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo close,\u201d She whispered to herself. \u201cAnd I will show all of them. They feared the black arts, and they were right to do so. That fool king should have taken my aid when I offered it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind drifted back to the time, a decade earlier, when she\u2019d been a welcome member of the king\u2019s counsel, one of the most trusted mages in all the land. She\u2019d been intrigued by the power of evil magic, wondering if, despite its devilish origins, it couldn\u2019t be put to use for the good of the kingdom. The king had refused her request, but she persisted, studying it in secret regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn retrospect, this may have been a mistake. Her studies discovered, she was brought before the royal court, to explain her actions. She admitted to herself that calling her judges \u2018small-minded fools\u2019 may not have been the best defense, but if they couldn\u2019t grasp the glory of her work, she saw no reason to endear herself to them.<br>\r\nAnd thus she was banished, which may have been the gravest mistake the court could have made. For then, she had absolutely no distractions. She had nothing to do but continue her studies, which had changed dramatically. No longer was she content to simply try to aid the kingdom. Now, her only goal, for the past ten years, was to find the best possible way to aid herself. And tonight, her work would be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn the light of the new moon, my ascension will begin,\u201d she whispered, pouring a silver elixir over the polished blade of an ancient dagger. She was ready to make the final step, to take power untold. At midnight on the eve of the new moon, she would gain the ultimate power she sought. But she needed to prepare her body to receive it, first. Thus, this ritual. Speaking a chant in a long-dead language that most likely should have remained dead, she thrust the dagger into her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain was overwhelming, but only for a moment, before it crossed the thin line into pleasure. Having not been with a lover in ages, Lydia was surprised, and a bit embarrassed, at how good she felt. She moaned, knees buckling, even as the spell worked its magic, revitalizing her body. Her hair became thicker, luscious. Her skin became a stunning alabaster, and her chest and buttocks inflated somewhat. She let her rags fall to the ground, unhindered by modesty. A small pain erupted in her forehead, as two small hors protruded slightly. When her eyes opened, again, they were a brilliant crimson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled the blade from her chest, and the wound closed perfectly. Lydia chuckled softly; she could feel the demonic energies flowing through her, just waiting for the new moon to infuse her completely. Rubbing her hands over her new body, she breathed heavily, entranced by the new tactile sensations. On a whim, she grabbed a small potted plant off the shelf, grasping it desperately between her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plant withered and died at her touch, its life force transferred into her. She purred; this felt good. All of it did. She didn\u2019t notice, nor care, that she was slightly taller after her unorthodox snack. With only a few hours until midnight, she wanted to make certain she made the most of her new self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is Lydia's next move?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lydia smiled viciously. The time for her revenge had finally come. But she had waited for so long, a few more hours wouldn't harm. In fact, the more she would wait, the more excited she would get with pleasant anticipation. Yes, she wasn't going to enter the kingdom with a thunderstorm, she wanted to see the king's and the council's pathetic faces when she revealed her power. With that thought in mind, she grabbed a simple cloak, pulled it's hood over her head and walked out of her tower, towards the kingdom of Widowwood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her way, she couldn't help but to drain the lifeforce of her surroundings. As she walked through the forest, trees, bushes, flowers and even the grass withered around her. Simultaneously, she felt more and more power cursing through herself. It felt more pleasant than anything she had felt in years, but as she got near the first villages, she stopped, not wanting to get any unwanted attention. So she wandered unnoticed through the kingdom until she eventually reached the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked right through the front door, when a guard approached her. \"Stop! Who are you? Do you have an appointment with the king's council?\" She looked up and smiled. \"Yes, I do.\" Her voice sounded like the hiss of a snake, but before the guard was able to react, she had taken control over him. His eyes became lifeless and with a monotone voice he said. \"Of course. Follow me.\" He let her through the giant building and eventually, they ended up before a big, oak-door. The entrance to the king's council. So many memories connected to this place. Some good ones, but the latest ones were pretty bad and helped her to light up her inner flame of hate even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she entered, she drew back her hood immediately. The king and all the other people responsible for her banishment looked at her, their faces showing expressions from anger to surprise to shock. The king stood up. \"Lydia, is that you? What happened to you?\" She smiled maliciously. \"Yes, it is I. I have returned after I gained the power of the arts of evil magic. This power could have been at your command, but you rejected it and now it is against you.\" To her dismay she saw that instead of crying in fear, the councilmen shook their heads. The king himself looked at her with sad eyes. \"So you've returned to prove my decision to forbid this kind of magic right? Look at you, it turned you into a demon.\" She bit her lip. Even now, they were all still engulfed in their self-righteousness. She was sick of it. She hated this stupid kingdom and all it's inhabitants. With a voice much too loud for the size of her body she screamed. \"No, not the magic I use turned me into this. It was you, you self-righteous insects! But it's to late to be sorry! I will ascend to be a goddess, while you will have to watch helplessly, waiting for your inevitable doom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she finally fully gave in to her powers. The rush of energy suddenly flowing through her body was overwhelming and she couldn't help but let out a short moan. Her body, too small and weak for her new powers, began to change to suit them. Before the guards, positioned at the sides of the door behind her, were able to reach the witch, she had already tripled in size, making them change their mind and retreat. Her robe ripped apart as she grew bigger and bigger. It was no constant growth. Instead, it came in many impulses, each time sending a wave of pleasure through her body, while her breasts jiggled up and down. She did not even feel pain when she hit the ceiling. Instead, she was crushing right through it. The councilmen screamed, jumped from their seats and tried to escape, but Lydia was blocking the entrance to the chamber. Only the king was still sitting there, gazing up at the ascending goddess. She couldn't tell if his eyes were showing regret, anger, sadness or resignation. When the high ceiling of the chamber was only barely reaching up to her hips, her growth stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, she saw people running away, screaming, while the guards got in position to attack her. They really thought they stood a chance. That made her smile. A struggling prey was always more fun to hunt than one which had already given up.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The commotion in the main hall of the castle certainly didn't go unnoticed, and while the king's guard were a bit...intimidated by the fifty-foot demoness in their midst, there was at least one person who, upon reaching the scene, maintained a bit of self-control. She was a young woman, with dark skin and flowing golden hair, clad in a flowing robe of white and crimson. Her eyes were an extraordinary jade, and seemed to possess knowledge and experience far beyond her years. As she entered the hall, assessing Lydia's towering form, she didn't feel afraid. She felt righteous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was Celeste, white magical priestess. She was second in the line of Lydia's replacements. She'd been raised since early childhood to use her magic to protect others. And she had no fear of the beast in her midst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe caught Lydia's attention before the gigantic witch could move against the others around her; she felt, more than saw, the entrance of a rival mage. \"So,\" Lydia purred. \"This is your weapon to stand against me? A child barely separated from her mother's breast? Delightful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your doom was sealed the moment you chose this path, my dark ancestor,\" Celeste noted calmly. \"Perhaps, as you die, you'll realize the error of your ways. Take heart in the fact that your folly before this court all those years ago led to the placement of unsullied white mages in your place. Indirectly, at least, you accomplished something of use in your wasted lifetime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia's playful smile vanished. The arrogance of this girl offended her, and she'd rectify the situation immediately. \"I'm done with you, now,\" she snarled, before raising her hand and unleashing a dark torrent of flame down at the white mage. Those unfortunate enough to be within the blast zone died in agony, burned into ash. Celeste, however, remained unconcerned: an aura of white light surrounded her, halting the flames before they could touch her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant witch hissed, serpent-like. This could be more difficult that she'd originally thought.</span></div></div>",

Better make it count, because it'll be your last!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a confession,\" Celeste retorted, \"As I am now, I cannot best you.  You are too strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, \" Lydia responded, \"I'm impressed.  You realize the folly of your actions after all, so if you'll just surr...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said as I am NOW!\" Celeste interrupted.  She had a grin on her face, expressing pure excitement and joy.  \"I must thank you Lydia, for coming to attack like this.  I have been waiting nearly all my life for this!  It is time for me to release my latent power.  You'll have to excuse the crudeness of its release, this really is the most efficient way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever just take your damn shot,\" Lydia said, showing increasing impatience at the young upstart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Celeste took her right hand, yanked up her robe, and revealed her exposed vagina underneath.  She had gone commando for this fight; she knew beforehand the time had come.  She then started to slowly massage her clit, while taking her free hand and did the same with her breast through the robe.  Her pussy was already soaked, the anticipation of her knowing what she was finally getting to do was more than enough to\" prime\" it.  \"Oh my God, this feels so wonderful!  I never have done this before!\"  she was already nearly screaming in ecstasy despite having only started her pleasuring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldiers watched in amazement as Celeste pulled this most unexpected move.  Normally, this would make for quite an embarrassing situation, but Celeste had no time for that.   And increasingly, she didn't care anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia laughed as hard as she ever had in her whole life, literally shaking the ground with the noise.  \"Well, I suppose if that's your last move, what am I to criticise right?  Anyway, it's my turn, and now it's time to end this fight with my hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Lydia was about to strike, a rush of magical energy shot out of Celeste that staggered the 50 foot tall Lydia.  \"What in the hell was that power?\" she screamed in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S..so good,\" Celeste moaned, \"I can feel my power GROWING.  Yes!\"  Her power wasn't the only thing growing.  Slowly at first, but then gradually speeding up, her body started to rise above the ground.  Her legs began to elongate, her breasts expand, and her arms lengthen.  Soon her boots began to give way to her growing feet.  The pain to them was nearly unbearable, but that would not last long.  Her robe was rising with her, but getting smaller in proportion to her overall body by the second.  She no longer needed to hold up the robe anymore to frig herself, as the robe soon only covered her midsection.  She grew to 7 feet, then 10, then finally the nearly tattered robe could stand no more, and completely shredded into pieces.   Her huge tits, exposed for all the world to see, came flying out, free from their constrictive prison.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pieces of the robe fell at her completely exposed and ever expanding feet.  Now she had complete and unfettered access to her privates...nothing could get in the way of her immense and growing pleasure.  She did finally notice the physical changes to her..one surely must forgive her for being a bit distracted with the state she was in.  \"Oh my heavens, I am growing!  Th...this must...be my latent...AHH...power!\"  The shock of her noticing her ever increasing form did nothing to abate her fervent masturbation, however it is important to note even at this time she's holding her full sexual urges back, not even inserting her fingers into her vagina.  Simply flicking her clitoris was more than enough at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unbelieveable!\" Lydia exclaimed in shock.  She was understandably caught off guard by the sudden transformation of Celeste.  \"I had to do all kinds of atrocious acts, recanted all kinds of foul utterings, to get where I am now.  And this young woman merely touches herself, and attains power equal to mine??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growing was not stopping.  On the contrary, it was speeding up.  Celeste's magnificent body was now covered in sweat, and her vagina was leaking fluid which was dripping down her massive lengthening legs.   Not only was she getting larger, and attaining more power, but she her body was getting sexier too.  Her breasts was now much larger in proportion to what they were when she was normal sized.   Her hips were narrower, and her butt was slightly bigger.  She was slowly becoming a goddess in every sense of the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Celeste quickly reached 25 feet, she noticed another physical change.  Her lust keep increasing.  The more pleasure she received, the more she wanted.  It was going to be very difficult to stop.  Moreover, pressure was building in her loins.  Finally, she would have what she waited for so long:  her first orgasm.  She continued to flick her clit faster and faster, and twisted her nipple on her massive breast with increasing quickness.  The climax was near.  \"OH GOD! I'm getting so HUGE!  And the power...it's.. ..so incredible!\" Every utterance coming out of her mouth was a scream at this point.  As her orgasm came closer, her growth seemed to plateau.  Finally, she came, and her body exploded in growth and with a feeling of absolute ecstasy that cannot be described by any mortal being.  She thrusted her body upwards, emitting a scream that could be heard for dozens, if not hundreds of miles.  When all was said and done, Celeste's gorgeous, naked, voluptuous body had reached around 53 feet, close to Lydia's height..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orgasm gave Celeste enough of a reprieve from her lust to stop herself.  She slowly staggered her gargantuan form towards the still-shocked and frozen Lydia, realizing she still had a job to do.  However, the thirst was still quite strong.  It took all of her willpower to not take her both her hands and thrust her fingers into her ever-willing and saturated vagina.  She felt...small, and unsatisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia wasn't the only one frozen in shock, and-- even though she would never admit it--fear.   The people, soldiers and peasants alike, could only stare in awe at the unfolding confrontation above them.  Their lovely Celeste had grown up, both figuratively... and quite literally!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Celeste said, \"I...I'm ready to fight you. P..prepare to be....DRIiiiven back once and for all!\"  Celeste could hardly speak straight after such an ordeal.  However, her sense of duty made her press on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She knew that this was the most important moment of her life, the moment that she had spent years working toward, and she wasn't about to risk throwing it all away because of a little girl's childish taunting. Before she made the mistake of rushing into a battle that she had no chance of winning, she took a moment to concentrate on her opponent and sense just how much magical power she truly possessed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she read the girl's power, she had to stifle a laugh. Lydia outclassed this girl in every possible way. She was indeed incredibly powerful, but she was severely overestimating herself if she thought that she could win this fight. Still, although she was indeed weaker, the girl's power wasn't that far below her own. Lydia would undoubtedly win, but only after a bloody battle that would leave her almost completely exhausted. She would still be able to handle the castle soldiers easily enough, but should another mage appear to challenge her in that state... No, this fight had to be avoided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, Lydia made a quick decision on how she would go about avoiding this suicidal battle. She would corrupt the girl and recruit her to her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you waiting for, vile beast. Make your move!\" Celeste yelled. She didn't like that Lydia had paused her attack for so long. Something wasn't right here, that much she could tell. She didn't want to attack first for risk of rushing headfirst into the witch's trap, but waiting for her opponent to act was beginning to irritate her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Lydia surprised everyone in the room by shrinking down to her previous size and walking calmly toward the young white mage who was challenging her. Several guards charged to try and apprehend Lydia, but with a casual wave of her hand she erected a dome of black fire that surrounded the two mages, keeping those pathetic soldiers from interfering with her plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why must we fight, child? I have never done you any harm, so what grudge do you bare against me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You raised your hand against the king. An attack on him is as an attack on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you poor little girl. I was like you once. Young and naive. I actually cared for that royal idiot once, and I foolishly believed that he cared for me as well. Take my words to heart, child. That man doesn't care about you. He only wants your power to act as his shield. And should your power becomes too great, if he were to consider you a threat to his rule, he would readily cast you aside like garbage and replace you with another. I speak from experience, young one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were banished for tampering with dark magic. I am a light mage, and would never make the same mistake as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic is magic, child. Light, dark, nothing but meaningless labels. Magic reflects the heart of the one using it and bends to their will. My power is no different than your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My power is pure, used to protect the lives. Yours is corrupt, and only serves to destroy. We are nothing alike!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And yet you would use that 'pure' power of yours to end my life. Light or dark, you're using magic to kill another living being, just as I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeleste, formerly unfaltering in her belief that she was good and the witch before her was evil, was hit hard by this. Lydia was right; while they each had their own reasons for doing so, both of them were using magic to kill. Was there truly a good or evil in this situation? Lydia had a plenty of reason for wanting the king dead, while she was merely following orders blindly. Lydia was going to kill someone who had betrayed her and taken everything away from her, while she was only going to kill because she was told to do so. In that sense, Lydia's reasons were fare more just than her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a thought popped into her head; what was Lydia planning to do after the king was dead? She was going to lay waste to his kingdom and kill all of those innocents just for living under the rule of the man she hated. Stopping a massacre of an entire innocent kingdom, that's why she had to kill Lydia here. That was definitely a cause that justified killing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't try to trick me, witch! You wish to destroy this kingdom and all who live in it. I can understand your hatred for the king, but you would end the lives of all of those innocent people who never once wronged you! That is why I cannot allow you to live!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia put her hand over her mouth and feigned a gasp of shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, is that what you were told? No, my dear, that is not my intention at all. I merely wish to end that royal idiot and rule this kingdom in his place. No harm would come to anyone so long as they don't attack me first. That fool of a king has no sense of loyalty to his followers, he only looks out for his own well being. My methods may be a bit harsh, but I value my word above all else, and would never betray one who is loyal to me. To him you are nothing more than an expendable pawn, but to me... To me you would be a precious and irreplaceable ally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you lie! The king said-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia placed a hand on Celeste's shoulder and locked eyes with her. The sheer power in Lydia's gaze made her freeze mid-sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the king said means nothing. He would say anything to brainwash you and make you a slave to his will. Here are the facts, child. I once served the king loyally just as you do now. I began researching the so-called 'dark arts' because I felt that they could be used to bring new levels of prosperity to his kingdom. He saw my power as a threat and banished me when the only thing I ever wanted to do was help him. That truth is undeniable. Can you truly call that man just if he would banish his most loyal follower just like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeleste fell to her knees, clutching her head as all of this conflicting information swirled around inside. She had been raised from birth to love the king, to serve him loyally her entire life, but she knew that there was at least some truth in Lydia's words as well. Could it really be possible? Would there come a day when she too became too powerful and got banished by the king out of fear? If so, that day may not be that far off. She was a magical prodigy who had years ago surpassed all of her fellow mages. At such a young age she was already one of the most powerful in the kingdom. If she continued to grow more powerful with age, then the idea of one with no magical power such as the king coming to fear her was a very real possibility. Still, she didn't want to believe it. She didn't want to believe that she might be betrayed by the one she had been loyal to for her entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't know... Surely the king must have had a good reason for doing what he did... He must have... There's no way that he could be so heartless...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless of his reasons, the crime he committed remains unchanged. If you continue to blindly follow him as you are now, your fate will be the same as mine.\" Lydia then knelt down next to Celeste and whispered into her ear \"Renounce the king and join me, child, and I will care for you as if you were my own flesh and blood. You will never have anything to fear with me by your side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeleste didn't know what to do. Everything she had been raised to believe throughout her entire life was being torn apart by this woman who she had only just met. Much as she wanted to, she couldn't ignore the possibility that Lydia was in fact telling her the truth. It was true that she had once loyally served the king herself and later been banished. That much was undeniable. If it happened once, it could easily happen again... She could be banished for no reason other than being too powerful. Was she really willing to remain loyal to the king knowing that she could one day be cast aside just like that?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"l... I... I submit, Lydia. Your words ring true. I can't in my right mind place my trust in a man who so carelessly trampled upon the trust of another. I shall join you in your quest to rule this kingdom and make it a better place for everyone. However, should you betray my trust, I will not hesitate to strike you down once and for all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia smirked devilishly as everything went as she had planned. With this girl under her control, she would have no trouble achieving her goals. Of course, she hadn't been lying when she said she wouldn't harm the <i>innocent</i> citizens, but she planned to rule this kingdom with an iron fist. Anyone who opposed her rule or otherwise displeased her would feel her wrath. While Celeste would likely oppose that idea in her current state, Lydia had a second stage of her plan in mind to fix that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, child. I'm so glad to see that you are able to understand reason. You are far to beautiful and powerful to live and die as that royal idiot's mindless drone. Come closer, child, and let me finalize our alliance by granting you a fraction of my power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout giving Celeste a second to react, Lydia pulled her in and kissed her on the lips. Celeste instantly began to feel a rush of power flooding through her body, the likes of which she could never have imagined in her wildest dreams. If this was just a fraction of the power that Lydia possessed, then she had made the right choice by not fighting her. She never could have defeated one with so much power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Celeste realize that as Lydia was empowering her, she was also corrupting her. Her morals were being eroded away, her desire to protect the innocent being replaced with a desire to control everything. Her old personality remained mostly in tact, and she tried to justify these new dominant desires as fair for their future-subjects by thinking things like \"They should be honored to take orders from us\" and \"We'll be doing them a favor by making all the decisions for them\", but in the end she didn't really care that much about being fair and just anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia eventually broke the kiss and looked over her new ally from head to toe. Since Celeste was already so powerful before, Lydia didn't need to inject that much of her power into her. It certainly wasn't enough to change her body in any significant way. The only thing that really changed was her clothes, as with a snap of her fingers Celeste modified her pure white robes to become pitch black. Still, even without modification Celeste was astonishingly beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for this gift, milady. I promise that I will not disappoint you.\" Celeste said, kneeling before Lydia who simply smiled at her and patted her on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will make a fine ally, child. Now, I believe that we have business to attend to. A little meeting with royalty, if I remember correctly.\" Lydia said, grinning mischievously at her new minion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed we do, milady. Indeed we do...\" Celeste answered, returning Lydia's grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside of Lydia's fire barrier, the king and his soldiers were powerless to do anything but wait and see what happens next. As soon as they saw the dome dissipating, they knew that their fates would be decided by what they saw. Everyone among them expected one of two outcomes: Either Lydia would be lying dead at Celeste's feet, or perhaps the other way around. Either way, none of them expected to see what they did. Both girls were standing very much alive, and Celeste's pure white robes were now black as night. Terrifying as the thought was, they all knew that this was the absolute worst case scenario. Lydia had brainwashed Celeste to fight for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls turned toward the king with their hands on their hips and smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry 'milord', but I'm done taking orders from a lying coward like you. I have a new master now, one who would never dream of throwing me away just because I grew too powerful for her.\" Celeste said, hugging Lydia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Celeste, I don't know what poison that witch has filled your mind with, but-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king was cut off as Celeste fired a beam of light from her hand that grazed his crown and vaporized a large portion of the wall behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare speak of milady in such an insulting manner, worm! You have no right to address her as anything short of Goddess Lydia, especially after what you did to her!\" Celeste yelled in rage, the venom in her voice terrifying everyone in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia simply smirked victoriously. She had this girl wrapped so tightly around her finger it was adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddess Lydia, I like the sound of that. Come, my dear, let's ascend to goddesshood and put this rotten old fool out of his misery together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, milady.\" Celeste agreed, fully understanding what Lydia had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly both of them began to explode with growth. They quickly reached Lydia's previous height of 50 feet tall and just as quickly left it in the dust. within moments both of the girls towered over the king and his castle at an enormous 300 feet tall. The king gulped in fear as he looked up at the two towering titanesses that were getting ready to end his life. All of his soldiers were fleeing for their lives, desperate to escape from the colossal goddesses who wanted their king dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then...</span></div></div>",

The sheer arrogance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised at a new, confidant voice, both Lydia and Celeste turn to find a newcomer striding into the wrecked hall. Both recognize her as a dryad, and a powerful one to stray this far from the forest. Like all dryads, her skin was the color of moss, her regal clothes constructed various colors of leaves. She was beautiful, but in a 'Stern-Mother' sort of way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWherever she walked, plants grew. Grass sprouted in-between the paving stones, faded flowers brightened and even the plants Lydia had drained appeared to be recovering somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding next to Lydia's foot, not even halfway to her ankle despite being 6' tall, the newcomer glared up at the two giantesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-D-D-Dryad-Queen! Help!\" The king managed to splutter out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be silent, Man-King.\" The Dryad spat. \"I haven't come for your sake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you haven't?\" Lydia cooed. \"Then what harm is there in leaving us be? We could make powerful allies-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia was interrupted by roots bursting though the cracked floor and wrapping around both her and Celeste's feet, quickly thickening enough that they couldn't immediately break free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allies? I, a spirit of the forest, ally with aberrations? Do you even know of what you ARE, Demon-Witch? With your very touch, you drain the life from everything and add it to your own!\" The Dryad-Queen spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With a flex of her hands, she surged upwards, her leaf-clothing multiplying to cover the same 'skin' as before. Before anyone could blink, she had settled at the height of the mightiest of trees, 50 feet taller then the two mortals. With her surge of height, the roots binding Lydia and Celeste also surged in size, becoming as thick as their arms and climbing all the way to their waists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait!\" Celeste interrupted.\"Isn't that how nature works? The strong feed on the weak?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dryad-Queen glared down at Celeste, and slapped her without warning. Celeste, unable to move her feet, fell backward as the waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The power of demons exist outside the natural order, and so cheat the strong of their power! To counter that, the spirits of nature exist to foil such power stealing.\" The Dryad-Queen focused he gaze on Lydia, and the witch abruptly realized that the roots were doing more than restraining her, they were blocking her energy drain ability and draining <i>her</i> energy!</span></div></div>",

Once Lydia and her pawn were dead, she might turn her attention to ensuring the humans fell in line with her wills as well. They would be in her debt, after all, and clearly lacked the power to resist the Dryad-Queen's will even if they desired to. Yes, once the Aberrations were dead, a new age would begin in the Widowwood, where the dominion of the Dryads would be unchallenged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you've anything to say before your demise, Demon-Witch, speak it now. If you black heart still holds any love for another of your kind, offer your farewells. This is your end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia could only stare up at the gigantic nature sprite in awe, the wheels within her mind turning rapidly. After a moment, however, the awe was replaced by a look of supreme satisfaction. She took the opportunity proffered, and spoke calmly, almost smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I merely wish to thank your highness for deciding to deal with this matter in person,\" Lydia chuckled. \"For a creature as mighty as you to take an interest in my affairs is a true honor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flattery will not save you, Demon-Witch,\" the Queen sneered. \"Prepare for your demise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not flattery, merely an explanation. You see, had you not deigned to interfere, my course would have been so much more... petty. As you correctly observed, I lacked a full understanding of what I've become. I viewed it in pale, human terms. But, if I've tapped into power so great that a nature sprite as powerful as you, practically a Demi-god, felt the need to destroy me, then clearly I've the potential to be something far, far greater than the Queen of some pathetic monarchy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dryad-Queen frowned, noting that the roots she used to bind Lydia in place were starting to wither and decay. She willed more to grow in their place and reinforce the Demon-Witch's prison, but none obeyed. To make matters worse, Lydia was clearly expanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I think the entire world will be a fitting start to my new empire,\" Lydia went on, moaning slightly from the influx of life energy. \"And since you were so, so arrogant to bring yourself and all your delicious power directly into my hands, it's only fitting that you be the first to fall to my rule. Fear not, 'highness'; I'll leave you alive, to serve as my slave for eternity...AFTER I've drained every bit of power from your beautiful body.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><div align=\"justify\">The Dryad-Queens certainty crumbled, when she saw the steely and determined gaze of Lydia's abyss-black eyes. In fact, the tainted Demon-Witch was mightier than she had expected. Sweat covered the visible patches of Lydia's pale skin, which flashed between the tree-trunk-sized, entangling roots.<br>\r\n\"No!\", the Dryad-Queen whispered, while she renewed her efforts to drain the witch.<br>\r\n\"YES!\", Lydia boomed joyfully, but exerted.<br>\r\nSlowly the Dryad-Queens renewed efforts showed results. Every second the roots became thicker and mightier, forcing Lydia to kneel down, while they enveloped her even more. After almost trippling in size, their growth finally stopped. The enormous witch they imprisoned was completely covered in a greenish cocoon, which massive silhouette mimicked the profile of a kneeling, fighting behemoth. At the ravaged ground of the city - torn by careless steps of three giantess\u2019 and unbelievable tall plants, sprouting from below \u2013 fearful citizens gazed at the plant-prison of the Demon-Witch. Three times the outer wall was twitching, where the witch\u2019s arms were entangled, but finally all movement abated. Euphoric some in the crowd shouted, others just stood there, shocked and unable to understand what had happened. Only a few noticed the strain on the Dryad-Queens matriarchal face. An unearthly, loud and deep moan escaped the cocoon. Suddenly the roots emanated a strange glow and began withering. Just t then, Lydia's head exploded into the sky above the enormous plant-prison, which snapped like tissue paper. Her features appeared more human now \u2013 if that was possible for such a leviathan- her eyes were no longer completely black and the horns had vanished. Her long jet-black hair cascaded down her incredibly fast growing body and framed her noble, youthful facial features. The witch\u2019s ruby-red, luscious lips formed a seducing smile, revealing pearl-white teeth. With every passing second she was growing bigger at an amazing rate. Her former prison was unable to resist her colossal body. Lydia's butt crashed through the backside, while her torso busted through the top. Lydia\u2019s monumental breasts rising above the whole they had just created, swelling still larger at an even faster rate than the rest of her body.<br>\r\nFinally the Demon-Witch straightened her back, the withered roots crumbling and falling around her while her orgasmic moans resonated through the city. The giantess stood at a towering 500 feet, her long, shaped legs seemed to go up forever, her massive torso was dominated by two wondrous teardrop-shaped globes, which seemed to get further and further away as she grew. First the Dryad-Queen feared Lydia was draining her, but she realized she wasn\u2019t dwindling. Then she saw the fields around Widowwood wither, the plants turning to black, mummified husks, and the black stains spread in her field of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right!\u201d, the demon-behemoth moaned satisfied. \u201cThanks to my new apprentice I found a way to feed on the power of life, even without breaking your \u2018formerly\u2019 considerable resistance! So I have to thank you, balance-bringer. You freed me from the shackles of my demonic masters\u2026 Because I will be mightier than each single one of them! They will hide from me and fear me, instead of making demands! My vision had been to narrow-minded. It is not about this pathetic kingdom and it\u2019s insect king \u2013 I will ascend to the godhood I deserve and nature itself will nurture my growth UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden heat flash paced through Lydia\u2019s highly stimulated body. No longer trapped in the Dryad-Queen\u2019s prison she actually hadn\u2019t lied. She was no longer caring for the panicked, screaming pedestrians at her feet. They did not concern her. All she cared about at the moment were her sexual urges. Lydia needed satisfaction , she thirsted for more but she had become to titanic to be stimulated by normal humans. The hot sensation continued, forcing her on all fours - her titanic body smashed several houses of the noble quarter - it was far more intense than anything she had experienced until now, her enormous growth speed up even more. The dark haired witch couldn\u2019t help but cry loud, because the feeling was so pleasurable. Erecting slowly she suddenly came forcefully, almost doubling in size. The castle below her shrank even more, not more than a child\u2019s toy for the 1200 foot tall leviathan Lydia. She became too large for the city street itself, the buildings crumbled from her sheer mass. Strangely, the destruction aroused the witch even more. Her bosom dominated the upper third of her torso.<br>\r\n\u201cI need relief now! I\u2019m in heat!\u201d, she boomed. Searching for objects that could help her.<br>\r\n</div></span></div></div>",

I shall not allow you to destroy the world in your lust!\" Even though being only a quarter of Lydia's size, the Dryad-Queen still stood her ground. But the giant witch was not impressed. With the back of her hand, she just slapped the spirit of nature away. The Dryad-Queen smashed into a near watchtower. Lydia slowly lowered her body down towards her when something tickled her back. Irritated, she looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining soldiers had prepared the catapults and were now starting to attack the leviathan. \"Defeat the demon! Protect the Dryad-Queen! Protect Widowwood!\" Their castle was ruined, their crops had withered. Of course, the people of the kingdom were fighting back, even though their attempts were futile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How pathetic!\" Lydia giggled wickedly. Then, she stood up to her full height. While she was rising, the soldier's hearts were dropping. Her long legs extended higher into the sky than the highest tower of the kingdom. Her stature was feminine, but her back was quite muscular. This was no demon anymore. No, the witch now seemed more like one of the titans, who supposedly formed the seas and mountains just by walking the earth. How could they ever defeat something that enormous?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sank to their knees and dropped their weapons, accepting their powerlessness. Just then, a shadow was cast over them. Lydia's massive, heart-shaped butt descended like a flying mountain. With a smash that cracked the ground and shook the surrounding area, Lydia defeated the king's army by simply sitting down. Her eyes wandered to the ruined hall of the king's court and fixated on the ruler of Widowwood. \"Do you see now how powerless you are! It was a mistake to banish me and now you can do nothing more than regret it. But I won't kill you just yet. I only grasped for this power because of you. So I want you to watch helpless and witness my ascend to godhood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Lydia's malicious laughter echoed across the land, the Dryad-Queen was desperately thinking of a plan to counterattack. She looked around, searching for someone or something to help. The humans were like ants, useless. But then her gaze fell upon one human way bigger than the rest. Celeste. Quickly, the Dryad-Queen approached her. She might have been corrupted by Lydia, but she was her only hope. \"Mage! I know your mind has been poisoned by that demon witch. Still, if things continue this way, you will also parish. I need your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeleste did not need long to decide. Lydia had obviously abandoned her, continuing on her own path for more power. She nodded. \"I will assist you, but only until we defeated this treacherous witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dryad-Queen extended her hand. \"Fine. Then lend me your strength.\" Celeste took her hand and immediately felt exhausted. The Dryad-Queen was using the mage's energy to cast a powerful spell. Next, beginning from the feet of the spirit of nature, plants began to grow. Everywhere, the withered plants were coming back to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia looked around confused when she heard the booming voice of the Dryad-Queen. \"See that, you wretched witch. Even if you destroy it, nature will always revive itself.\" Before the giant could answer, the ground started to rumble. Gigantic roots shot out of the earth and detained Lydia once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that wise? She has already proven to be able to break free from a prison like that.\", Celeste wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but it will buy us time. Nature not only consist of plants. Earth, fire, wind, water. That witch has become an anomaly, something that should not exist in this world. I need the help of the other spirits to defeat her. Come quick, we must find them and ask them for their help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ran, quickly bringing more and more distance between them and the giant leviathan that was Lydia. But soon, they saw the plants around them wither. Lydia was draining their energy and destroying her prison once again. But when reviving them, the Dryad-Queen had filled the plant life with magic power that would give the witch a hard time to drain them. But had it been enough?</span></div></div>",

Green flames licked across the supple curves of Lydia's body. Her hair cascaded about her head as if held in a powerful wind. Her clothes clung to her shapely body as if they had been soaked to her skin by a torrential rain as nature's energy played about her body. When she finished rising to her feet, her eyes were now more than 2000' above the ground and she felt infused with the magic of nature to a level beyond even her control of dark magics - and then she had an idea to satisfy her sexual urges which had been growing as she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dryad-Queen and Celeste suddenly found their path blocked by a massive eruption of roots from the ground - which twisted together into something that looked like a giant, writhing tower hundreds of feet high, the Dryad-Queen was uncertain why this had happened, but Celeste quickly recognised the purpose of the shape in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia's stride brought her to the towering plant in moments and she kneeled down, and with surprising speed pinned each of Celeste and the Dryad-Queen under a hand, she then lowered herself onto the tower that was throbbing with life energy, screaming out in pleasure as she began to ride the new penis she had endowed the earth with, and simultaneously used it to draw even more of nature's energy into herself. While she did this, she position her hands on her two captives so that she could tease their nether regions with the tip of one of her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dryad-Queen felt herself begin to give into sexual pleasures the Demon-Witch was assaulting her body with, and she saw that Celeste had already surrendered herself to the pleasuring touch.

They were like toys to her, only as tall as the thumb Lydia used to softly caress their crotches. The unearthly beautiful behemoth laughed sultry. The sound of her voice made the Dryad Queen gasp. Lydia\u2019s eyes examined her from top to bottom.  Despite the fact her very existence was repulsive in the Dryad Queen\u2019s eyes, Lydia was the stunningly and most beautiful being she had ever seen, Lydia glanced down an orgasmic grin on her face... though Celeste and the Dryad Queen could barely see it from their angle, obscured as it was by her staggering, monumental breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I\u2019ll pay you in advance for the pleasure... and power you\u2019ll bring me! Behold the august sight of the mightiest being in the mortal realms!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd true to her word, the view was absolutely majestic. The former witch was beautiful, from the sinewy working of her muscles, to the sinusoidal curve of her hips, to the welcoming swell of her awe-inspiring ass. The dryad Queen couldn\u2019t marvel at all of Lydia\u2019s features at once, the witch was too enormous.  The creamy white abundance of the leviathan\u2019s colossal breasts drew her eye, each curved with a perfect teardrop shape and dangerously large even at Lydia\u2019s titanic height. But most inviting of all was the soft, pink curl of flesh that she could clearly see between the witches\u2019 legs. It was capped by a layer of downy black hair, and glistened with wet droplets in the golden light of the day\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Inviting? My defences fail!</i> she thought in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst her will, the Dryad Queen felt the quickening of her own breath, her cheeks reddening and the warmth of lust spread throughout her whole body. The unheard off combination of nymph- and succubus-powers quickly tearing through her mental barriers and wards, she felt growing desire. Next to her the way less experienced and fortified Celeste already had succumbed to Lydia\u2019s overwhelming beauty and seduction skills. Moaning loudly she squirmed, while the tip of Lydia\u2019s index finger expertly switched between gently caressing the dwarfed giantess\u2019 succulent breasts or surprisingly nimble running along the rim of her love juices draped clit. Finally the Dryad Queen couldn\u2019t resist any longer, she felt herself squirming, too. Louder and louder her moans echoed Celeste\u2019s.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well,\" Lydia said pleased, \"that settles that! Now it is my turn.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrouched she took a few steps to the mighty lake at the eastside of Widowwood and sat down on its shore. The ground shuddered as she plopped her butt heavily to the ground, squashing a large section of the port. Her enormous weight made a depression in the ground. Finally she had a moment for herself, Lydia reflected. It was time to reward herself. Dipping her massive feet in the water, she reached raised the wooden \u2018tower\u2019 she had summoned and her squirming captives, still pleasing them with two of her fingers. Celeste had guessed right. Lydia hadn\u2019t just created it as a prison. It was the perfect size. Teasingly slow she spread her block-long legs wide open her right hand instinctively cupped her breast and rubbed it slightly while she inserted the smokestack inside herself. It disappeared most of the way in.<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" she moaned deeply as she rubbed it back and forth, still gentle, as she continued to bring pleasure to her captives. As the magic prison probed deeper within her massive body, she moaned with pleasure, magical energy pulsed through her whole body, connecting with the Dryad Queen\u2019s and Celeste\u2019s energy she began to drain them and started to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia continued to grow even bigger, now nearing 2800 feet. Her breathing was getting faster, her cries of pleasure louder, as she approached orgasm. Her titanic body was growing so quickly now, the still shocked crowd of survivors was starting to fear she would achieve the impossible and surpass the first wave of destruction she had caused. Praying in panic they feared the whole city would soon be crushed under Lydia\u2019s sitting body. The magic tower was starting to feel puny to her, her captives had already diminished so far, she wasn\u2019t even sure they still existed \u2013 at least they were too small for her to feel them - but she was way too worked up to stop now. Suddenly, Lydia screamed so loudly it could be heard for miles. Revelling in pleasure, experiencing several orgasms at once, she threw her head back and arched her back, her upright enormous breasts literally seeming like mountains. Her body still swelled larger, but it finally seemed to slow down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia\u2019s orgasm lasted for over a minute. Finally, with a lusty sigh, the black haired titaness came down from it. Casually she removed the remains of the magic tower and tossed it into the lake with a dismissive flick of her mighty hand. Still breathing heavily she looked around. By now she had stopped growing, apparently orgasm had seen to that. Moving her colossal torso forward, Lydia leaned over and splashed some cool lake water on her face, then over her gigantic breasts. This morning it had been a mighty lake to her, now it was merely a puddle. Then, slowly, she stood up. Lydia gathered her long perfectly-shaped legs under her and slowly straightened her tremendous body. Even crouched her head was at roughly 2000 feet. Grinning she mustered a crowd of tiny people below her, crawling through the ruins. She cast a giant shadow over all of them the water dripping off her colossal body was like a rainstorm to the survivors below her. Then she straightened her legs, rising higher and higher and higher above the ravaged remains of Widowwood. Her surroundings seemingly shrank even more, mountains, forests the \u2018great city of Widowood\u2019, they were almost minuscule compared to her staggering height. She could see for miles. There was nothing to use for reference, but Lydia estimated she was somewhere in the area of 4500 feet tall. Realizing how enormous she actually had become made her almost yelp with pleasure again. The clouds seemed almost tangible despite the fact she knew there was quite some distance between them and her head. She had come here to become queen\u2026 Now she was a goddess. Why should she bow to the powers, who granted her the first step of ascension? Why should she stop here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</div></span></div></div>",

Strongholds, castles, entire cities could be leveled with one foot and puny villages could be erased from the map by simply sneezing. The lake next to her was nothing more than a small puddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few miles away, just a few steps to her, she spotted the mighty mountain range which marked the northern border of the country. The sight almost made her laugh. She remembered how she always felt like living in the shadow of those titanic watchers, unmoved for ages. Now, they were not even small hills. The highest ones did not even come close in reaching her knees. She could flatten and raise mountains like even without using magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, she thought, she was indeed the most powerful and gigantic being in this realm. So, the next logical step would be to reach into and conquer other realms. The world of demons, from which she obtained her original powers, was within her reach. She would not bow to the beings inhabiting it, she would conquer it and make it\u2019s power her own. Then, she would be able to grow massive enough to even reach the heavens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut first, she must ensure her dominance over this realm. A look at the two minuscule women at her feet reminded her that there were still beings more powerful than the microbes that humans had become to her. She had to bind the inhabitants of this realm to her will. She had to build an army to carry out her orders. In the end, she could not be everywhere at once. At least not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gaze of her beautiful, purple glowing eyes wandered to the closest city, s small, grayish area slightly bigger than her foot. It was the capital of the kingdom, wreaked by their former battle, but still full of people. Slowly, she lowered herself. Even though she tried to be gentle, the movement created gusts of wind that cleared some of the woodland under her massive, heart-shaped butt. Lydia smiled delightfully when she saw the people of Widowwood panicking, praying to their gods. The titaness bit her lower lip in excitement. Soon, they would only pray to her.</span></div></div>",

The smell of her vagina washed over the city. Fueled with the power of nymphs, it captivated the people. Soon, they all looked up. Lydia\u2019s face was partially covered by her massive breasts, but her glowing eyes were clearly visible. They radiated an aura of pure dominance. If she had uttered an order, any order, each and every person in the city would have wanted nothing more than to fulfill that command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the giantess lowered her hand, until it hovered a few hundred feet over the city. To the people, the soft, fair skin of Lydia\u2019s hand was now the sky. Next, a purple light radiated from that sky, filling the streets, plazas, houses, towers and even the castle itself. If the wizards had not been bound by Lydia\u2019s spell and instead, had tried to block that light, they would have failed miserably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u00e2 \u20ac\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman suddenly felt a warm explosion in her chest. Her skin tingled. She knew what this was, a gift from goddess Lydia. She watched in ecstasy as her body grew bigger and bigger. Her clothes ripped, but scales, stronger than any armor, covered her arms, legs, back and part of her chest and belly. But she knew they were just for show. Her skin was now more resistible than steel. Her fingers and toes ended in sharp talons. Her muscles became more defined. When the transformation was done, she quickly realized that it had happened to the other women as well. But she did not care. She had another urge to fulfill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u00e2 \u20ac\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the guards had stared at Lydia\u2019s perfect hand for the entire time. But now, a sweat and overwhelming scent filled his nose. It was not as strong as Lydia\u2019s, but still powerful and closer. He turned around and before him loomed a woman at least twice his size. Her red eyes glowed and emitted sparks of pure desire. She grabbed the guard with one hand, lifted him in the air and tore off his armor with the other hand, like it was made of paper. She then pressed him against her body. His head disappeared between her massive breasts and the woman put his already erect dick in between her thighs. She made love with him, fast, aggressive, greedy. He felt the power leaving his body, but he did not resist. This was the task the goddess had chosen for him and he would happily serve her will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u00e2 \u20ac\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia removed her hand. With delight, she inspected her work. The women and become powerful succubi. No, these beings were created by Lydia herself and they were way stronger than succubi. The men had gained additional strength and endurance as well and would serve to fuel Lydia\u2019s fighters. Women with magical potential, those who were able to become mages or witches, had grown even bigger, rising up between the houses. Black horns stuck out from their foreheads, a tail emerged from the end of their spine and swished around dangerously like a massive snake and giant, black, leathery wings covered them like a cloak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Lydia\u2019s gaze wandered to the king\u2019s castle. There, she spotted the princess, now even more beautiful. She towered in the courtyard, sucking energy from two guards at once. Yes, the goddess thought, she is a woman that knows how to lead. Gently, she extended a gargantuan finger. It stopped a hundred feet over the castle, where it loomed dangerously, ready to crush the entire place in an instance. With her magic, Lydia created a small cut in her finger. She then let a single drop of blood flow out. Immediately, the cut healed. The drop of blood slowly floated down like a bubble, until eventually, it ended right before the princess\u2019 face. There, it glittered like the most beautiful ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">Drink!</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the first time Lydia spoke. The word echoed across the land. The citizens cowered, filled with awe and joy upon hearing their goddess\u2019 voice. The princess did not hesitate and swallowed the entire drop. Instantly, she felt a surge of power flowing through her veins. The previous transformation was nothing compared to this. The princess\u2019 body expanded higher and higher. Her features became curvier, her claws sharper, her horns bigger and her wings mightier than those of any of the other women. Her face was so beautiful, it was only bested by Lydia herself. Finally, the princess towered at a height of 200 feet, ten times the size of the most powerful woman in the city. Then, Lydia\u2019s voice was heard once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">You are now reborn as my loyal servant. Your name will be Xarah. You will lead this group of worshippers and carry out my will.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nXarah kneeled. Joy filled her heart as she repeated her new name in her head. \u201eYes, my goddess. All shall kneel before you.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, Lydia rose to her full height once more. This worked perfectly. With a wave of her hand, she also transformed the surrounding villages, making the entire kingdom an extension of her will. Now, she thought, it is time for my next action.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been weeks since the incident. All of the neighboring countries had seen the titaness rise and then vanish. It had been a bad omen. Widowwood, once a peaceful kingdom, was now worshipping some witch named Lydia who had declared herself a goddess. Blasphemy, the high priest thought. But his army, the inquisition of the holy church of the sun, would put an end to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had not reach the capital yet, when he saw them. Giant succubi swarmed the sky and descended upon their army. His men would have been charmed immediately, had it not been for the blessing of Nu, the sun goddess. His army had no intention of giving the enemy an advantage. They channeled fireballs and shot magically enhanced arrows. The succubi screamed in pain. The priest smiled confidentally. The goddess was with them. But the enemy's assault continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, even bigger succubi with black horns and tails appeared. They sliced through his troops like hot knives through butter. \"Do not falter!\", he screamed. On his mark, the priests channeled divine energies to force these new demons back. Soon, they were forced to keep a distance. But the holy army was still surrounded. Hissing and growling came from all around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he noticed a large shadow. With a thundering boom that shook the earth, the biggest demon he had ever seen slammed into the ground. She was even bigger than Nu's tower in the capital. The high priest gulped, but he would not falter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the meaning of this?\", the giantess thundered, one hand on her hips, the other touching her cheek as she grinned mockingly. \"Are you coming to pledge your countries loyalty to goddess Lydia?\" Her tail swished over the ground, throwing massive boulders around like pebbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was indded frightening, but at her words, he could only laugh. \"Foolish witch-worshipper. We serve a real goddess. If your witch was so great, why is she not here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">I am always here!</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice came from everywhere at once, echoing through the countryside. The priest looked around warily, only to notice his men staring up in the sky. He followed their gazes, but there was no sky. Instead, there was what looked like the ceiling of an impossibly large hall. And before them, above the horizon, loomed the figure of the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. She wore a black dress that glittered like the night sky. Her long, black hair flowed down her shoulders like water. Her eyes, glowing mercilessly, were focused on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she leaned forward. Her cleavage revealed a pair of massive breasts, hovering over the distant mountain range like moons. Her hand wandered over the land. She extended her index finger, lowering it until it hovered over his army like a massive, flying mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">You are nothing to me. I could crush you just like that.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let the words sink in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">But I want to test my people. I will not intervene directly. It is not necessary.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her chuckle thundered across the land, shaking the priest to the bone, he had to focus with all of his might on sun goddess Nu to not fall to Lydia's spell. But still, how could they defeat her? He was desperate. So he prayed to his goddess for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia let the sky return, but she was still able to watch her kingdom. Satisfied, she let herself sink into her throne. She had created the throneroom herself. It was her own realm. With delight, she watched the sphere that hovered before her. It contained the part of the mortal world that was her domain. With excitement, she remembered how it had been when the people started worshipping her. The powers she had claimed from the netherworld and the ones she had drained from her opponents were one thing, but being worshipped as a goddess fueled her ascension on a whole new level. She was no longer bound to the mortal realm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the corner of her eyes, she noticed something. Another deity was trying to enter her domain. But Lydia was smart. She knew she was not ready to face a real god or goddess yet, but she was able to block their influence in her own domain. Nu was unable to enter. But then, something else entered. A massive dragon, a holy beast summoned by the goddess, was on his way to help the holy army. Lydia sneered. She could squash it like a fly if she wanted to. But she had decided to not intervene directly. On the other hand, Nu had sent help, so why shouldn't Lydia do the same?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered her first summonings. The materials, the ritual, the risk, all to summon a simple demon. She laughed at how weak she had been just a month ago. Now, she could open a gateway to the netherworld with her will alone. Slowly, a rift opened in her hand. But she would not summon a minor demon. No, she would enslave an archdemon, a demigod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the summoning was complete, she looked at her hand. It took her all of her self-control to not start laughing. The mighty demon she had summoned was no bigger than an ant to her. She raised her hand to her face to inspect what she had actually summoned.</span></div></div>",

She learned quickly and became a mighty witch. But one day, a demon broke free from her control. Vjaska was not devoured by it, however. No, she fought and in the end, she swallowed the demon herself. The power that came with it was addicting. She devoured more and more demons. When she absorbed the 99th one, her transformation was complete and she became a powerful archdemon. She had inflicted terror in the hearts of all who had encountered her ever since. Until today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, she was like a small ant, crawling around on the gloved hand of an incredibly large and powerful witch. Filled with disbelief, she stared up at Lydia's sky-filling face. Vjaska's pride as a demon forbid it to even tremble, but the witch could still smell her fear. Lydia's eyes wandered from the demon to the dragon. The mighty creature was bigger than the naga, emanating Nu's divine energies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia had an idea. She smiled mischievously at Vjaska. \"Will you be a good pet, little snake?\" The naga could do nothing but nod. \"Good girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Lydia let some of her own powers flow into the naga. Vjaska was overwhelmed. Not even when she devoured her strongest demon had she felt this good. She became stronger, deadlier and, most of all, bigger. Her iron scales became stronger, even resistant to magic. Her muscles grew thicker, her claws and teeth sharper. Her body swelled in all direction, her tail became thicker and longer. Even her small breasts became more voluptuous, undoubtly a side effect of Lydia's powers originating partially from succubi and nymphs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the flow of energy stopped, Vjaska moaned with pleasure. She would be forever grateful to her new mistress. Lydia, satisfied with Vjaska's new size, let the naga enter the mortal realm through the sphere.

Down a gently sloping hill fireballs rocketed back and forth, spears and claws tore at each other, and broken bodies littered the fields. A company of soldiers were busy tearing apart one of the giants, her legs crippled by their lances. Not fifteen feet away a larger woman was kicking mounted knights into the air while devouring a handful of peasant conscripts. Vjaska grinned, eager to partake in the carnage. Far in the distance a golden glow radiates from a serpent about her own size, but without human features. The largest of Lydia's servants was locked in combat with the being and the naga couldn't tell if one of them had a clear upper hand. She slithered towards the two titans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">NO</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nVjaska collapsed into a spasming heap as the voice tore through her mind. Her vision went white and she knew only pain. But as soon as it had come her mind cleared again. She eased herself upright, still teary eyed from the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That fight is not your concern, deal with the lesser minions. Prove yourself and I shall grant you the chance to fight such a being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia's voice, although omnipresent and overpowering, was comforting this time instead of destructive. Vjaska felt stronger, even stronger than when she stood in the goddess's hand. And more than anything she desired to earn such a privilege. She surveyed the battle, looking for where she might be used best. On the next hill a group of archers fired blessed arrows on several of the weaker succubi. They were injured, and the levy troops that they should have swept aside easily were close to overrunning them. With a cry that shook the earth Vjaska charged. She didn't know how large she was now, but in moments she had reached the base of her enemies' hill. A group of pikemen held their weapons high, aiming for her soft belly. The serpent didn't bother slowing. She laughed as she felt their pikes snap harmlessly well below her waist, and moments later their armored bodies crushed under her tail. A number that had been out of her immediate path survived, but her goal was forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached the top of the hill and surveyed her prey. All had heard her battlecry and as they saw her barrel through their guard they had tried to flee. But at Vjaska's size escape was impossible. She surrounded the group with her coils and leered down at them. She had caught about thirty, and crushed a few more as she had corralled them. And they were tiny. At her previous size a single human would feed her for days, and she would have to unhinge her jaw to swallow a victim. Now, she estimated she could easily eat three or four at a time. She concluded her new height was at least 150 feet, possibly more. She threw her head back and laughed, her dark hair billowing in the wind. The men below her cowered and tried to climb her scales. Two had made it up the bottom coil and were working on the second. With a twitch she knocked them down and pulled them between the coils, a tiny spray of blood marking their passing. Gleefully she raked her hands through the archers. Several were eviscerated and she captured three under her palm. She smashed it down, feeling their bodies crackle without resistance. Vjaska raised the bloody palm to her face, letting the scent of iron and fear roll over her tongue. Her forked tongue flicked out and she purred in delight. She curled herself tighter and the soldiers hurried to the center of their prison. Vjaska tried to move slowly and make it last, but her self-control faltered. With lightning speed she closed the circle. Their screams barely altered pitch as she coiled herself together and crushed the remaining archers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two giantesses below still struggled with the peasants. Eager for more bloodshed, Vjaska hurried towards them. The line of poorly armed, poorly armored peasants was about ten men deep. She came in from the sides, completely crushing the back three lines before they knew she was on them. Then the snake turned around and snarled down at the humans. They broke instantly, forgetting the wounded giant in front of them and running. Vjaska laughed to herself, the pitiful creatures had to run the length of her blood-soaked tail to escape from her. And she could mark how pitiful their progress was by the rings of orange scales breaking up the sea of black scales. She unhinged her jaw and moved on the fleeing mob. She passed over several ranks of peasants before smashing her mouth into the crowd. The ones fortunate enough to escape the maw were crushed under her breasts or smeared along her scaly lower half. She barreled through the humans, swallowing dozens in her first pass and crushing many more. Vjaska rose back to full height, tilting her head back and swallowing those that hadn't already been forced down her throat. The hundred or so remaining were quickly dispatched by her claws. Now, only the two giantesses remained. They looked up at Vjaska, part fearful and part in awe. They were merely twelve feet tall, barely better than the humans. She looked down on them in disgust. Gifted with Lydia's power and squandering it by losing to peasants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">You would use my gifts for selfish acts of bravado. You are undeserving of my favor and my kingdom. Vjaska, destroy these two.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nVjaska smiled at her goddess's command. To their credit, the condemned women did not try to flee but knelt before her. She felt some pity as her form engulfed them. Safely constricted, she unhinged her jaw and placed her mouth over the blonde giantess' supper body. Biting down, she flipped the girl up and let her slide into her stomach. The second one she skewered on the end of her claws and disposed of moments later. Vjaska was contentedly full but at her new size and with her longer form she could store plenty more. She tapped her claws against her belly as she looked for more worthy prey.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nu was known as a gentle, merciful goddess throughout the world. Cities in every kingdom held shrines where people went to pray for forgiveness and leniency in the afterlife. She was one of the few deities that did not require exorbitant sacrifices of food or precious metals, and was widely regarded as the kindest of the pantheon. Which really threw people for a loop when confronted with her battle-priests. Unmatched wizards capable in all arts of destruction, a handful were a match for a smaller kingdom's armies. And in this battle hundreds squared off against the might of Lydia's dark horde. Where the frontline combat favored the forces of light circles of Nu's mystical warriors reinforced the less-magical soldiers. Rays of sunlight flashed down on Lydia's succubi and set the alight. Most of her more powerful demons, inexperienced in their new powers, were no match for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVjaska feared these men and women more than most other beings. Even though naga were by no means inherently evil they were distrusted by humans. Nu's priests in particular hated her kind, and were embarked on a campaign of extermination against them. Thousands of nests had been incinerated and not even hatchlings had been spared. Being less adept in magic had left the surviving naga at a disadvantage, and they prayed that the priests would soon exhaust their fervor while some of them still lived. But now with the gift of her goddess Vjaska sensed an opportunity. If she could slay the priests here she could save her people. She slithered over to one of the taller giantesses who stood at about 30 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gods be damned the Goddess knows how to pick her monsters,\" the officer said as she admired the serpent. Vjaska grinned down at the smaller woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want Nu's priests, where can I find them?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a circle not a mile north but our girls are handling them just fine. One of our units broke through near the rear of their column but were cut off before we could reinforce them. Their sorceress is good but not good enough to break out. I reckon something like you might make the squirts shit themselves though,\" the giantess said. Vjaska could see the nearest priests trying to hold back the tide of women, flashes of golden light cleaving the darkness of Lydia's domain. But remembering the two she had executed, she knew the Goddess's needs came before her own desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they live I will save them,\" Vjaska hissed. She turned and slithered away across the wartorn landscape. She travelled mostly behind friendly lines to avoid collateral damage or distractions, watching the conflict from afar. She was surprised to find men working for the goddess, building strange shrines or corralling prisoners brought back by her women. Occasionally they lay together, the succubi recuperating after being injured at the front. At one shrine several of them tied captive women to posts in the center. Moments later purple lightning split the sky, striking the women and transforming them into beings more like the giantesses that inhabited Lydia's kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the fighting thinned out and Vjaska knew she had reached the rear of the holy army. Vjaska could see several of her comrades trapped by Nu's Warriors and bombarded by the battle-priests. These ones must have been strong, as they had pushed back the black clouds that shrouded the rest of the kingdom. It burned her pale skin. Choosing a spot where the defenders were thickest Vjaska advanced. Several of the giantesses paced back and forth in front of a line of pikemen, brutalizing captives to goad the soldiers into an advance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clear a path.\" Vjaska commanded, not slowing down. With a yelp the girls dove out of her way. The tiny men facing her screamed and tried to move but there was nowhere to run. She paid little attention to the snaps and cries below, she had one goal. Within moments she had broken through to the trapped giantesses, whose number had dwindled to three. She curled around them, body-blocking them from the knights and soldiers trying to finish the exhausted women off. Even at their size they seemed tiny to the giant snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our sisters will be here soon. Finish off this rabble while I deal with the priests,\" Vjaska said. The giantesses were battered, bruised, and bloodsoaked but nodded agreement. Vjaska uncoiled to allow them out and turned towards a golden dome not far away. Within must be the priests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come out you cowards! See how you do when naga and human are evenly matched!\" Vjaska called down to the half-sphere. Gold runes floated on its surface but no answer came. She snarled in frustration and tried to smack the circle of light. It burned her hand where it touched and she shrieked in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn you!\" She grabbed a handful of soldiers who were trying in vain to hurt her scaled lower body. \"If you don't fight they die!\" She yelled. Still there was no response. \"RRAAAHHHH, FINE!\" Vjaska howled, blinded with rage. She mashed her palms together, grinding the men in her hand to a liquid and letting it fall on the dome. She set to work on the armies below her, flinging handfuls of soldiers hundreds of feet or slicing them to ribbons. After a minute of slaughter the dome changed hue, grabbing her attention. She flicked a struggling knight off the end of her claw and returned her attention to the dome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At last they stoop to notice me,\" Vjaska said, voice dripping with venom. Without warning a blast of light shot from the dome. Vjaska screamed as she was lifted airborne, her body feeling as though it were on fire. She writhed madly, tail slapping the ground and sending geysers of soil flying until she was high enough that no part of her could reach the ground. Golden light surrounded her, burned her scales and crisped her flesh. Her cries of pain escalated in pitch and she was certain death was near. But then it cut off and she plummeted earthward, landing hard enough to split the ground and cause tremors. She panted, every square inch of body in agony. But after a moment it subsided partially. She forced herself upright. She could see that her skin was not blackened by fire and her scales had not fallen off. With the pain now manageable, her rage returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IF YOU WANT A LIGHT SHOW, I'LL GIVE YOU A LIGHT SHOW!\" Vjaska screamed. Deep within she felt the demonic power she had had before her transformation. If that had felt like a small goblet of energy, she now channeled an unstoppable river of the stuff. She arched her back and reached skywards, the air between her fingers crackling. The sun clouded over and black clouds cast a shadow over all her surroundings. She felt an unstoppable tide rising from the pit of her stomach. The sky boiled and freezing rain splattered against her skin. She gasped and heaved in delight as the power coursed through her veins. Finally it built to almost orgasmic levels of pleasure and she could no longer control the torrents raging through her. She slammed her hands down and sheets of lightning raked the field around her. The cacophony was unlink anything she'd ever experienced, so loud that she didn't even realize she was screaming at the top of her lungs. Her vision glowed white, bolts of electricity stabbing down to smite her foes. Lydia's succubi cowered but were untouched by the storm. Nu's army, however, was not so lucky. Knights cooked inside their armor, horses were virtually evaporated, levees melted from the heat. And in moments it was over. All that remained for hundreds of feet were charred skeletons and a giant naga, screaming into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVjaska kept going for another minute before the pleasure subsided. She panted, sweat dripping off the human portion of her body. All she could smell and taste was ozone. When she remembered what she had been doing she looked around her for any sign of the battle priests. But the golden sphere was gone. No sign of it lingered, and she couldn't tell if it's occupants had perished in her maelstrom or were teleported to safety. But Vjaska no longer had the energy to care. She leaned slightly to the left and collapsed, kicking of a pile of ash as she destroyed the last remains of Lydia's many foes. Far in the distance however, the war raged on.</span></div></div>",

During her draining of the roots, Lydia had grown to match the Dryad-Queen and neither possessed an outright advantage against the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking quickly, Lydia created black flames in her palms. Rather than flinch, however, the Dryad-Queen's palm grew thick bark and endured the evil heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe castle guards, having rebooted their brains the the point where they could follow orders, defaulted to \"trees good, demons evil\" and a rain of arrows pricked Lydia's skin, faintly annoying her. Celeste reacted to the attack by smacking the attackers aside where she could, he legs still entangled. When the attackers quickly moved out of her reach or died, Celeste resumed trying to escape her root-based bonds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, give up Girl-Failure. The Roots of Restoration were made to counter beings just like yourself, you have no hope of escaping them.\" The Dryad-Queen quipped, managing to leg-sweep Lydia and pin her down. Many brave knights blushed and looked away as the Queen straddled the naked Demoness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring for the moment that she had defeated the roots just fine, Lydia defended her new toadie. \"Hey! Where do you get off calling people 'failures', you overgrown garden gnome!\" With a vigorous wriggle, Lydia slipped out from under the Dryad-Queen and pinned <i>her</i> to the ground, crushing many court attendees as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pure dweomer-weavers are capable of the highest acts of healing and restoration, but they must refrain from <i>all</i> sinful acts! Achieving 20 winters unsullied is an accomplishment of the highest order, and yet she throws it away at the first sign of opposition?!

Celeste, hardly a waif herself but still at the mercy of the much larger women, was initially in awe of the spectacle, until she realized that a perfect opportunity was presenting itself for her. Her experience as a white mage allowed her to harness nature-based magic, and her recent conversion to the forces of darkness allowed her to feed on the demonic elements as well. And feed she did...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was when the smoke cleared and both Lydia and the Dryad-Queen were exhausted, panting on their knees at the physical and spiritual drain their conflict had put them through, the demonic witch realized her new servant was... gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems Celeste wasn't able to survive my might,\" she mused, not overly concerned. \"Oh, well. You will still bow before me, Queen of Weeds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dryad-Queen sneered at the threat, knowing it was empty as the one she was about to deliver; neither giant could stand, let alone fight. \"You will lick my feet in submission before this day is done, Fool-Witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that is a wondrous idea! I may have to borrow it, as I've already borrowed much more from you two!\" The voice rang out from above the castle courtyard, somehow melodic and thunderous at the same time. The two enormous women were cast in shadow and frozen in shock, until Lydia finally was able to name the monolith before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Celeste?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeleste... had grown. No longer at the Dryad-Queen's mercy, the corrupted mage now towered over the entire landscape, the castle barely brushing the top of her knees. The mighty mages who previously overpowered her were now nothing but dolls in comparison. A deep, unearthly glow emanated from her eyes, and an insane smile split her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, little 'mistress',\" the godlike mage giggled. \"Your pawn has learned too well from you, it seems. I saw an opportunity to gorge myself on the energies you two foolishly expended, and I took it. And, oh my, look at the results! I believe that I'm dissolving our partnership, Lydia; it's hardly right for a being of my power to serve a speck like you. However, the two of you can look forward to an eternity of slavery to your new goddess! I'm hardly sated with the measly amount of power I've taken from you two. All magicks will be mine before the next sunset, if I've anything to say about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeleste's deranged laughter echoed through the kingdom.</span></div></div>",

The titaness just stood there, her colossal body unmoving in his naked glory. Obviously her robes hadn\u2019t been able to cope with her growth spurt, so they ragged remains covered large parts of the district next to the castle. Frozen in shock Lydia now realized that Celeste\u2019s body had not only gained height. She also appeared more athletic, her arms, previously thin and scrawny, had gained a decent amount of muscle tone, as had her thighs and stomach. Her formerly elfin \u2018apprentice\u2019 was toned and trim, like the amazons from the south \u2013 decent, but not overtly muscular, but fit, built for endurance. Celeste\u2019s breasts were the only place on her body with the slightest hint of fat, and even Lydia could see a certain tell-tale athletic firmness. Her breasts had definitely grown at an even faster than the rest of her body \u2013 each curved with a perfect teardrop shape and swollen to the size of her head. Those succulent orbs bounced and swayed with her every of her deep breaths. Her beautiful, shapely legs had stretched longer, even though they had always been her best feature, they now were beyond belief. They were exquisitely toned, and even for a girl as large as she they were long. Celeste\u2019s tanned skin now gave off a healthy caramel glow, despite the aura of unholy light that was surrounding her. Without exaggeration: she had become the physical embodiment of feminine grace and beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGracefully, especially for a being of her tremendous size, the behemoth knelt down. Even when the blonde giantess knelt, the pinnacle of the towering castle keep was still way beneath the level of the underside of her tremendous bosom. Panic ensued; all the inhabitants of the city were fleeing in terror, either hiding indoors or retreating out of town as fast as they could. Despite her enormous size Celeste heard their screams of fear, horror and anguish, although some seemed to be out of awe and even lust. Only the king\u2019s guard regiments remained, proving their reputation of being exceptionally brave even against overwhelming odds and in hopeless situations. They had been unable to cope with the giantess dark mage and the giant dryad, how could they hope to achieve against a titaness of Celeste\u2019s size and power?<br>\r\nFor the moment, she was distracted by a small strange object in the corner of her field of view, just below her ponderous left breast. It looked like a bright bumblebee, but it had no flapping wings. Transfixing it with her emerald green eyes she laughed loudly. It was one of the king\u2019s airships. Powerful mostly, large constructs, enabled to fly through magic and the pride of his generals. It seemed to be moving so slowly, she was sure she could catch it. Lightning fast, her huge right hand descended on the strange little \u2018insect\u2019 and grabbed it. Twisting her sinuous lips in a malign grin, she flicked the airship, sending it spinning and flying miles over the horizon. She laughed out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cPuny insects!\u201d</i>, Celeste thought and turned her attention to Lydia and the Dryad. Still kneeling and balancing on balls of the feet she shifted her weight and spread her long legs wide. Effortlessly she toppled over a watchtower, which was hit by her left shin, in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to thank you, my little \u2018mistress\u2019!\u201d, Celeste purred. \u201cI was born with immense magical potential, and each passing day my mastery of magical force grew more potent. But I denied the opportunities to exercise the incredible power at my command \u2013 It was all about balance or restraint. They even convinced me to virginal \u2013 because only a true ascetic is bale to harness his full potential and control.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer melodious laughter rocked the castle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you imagine it? Being denied the pleasure of sexual fulfilment and exercising so much untapped power\u2026 But no longer\u2026 I swear it!\u201d, the titanic blonde said. As she spoke her fingers were making their way down her body, starting at her neck, caressing it gently with the fingertips, following the tremendous curve of her ample bosom, playfully pinching tiny, rose-coloured nipples, before they continued to venture deeper, tracing the edges of her bustline with the fingertips, she paused for a second and took hold of each of her breasts in her hands, squeezing them tenderly, kneaded them for some seconds and groaned in satisfaction, before her fingers wandered further down again, playfully she retraced the contours of her perfect eight pack, past her slim waist, past the curve of her hips, until at last they arrived at the waiting mound of her sex. Moaning she caressed the downy blonde fur and touched pink, glistening folds of her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia gulped and starred at the copper-colored flesh of the massive bustline, which dominated the sky above her.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you two will help me reaching sexual-fullfilment! And maybe I\u2019ll spare your lives!\u201d, moaned Celeste. Lydia looked at the dryad queen.</div><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The only chance they had was to put aside their differences for now and work together. They hated each other, but they were not stupid. Making brief eye-contact was enough to make a silent agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further thought, Lydia unleashed a powerful beam of magic. With incredibly speed, the giant mage dodged it. But that way, she jumped directly into the Dryad-Queen's trap. Roots grew out of the ground, wrapping around her body. Celeste tried to rip them apart or burn them with magic, but they seemed indestructible. The Dryad-Queen's magic alone was powerful, but this time, her roots were glowing purple, a sign of Lydia's black magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their powers united, they were able to detain Celeste. But before the two could think of a way to finish their opponent, the mage slowly looked down on them. Lydia and the Dryad-Queen were shocked. Instead of a pained expression, a wide, crazy grin spread across Celeste's face. \"Two against one? That's hardly fair, isn't it?\", the mage shrieked, then bursting into a laughter that even froze the blood of Lydia and the Dryad-Queen. \"Let's even the odds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, a cloud of red mist poured out of every pore on the mages body. It slowly moved next to her, taking humanoid shape and eventually transforming into an exact copy of Celeste. The clone smiled at her original. \"Let me get that stuff off.\" She put her hand on the roots, which quickly made them wither and fall of, while the two mages seemed to grow even bigger and more powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia and the Dryad-Queen looked at each other, seeing the desperation in the other's eyes. Meanwhile, the two Celeste's surrounded the castle. The original didn't let her two opponents out of her eyes. The other however looked curious at the helpless and terrified soldiers while casually smashing the top of one of the towers. When they got into position, the clones looked at each other, then back at the witch and the spirit of nature.</span></div></div>",

One day, he heard of a land which once had been the home of multiple kingdoms, living together in harmony. Peace had seemed to last forever, until on one fateful day, a demon witch appeared. She had attacked the kingdom of Widowwood. The people struggled, but none of them had been a match for her massive size and incredible magic powers. After the kingdom had fallen, the others had realized that they would either have to worship their new demon goddess or receive doom by her hand. Still, some had continued to fight. It had been a hopeless battle, leaving the land in ruins. Eventually, everyone accepted the demon as their new goddess. Now, there even was a cult that worshipped her. A cult which apparently only had females as high ranked members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a challenge Leo accepted immediately. Defeating a powerful demon witch and freeing multiple kingdoms at once, that was something to make him even more famous. And of course, it was all for the sake of good. He was a hero after all, and defeating evil was his job. The moment he entered the land, he sensed something was amiss. The plantlife, the people and even the earth itself seemed sick and lifeless, but also filled with a strange and powerful presence. As he wandered deeper into the land, the plants got more and more dangerous and appeared to be surrounded by an evil aura. But that did not shock him too much. He had seen something like this once or twice. This demon witch, Lydia he recalled her name, was truly something. Yet, he was still confident enough to think he could take her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, at the center of the land, he saw it. An unfriendly forest of lifeless trees and thorns, surrounding a huge mountain covered in giant, spike-like rocks. On top of it, there was a large temple, built entirely with dark-red stones, as if it was made of solid blood. To make the scenery appear even more unnecessarily evil, the sky was covered in a giant, spinning, red glowing cloud. So that was the cult's headquarter and that was the place Leo hoped to find Lydia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he wandered through the forest, he had the sensation of being watched. But when he looked around, there was no-one there. Still, it felt like he was surrounded by an evil presence which tried to crush him with it's pure aura. The air was thick and hot and it seemed like spears of pure hatred were piercing through him. A lesser hero would probably already be gone, running away as fast as he could. But Leo was a strong and brave hero, who would fear no danger, because no demon witch or whatever stood a chance against him. When that thought crossed his mind, he smiled confidently, but suddenly, he heard a distant laughter coming from the woods. A laughter which seemed to taunt him. But as he looked around, he still saw no-one. He shook his head. Probably just his imagination. So he walked on, ready to fight and slay the demon witch Lydia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did he know that Lydia was no ordinary witch or demon. She had ascended to something far greater and would be way stronger than anything the hero had faced before.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Leo continued walking through the forest, watching the evil cathedral on top of the mountain, when suddenly, the ground began to rumble. Before he was able to react, five long spikes rose up around him. He drew his sword and was about to dash out of the circle, when the ground itself lifted up. Irritated, he looked down and realized he was standing on a large platform to which the spikes were attached. Seeing this, he couldn't help but think that the structure he was standing on looked similar to a human hand. Before he could continue to follow that train of thought the ground below broke open and from the giant crack rose a titanic being. It resembled a human woman. Her right arm was extended and the platform the hero was standing on apparently was her hand. On closer inspection, she looked like an extraordinary beautiful woman. Her skin had the color of wood, yet it was soft, like human skin. Her lower body was still underground, but her slender upper body was clearly visible. Over a slim yet muscular belly, a pair of giant, tear-shaped breasts were defying gravity itself. Leo had problems averting his eyes from them as he realized they must be bigger than his entire body. Finally looking up, he saw her beautiful face. Red lips formed a playful, sadistic smile, a pair of red glowing eyes observed his every move and all that was surrounded by long, black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he still gazed at Lydia's beautiful body, she quickly closed her hand, leaving only his head and left arm free. Her smile grew wider and her long, red tongue extended out of her mouth, licking her lips. \"So, another one of you fame seeking idiots is trying to challenge me!\" Her voice was calm and yet so dominant and powerful, Leo couldn't help but feel a little intimidated, the first time in years. Before he could respond, the giant witch continued. \"Well, at least you seem to be a bit stronger than the previous ones. So, this could be at least a little entertaining.\" Damn, she was taunting him, the great Leo. He couldn't allow such insolence. He looked into her eyes, but the way they focused on him made his voice a little less intimidating than he had intended. \"Be aware, demon, that I am no ordinary hero. I am the great Leo, slayer of demons. I am not your entertainment, I am your demise.\" He cursed silently. With his last words, her already wide and crazy smile had grown even wider, making his voice break a little at the end. Whatever, talking was over and now he would let his actions speak for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his free left arm, he shot a beam of energy at her face. A part of her head was blown away, but instead of falling down, she did not move at all. In fact, she even started laughing while dark smoke rose from the giant wound on her head, like it was nothing. A sight which started to creep Leo out. He had seen immortals, but none of them were so confident, big and scary as this demon witch. At least his blow had made her grip loosen a bit, so he freed his sword-arm and cut of her hand. He fell, hit the ground and immediately jumped back up, higher than any ordinary human being could do. With the help of his magic, he flew above the trees, keeping the giant witch in sight, when he saw a movement to his left. He turned around to see a giant fist coming towards him. He turned his body so his feet would collide with the giant hand, pushed himself off and flew in the other direction. Looking closer he realized to his horror that the new attacker looked exactly like the first one. Suddenly, he realized something was behind him. He prevented a scream as he saw a third Lydia, her mouth wide open. He was not able to change direction and had to watch helplessly, as he flew directly into the wide, red cave. It closed behind him and her giant tongue pressed him against the top of her mouth. He was unable to act when the giant muscle tossed him around like a piece of meat. Eventually, he was pushed down her throat and landed in her vast stomach. The acid here was hurting him, damaging his clothes and armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was not over yet. This wasn't the first time he had been swallowed by a giant monster. He gathered more magical power and jumped forward, burning himself through her stomach wall towards the outside. He saw light as he flew out, but suddenly, he was stopped. Looking back, he was shocked to see multiple long arms coming out of the hole in her belly, grabbing his legs. Damn, what on earth was she? He swung his sword to cut of the arms, landed on top of a tree and jumped up again. He looked around to see all three of them, the first one already healed again. He had to think. Was there a right one among them or were all of them illusions?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before he could make his next move, something hit his back. He fell down and hit the ground. The projectile was still stuck on him. It seemed to be a strange liquid. On closer inspection he realized that it was spit. He did not trust his eyes. He, Leo, the great and mighty hero, had been spit out of the air like a little fly? Suddenly, more saliva was falling down on him. He tried to free himself, but the hero was already soaked in the sticky liquid. He looked up and saw now four identical demon witches, sneering down at him. A strange mixture of fear, embarrassment and anger filled his chest. He stood up and tried to look as threatening as possible. Which was not really threatening at all regarding his acid burned clothes, his saliva covered body and the fact, that he was surrounded by four giant copies of a demon witch, which were all nearly 200 feet tall, laughing and mocking him. Trying to keep as calm as possible, he decided to ...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Leo was a brave and strong hero, but he knew that sometimes, even a hero needed some help. He unleashed a sudden flash of light and ran off. Lydia, temporary blinded by the light, just laughed. \"Oh, don't think you can escape me!\" As Leo tried to find a save spot, he watched in horror as more and more Lydia's were rising from the ground. Well, this demon witch was a powerful mage, so he had to summon a powerful magic being to counter her. When he felt he would be save for at least a minute, he prepared his spell. His left arm was covered with runic symbols, thus making it unnecessary to write them down each time he wanted to do a summoning ritual. He knew that in the heat of battle, a fast way to summon help did always come in handy, so he even wrote down the runes for multiple beings. Which means, now, he had to choose which one was most suited for the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA spirit of nature. She had no fix body, but usually appeared in the shape of a human woman. She was slender, had long legs, an amazing rear and breasts which were smaller than Lydia's but still bigger than the ones of an average human. Her face was perfect, with light blue lips and silver eyes. From her head, long, light blue hair was flowing down to her butt. Her skin was just white, making any pale girl look tanned. She was always surrounded by a cold aura, freezing everything around her. However, she was no ice-spirit. It was just her cold and calculating nature. On the other hand, when provoked enough, her calm and emotionless behavior could quickly be replaced by an outburst of rage, in a worst case making her go berserk. In that state, her skin turned red, her hair crimson and her aura was sometimes hot enough to melt stone. She usually was the size of a very tall woman, a head taller than Leo, but as a spirit of nature, she was able to change her form. Her maximum size was determined by the power of the summoner and the power she could gain from her surroundings. What was not known by most people was that she was also skilled in necromancy. She could control and feast on the dead and had a tendency to try and break the rules of nature itself. Leo was a bit worried about that, yet thought of her as a strong servant and thus decided she would be a good ally. Silver on the other hand did not like Leo and thought of him as an arrogant prick. When summoned, she only served him unwillingly. Also, she always tried to trick her summoner and devour him or her to gain the upper hand, Leo being no exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe daughter of an ancient dragon and a spirit. She appeared as a human woman, but was twice as tall a an ordinary human being. Further, her elbows, hands, lower legs and feet were covered in dragon scales and her toes and fingers ended in sharp claws. From her head grew two pairs of horns and her red, spiky hair sticking out of her head always fell to her back. Her beautiful, red lips were hiding two rows of sharp teeth and her eyes, one red and one yellow, were glowing in the dark. Her body was muscular, yet feminine, with amazing curves and big breasts which would even rival Lydia's. From her back spread a pair of giant wings. It was said she was able to transform into a titanic dragon, as big as a mountain, but there were also rumors she would also be able to grow bigger without changing her form. She had a high temper, but had also a caring side for people she liked. She liked to show of her strength, but also hated those who bullied around the weaker ones. As a dragon, she was of course resistant to heat and could breath fire. However, the kind of spirit her mother was is not known, so she also had other abilities most people and even herself did not know about. She respected Leo as a skilled fighter and liked his idea of justice. She would always fight for or with him and maybe even do more for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking of the two servants he has the quick summoning signs for, he decided to call ...</span></div></div>",

The demon witch seemed to be somehow connected to the land and the spirit also had the ability to connect with nature. Furthermore, she was also skilled in forbidden arts so she knew more about Lydia's power than Leo. He prepared the ritual, channeled magic through the runes on his arm and called out to the spirit realm to summon Silver. A bright light appeared and as it vanished, the tall, blue-haired spirit was standing before him, regarding him with a displeased look, one hand on her hips. \"You again? What do you want?\" Her voice was monotone as always, but he thought he heard a subtle touch of disgust in it. He looked up at her, staring directly in her silver eyes. \"I summoned you for help. You have to fight this demon witch for me!\" Silver looked at all the Lydia's which were roaming around the forest. Some of them had already encircled them again. \"Fine.\" She grabbed his left arm, the connection between the two, her fingernails sinking into his flesh, and hissed. \"Then give me more power!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually, the summoner would sent magic to the spirit, but Silver had the habit of draining the energy out of her master by herself. Leo could have stopped that, at least he hoped he could, but he wanted to give her magic energy anyway, so he let her do it. He was a powerful hero and his body was like a well of mana, one, if not the only thing, Silver liked about him. As she sucked in more and more energy, her body grew taller and taller. Leo felt himself being lifted into the air, because the spirit did not let go of him. When she was about twice the size of the Lydia's, her fingers bigger than Leo, she stopped and put the hero on her shoulder. He was exhausted from giving so much mana, but it should be worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore any of the Lydia's could act, Silver just waved her arm, freezing the entire area. The demon witch's shattered into countless ice crystals. Yet, some of them were left and some more were rising again from below the surface. They were just copies, Silver had to find the original. She started sensing into the ground, but she did not get far when suddenly, a voice was heard from below the surface. \"Oh, what a cute little spirit. You think you stand a chance against me.\" An earthquake started to shake the land when huge boulders and dirt were sent flying through the air behind the red cathedral. Leo watched in awe and horror as a gigantic figure rose behind the mountain. It was Lydia, her body as perfect as the ones of her clones. She was still covered in mud, but did not mind about that. She licked her lips and looked down at the way smaller spirit. She could possibly crush Silver with one hand. Still, the spirit's face showed no reaction to the demon witch's display of power. She tried to move, but was stopped. Below, multiple arms had risen from the ground and were now grabbing her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what exactly were you trying to do? Bore me to death with that little, cool breeze?\" Lydia laughed and continued taunting the spirit girl. \"Even you nature spirits are nothing to me now, but seeing you, so small and pathetic, is quite a surprise. Maybe you are especially weak, or your summoner has no power, or ... you are just too old.\" She laughed again. Leo on the other hand was getting nervous. He saw Silver's eyes twitch at Lydia's last comment. He knew what would happen if the witch would continue taunting her, and he did not want to be near the spirit when that happens.</span></div></div>",

Silver was obviously taking these insults quite personally, and her anger was rising. She needed to pull forth more power, to be able to defeat the demon before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, at least, she needed enough of a boost to flee and leave Leo to his fate. Either option worked for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, little wind girl,\" Lydia sneered, voice like thunder. \"Why does a force of nature serve such a mediocre mortal? You don't seem particularly interested in his cause...oh! Or has he perhaps bound  you to his will?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver frowned, her rage tempered slightly. \"As if a witch of your power has never bound a spirit, before. It's not that uncommon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia laughed once more, which only made Silver angrier. \"Perhaps not, but it is rather odd to see a spirit as powerful as you reduced to a slave. It's unnatural...and I do know a thing or two about the unnatural. I also know how it feels to be used, abused, and discarded by others. The rage and resentment you feel must be overwhelming, at times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare patronize me,\" Silver snarled, about to lose her temper. Leo, on her shoulder, braced for impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not, little one. I'm empathizing. And offering a solution: abandon him. Drink of my power, and it will give you the strength to dissolve his hold on  you. You'll be free and untamed, and the entire natural world will be your playground. You'll be second only to myself, and I'm far more interested in letting  you properly vent your anger on this world. What say you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia's offer was not entirely altruistic. By giving some of her power to Silver, and letting the wind-spirit run free, Lydia's own sphere of influence would expand. With Silver's help, she could spread her darkness over the entire world, growing even more powerful than she currently was. She practically salivated at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver was silent as she considered this offer.</span></div></div>",

But she should also try and not to get angry again. If she would loose control too often, people would not summon her anymore. But without being manifested in this world by a summoner, she was not able to drain energy and get stronger. But she wanted to gain more power. She wanted to become one with everything. In a way, she envied the giant witch. She had found a way to become one with this land. Well, not entirely. She could feel her presence in the ground and the plants, but there was so much more. Yes, here, more than anywhere else she had been, Silver could feel death. Lydia had terrorized and killed countless people in this land. This whole place was basically soaked in the grudges the dead held against the demon witch and it was simply ... AMAZING! Silver started to use her necromantic abilities to gain power from those grudges. The fact that she was fighting Lydia, the target of the dead's hate, made it even easier. Yes, so much anger, so much hate, it was all flowing into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo was getting nervous. Silver was again using forbidden magic. He was about to tell her that it was disrespectful to disrupt the slumber of the dead, but stopped as she suddenly turned her head and looked at him. Her lips formed a smile and she was even blushing a little. Suppressing a moan, she said. \"I - don't - need - you - anymore!\" With that, she cut the connection between summoner and spirit and vanished. Leo saw the ground coming closer, but managed to cast a spell to slow his fall. He wondered what happened. Usually, a spirit was not strong enough to cut the connection on it's own. Furthermore, the spirit was only able to manifest itself with enough energy. Energy usually provided by the summoner. Of course, if the connection would cut, the spirit had some energy left to maintain it's form for a while. It was even able to drain more energy to stay in the physically world even longer. But Silver had just vanished. Well, maybe she just had enough of him and left. That was unfortunate, but Leo had to continue fighting. Maybe on his own, or maybe he should try to summon Cinder instead. On the other hand, summoning Silver had exhausted him a lot, so a temporary retreat was the best thing to do. He looked at Lydia to see if she had already spotted him again, but the gigantic witch as well as her clones were just turning their heads left and right, concerned expressions on their faces. They were still looking for Silver. And then he felt it. Her presence was still here. But where was she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a deafening laughter echoed across the land. Leo had to cover his ears. \"SO...MUCH...POWER!\" The godly voice of Silver forced him to his knees. After he recovered, he saw Lydia and her clones, all looking at the sky. He followed their gaze and to his horror, he saw the sky was filled with Silver's titanic face. Her neck just disappeared behind the horizon. How was that possible. He looked the other way and dropped to his knees again, his mouth wide open. In the distance, behind the giant Lydia, behind the wastelands, behind a faraway mountain range, four incredibly large fingers were rising in the air. Looking right, he saw a giant thumb as well. In awe and terror he realized that the spirit was holding the entire landscape in the palm of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SO, YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW I WILL DEFEAT YOU?\" She thundered. \"YOU ARE JUST A PATHETIC LITTLE WITCH WHO GAINED A LITTLE MORE POWER THAN A USUAL HUMAN. BUT I AM AN ANCIENT, MIGHTY BEING. IF YOU WOULD CATEGORIZE THIS WORLD FROM HIGH TO DEEP WHERE HIGH WOULD BE HUMANS, PLANTS AND JUST EVERYTHING YOU CAN SEE AND DEEP WOULD BE PURE ENERGY AND ABSOLUTE POWER, THEN YES, YOUR ARTS OF EVIL MAGIC WOULD BE PRETTY DEEP, BUT MY ENTIRE BEING IS EVEN DEEPER. AND SOON, I WILL BE CONNECTED WITH EVERYTHING. I WILL BE ABLE TO CHANGE NATURE, NO, I WILL BECOME NATURE ITSELF!\" She laughed again. \"MAYBE I SHOULD THANK YOU. IF YOU HAD NOT FILLED THIS LAND WITH SO MUCH GRUDGE AGAINST YOU, I WOULD HAVE NEVER GAINED THIS POWER. AND YOU LEO.\" Her gargantuan, silver eyes focused on him. \"I SHOULD THANK YOU AS WELL, FOR BEING STUPID ENOUGH TO SUMMON ME WITHOUT USING SUMMONING SIGNS FOR QUICKLY RELEASING THE SPIRIT. BUT TO YOU AGAIN, MY CUTE LITTLE WITCH. YOU ARE ONE WITH THIS LAND? SO I JUST NEED TO CRUSH THIS ENTIRE PLACE. OR, EVEN BETTER, JUST ABSORB IT. THEN, I WILL START MY CONQUEST. EVERYTHING WILL FINALLY BE A PART OF ME!\" Her thundering laughter was even enough to force Lydia to the ground. Leo on the other hand could only watch helplessly. He was responsible for this, but there was just nothing he could do.</span></div></div>",

Sadistic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood once more, looking into Silver's sky-filling face. \"Well, congratulations on your ascension, pet,\" she said with false cheerfulness. \"You may be right: I'm not an ancient nature spirit.

And I have no intention of letting you steal my place as goddess of all creation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made a fist, and Silver felt something terrible and cold constrict within her chest, as if an icy hand was gripping her heart.

The spirit never suspected Lydia had learned to become one with the dead as well. But she was so close in accomplishing her goal, there was no way she would give up now. She struggled with Lydia's will, but it was no use. The energy Silver's current physically form was based on was still controlled by the witch. But there had to be another way. Looking deep into the stream of energy, the spirit eventually spotted Lydia's soul. She tried to read her memories and feelings as best as she could in her current situation, in an effort to find something she could use against her opponent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead, she found something else. She found something familiar. The witch's desires and her will were matching with Silver's one wishes. If she wanted to become one with everything, she had to find something in the physically world to connect with, so she would be able to maintain her form. The easiest way of course was to become one with a living being. But she had always been disgusted by the ones who summoned her. Yet, now, she was facing a being who's inner self was similar to her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that thought in mind, she addressed the witch again. \"Lydia, you want to rule over everything as well, don't you? But there are things deep within the core of nature itself you still don't understand. I, on the other hand, am part of nature. Our souls have so much in common, if we become one, a part of me will be able to stay in the physical world, while you will be deeply connected with with nature and the core of magic itself. Together, we can make this entire world part of us with ease. And because our way of thinking is so similar, we will have no problems living as one. If you are still not convinced, look at it this way: I want to become one with this world and you want to control this world. If we become one and combine our strengths to fuse with all of nature, I can get the body I want and you can get the power you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia did not have to watch Silver in the eyes during her speech. Their very souls were currently connected and the witch could feel that there was no sign of betrayal in the mind of the spirit. On the one hand, the witch wanted to become the ultimate goddess herself and she was confident that one day, she would even be able to reach for the deepest parts of magic on her own. But on the other hand, you never knew what could go wrong and this spirit was now making her an offer to get what she wanted way more easily and quickly. Furthermore, if the spirit did not trick her, Lydia would be able to control their united body on her own, because she had the will and Silver was only a spirit, a force of nature made of desires. Desires which matched Lydia's own. Furthermore, she kinda liked the blue-haired girl. Looking at her current form was arousing. Becoming one with it and making it even more powerful was a thought she liked even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking for a while, she had finally decided.</span></div></div>",

But the mockery, that was starting to wear on his nerves. He knew that losing his head in a fit of anger could lead to losing his head in a more literal sense, so he wasn't about to do anything brash. However, to soothe his frayed nerves, he did spit out a harsh invective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blasted coward! Stop hiding behind these tricks, and reveal your true form!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four Lydias smiled in unison, displaying mouthfuls of teeth that seemed less like dental work and more like razorblades. \"As you like,\" one of them replied. \"Trek to my temple, and we'll meet in person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reply was so unexpected that Leo immediately suspected a trap. \"As if I'll simply walk into your temple? Do you take me for a fool?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my lost little Leo,\" Lydia purred sweetly. \"I take you for a dead man. You forfeit your life the moment you came to my domain. I can easily end you right here. But...where would the fun be in that? Instead, I give you the opportunity to be graced with my presence. My servants will allow you to approach unmolested, and we can meet and discuss your fate.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Leo got the feeling that the witch was right. He had no choice. She controlled this land, literally, but there had to be some kind of core. Her original body which was connected to the land. If she allowed him to approach it, he should do so and then attack her. He smiled. Due to her arrogance, she herself was about to present him her weakpoint. He looks up, his gaze wandering from face to face, unsure, which one to look in the eyes. Eventually he choose the Lydia nearest to the temple. \"Very well, I accept your offer. Let us meet in person and discuss our situation.\" With smooth motions, like snakes, the four Lydia's backed off and disappeared into the ground. Leo looked around, still expecting a trap, and then moved on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finally reached the red temple, he was a little surprised. There had been no ambushes and now, he could not see a single guard. He looked up at the giant door. It was open and only darkness lay behind. As he walked through it, he had the strange idea that he was entering the mouth of a giant monster. Suddenly, he felt dizzy. The door seemed to back away behind him, the light coming from outside disappearing. Eventually, he was completely covered in darkness. Yet, he felt that he was not alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked on, he noticed that the ground had become soft and there was an unusual, fishy smell in the air. Suddenly, the area around him was illuminated by an disembodied red light. Looking around, he found himself surrounded by giant, thick trees. They had no crippled branches like the ones he saw before the temple. In fact, they had no branches at all. Instead, they were just pretty huge. He continued to observe his surroundings. The forest was pretty large and the light did not reach beyond it. Where was he? He remembered legends of the forests of giant archtrees which had covered the land many millennia before. It was said there were still such forests, hidden in space and time. Was this maybe the witch's source of energy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, so you have finally arrived.\" He flinched as he heard the voice behind him. Turning around he saw Lydia. She wore pretty revealing clothes which looked like they were just underwear. They were made of black leather and shimmered in the light. Above that, she wore a long, red cape. Her long, black hair was flowing despite the absence of wind. Her crimson glowing eyes were fixed on him as she got closer. With each step, her breasts, barely contained by her leather bra, were jiggling up and down, making it hard for Leo to concentrate. There it was, the witch's true body. He just had to slay it to defeat her. He had to think of a smart way to lure her out of her defense. But on the other hand, she could hide her true form again at every moment. So he better attacked her now, using the element of surprise to his advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe charged forward, but apparently she was not surprised by this at all. She just let out a taunting laugh, winked at him and started growing. He was already to fast so he was not able to stop on the spot. When he finally came to a halt, he found himself between her enormous feet, each one as long as he was high. Slowly, she raised one of them, but Leo had already backed of. He was experienced and would not be petrified only because his enemy had surprised him. He hid behind one of the trees. Lydia followed him slowly, like a cat making the mouse think it had a chance to escape. Although her form was massive, her footsteps made almost no sound on the soft ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo knew, to defeat a giant enemy, he had to reach a higher spot. And this place was perfect. The giant trees towered even over the large witch. He ran up the one he was standing next to, but he did not get far. Lydia shot a ball of energy from her hand, vaporizing a part of the tree below him. He jumped of as the upper part fell towards the ground, but Lydia had already fired another time. Following his instincts, Leo quickly casted a spell to create a mirror shield. The deadly ball of energy bounced of and hit the surprised Lydia's hand. Now, his chance had come. Landing on the ground, he charged at her again. Quickly, while she was still distracted, he casted another spell to temporarily bind her other hand. Then, he put all his power into one jump. He flew into the air, higher and higher. Past Lydia's long legs, past her belly, her breasts and eventually, he stopped before her face. He sent energy into his sword, increasing it's size. He slashed at Lydia. She screamed as she raised the hand which was now no longer sealed and covered her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo elegantly landed on his two feet, slowing his fall with magic. The witch on the other hand had fallen to her knees, still screaming. He smiled victoriously. Now, he just had to prepare the finishing blow. But it never came to that. Lydia's screams abruptly stopped. \"Just kidding.\", she purred as she rose up to her full height. Her wounds had completely healed and to make things even worse, she was growing again. Letting out a deafening roar, she doubled again in height, now reaching almost halfway up the giant trees. Before Leo could react, Lydia raised her right foot with a speed which should be too fast for someone her size. It slammed down on the hero who only had enough time to cast a protection spell to not get crushed instantly. Every bone in his body felt broken, but his head was still free. He was unable to move and started to smell her footsweat which his clothes were slowly starting to be soaked in. He wondered, she was no ordinary human being. Not at all. So she should not be sweating from what had just happened. She was doing this on purpose. To further humiliate him. That was indeed a bad position he was in but still, it was not over yet. He considered his next move, when suddenly, he heard something that made his heart drop even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA booming laughter was heard from all around, accompanied by a strong vibration in the ground. Then, he heard Lydia's voice. But it did not come from the one standing on him, it came from the distance, yet it was incredibly loud. \"SO, HERO, YOU THINK YOU CAN DEFEAT ME? YOU, WHO CANNOT EVEN DEFEAT THAT MINUSCULE CLONE WHICH ONLY HOLDS AN INSIGNIFICANT FRACTION OF MY POWER!\" Then, the light's power was increasing. Leo looked in the direction the voice was coming from and could hardly stopped himself from screaming. Beyond the forest, there was an unbelievably large landscape. In the distance, he could see two gigantic mountains and above them, Lydia's titanic face was smiling down maliciously, like an evil goddess of doom. Then his eyes began to understand the scenery. The landscape was her belly, the mountains her titanic tits and what he had mistaken for a forest was in fact her pubic hair. Realizing that, he dropped his sword. Lydia was not just a demon witch, she was a goddess. He was smaller than a flee compared to her. There was no way he could defeat her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mocking laughter echoed around him. \u201eSO, YOU HAVE FINALLY REALIZED YOUR POSITION! BUT DON\u2019T THINK I WILL JUST KILL YOU. NO, IT DOES NOT HAPPEN VERY OFTEN THAT A STRONG AND MIGHTY HERO LIKE YOU ENTERS MY LAND, OR RATHER, MYSELF. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME BEFORE YOU, BUT MOST OF THEM DID NOT STAND A CHANCE AGAINST EVEN JUST MY STARE. YOU ON THE OTHER HAND SEEM TO BE A LITTLE MORE \u2026 RESISTANT TOY! LET\u2019S SEE HOW LONG YOU WILL LAST. AND BECAUSE YOU ARE ALREADY IN SUCH A CONVENIENT POSITION, WHY DON\u2019T YOU START DOWN THERE!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she licked her lips, watching his insignificant form with hungry eyes, he gritted his teeth in desperation. Not only had he been defeated, he would not even get the chance to die like a real hero. Instead, he was about to end up like this witch\u2019s sex toy and he really did not want to find out what exactly she meant by \u201adown there\u2019. But if he wanted it or not, he was soon about to find out that Lydia meant \u2026</span></div></div>",

I will fight on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four Lydias chuckled. The sound of their laughter and the expressions on their faces sent a shiver down his spine. \"If that is your wish, it shall be granted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lydias dissolved, but her voice continued to sound omnipresent. \"Let's see how you'll handle this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her echoing voice faded, the earth started shaking. A massive crack formed right underneath Leo's feet. He jumped to the side as an endless abyss opened up. The ground next to the gap rose higher and turned soft. Suddenly, it was no longer earth, but something else, smooth and red. He tried to keep his balance when the answer came to his mind: lips. The sides of the rift were massive lips and the gap itself was a mouth, big enough to swallow an entire village. When he gazed into it, he saw massive, white, sharp teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stumbled backwards as a gush of hot, humid wind emerged, filling his nostrils with a sweat scent. Then, an enormous tongue emerged like the head of a massive monster. It slammed against the lip he was standing on, slowing making its way towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, he jumped to the side, away from the looming abyss. But when he left the lips, he realized that the remaining ground had also turned to skin. Before him, a giant hill emerged, two gaping openings at the front side. A nose, he thought, when a tremendous wind sucked him right into one of the holes. Luckily, he was able to catch a nose hair, massive as a tree trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the wind stopped, he tried to jump down. But the hair was too sticky. A second later, the wind returned, this time blowing in the other direction. He was grabbed by the storm and sent out. Only thanks to his magic and superhuman strength, he was able to safely land on the lip again and use his momentum to jump over the abyss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, he dashed over what he assumed to be a chin, when the ground suddenly rose up while simultaneously getting steeper. The titanic face rose up. But he managed to escape, landed on real earth again, and ran. He cursed. If things would go on like this, he would not be able to attack her. Instead, he would have a hard time surviving. Plus, she was not even really attacking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going, little hero?\" Lydia's mocking voice thundered from above, shaking the earth with every syllable. \"Was I not 'almost beaten'? Come on, finish me, strong Leo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed like a thunderstorm. Cracks formed as the earth trembled. Leo had to use magic to protect his ears from bursting. Finally, her laughter stop, but the shaking did not. Four gigantic pillars emerged in the distance. No, not pillars, he realized. Those were fingers. He found himself in the palm of Lydia's hand. The ground had already turned into her soft skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith superhuman speed only a high level hero like himself could muster, he managed to jump off, right as the fist closed behind him. As he looked back, he had to use all of his willpower not to collapse in defeat. Lydia's head and hand rose out of the ground like mountains. She was no giant, she was a titan, a goddess in the flesh. He had to retreat, gather more people, maybe call for the gods themselves to go to war with this demonwitch.</span></div></div>",

While she'd been interested in the power these dark magiks gave her, there was no denying that the added physical bonuses were enjoyable as well. Yes, she liked this quite a lot. Best to show her servant the new, improved Lydia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made her way upstairs, to the small sleeping chamber. Initially lonely after her first months of exile, Lydia had been pleased to find a fellow stray out in the outskirts of the valley. She'd blessed this wretch with home and companionship, and all she asked in return was a little service. And if Lydia should occasionally lose her temper, or abuse her lackey out of frustration at her slow magical progress...well, that was simply the price one paid for the room and board Lydia provided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, Lydia was completely certain her servant would enjoy the changes she'd undergone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is Lydia's servant?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexi: A runaway with a violent temper. She hates the kingdom and the abusive family she ran from. She's not too fond of the way Lydia treats her, but she's easily manipulated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNull: An undead young man raised by Lydia's necromancy; he was her lover in life, and was killed in battle after she was exiled. He retains human intellect, but no emotions, nor memory of his past life. He is completely loyal to Lydia, although her twisted emotions often lead her to hate him just as passionately as she'd loved him in life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari: A young woman born under a bad omen, Sari was always an odd girl. Cold and emotionless, she was driven from her home when various misfortunes were blamed on her. She studies magic under Lydia, and although she hides it well, Sari plots to betray her mistress and seize the power for herself at the first opportunity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda: Belittled and ignored her entire life, Amanda wondered into the Blackfire Forest to kill herself, when Lydia intervened. She gave the waif of a girl purpose, albeit not much beyond servitude. Amanda completely lacks self-confidence, and is very easy to control. However, she does occasionally show hint of repressed rage at those in the kingdom who hurt her.</span></div></div>",

She was about to become all-powerful, an unstoppable goddess who would be able to bend the world to her will, and she wanted someone to rule by her side. Naturally, the only person she deemed worthy of this honor was her own adopted daughter, Alexi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am about to become omnipotent, my little girl. And luckily for you, I'm willing to share a fragment of my soon-to-be unlimited power with you. Be honored and accept this gift, for you will soon rule this world by my side!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia then planted her hand on Alexi's forehead and sent a surge of power into her body. Alexi didn't understand what was happening at first, but she soon felt an unbelievable wave of power flowing through her body. She had never felt anything like it, and the feeling was almost euphoric. The power continued to flow throughout her being, and within moments she herself was undergoing physical changes similar to the ones that Lydia experienced earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexi wasn't anywhere close to being as well developed as her \"mother;  she had next to nothing in the way of curves. However, as she absorbed power from Lydia, her body began to take on a slightly more sensual build. Her breasts instantly inflated from virtually non-existent A-cups to fairly small B-cups, and her butt also became just a bit defined. Much like Lydia, her skin went from a pale white to a deep tan, and a pair of small horns appeared on her forehead. Lastly, her eyes changed color from a dull brown to the same blood red as Lydia's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the transformation was complete, Alexi's body had taken on a more developed form. While her curves were still nothing compared to those of her master Lydia, she now had a body that would put most girls to shame. As Alexi's transformation was completed, Lydia lifted her hand off of her forehead and backed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I feel so different now... Like, I can do anything I want now...\" Alexi said as she admired her newfound power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you can, my little girl. I have given you power beyond anything else in the world. There isn't a single soul who can stop you from getting anything you desire now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Well, in that case...\"</span></div></div>",

And with every flare of her temper, her body expanded, growing taller and taller as her rage pulled more strength from the darkness within her. Startled, Lydia stepped back a bit.

The head of her daughter had pushed through the roof, her arms and the leg she was using to pin down Lydia had torn through the massive stone walls like paper. Shocked Lydia realized that the female behemoth, who was once her adopted daughter, was still growing. Alexi's huge and beautiful face was painted with an impish grin. She reached her huge hand down toward her crotch. Her fingers pulverized the stones of the wall in front of it, granting sight on the pink glistening folds of her pussy. She started to finger herself, and moaned as softly as a nearly-tower-dwarfing woman could. <br>\r\n\"Alexi, come to your senses?!\" Lydia begged. She felt the skin of Alexi's feet growing against her body. The weight was slowly becoming heavier.<br>\r\nAlexi gasped with pleasure. She smiled. \"I've never seen things clearer, mother!\" She started to masturbate more quickly. Her breathing was quickening. And then, with a sudden giggle of pleasure, she started to grow again. The structure of the tower made a groaning noise. Lydia observed that the walls below the destroyed roof were pushed outwards by an increasing pressure. Lydia could see the supple curve of Alexi's cleavage emerging from beneath roof line. Her breasts, pushing against the wall!, Lydia realized. It was no contest. The walls lost their fight and snapped easily. Rubble rained on the ground, while the new hole was revealing more and more of the marble-coloured flesh of Alexi's bustline - a pair of wondrous orbs making a slow-motion escape from their stone prison. Her breasts were definitely growing even faster than the rest of her body \u2013 Alexi was at least a generous DD-cup by now, according to mortal proportions. Alexi's long black hair elongated even more, framing her face and flowing down her back, while she was growing relentlessly bigger. <br>\r\n\"More!, she moaned \"More!\"<br>\r\nDespite the horror she felt, Lydia couldn't resist the unearthly demonic beauty her daughter radiated.  She looked up to see Alexi's monumental breasts rising above her, swelling still bigger as she steadily grew taller. Still under growing pressure the sorceress left hand searched her own wet sex. By now, Alexi's massive tits were rising above the destroyed roof. Suddenly, Lydia heard Alexi let out a thundering cry of satisfaction! She looked up. The young woman was growing at an amazing rate, her head shooting upward into the air! Her growing body freed itself from the stone shell. Stones and rubble were sent flying by Alexi's violent growth spurt. Finally, her growth slowed, until finally she stopped, her legs as tall as the tower had been! Alexi was magnificent. She must have stood fifty feet tall, or maybe even a bit taller! The moon behind her was bathing her flawless, gargantuan body in silvery light. She was also absolutely gorgeous. All of her features were perfect, the nice, long legs, the perfect butt, the angelic yet demonic face, framed by her long black hair.  But the most spectacular feat were her breasts, each curved with a perfect teardrop shape and swollen to the size of her head.<br>\r\n\"So much untapped power!\", Alexi groaned. She longed for more pleasure. The feeling had been incredible. \"I need more!\", she gasped. Without hesitation she slides her right index finger into the sopping depths of her pussy. The succulent orbs of her breasts bounced and swayed with her every movement; her enormous body twitched and shuddered each time her hand sank deep within the rushing river of her pussy.<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you want to do this?!\" Lydia begged. \"I mean Alexi, look at you! You're a giant! Any bigger and you won't be able to fit inside even the largest chambers of the throne palace of Widowwood.<br>\r\nAlexi smiled a mischievous smile \"You don't know how incredible this feels!! I'm beyond colossal already. What harm could another ten feet do? Or a hundred?\".<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Gently she inserted her thumb and index finger into her overstimulated sex. \u201cI hope you're ready Mother,\u201d Alexi boomed, between deep grunts and growls of pleasure. \u201c....because here...I...GROW.\u201d Almost instantly she felt it happen. Pure, unadulterated GROWTH - no heat, no tingling \u2013pulsed through her body. The ground groaned beneath Alexi's weight. She screamed, now thrusting madly, while her own juices splashed everywhere. It felt like she was literally burning with pleasure. Her body shot skywards, dwarfing the tower. Her toes crushed trough the basement walls and the tower, which had been the size of one of her legs seconds ago, now only the size of her shin, collapsed. Alexi didn't even feel the massive stones, her body send flying. For Lydia it was like crossing a siege. Massive boulders crashed next to her, shook the ground and wreaking havoc. Covered by the shadow of Alexi's towering body she could merely see the rubble raining down on her. \u201cMy home\u201d she thought, before a nearby impact threw her of her feet. \u201cAll in ruins\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nAlexi couldn\u2019t care less. She came again screaming, no longer caring about Lydia or the tower. Gasping heavy she moved forward, feeling the ground tremble under the might of her steps. The mighty, ancient tress around the tower, not even reaching half of her shin and were flattened, unable to withstand her overwhelming strength. She picked up a boulder, twice the size of her enormous hand. Playfully she tossed it up two times, effortlessly catching it with her left hand. For her it was light like a pebble. Her face was lit up by a smile and she threw it away. It collided with a mountain, the force of the impact destroyed it\u2019s north side and started a landslide. \u201cNot the peak of our power, eh!\u201d, Alexi smirked. \u201cTime to visit the town!\u201d.<br>\r\nAnd the female leviathan started moving. Her colossal breasts swaying gently as she moved.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With a wide grin, the grantees leaned over, holding back her titanic breasts with one arm so as not to let them obscure her view of her target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia was only just regaining her bearings as Alexi's long, limber fingers ensnared her, not gentle, but not actively malicious, either. The mage didn't protests as she was lifted high into the air before her adopted daughter's face, the girl's new scale truly sinking in for the first time<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, mommy?\" Alexi teased, eyes bright with mischievous delight. \"Don't you like the new me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia was furious. \"You ungrateful child! You've destroyed our home, you fool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mirth drained from the giant girl's face. \"That wasn't our home, Lydia,\" she sneered. \"That was a prison. It was where we were forced to live after those ants drove us away. Don't you want to see them pay for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The vengeance was to be mine, girl! Not yours! You've no right to take this power from me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexi frowned, and squeezed her prisoner slightly, enjoying the ensuing gasps for breath. \"Don't talk to me like that, little woman,\" she hissed. \"Because you're starting to sound like you're an enemy. And you taught me never to show mercy to our enemies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally regained her breath, Lydia was much more reserved. \"Alexi, I only want what's best for you... for us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just need to get used to the idea that you're not in control anymore,\" Alexi said. \"How can I make that clear for you?\"</span></div></div>",

Stone shattered and wood splintered under the body of the naked giantess. Alexi lolled a bit, knocking over some trees with her hips and legs. <br>\r\n\"I'm still so horny, mother! And you'll help me to find relief!\"<br>\r\n Careless she dropped Lydia on her stomach, next to her belly button. The impact on Alexi's toned muscles numbed Lydia, who rose shaking and thankful for her new enhanced body. Her old frail frame would've been broken by this harsh treatment. She took two deep breathes to get her lungs working again. The \u2013 in comparison - diminutive mage stood for a moment, head swimming, as she looked accusingly up at her titanic daughter. Alexi was...well, there were so many adjectives...gorgeous, majestic. Without a doubt the largest human being  Lydia had ever laid eyes upon. If she had been standing, she doubted very much if the roof of Stormonts castle keep would have come much past the giant girl's navel. Alexi's head lay on the feet of a mountain near Lydia\u2019s now-smashed-home, with her gigantic body stretching all the way to the river in the small canyon further north, legs dangling off its edge below the calves. Never breaking eye contact with Lydia, the girl slowly parted her shapely thighs, revealing the pink cleft that lay between.<br>\r\n\u201cPleasing me is going to be a very, very big job. And if I experience another growth spurt, it's only going to get bigger. And remember, you don't get anything until I'm satisfied. \u201d<br>\r\nLydia wanted to protest, to scream at Alexi in anger, but for the first time in years Lydia felt fear creeping back into the dark corners of her mind. A movement of displeasure sent Lydia flying, in panic she grasped something to avoid being thrown of her giantess daughter. It took her a while to realize, that she had grabbed Alexi\u2019s pubic hair.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting it, I see! So...hop to it, little one.\u201d Alexi purred with her thundering voice. Her hands started to massage her massive cleavage. Again Lydia hesitated. She walked on shaky legs until she felt the sole of her feet resting upon the velvet folds of Alexi\u2019s womanhood. From this angle, the giantess\u2019s body was truly a sight to behold. The cleft of the girl's man-sized womanhood lay behind her, topped by a well-kept mound of curly black hair. Above this rose the long, flat plateau of her stomach, the expanse broken only by the faint outcroppings of her abdominal muscles. In the distance the valley slowly transitioned into the massive curves and foothills of her bosom. And at the peak of this mountain-ridge of femininity was Alexi's beautiful face, staring down at her with barely contained lust...and more than just a hint of impatience. Lydia obeyed. She needed more time to regain control, so she had to play along.<br>\r\nAfter climbing from her daughter she rested the heel of her hand against Alexi's aching womanhood and drew down, feeling it's velvety softness beneath her tiny palm. Disgusted but somehow turned on the same time, Lydia lightly traced her way around the dew-soaked edges of Alexi's pussy, teasing her and letting the moisture spread. The overgrown girl let out a deep, guttural moan, her hands massaged her breasts more intensively. As Lydia continued to work Alexi\u2019s dripping sex, its perfume was washing over her, the stuff thick with powerful pheromones, the dark mage felt herself beginning to lose it. She planted her lips firmly against the girl's clit, and began to suck. The sound that Alexi made was not a moan, but a scream. She began to kick and thrash about crazily, so Lydia didn't dare pull away from Alexi, or risk being crushed under her tremendous girth. Her free hand slipped inside Alexi\u2019s cavernous depths. Again and again she plunged inside. Alexi was close now. Her howls of ecstasy were drawing to a crescendo; the wetness practically streaming out in a torrent.  With the force of a charging knight-army Lydia was suddenly being sprayed point blank in the face by Alexi\u2019s juices. She knew, that some women could do this during especially powerful orgasms. This was a hell of a way to find out it was true \u2013 being hit by a focused wave of fragrant juices from a girl many  times her own size. Alexi continued to buck, settled to twitching, then lay still, her chest rising and falling rapidly as the spent giantess struggled to catch her breath. Lydia stepped back several meters, and found a gigantic, exhausted Alexi staring down at her. The girl's eyes were half-lidded slits, her face flushed red with exertion. Yet despite her obvious fatigue, there seemed to be a strange sort of vitality about her all the same.<br>\r\n\u201cA good start my pet, a good start!\u201d,she moaned.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Alexi's warm, rough tongue lingered between Lydia's legs, as the giant girl's eyes lit up with perverse delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh, you taste so sweet,\" she whispered, growing aroused by having her formerly-domineering 'mother' in the palm of her hand. \"Like honey.

Lydia struggled the entire way down, but it was useless; she met her end in her adopted daughter's stomach.

Perhaps this hadn't been such a great idea...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer doubts immediately vanished as she felt her body changing again. She stood suddenly, practically roaring in joy as every one of her cells was charged with black magic, so much more than before.

Her horns extended further from her forehead, and her eyes ceased to simply be colored red; they now actively glowed with a demonic aura. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm beautiful,\" she laughed, her voice a feminine rumble. \"And unstoppable.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alexi smirked deviously as she thought about what she would do next. She was already powerful beyond belief, and devouring her mother had given her even greater power still. She was all but invincible now, the entire world was hers to do with as she wished. The transformation to her physical appearance was also was magnificent. Her once child-like body, which had no almost curves to speak of, had grown and stretched into a much more mature form that was almost as curvaceous and beautiful as her mother's was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alexi stood and admired her new sexy form, she decided that it was time to plan what to do next. Sure she could easily go straight into town and get her revenge on her former family, but Alexi wanted to have some fun with her new powers first. And she had special plans for exactly how she wanted to entertain herself. Reaching down into the rubble of her destroyed home, Alexi dug around until she found one of her old dolls. It was an old gift that Lydia had made for her when she had first been adopted: a magical doll that took on the shape of its owner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexi held back a laugh as she examined the doll, as it was a replica of what she had looked like before. Seeing how childish the doll's appearance was and comparing it to her current goddess-like form, Alexi almost couldn't believe that she had ever looked like that. Using her new magic powers, Alexi made the tiny doll begin to grow in the palm of her hand. It continued to expand until it was 50 feet tall, and while this made the doll tower over normal humans like a giantess, it still only came up to the knee of the now 200 foot tall Alexi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing the doll on the ground at her feet, Alexi began with the next phase of her plan. Concentrating her magic power, Alexi created an orb of energy in the palm of her hand. She then watched as that energy began to take on a familiar form. Within moments, the energy had manifested itself as the spirit of the recently digested Lydia, and Alexi smiled playfully as her mother's ghost stood in the palm of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back, mommy. So tell me, what was it like in there? How did it feel to be eaten and digested by your precious little girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia was filled with rage as she began to recall the incidents that had lead up to her death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?! It was terrible! Why would you do such a thing to me, Alexi?! I took you in when you had nowhere to go, I raised you as my own daughter, I even granted you a piece of my unlimited power so that you could rule by my side! I gave you everything, and this is how you repay me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see that somebody is still a little cranky. But don't worry, mom. I have something special in mind for you that will make things much better.\" Alexi said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then used her magic to levitate the giant doll into the air and shoved her mother's ghost inside of it. Alexi then watched gleefully as her doll sprung to life. Its eyes glowed a demonic red, and its ball-jointed limbs began to move. Lydia looked at her new body in shock, quickly realizing that her spirit was now inhabiting the doll she had made as a replica of Alexi when she first adopted her. While disappointed that her new form had none of the luscious curves that her former body did, Lydia was admittedly glad that she at least had a body again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you think about this, mom? You're gonna be my doll now, so I'm going to be the one calling the shots from now on. But since I know how badly you wanted to get your revenge on the royal family for banishing you, I decided that I'd be nice and make you big enough to use them as your own dolls! Basically, whenever I'm not playing with you myself, I'm gonna give you permission to go and wreak havoc on the kingdom. I'd say it's a pretty good deal for the both of us, right mommy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia didn't know how to respond. On one hand, she was being given a second chance at life, even if it was in the body of a doll version of her daughter. With this she could finally have her revenge against all those who had wronged her, and she would still be able to rule over the puny humans below her, though to a much lesser extent than she had initially intended. Perhaps if she played her cards right, she might even be able to regain the power that Alexi had drained from her and regain her position as the one in control. On the other hand, though, she was now nothing but a plaything for her daughter. Alexi could do anything she wanted to her, and she was helpless to stop her. Being dominated and controlled like that by the girl she had raised as her own daughter might just be too much for Lydia's pride to take. Would she be able to handle this new exchange of authority?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Lydia react to this?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alexi had big plans for the kingdom of Widowwood, and she wanted to get started as soon as possible. Without a second thought, Alexi grabbed the doll that now housed her mother's soul and scooped it off the ground. She then used her magic to create a rope of pure energy and tied it around the doll's neck. Lydia squirmed throughout the entire process, trying with all her might to resist the strength of her gargantuan daughter, but it was simply no use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if she still had her old body and all of her old power, the sheer difference in size was just too much for Lydia to overcome. Now that she was trapped within the body of a doll, she hardly had any strength at all. If not for her towering size, even an ordinary little girl could overpower her now. With the combination of her even greater size and her superhuman strength, Alexi was able to easily manipulate Lydia's doll body without even trying. Within a matter of moments, Alexi had secured an energy noose around her mother's neck. Giggling maliciously, Alexi carelessly dropped Lydia to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, my little toy. We've got work to do.\" Alexi said as she gave the energy rope a sharp tug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia felt the rope tighten around her neck, constricting more and more painfully with each time her daughter tugged. If she still had a living body that required air to breath, Lydia would have undoubtedly been choking right now. However, since she was now nothing but a doll, her body didn't need to breath in order to function. In this respect, Lydia was somewhat grateful. Unfortunately for her, while her new doll body was no longer bound by the needs to eat and breath, her daughter had made sure that Lydia would still be able to feel pain for her own amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With another sharp tug of the rope, Lydia fell over onto her back. Alexi then began walking through the forest toward Widowwood, carelessly dragging her doll mother through the dirt behind her. Within mere moments Lydia's body was assailed by intense waves of pain. Her neck burned as the energy rope squeezed around it, and she felt as though her head could be torn off at any moment. Lydia was constantly colliding with trees as she was dragged through the woods, and she could feel every branch that broke off against her plastic body. The tree limbs scraped harshly against her, leaving many scratch marks on her form. She could feel dirt and leaves getting wedged into her joints, making it increasingly difficult and painful to even move her own limbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this time, while Lydia was going through this torture, Alexi wasn't paying a shred of attention to her. She was just casually walking toward her destination, uncaring of the suffering that her toy was being forced to endure. Alexi herself towered over the trees, and while they did scratch against her ankles as she walked, it was barely enough to even register to her. Alexi had only one thing on her mind right now: revenge. She wanted payback against her former family for abusing her to the point that she had to run away, and against all of Widowwood for not doing anything to even try and help her. Alexi was focused on her goal, and she wouldn't let anything stand in her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Alexi arrived at her destination.

Just another reason, Lydia thought, even as she was dragged helplessly through the woods, that this girl's recklessness and impatience would ruin everything...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexi didn't seem to mind; if anything, she took joy in their attempts to prepare for her. Nothing could, naturally, so she'd just have more fun smashing through their pathetic defenses. She got a tingle just thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she reached the outskirts of the kingdom, she took a moment to stomp a fleeing peasant into oblivion, clearly telegraphing her intentions to the royal guards. She pulled up the binding that leashed her mother, smiling darkly. \"Don't want you causing trouble while I'm working,\" she noted. With a gesture, the rope reformed itself into a series of tight bonds along Lydia's body. Struggle though she may, Lydia couldn't get free from this any more than she'd been able to escape from her enormous daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll regret this, girl,\" she hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexi laughed, insane. \"Oh, mommy. We're gonna' have so, so much fun after this,\" she promised. \"And you'll learn to respect me as your master. Even if I have to break you, first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will never-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexi sighed, dropping her to the ground without any ceremony. \"I've heard this before,\" she noted. \"Whatever.

Whatever I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to enter the kingdom, leaving her mother bond and helpless in her wake.</span></div></div>",

Her body was battered from being dragged through the woods, and the bindings that Alexi had placed on her were astoundingly powerful. Lydia could hardly believe that her daughter was able to learn and master such an advanced restraint spell so soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp until earlier today, Alexi had shown no interest in magic. While her mother poured all of her energy into studying the dark arts every single day, Alexi would always be off on her own, playing with dolls or something of the like. And yet, now she was casting the even most advanced of spells with ease, everything from basic growth magic to the nigh-impossible art of resurrection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n There was no explanation for how she had so quickly mastered the power that Lydia had given her not even a day ago. The mere thought of it infuriated Lydia. She had spent years of her life tirelessly studying, working herself to the point of exhaustion, in order to learn and master the many powerful spells that she now knew. Yet within only a day, Alexi had not only mastered her newfound powers, she had managed to surpass Lydia herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst part of it all was how carefree she was with this power. She was taking advantage of it for no purpose other than her own enjoyment. She was acting recklessly and without any fear of consequence. If things kept going as they were, it was only a matter of time before Alexi made an irreversible mistake. Lydia knew that something had to be done. Sure she herself had wanted to take revenge against Widowwood, to make its residents suffer eternally beneath her, but she couldn't approve of Alexi's reckless methods. Lydia had to bring her daughter under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those thoughts in mind, Lydia began to thrash against her bindings with all her strength. She put every ounce of her energy into tearing through them, but nothing she did was working. Alexi's magical bindings were too strong for Lydia to break free from, especially with her body in its current state... Wait, that was it! <i>Magical</i> bindings! As powerful as they were, the ropes tying Lydia's body up had no physical form. They were made entirely of Alexi's magic. Magic that Lydia herself had given her. Magic that Lydia could possibly absorb back into her body once more. Lydia knew that this was her only hope of escaping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the body of a doll, one with no muscles to aid its movements, her physical strength was abysmal at best. The only thing that even allowed this body to move at all was the limited magical power that her soul inherently possessed. Breaking out of the bonds through brute force was simply impossible for her now. Perhaps in her previous form, when she still possessed a superhuman level of strength, but not now. Her only option now was to use what little magic she still possessed and overpower the magic that was holding the bindings together. If she could do that, not only would she be freed from her restraints, but she would be able to absorb every bit of power that Alexi put into creating them. And judging by how thick the ropes were, Lydia could tell that that was a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one issue remaining: Would she actually be able to do it?</span></div></div>",

This carried a great risk, as right now she was merely a soul inhabiting an otherwise inanimate object. The only thing keeping her soul anchored in the physical plane was that small amount of magic that Alexi used to resurrect her. If she did this and her plan failed, Lydia would cease to exist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout her, there wasn't a single person on the planet who stood a chance of opposing her daughter. With her gone, Alexi would no longer have anything that could stand in her way. If left unchecked, she could easily destroy not only Widowwood but the entire world as well. The fate of all life on the planet was at stake. Lydia wanted to rule over the world with an iron fist, not go on a mindless killing spree and destroy it. Alexi had to be stopped before she did just that. Even if she had to risk her own life to do it, Lydia knew that she was the only one who could. She brought this monster into the world. It was up to her to stop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcentrating with everything she had, Lydia began to expel all of her magic into the bindings around her. Her magic clashed with Alexi's for dominance, and Lydia was being worn down. Alexi had poured an astounding amount of power into these bindings. It was almost as though she knew Lydia would attempt something like this in order to escape; surely this much magic was overkill if she only wanted to restrict Lydia's physical body. She clearly wanted to keep her power in check as well while she was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Lydia couldn't give in. She wouldn't let herself be defeated by her own daughter. Not like this. With a burst of willpower, Lydia's magic began to slowly eat away at the ropes that bound her. She could feel their energy flowing into her body as her own energy tore them apart. The more power Lydia drained from the magical ropes, the stronger she became, and the easier it became to absorb more. Soon Lydia's plan came to fruition, and the energy of the bindings was completely absorbed into her being. She was free at last, and now she had recovered a great deal of the power her daughter had stolen from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sizable portion of her power restored, Lydia got to her feet. A confident smirk spread across her face as she reveled in her newly regained power. Looking down at her body, however, Lydia was very disappointed. Despite the great power that once again flowed through her, she was still nothing but a doll. A doll made to resemble Alexi. And not the current Alexi, whose body had been transformed into one that would make even the most beautiful of women jealous. No, Lydia looked like the old childish Alexi, without a single noticeable curve in her entire figure. Not only that, but her plastic body was covered head to toe in scratches from being dragged through the woods, and her joints were still clogged with dirt and grass. Something had to be done about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing a meager fraction of her power, Lydia proceeded to make adjustments to her body. The first thing was of course to repair the damage that had been done to her on the way here. As her body was bathed in a purple glow, Lydia felt a wonderful tingling sensation as every single scratch and imperfection on her plastic 'skin' instantly vanished. She then tapped each of her joints with her index finger, causing them to glow as all the dirt and grass that had been wedged into them vanished into thin air. With her joints cleaned out, Lydia could once again move freely and without pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second adjustment that she made was to her appearance. Lydia couldn't stand being trapped in what was essentially the body of a prepubescent little girl. Her body soon began to glow red, and its shape began to morph. Within moments the glow faded, and there stood Lydia in all her former glory. While the doll joints still remained, Lydia's body was now an exact replica of her own before Alexi had devoured her. All of her former curves had been restored, and even if her body was made of plastic now, she still looked amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with her appearance for the time being, Lydia decided to...</span></div></div>",

The forest around her was a dried-out husk of its former self, but Lydia hardly cared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This should have been a sensual experience,\" she noted with irritation. \"But I can barely feel anything in this worthless body.

And with all of this power she had gained, she knew she was more than capable of doing just that. Still, something about this seemed wrong. She realized that there was no way anyone would recognize her in her current form. With her newfound power she had gained a body that no girl her age could ever hope to have. Even compared to fully developed adults, there were few who possessed a figure more perfect than hers. The people whom she wanted revenge against only knew her as a child, not as the goddess that she had become. What they would see wouldn't be young Alexi demolishing their kingdom in an act of vengeance, it would be a cruel goddess tormenting them for her own amusement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't the message that Alexi wanted to convey. She wanted the people to know exactly why she was doing what she was doing. To know that they brought all of this upon themselves by ignoring her as she suffered. To know that their destroyer wasn't some cosmic deity who chose them by sheer chance, it was their own karma biting them in the butt for not helping a defenseless little girl who had been suffering for years. As she thought about how to convey that message, Alexi looked down to her side and remembered the new form she had given her mother. Lydia was a doll now. A doll made to be an exact replica of Alexi as she looked on the day Lydia first took her in. Surely the people would be able to recognize that. A devilish smirk spread across Alexi's face as she gazed down at her mother. Lydia, noticing that her titanic daughter had stopped dragging her along the ground, struggled to get to her feet once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at that, mommy. It's that pathetic little kingdom that you wanted so much to destroy!\" Alexi said, pointing toward the kingdom in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia didn't say a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, cat got your tongue? Maybe you're in too much pain to talk after I dragged you through the forest like that. Don't worry mommy, I'll fix you right up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexi then placed her hand against her mother's forehead and sent a pulse of magical energy through her. Lydia's body began to glow brightly as all the scratches on her plastic 'skin' instantly repaired themselves. The dirt and grass that was beginning to clog up her joints also vanished into thin air. Within moments, Lydia's body was as good as new. While she was glad to finally be relieved of the pain that she was enduring, the fact that her daughter had healed her after subjecting her to such torment in the first place made Lydia worry about what she had planned. Surely she had a reason for repairing the damage that she herself did to Lydia's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're ready, mommy, because I've got a special job in store for you!\" Alexi said as she undid the magical rope around her mother's neck and picked her up, cradling her in her arms like a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that, child?\" Lydia said in her frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to destroy all of Widowwood for me! Isn't that great? I'll be letting you do exactly what you wanted to, mommy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia's mouth curled into a smile as she heard this. Even if the conditions behind it weren't exactly ideal, Lydia would still be able to get her revenge against the kingdom that had exiled her. Alexi stomped toward the kingdom walls with Lydia in her arms. With a simple jump her massive legs easily carried her over the massive walls, which were famous for having never been breached by any invading army before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls were so thick that none could hope to break them, and so tall that none could hope to scale them, but Alexi managed to jump over that impenetrable defense like it was nothing. Once she was standing within the castle walls, Alexi grinned evilly as she watched the citizens panicking at her feet. Their fear was definitely understandable. Seeing a 200 foot tall girl carrying a 50 foot tall doll walk into your homeland would terrify anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there, people of Widowwood. I bet you're wondering what a big girl like me is doing here in your cute little kingdom. Well, allow me to tell you a tale that will answer all these questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce upon a time, there was an innocent little girl named Alexi. She was cute and kind, but sadly she was born into a terrible family. Every day, Alexi was abused by her cruel mother and father. Every day she cried out to her fellow citizens for help. And every single day she was ignored by all of them. Nobody cared about poor defenseless little Alexi. Only caring about themselves, the selfish citizens of Widowwood went about their daily lives, never paying any attention to the young Alexi's suffering. They all just watched as her parents beat her, belittled her, and made her life as miserable as possible. Finally, a day came when poor Alexi had had enough. She knew that nobody would do anything to help save her from her heartless family, so she decided to take things into her own hands. Gathering up what few possessions she owned, Alexi ran away from home and ventured out into the forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexi had always been all alone, so fending for herself in the woods was just like another day at home. Eventually, after wandering aimlessly for days on end looking for a place where she could belong, Alexi finally found what she was looking for. There in the middle of nowhere stood a tower, and in that tower lived a kind old witch. That witch was also from the kingdom of Widowwood just like Alexi, and she too knew the cruelty of its citizens. Taking pity on poor little Alexi, the witch decided to adopt her as a daughter and let her live in the tower with her. Life with that witch wasn't perfect. The poor witch herself was already struggling to get by on her own, and taking in a young girl only made things more difficult for her. Still, that new life even with all of its hardships was much better than the one that Alexi had abandoned. As time went by, the witch and the girl grew close. They became more of a family together than Alexi's old one ever was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Life finally seemed to be looking up for the poor young girl named Alexi. But one day, the old witch who had become her mother gained a new spell. It was the ultimate spell, one that would grant its caster a near unlimited power. The witch planned to use this spell to get revenge on Widowwood and all the people who wronged her, and knowing of the grudge that Alexi held against the kingdom, she decided to grant her that power as well. Being imbued with the power of the witch's ultimate spell, Alexi was filled with joy. Finally, she would be able to get even with the kingdom that made her life miserable. She could finally get her revenge. Everything seemed to be going her way for the first time in her life! But sadly, such a perfect situation was not meant to be. As Alexi plotted her vengeance, the witch began to have a change of heart. She decided that she didn't want Alexi to fulfill her wishes after all, and told her that she couldn't go to Widowwood with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch wanted to have all the fun to herself. Overcome by greed, she betrayed her own daughter. This broke poor little Alexi. She had already been through so much suffering, and now the one person she had come to love and trust turned on her. Filled with an uncontrollable rage, Alexi began to use the power her mother gave her to grow. Bigger and bigger Alexi became, until she finally outgrew the very tower that she and the witch called home. Knowing that the witch would only interfere with her plans, Alexi decided that she had to be eliminated. This decision broke her fragile little heart, as the witch was the only person she had ever truly cared about. With a heavy heart and tears streaming down her cheeks, Alexi picked up the witch and plopped her into her mouth. Having devoured the witch and absorbed all of her powers, Alexi's body began to change. From the little girl she once was, her body transformed into something that would make any woman jealous. She became unimaginably beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, even though Alexi now held everything she could have ever hoped for, she still felt empty inside. She longed for the companionship of the witch, the one person who treated her as a person whose life held value. With her incredible power, Alexi pulled the spirit of the witch from her stomach and planted it inside a doll. A doll that the witch had made for Alexi on the first day they met. One that was a mirror image of Alexi's former self. The witch had been reborn as Alexi's favorite doll, and now that doll is going to be the bringer of judgment! You will all pay for what you did to me!\" Alexi cried out, ending her story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she gently placed Lydia onto the ground and patted her on the head. Instantly five magical threads shot from her fingers, connecting themselves to Lydia's wrists, ankles, and neck. With a flick of one of her fingers, Alexi made Lydia's body move on its own. Lydia felt her leg being lifted up before quickly slamming down once again. Her plastic bare foot flattened several panicked citizens beneath it as Alexi let out an evil laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dance, my puppet! Dance and destroy everyone who made us both suffer!\" Alexi said maliciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia thought about what to do for a moment. If she went along with her daughters plan she could finally destroy the kingdom, even if it did mean being manipulated like a puppet in the process. On the other hand, the magic threads were much more thin than the rope Alexi strangled her with earlier. She could probably break free and escape if she tried hard enough...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will Lydia do?</span></div></div>",

All that mattered to Lydia was that she would finally be able to feel the bodies of those who wronged her being crushed to a pulp beneath her feet. As long as she could finally make them suffer, Lydia was willing to endure the humiliation of being turned into her daughter's toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexi simply smiled down at her mother as she saw the look of pure sadistic satisfaction on her face. When her daughter didn't move her again, Lydia snapped at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? What are you waiting for, child?! You're the one who put these strings on me! I can't move without you, so hurry up and work those fingers of yours! I want to make these vermin suffer! Isn't that what you wanted too?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But of course, mommy. I was just waiting for you to ask. So, are you ready to become my puppet of destruction?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, I just want to put these insolent worms in their place! If that means becoming your puppet, then so be it! Make your move, child!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha! Oh, with pleasure mommy! We're going to have so much fun with this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at that, Alexi began to skillfully manipulate the magical strings and control her mother to do her bidding. Her fingers danced and Lydia's body followed, leaving nothing but death and destruction in her wake. The citizens of Widowwood could do nothing to stop the 50 foot tall doll from destroying their homes. They could only watch helplessly as her plastic fists crashed through the walls of their buildings, causing them to collapse in on themselves. Her colossal feet snuffed out dozens of insignificant lives with each passing minute, and try as they might the citizens were unable to outrun them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia, having no control over her body at the moment, simply relaxed and allowed her daughter to do all the work. She didn't care one bit that she was being used like this any more. All the embarrassment that she felt before had been driven away the instant she felt those first few bodies popping like grapes beneath her soles. As Alexi skillfully controlled her mother and had her ravage the kingdom, Lydia simply relaxed and enjoyed the feeling of each and every life that she ended. Regardless of the circumstances behind it, Lydia was getting incredibly aroused as she exacted her revenge. If she still had an organic body, she would have been soaking wet between her legs right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rampage continued for what felt like an eternity. Lydia had demolished dozens of buildings, ended hundreds of lives, and she loved every minute of it. Alexi was enjoying it just as much as Lydia, as she knew that the one causing all this destruction was only her doll. If she herself were to have taken part in the rampage, she could only imagine what the outcome would be. Just when the both of them were hoping that this sensation would never end, a certain family appeared before them that drew Alexi's attention. Seeing who it was, the young puppeteer stopped Lydia in her tracks as a malicious smile spread across her face. Oh yes, Alexi wanted to deal with <i>them</i> personally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat family had approached them?</span></div></div>",

But the king or one of his military advisers clearly felt that these two could help stop the carnage, if they could but communicate with Alexi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd why shouldn't they? These were her parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two, oddly enough, bore the mark of high society, which surprised Lydia once she realized who they were. Alexi's father was a tall, lithe man with light brown hair, and a slight limp. Her mother was a blond, buxom thing who wore expensive, gaudy clothes and jewelery. From what she knew of them, Lydia recalled that the man was a drinker, and the woman a vapid, verbally-abusive shrew. Although she and Alexi were clearly on bad terms at the moment, Lydia still felt a slow rage build at the sight of these two. What little compassion Lydia still felt was devoted to her adopted daughter, and knowing that these people had abused and neglected made her blood boil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could move to approach them, however, Lydia felt the magic of her shackles pull her back. A quick look up to the titan Alexi made it clear that this was personal. Even if she'd had the power to object, Lydia wouldn't have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what do we have here?\" Alexi demanded at her pint-sized parents. \"They had to drag you out of hiding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexi, I-\" her father began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP!\" Alexi roared suddenly, terrifying the entire kingdom into a stunned silence. \"You ants don't get to talk! And you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gestured angrily at the soldier escorting them, taking the man entirely by surprise. He didn't have a chance to move, or even react, before Alexi fell to her knees, and slammed her enormous fist on top of him. He was reduced to nothing in mere seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where were you when I needed you?\" she snapped at the red stain she'd left on the ground. \"Where were ANY of you? They say the right things and know the right people, so whatever they do to their daughter is their own business? You all deserve what I've done tonight! And you two-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to her parents, of course. Any sense of composure had been well and truly lost at this point, as they cowered before their godly child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You deserve this most of all...\"</span></div></div>",

Now don't you get ahead of yourself, young lady! New powers or not, I am still your mother! I took you in when you had nowhere else to go, and this is how you repay me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care who you are, you're going to be my servant from now on!

Without hesitating for a moment, her hand shot forward and grabbed onto her mother's forehead.Lydia tried to break free, but her daughter was surprisingly strong for a girl her age, even before being granted her new powers. She was always able to put up a decent fight with people who were much bigger that her, and this was no exception. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but surely, Lydia felt the strength being drained from her body. Alexi simply laughed at her mother's plight as she continued to absorb more and more of her power. Lydia knew that if she didn't get away soon, it would be too late. Alexi was becoming very powerful very fast, and soon even Lydia wouldn't be any match for her. If she didn't do something quickly, Lydia would end up becoming nothing but another helpless plaything for her own adopted daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

The irony wasn't lost on Lydia; her magical knowledge was immense, but she didn't know a thing about being in a street fight, and the latter knowledge was what she needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Alexi, this was pure bliss. Her body continued to grow larger and more curvacious as she drained her \"mother\" dry, each bit of dark magic opening new and exciting vistas of possibility for the girl. She would never need to control herself again, never need to bite her tongue or watch her considerable temper. No, she was going to indulge her every impulse, and if that tore this world asunder, well...that was the price to pay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished draining Lydia dry, she purred quietly, overwhelmed with sensation.

The sight of the most powerful person she knew being pinned down and at her mercy was an unbelievable turn on for young Alexi. Her lustful eyes looked down into her mother's, and seeing the look of extreme pain on her face, she couldn't help but giggle evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy is nothing but a toy to me now.\" Alexi said with a devilish smirk. \"And I love to play rough with my toys.

I said you're my toy now, and toys don't talk back to their owners!\" Alexi said with a glare of frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia tried to respond, but Alexi bounced herself up so that she slammed down directly on her chest, crushing the air out of her lungs. Alexi's face then became much more caring, and she gently placed her hand against her mother's cheek. Leaning forward, she forced herself on her mother and locked her in a passionate kiss. Their tongues wrestled for dominance within their mouths, but Alexi was clearly the superior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As her lips pressed against Lydia's, the young girl began to grind her bare pussy against her mother's chest. Her juices began to leak out as she became more and more aroused, but Lydia's end was far from enjoyable. As her daughter's huge body rode her, she could feel her ribcage beginning to creak from the pressure. Alexi's massive weight was too much for Lydia's body to handle, and she was flooded with pain as her own daughter had her way with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse, the combination of the weight and Alexi's lips sealing off her mouth made it all but impossible for Lydia to breath. Things only got worse as time went on. Alexi never released her kiss, and her grinding was beginning to get more and more wild. Each moment was complete and utter agony for Lydia. Struggle as she may, she could do nothing to escape from beneath her young daughter. In fact, her squirming was only serving to arouse Alexi even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia let out a cry of agony as she felt the first of her bones finally give in to Alexi's overwhelming weight. Soon another crack could be heard, followed quickly by several more. Alexi laughed as she heard her mother's weak bones breaking beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, what's the matter? Is big bad Alexi too much for the little dolly to handle? Don't break on me just yet, I'm still not finished with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Alexi's grinding was kicked into overdrive. Lydia squealed in pain as all of her body was being crushed under the weight of her amazon daughter. She could feel every bone in her body being ground into dust, and she was beginning to suffocate from lack of air. Lydia was being raped by her own daughter, and she was helpless to stop it. Alexi was destroying her. With minimal effort the young girl was reducing the powerful mage's fragile body to nothing. Alexi laughed at how easy it was to overpower her own mother like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what felt like an eternity of torment beneath the crushing weight of her young daughter, Lydia passed out into merciful unconsciousness from lack of air. As her mother faded away, Alexi finally broke the kiss. She continued grinding against Lydia's unconscious body, not caring one bit about the damage she was doing to her in the process. With one last moan, Alexi released her orgasm all over Lydia's unconscious form, coating her mother's body in her love juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... Oh my god... That was... Absolutely amazing, Mommy! We're definitely... Gonna be doing that... A lot more... From now on!\" Alexi said in between breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young girl grinned ear to ear as she looked down upon her handiwork. Lydia's body was completely broken. Her arms and legs twisted at impossible angles as the bones within them were shattered. Her face and chest were dripping with Alexi's cum, and her ribcage was completely caved in. Alexi was amazed by how she could have done this to her mother. Lydia's body was an absolute wreck. Alexi had destroyed her mother through the simple act of sex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another laugh as she realized just how powerful she had become, Alexi snapped her fingers and allowed her magic to repair Lydia's battered body. This was just the beginning. When her mother woke up, Alexi planned to have even more fun with her, and she couldn't have her in such a condition when that time came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

It practically exploded upon impact, falling over without even a groan of protest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not just Lydia,\" Alexi whispered to herself, grinning with satisfaction. \"Everything is a toy to me...\" As she contemplated her power, her hand found its way between her legs, as she thought of the possibilities before her. Her stamina was superhuman, and her lusts were insatiable. She leaned against the tower as she shamelessly fingered herself, eyes rolling back in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First...first, I'll do 'mommy' again,\" she breathed. \"Then we'll go to the kingdom...see how many...how many I can do, at once...they'll fight, but they...they can't stop me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magic within her began to stir, again.

She was surprised to not feel any pain whatsoever after her ordeal; at least Alexi had allowed her that minor kindness...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexi. The name filled her with terror. She had to get away from her oversized, oversexed \"daughter\", before she was literally fucked to death. Lydia stood slowly; where was that girl?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer came in a terrifying instant, as the roof of the tower was literally ripped away and casually discarded. Lydia screamed with absolute terror at the sight above her. Alexi was huge! She was easily bigger than the tower, now, and what Lydia could see of her nude curves had magnified as well. What's worse was the giantess's eyes; they had the same crazed lust as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for more, 'mommy'?\" Alexi purred, reaching for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mage barely had time to run before she was enclosed by huge fingers. \"You...are you insane?!

The floor sank slightly in protest of the twin mounds of flesh that rested on it. Alexi's breasts were easily twice Lydia's height, and unimaginably fat besides. Each featured a nipple larger than Lydia's head, harder than a rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like my tits, 'mommy'?\" Alexi purred. \"Bigger than yours, I think.

Lydia was at once horrified at her daughter's display, and yet deeply jealous of her power and freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, mommy,\" she panted, grunting between each word as she thrust harder against the tower. \"You did...so good...better hold on...or you'll get crushed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia didn't need to be told twice. Despite her reluctance to do so, she grab a hold of Alexi's left nipple, which grew lager and harder at her touch. This extra bit of stimuli was enough to push Alexi over the edge. With a final cry of, \"Mommy!\", she brought the tower down. It had been their home for years, and Alexi had just fucked it to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia shuddered at the thought of what was to come.</span></div></div>",

She was about to become all-powerful, an unstoppable goddess who would be able to bend the world to her will, and she wanted someone to rule by her side. Naturally, the only person she deemed worthy of this honor was her own apprentice, Sari. Unfortunately for Lydia, she was unaware of Sari's true intentions. Completely oblivious to her apprentice's plans of betrayal, Lydia reached behind Sari's neck and pulled her in so that their faces were mere inches away from eachother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am about to become omnipotent, my dear apprentice. And luckily for you, I'm willing to share a fragment of my soon-to-be unlimited power with you. Be honored and accept this gift, for you will soon rule this world by my side!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia then pulled Sari forward and embraced her with a passionate kiss. As the two girls' lips locked, Sari could feel an overwhelming power flowing into her body. The power continued to flow throughout her being, and within moments she herself was undergoing physical changes similar to the ones that Lydia experienced earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari wasn't nearly as well developed as her \"master\"; compared to Lydia, her breasts and butt weren't anything too impressive. However, as the young woman absorbed power from Lydia, her body began to take on a much more  curvacious build. Her breasts instantly inflated from small B-cups to fairly large C-cups, and her butt also became much more defined. Much like Lydia, her skin went from a pale white to a deep tan, and a pair of small horns appeared on her forehead. Lastly, her eyes changed color from a peaceful blue to the same blood red as Lydia's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the transformation was complete, Sari's body had taken on a much more developed form. While her curves were still nothing compared to those of her master Lydia, she now had a body that would put most girls  to shame. As Sari's transformation was completed, Lydia broke their kiss and backed away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, my little apprentice, what do you think? This power I have given you is greater than any other. Together, we shall have revenge on all those fools who have wronged us. And soon, the entire world will be at our feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right master, this power is unbelievable. But there is just one little problem that I need to address...\" Sari said as she slowly walked toward Lydia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what might that be, my apprentice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore saying anything, a devilish smirk formed on Sari's usually emotionless face. She then quickly lunged forward and knocked Lydia over, pinning her down to the ground and grabbing her wrists to prevent her from resisting. Looking up at her apprentice, who was now sitting dominantly atop her chest, Lydia was filled with rage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the meaning of this?! Release me at once!\" she yelled furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari simply laughed evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, I'm ever so sorry, <i>master</i>... But you see, I have this thing about power; I really don't like to share it with anyone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Sari planted her lips over Lydia's once again and began absorbing more of her power. Lydia struggled fiercely to escape from her apprentice, but Sari's position on top gave her an advantage. Slowly but surely, Lydia was being drained of all her power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Sari revelled in the thought of her betrayel. Intense pleasure cursed through her body. Within a few seconds her whole body was filled with this intense sensation. Every muscle in her body tensed and flexed involuntarily. Her clothes were getting uncomfortable, her shoes were pinching her feet. But despite all this, it felt...great. The pale blonde grinned. And then, slowly, Sari started to grow. Her, already long, legs lengthened, her hands stretched outward, her head gradually rose towards the ceiling.<br>\r\nIn her grasp she could see Lydia beginning to change as well. Lydia's body was no longer overhelming, it seem to dimish. In a way that was almost impossibly to quantify, she seemed less imposing, less intimidating. Soon it was clear \u2013 she was getting smaller.<br>\r\nSari's clothes tightened, and she started to hear the sound of tearing fabric. Her already to small shirt finally gave up and disintegrated off her expanding frame, leaving Sari's upper body completely naked. Sari's fomerly small breasts experienced an even greater boost then before, they now were huge, magnificent. They were round and firm and nearly the size of her head. And she was still growing!<br>\r\n\"More! More!\", Sari moaned.<br>\r\nShe was flexing her thigh muscles as hard as she could. Her trousers, already strained to their limit, couldn't take it. They ripped in half, practically exploding off the apprentice's body. Their remains fell from her long legs. Sari towered over the shrinking Lydia. She was huge, naked, and proud. She was even more gorgeous than she could have imagined. Her alabaster skin gave her the apperance of a noblewoman. She was surprisingly thin but her abs and thighs well-toned. Her long blonde hair cascaded down to the small of her back, a few wisps covering the rosy tips of her nipples. Her breasts were wonderous big orbs, perfectly tear-shaped, proudly defying gravity itself. Lydia on the other hand was significantly smaller than before. Somehow she had kept her new youth and her looks, but she was only a feet tall. Sari grinned, scanning her surroundings. She must have been at least ten feet tall. She lifted Lydia with one hand. The way her former master was cowering in fear made her appear even smaller than she actually was. Her eyes were frantic, like a caged animal.<br>\r\n\"Come to your new mistres, Lydia!\", Sari growled as she lifted Lydia to her face. The blonde's head was nearly touching the ceiling.<br>\r\n\"To thank you for your present, I'll allow you to life and serve me!\", Sari purred and dropped the helpless woman. Lydia hit the ground hard. The draining had exhausted her.<br>\r\nSari surveyed the room around her from a perspective she never thought she'd have in her wildest dreams. She felt more powerful than she ever has in her life. Almost unbidden Sari's fingers began to tease the lips of her sex. She was soaking wet. Meanwhile, she found herself unbearably horny. She needed to get rid of some pressure, and fast.</span></div></div>",

Despite being such a threatening force, she was of irresistible beauty too. Her skin had the noble colour of alabaster and her body almost looked like it had been made of the very same material. But \u201cmade\u201d was to crude, \u201csculptured\u201d was a more fitting term. Every inch was perfect, like the old statues on the palace roof in Widowwood. She was reminded of the warriors of the amazons on the far eastern wing, depicted in the large battle of Hor\u2019nak. It had been the amazon\u2019s finest hour. Led by her famous Warrior-Queen Laurel, they had defeated an orc-army, outnumbering them ten to one. Like Laurel the beauty before her was athletic beyond comprehension too. And still she had kept a feminine beauty.<br>\r\nAmanda had never been a poet or intellectual, but still her mind kept searching for anything she knew, she could compare with the view in front of her. She had been that dazzled since Sari had blown through the massive stone wall like a hot knife through butter. Unimpressed by the amount of destruction caused by her grand entrance, the female juggernaut had directly turned to face Amanda. Suddenly she found herself toppling over, her body flying through the air. Sari caught hold of her as she fell and slowed her descent to the ground. Before I had a chance to realize what was happening Sari\u2019s enormous body was on top of Amanda and she was pinning her wrists to the dusty floor. First Amanda thought of fighting back, but was stopped short as she became conscious of the fact that Sari was at least four times her mass. Sari placed her sinful, red mouth on Amanda\u2019s and kissed her savagely. Amanda now resisted, trying to clamping her mouth shut as Sari\u2019s tongue traced the edges of her pursed lips. Sari knew that Manda was completely overmatched, and switched to using just one hand to hold down both of Amanda\u2019s. No matter how hard Amanda tried she couldn't move Sari even an inch. Sari's free hand began to tenderly stroke Amanda\u2019s hair and face. Suddenly Amanda\u2019s resistance crumbled. It was not the first time Sari had sex with her. They were used to meet in the basement, hidden from Lydia\u2019s eyes. It was no love-making. Amanda would never call it that way. For such a poetical term Sari was to cold and calculating, even in the moments of pleasure. Amanda knew, Sari was using her \u2013 every time \u2013 without deeper feelings. Sometimes it stained the sex, because Sari \u2013like in all things- knew what to do, the perfect spots to touch, but it was without passion. In these moments it felt almost mechanical, despite Sari\u2019s skilful movements. This time was different. Not only Sari had changed to colossal all-powerful beauty, it was passionate. It was wild and every fibre of Amanda\u2019s body screamed for more. Sari thrusts her finger deep inside her, pressing into her g-spot as she came out again. Amanda squirmed in waves of pleasure, they both came several times until they both succumbed to exhaustion and fell asleep \u2013 although Amanda was sure Sari could have went on for hours.<br>\r\nAmanda woke up, her head between mountain-like breasts, her own thin frame sprawled on, the hard ridges and lines of Sari\u2019s recently acquired six pack. Even her soft, sleeping breathes felt incredible powerful. Gently Amanda stroked the underside of Sari\u2019s monumental breasts. Sari had become a being beyond any description. And at the peak of this mountain of femininity was her beautiful face, hidden behind this mountain-ridge of breasts. Amanda had been shocked, when she had seen that Sari\u2019s ice-cold blue eyes had turned dark red and she had almost been repulsed by the horns. But Sari\u2019s overwhelming other features had extinguished her doubts in seconds. She flinched when Sari suddenly spoke.<br>\r\n\u201cGet up, Amanda. We\u2019ll meet outside. We\u2019re going for a walk!\u201d<br>\r\nImmediately she rolled from the towering former-apprentice. After all the from-sex-to-business demeanour was typical Sari. Amanda grabbed after her clothes.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I like you the way you are!\u201d Sari\u2019s seductive voice demanded. Amanda thought about protesting for the fraction of a second, but decided otherwise. Sari had never been known for accepting objections.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When she left through the smashed front door she saw Sari waiting for her. Sari was still naked too. Moonlight glistened on her pale skin and fair hair. Amanda lowered her gaze when she saw the other inhabitants of the tower. She nearly hadn\u2019t recognized the transformed Lydia, not only because of her minuscule size. Seeing the horns and enhanced female traits clearly showed from whom Sari had obtained this power. Amanda was simple, but not dumb. She knew that her old mistress has somehow been tricked by Sari. Sari was good and intelligent, but not overly creative in her methods.  Seeing Lydia enhanced, fuelled Amanda\u2019s feelings of being ugly and insignificant. Her harsh childhood had severely damaged her self-awareness. So Amanda was still unable to appreciate her own beauty and skills. And she was beautiful, despite the fact she would never see it this way. She had long dark red hair and her rare smiles could win any person in the kingdom. She was tall and moved with a natural grace, even though she was trying to move unnoticed all the time.  She admired Sari\u2019s toned muscles, because Amanda herself was very thin and frail. Nonetheless she had an ample bosom, perfect shaped, voluptuous orbs. Conservatively estimated she was packing at least a DD, on a frame that looked built for B's. The cold of the night made her rosy nipples hard again. Ashamed she hid them behind her hands. No one cared. Alexi and Null were imprisoned in large, makeshift  cages. By the looks of them Sari had formed them out of iron-bars from the small forge behind the tower. Lydia\u2019s prison looked more delicate, like a very-large bird-cage, made of gold. Sari surely had used magic to create it. Sari had loaded the cages on the large carriage. They normally used it to get wood. Instead of horses, Sari was moving the carriage with one hand.<br>\r\n\u201cThere you are!\u201d she grinned.<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re we going!\u201d Amanda asked with a hushed voice.<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re visiting the city, my shy, little Amanda!\u201d Sari replied still grinning. The colossal blonde let go of the carriage and moved in front of Lydia. She bent down, her massive breasts obscuring Lydia\u2019s view on her face.<br>\r\n\u201cBut first a lesson for my former, mistress!\u201d she smirked. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been too fond of alliances and pacts - too willingly being dependent on someone. First the king, now your little daemon-pact \u2013 whose benefits the both of us enjoy at the moment \u2013 you seem eager to bend your knees.  But I\u2019ve got to admit, a pact with the succubi-queens: clever indeed!\u201d<br>\r\nLydia glared defiantly at Sari. The blonde\u2019s perfect torso and malign grinning face filling her whole field of view. Lydia was still shocked to be considerably smaller than Sari\u2019s upper part of the body.<br>\r\n\u201cBut I\u2019m going to teach you a lesson, my former mistress!\u201d Sari boomed and stood up. She put her hands on her mighty hips and started to speak dark, guttural words, Amanda didn\u2019t understand. Suddenly hellish winds started to howl and dark voices whispered. Their noise increased and dark tendrils appeared from the ground and starting to entangle Sari\u2019s extremities. Sari just ignored them and continued to speak. Amanda screamed when one of the tendrils pulverised a rock near Sari. The blonde mage withstand incredible powers. The wind grew stronger and stronger. Sari\u2019s blonde hair streamed around her head and was obscuring her face. The noise of the storm and the former whispers became deafening loud, before they suddenly vanished with a painful squeal. Amanda rose from her cowering position. Her gaze searched Sari and found her. The blonde colossus stood at the same spot, she had occupied during the storm, unmoved and unharmed. Her ample bosom gently rose with her serene and calm breathing, her angelic features looked peaceful. Her eyes were closed. Amanda immediately noticed that the horns had vanished from Sari\u2019s forehead. Fluttering Sari opened her eyes, which were no longer red. The cold, clear blue of Sari\u2019s eyes had returned. Like glaciers glistening in the sun. All trace of the daemonic powers had vanished and the blonde behemoth stood taller, fuller and more powerful than before. Sari grinned and all the trace of the succubi-queen in the making was banished in the blink of an eye. In her place was a mortal demi-goddess, brighter and more dangerous than ever.<br>\r\nLydia\u2019s defiance was replaced by shock. \u201cHow?\u201d she stammered.<br>\r\n\u201cThe books of Ur\u2019Shorass, my new apprentice! You remember them?\u201d Sari answered with her sultry voice.  \u201cDaemons tend to betray their pact-partners. So I decided to cleanse myself of them, but keep their gift of power!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou broke the pact with the Queens for us?\u201d, Lydia gasped desperately.<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Sari answered with her coldest smile. \u201cI broke their bond with me. My soul is not their prize to take.\u201d<br>\r\nLydia seemed to shrink even more, when her small, daemonic form sat down and she wrapped her arms around her legs. Sari leaned over the cage again, closer this time. The underside of her massive bosom indented the cages top.<br>\r\n\u201cAs you can imagine, the daemons were not happy about my course of action and your failure to contain me. So if I were you I wouldn\u2019t die soon. Enraged daemons do terrible things with the soul of mortals.\u201d Sari smirked coldly. \u201cBetter stay on my good side, slave-apprentices! My might is the thin line between eternal damnation and torment and the joyful life as one of my favourite pets!\u201d<br>\r\nLydia burrowed her face in her arms and started to sob. Amanda felt almost sorry for her. Sari had outwitted the dark mage completely and her fate was in Sari\u2019s hand now\u2026 For all eternity. The unlimited power she had always strived for had been snatched out of her hands and she had to watch while the betrayer lived her dream. Lydia had never been a good mistress, but she had cared for Amanda in a time no one else had. Fate was a cruel mistress for Lydia in the last hours.<br>\r\nAmanda\u2019s gaze fell back on Sari. Soaking in every detail of the blonde colossus body the moonlight revealed.  She felt a tingling starting within her nether regions. Amanda felt she was getting hot inside, and gooey like maple syrup, just by looking at Sari. \u201cIt should\u2019ve never happened\u201d she thought, feeling warm droplets running down her thighs. She desired Sari\u2026 Even loved her? She didn\u2019t know, she just knew it was bad news to become emotionally involved with her \u201cice-queen\u201d.<br>\r\nSari grabbed the carriage again. \u201cCome, Amanda! This kingdom needs to see his new queen. I think we start at Geredan. After all this town is close by!\u201d. Slowly Amanda followed Sari, her gaze fixed on the mages perfect butt, all the while walking in a way that her inner thighs rubbed against each other softly. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For while her exterior might be a shrunken, hollow shell of a human being, her mind was as active and vengeful as ever, and her sobs masked a deep, deep meditation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You've overplayed your hand, Sari,' Lydia thought to herself. 'And your folly will cost you dearly...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing on the remnants of dark energy within her, Lydia concentrated until she felt completely detached from her physical form.

Your little pet has bitten the hand that fed her, absconded with the power I bestowed upon you, and left my demons nothing in return. You will suffer dearly for your carelessness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia's spirit showed no sense of intimidation by this demonic force. \"And what does that get you, my Queen? Merely my soul, which you'd already claimed. You're no better off. Meanwhile, a mere mortal has bested you. Stolen from you. Made you a laughingstock. You can see her ambitions. The legends of her power will spread, and its origins will become known. Generations of mortals will know that she stole from you with impunity. Unless she is stopped. Now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you would do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might, were my terms met. I want to become something far more terrible and powerful than you were willing to make me before.

Although never particularly amorous, Sari had to admit that the influx of godly power was certainly making her feel rather lustful. Once she was done ripping the power from Lydia, perhaps the older woman would serve well as a mate. The first of a potential harem, in fact...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari was so distracted by her post-ascension planning that she failed to feel the anger rising in her victim. No, not just anger, but rage. Pure, undiluted rage against the backstabbing  upstart Lydia perceived her to be. And with that rage, came power. Rather, with it came the key to more fully unlocking the power both already possessed. Unfortunately, Sari, cold and calculating, couldn't access these powers on that level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a practically inhuman snarl, Lydia forced her apprentice off of her, eyes bright red with fury. \"You...worthless little bitch!\" she roared, uncharacteristically blunt and vulgar. \"You dare to harm me? To betray ME? I am your master! I am your God!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari was alarmed by this turn of events; she could feel the power in Lydia blaze stronger and brighter. So much power, which would be so easy to take...but not while Lydia was so furious. There was but one logical course of action: retreat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, Sari leaped from the tower window, her new power allowing her to land gracefully and take off in a mad dash. She had to distance herself from Lydia, allow the other woman's rage to die out. Then, she'd try again. More careful, this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, that may be easier said than done. Sari heard an odd explosion behind her, turning back to see what had caused it. What she witnessed made her blood turn cold. Lydia had grown, exploding outward from the tower, her nude body looming high over the forest. What's worse, her rage continued to feed the process, and her body continued to swell and expand even as she searched for her traitorous apprentice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you?\" Lydia bellowed. \"I'll find you if I have to rip this forest apart!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the obvious, terrible dangers, Sari couldn't help feel a pang of lust for the godly giant. She was so beautiful, so powerful, so commanding. The girl hesitated, unsure of how to proceed.</span></div></div>",

It would be difficult to do so, considering she hadn't quite figured out how to channel such energy without the rage Lydia was clearly making use of, but survival provided an awfully handy incentive to learn quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes in concentration, even as the reverberating quakes around her indicated Lydia was getting closer.

Suddenly a paralyzing toxin was released from the tips of Lydia's fangs, spreading through Sari's veins throughout her entire body. It was then that a horrifying realization hit her like a ton of bricks. This was how snakes fed. They would bite their prey and immobilize them with their venom. Then they would swallow them whole, and snakes were known to be able to swallow animals much larger than themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly Lydia's poison began to run its course through Sari's body, seeping into her muscles and rendering them useless. Soon her entire body was still and immobile. Uncoiling her tail, Lydia let Sari's paralyzed body fall to the ground below her. Hovering her face mere inches away from Sari's, Lydia flicked out her forked tongue and licked her apprentice's lips, laughing to herself at the look of disgust and terror on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia then dislocated her jaw and took Sari's entire head into her mouth. She continued to slowly slide her mouth further and further down Sari's paralyzed body, scraping it and drawing blood with her sharp fangs in the process. Sari wanted nothing more than to be able to move right now. To be able to fight back and resist being swallowed like this. But no matter how hard she tried to move, her body refused to respond to her desires. She was forced to look at the inner lining of her master's throat as she was slowly pushed further down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Lydia's mouth reached all the way to Sari's toes, and she closed her mouth around her apprentice's bare feet. Snapping her jaw back into place, Lydia finally swallowed Sari all the way down and let out a loud belch. She enjoyed the feeling of power as her stomach acids slowly ate away at her apprentice's body. Every moment of it was agony for poor defenseless Sari. Midway through the digestion process the poison finally wore off, but by that point her muscles had been corroded to the point that she could barely even move anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hours of agony sitting in her merciless master's stomach and being eaten away, Sari finally was given the sweet mercy of death. As her life faded away, Lydia absorbed all of the power that she had within her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow stronger than ever before, Lydia decided to move on to her next mission:</span></div></div>",

She smiled, and it was not a pleasant sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why would I want to go back? I'm perfect this way!\" Lydia snarled, and then struck with lightning speed. Her tightly coiled tail propelled her at the other giantess. Sari tried to block, but was too weak and slow. Lydia's fangs found her neck and injected a dose of lethal venom into her veins. Lydia pushed the tottering giantess backwards. She fell through the portal, eyes unfocusing as the toxins did their work. Lydia closed the portal, knowing her apprentice would be dead almost before she hit the ground. That is, if the other dimension had any ground. Chuckling evilly, the giant snake slithered off through the forest. She savored every new sense her form gave her, from heightened senses, faster moving, greater strength, and a certain evil aura that killed any vestiges of a conscience she may have had. In fact, when her tongue flicked out she could literally TASTE humanity. And her only though was of prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe village was in a small clearing. The townsfolk saw Lydia come slithering over the trees just as she spotted their buildings. Now focused, she sped up her movements. The giantess burst from the forest onto the fields, crushing three field hands running for the \"shelter\" of the village. The sensation of their tiny bodies being popped and the ground into her scales was almost too much for Lydia. Her lust was only tempered by her hunger. And this she was able to satisfy in full. The village must have held close to three hundred people. In the course of ten minutes, every last one of them was in some way consumed by the naga. Whether is was by the enormous serpent slithering right over them, turning a screaming human into a greasy stain, or having the roof ripped off their dwelling and then eaten alive, not a soul survived Lydia's emergence. In the rampage, she bulldozed through entire buildings to get at one person that caught her eye. At the end of it all, Lydia was completely satisfied. She lay coiled amidst the wreckage of the largest buildings in the village, feeling hundreds of tiny people struggling and digesting inside her. She quietly chuckled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, Sari has been a very good apprentice,\" she murmured, drifting off to sleep in the afternoon sun.</span></div></div>",

Today was the day Widowwood would see what they had created. Lydia flicked out her serpentine tongue, as of already tasting the King. Determining the direction of the city, Lydia slithered off into the West. In what was to be her later misfortune, she faced several distractions on the road. Several trading posts and farms lay along the road to Widowwood. Lydia, eager to experiment with every part of her new anatomy, stopped to destroy each one in new and creative manners. However, the giantess was less thorough than before. Several horsemen slipped out ahead of the monster, driving their steeds as fast as was possible. Although Lydia caught most of them later after developing a special taste for whole horse, at least one managed to bring word to the King. The King, having had no doubt Lydia would one day return for her revenge, readily believed the messengers. By the time Lydia had finished pillaging the roads and came to the gates of the city, the King's entire army stood amassed in the fields before her or standing along the walls of the city. It gave Lydia small comfort to see the entire army suddenly go stock-still at the sight of her body. But then a small file opened, admitting a figure in white armor to the front of the lines. Reassured, the pikemen steadied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lydia! I knew you would one day return for your supposedly deserved revenge on me. So let me offer this, fight me alone and forget about the rest of my kingdom,\" The figure said. Lydia immediately recognized the king. The former her would have crushed him instantly.

Something that doesn't belong to this world! Can't you see? I tried to save you from exactly this! Please, fix this and rejoin me!\" His speech done, the King awaited Lydia's response. Lydia, for once, was slightly thrown off. The King was right, the dark arts had turned her into a monster. But then the inner voice of the serpent spoke.<br>\r\n'A beautiful monster.'<br>\r\nLydia smiled, her reptilian eyes narrowed to slits. She charged forward at the assembled army. As she passed through the first line, she felt their spears prod at her tough scales. Less than a second later, the titanic naga felt them snap against her on rushing form. Dozens of armored soldier were crushed like tin cans as Lydia slithered through the first row, heading straight for the walls.</span></div></div>",

Already, any onlooker foolish enough to get close to her would notice the small bits of dead skin forming along her lightening-fast tail; Lydia's meal were fueling future growth, and she was beginning to molt. Still, the impulse to feed was overwhelming, now that so much meat was in sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you watching, your majesty?\" she sneered, stopping to loom over the castle walls. She was still being struck with a barrage of arrows, but even those that lodged in her side were little more than pinpricks to the enormous naga. \"I'm about to do what no other enemy ever hasss; I'm going to breach your wallsss, and ssslay your people. And all of you antsss are helplesss to ssstop me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia placed her hands along the ramparts of the castle wall, taking a moment to flick a hapless sentry out of her way. She was going to rip the walls down with her bare hands, when a sudden gusts of wind swept over the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia turned, curious. It was as if a violent thunderstorm had just descended upon the land. But the sky had been clear mere moments ago. What was all this, then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a feeling of energy, not unlike after a lightening-strike, pulse through the air, Lydia suddenly recognized the sensation. Someone of great power and skill was opening a portal between worlds. Surely, no one among the royal court had such magic, or the king would have already deployed them against her. So, the portal must be opened from the *other* side, which most likely meant...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia's suspicions were confirmed when the familiar voice of her traitor apprentice rang out. \"Not quite so fast, 'master',\" Sari sneered, passing through the portal.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At first Lydia was curious about how her apprentice might have survived, but now she froze. Sari was not human anymore. Somehow she had also transformed into a deadly monster. Her body looked like that of a black scorpion with a red shimmer on it's back. Her two giant claws looked big enough to wrap around Lydia's whole body and the tip of her tail was hovering in the air, displaying a dangerous stinger. Instead of a scorpion's head, Sari's upper body grew from the front part of the creature. Her skin looked darker and harder, her arms were protected by an armor of dark plates, similar to the ones of the scorpion's body, and her fingers ended in sharp talons. Her upper body still looked thin, but her muscles were clearly visible and her breasts had swelled to rival even Lydia's melons. Her hair had become red and had grown a little longer, her eyes were still a glowing crimson and her red lips were forming an evil smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia, still stunned by the turn of events, whispered. \"How is that possible. You should not even be alive anymore.\" Sari's smile just grew wider. \"You see, you made the mistake of not making sure I was finished. I changed my body to save me from your poison. The only way I could think of was to turn in a poisonous animal myself. In one way or another, you made me this way.\" She laughed. Lydia crunched. This was bad. Her treacherous apprentice had returned and was more powerful than ever. So, the snake witch only had one option. She had to take her out while her power still made Sari still self-confident enough to make mistakes. Without warning, Lydia's tail was lunging at the scorpion witch. But her apprentice never was one to miscalculate her own abilities and thus she was in no way just relying on her powers. No, she was keeping a cool head as usual. Expecting Lydia's attack, she just grabbed her tail with one of her giant claws. Lydia shrieked as the scorpion witch threw her through the air. She hit the ground, crushing everything beneath it. The people of Widowwood did not even know were to run. The ones who already started fleeing when Lydia began her attack had to turn because the giant naga fell right before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, they did not get far when the witch's body rolled them over because Sari pulled her former master back toward her. But Lydia was far from done. She leapt forward, sinking her fangs once again in Sari's neck. She looked at her, smiling triumphantly. But that smile soon vanished as the other witch just smiled back. \"Didn't I tell you already? When I changed my body I made it immune to your poison.\" Lydia screamed in pain as Sari's other claw grabbed her below her waist. \"You are always getting so emotional. Those emotions are blinding your vision.\" She trapped the witch's upper body in a deadly hug. Despite the situation, both of them couldn't help but feel a little aroused when their giant breasts pressed against each other. \"And that is why you fail and I win.\" With that, she led her tail descend downwards and pierced Lydia with it's stinger, injecting her own poison into her. The naga screamed again, but Sari just threw her aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she felt a little itch. Looking down, the remaining soldiers were shooting arrows at her which all bounced off inefficiently. \"Oh, how cute.\" She knew she should just finish Lydia off, but seeing these people, people like the ones who blamed her for their misfortune and banished her, she felt something. A deep, suppressed hate. But thinking about it, now she really had become some kind of 'bringer of misfortune and despair'. She smiled viciously. Why not giving the people what they wanted. It wouldn't take long. She was about to grab them when she thought of something else. She was not an ordinary monster, she had become a goddess who could bent reality itself. So she could at least get a little creative. The soldiers had stopped firing arrows when they realized that they only made the scorpion witch laugh. But before they could start to retreat, the ground was suddenly sinking. They tried to run, but most of them fell and the rest failed at climbing up the walls of the depression which formed underneath them. Suddenly, the ground stoppe moving, but before they could get up, water came from the center of the hole and filled it. Hot water. They screamed when coming in contact with it, but there was no escape. Sari just laughed at the squeaking little people swimming in the pool of hot water. At last, she made the ground turn to stone. Proudly, she looked at her giant soup bowl. The soup was lacking some ingredients, but the most important ones were in it. She grabbed it and drank. The hot water did not harm her, but the soldiers were already too exhausted to even try to get out of the stream of water that was flowing toward Sari's mouth. One after the other, they fell into the gaping hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Lydia was lying on the ground, pain filling every inch of her body. But she could neither scream nor move. The poison was paralyzing her whole body. It hurt so much and she couldn't do anything. She let out a silent cry of anger. She had trusted her apprentice but she had betrayed her, like the people in Widowwood had betrayed her. And now that traitor was about to gain the power Lydia had worked for all these years. That was simply not fair. She felled anger once again swelling in her chest. If her stupid apprentice could have nullified her poison, than Lydia, the mighty witch, should be able to do it with ease. She focused on her body, on the poison within it. And then she started to change her body, just so much it would be able to resist the poison. Slowly, it started to work. The pain was getting weaker and she could feel her body again, move her arms and tail and a smile formed on her face. Time to show that brat who was in charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up, Lydia saw Sari, holding a bowl in her hands, drinking from it. The sight irritated her a bit, but she had to act fast. At the moment, Sari's body seemed to be superior to hers. So she just had to change that. Focussing, she prepared a spell that would serve her needs, when suddenly, Sari noticed something moving. She turned around to see Lydia, ready to cast a spell. She cursed. It was to late to stop her. At the same time Sari started to prepare some sort of counter, the snake witch casted her spell.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before Sari was able react, Lydia was engulfed within a blinding light. The scorpion witch closed her eyes but suddenly felt the temperature rising. She looked over to her former master and saw in shock and confusion, that the ground beneath the giant naga had turned into lava. The snake witch was slowly sinking into it until she disappeared completely. Sari carefully approached the large pond of lava. What did Lydia do? Did her spell failed? Soon, she received answers to those questions. Answers which she did not like. Lava was gushing upwards when Lydia rose from the pond. Her body had transformed again. Her skin was now dark red, her hair flaming orange and her eyes were glowing with a bright light. Her horns had gotten longer and thicker and deadly spikes had formed on her back, shoulders and elbows. Only her upper body was reaching out of the sea of lava, but she still towered over Sari. Bending down towards her, lava was dropping from her long hair and her massive breasts. Her former apprentice could only watch in awe. There was no way she could attack her, even a some steps away the heat was almost unbearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, time to put you in your place!\" Lydia shouted, then she inhaled deeply and breathed a stream of fire from her mouth. Screaming, Sari jumped out of the way. The place she stood just seconds ago was now completely burned. Looking back at Lydia, she realized in horror that the lava pond was expanding. The witch grinned sadistically, her face ominously lit from the hot liquid underneath. Sari turned around. She had to flee. She ran and tried to cover behind a small mountain. \"Think you can hide from me?\" Lydia's voice echoed across the land. Sari started sweating as it got hotter and hotter. Turning around, she realized that the mountain was slowly melting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the king of Widowwood and his council were at a loss. When the other monsterwoman appeared, they hoped that one of them would just take out the other and the winner would be weak enough for the kingdom's army to take care of. But instead, the two were destroying the land and instead of getting exhausted and weaker, one of them had gotten even stronger. The king looked out of the window. Half of his land was crushed and the other half was flooded with lava. In the distance, the titanic form of Lydia, her back toward the castle, was rising before the sky and sending a beam of fire from her hand to melt an entire mountain. Upon seeing all that he realized that his kingdom never really had a chance of participating in this battle. They were just helpless bystanders, doomed either to be destroyed during the fight of the giant witches or to be at the mercy of the winner. As the mountain was slowly melting away, Lydia leaned forward a little more, moving her body a bit further out of the lava, exposing her giant ass to the kingdom. Due to her leaning position her perfectly round buttcheeks were a little spread and drops of hot liquid were slowly running over them. Looking around, he saw that his councilmen were all looking in the same direction. He raised his cup of wine. \"Well, if we are doomed anyway, let us at least enjoy the show while we still can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the council of Widowwood was drinking their wine, Sari still sat behind the melting mountain. She could see lava flowing from it's top towards her. Shaken by fear, she could only wrap her arms around herself and wait. To make things worse, her mind was suddenly flooded with all her bad memories. The people in her hometown had looked down on her. They had hated her although she had never even done something bad to them. Now, all she wanted was power. Enough power so that no-one would ever look down on her or hate her again. She wanted to escape her fate by just getting stronger and stronger. But Lydia was far to powerful. Sari was no match for her. She started to weep. She had almost been able to defeat her. But then... then her emotions got her. Made her do stupid, useless things. And now they were about to overwhelm her again. No, she wouldn't do the same mistake twice. Emotions had always been her enemy. Slowly, she calmed down, ignoring Lydia's evil laughter behind her. She had to think about the facts. Her former master was stronger than her, so brute force was no help. Lydia had transformed into a giant fire demon. Sari could not attack her, because the heat would roast her almost instantly. So she had to find a way to turn the giant witch's advantage to her disadvantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari smiled. Easy. She just had to change her form into something more suitable for a fight like this. For that, she basically had two options. She could turn into something more resistant to fire, like a dragon. Or she could turn into something water-elemental and either lure Lydia towards something like a lake or the sea or somehow bring a large amount of water towards the fire demoness.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sari knew her only choice was to turn into something her former master\u2019s form was weak to. She looked around and only a few miles to the south, she saw the sea. In her current massive form, she could cross the distance in no time. She dashed toward it and luckily, the bright light emitted from the burning mountain made it hard for Lydia to see Sari behind it. When she finally moved in sight, the fire demoness stopped her fire beam and turned towards the other witch. \u201eNow, where do you think you\u2019re going?\u201c, she asked with a playfully dominant tone. She focused her magic and let the lava field extend in a straight line toward the scorpion witch, annihilating everything in it\u2019s path. Sari desperately tried to run as fast as she could. Right before the lava reached her, she jumped and safely landed in the water. Behind her, where the lava met the sea, it cooled down to stone, while the water boiled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia slowly walked through the river of lava towards the spot where Sari had disappeared, unable to see clearly due to all the steam. Suddenly, a giant tentacle lunged forward, grabbed the witch\u2019s left arm and dragged her forward. Lydia let out a short scream and as the steam subsided, she was shocked to see Sari\u2019s new form. Her hair had turned green and her eyes were glowing blue. Scales, shimmering like rainbows, covered her lower arms, her back and part of her cheeks and breasts. Instead of a scorpion\u2019s body, eight massive, dark-green tentacles were growing from below her hips. Her upper body had swelled a bit larger, but was still smaller than Lydia\u2019s, yet her tentacles made her appear almost bigger than the fire demoness. The older witch cursed as she was dragged towards the sea. As her arm got closer to the cool water, she could feel it getting numb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari on the other hand was feeling great. Water was deep and cold and she thought it was just like her. Lydia looked at her, her eyes burning even brighter, and sent a stream of fire from her mouth towards the other woman. Sari let a wave of water rise. Colliding with the fire, both vanished. Before Lydia could do anything else, Sari answered with a splash of dark ink. It hit the fire demoness right in the face, forcing her to close her eyes. In the meantime, the cold witch sent forth another tentacle and grabbed Lydia\u2019s free arm, dragging her even further towards the water. She smiled viciously. Just a bit more and she had Lydia right were she wanted her to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Lydia let out a loud roar, making Sari hesitate for a second. She was angry. More angry than she had ever been. She had broken that record multiple times this night. This little brat was still trying to oppose her. She probably even thought she had a chance. And yet, Lydia was unable to move, her body getting more numb by the second. It couldn\u2019t end like this. She was the mighty witch, the one who was about to become the goddess of this world. More and more anger swelled within her and with anger came power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari cried out in pain as Lydia\u2019s arms began to get hotter and hotter. Her tentacles were about to get burned so she let go of her. The heat made the water boil and steam filled the air. Before it began to hide Lydia\u2019s form, Sari got the strange feeling the demoness was getting bigger. She had no choice. Whatever was happening, she had to take her out. Standing on her tentacles to her full height, she prepared to punch Lydia right in her face. But instead of hitting her cheek, she hit something pretty soft. Suddenly, the steam vanished and to her horror, Sari realized that where she suspected her opponents face, there was only one of her giant breasts, still jiggling from the impact of her hit. \u201eIf you want me that badly, why not ask me first? Come here, little one.\u201c With that, Lydia grabbed Sari with a hand, almost large enough to wrap around her entire body. She screamed as she felt her skin starting to burn and the air being pressed out of her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia let out and evil laugh and emitted a wave of fire, burning everything near the beach. \u201eThat\u2019s right, no-one can stop me!\u201c Meanwhile, Sari desperately struggled to get free, but there was no hope. Lydia\u2019s hand was to strong. But amidst her hopelessness, Sari remembered something. While Lydia had been busy planning her revenge, Sari had always tried to read as much books in secret as she could to learn things her master did not know about. One spell was a transformation spell to turn the opponent into a helpless mass of goo. She knew she would not be able to cast this spell on Lydia now, but she did not want to either. As she had read about it back then, she had wondered if it would be able to control such a goo body. An ordinary mage would probably not be able to. But Sari was no ordinary mage anymore. With her current abilities, she was more like a goddess or at least a demigod. She should be able to do so. So with her remaining strength, she casted the spell and saw only an irritated look on Lydia\u2019s face, as her former apprentice melted away in her hand. \u201eWhat is this?\u201c, she screamed, but she could not get a hold of her and Sari fell into the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwimming around as a formless mass, she tried to control her new body. Slowly, she was moving around. Then, she formed it into a shape which looked similar to her old body, just that it was entirely blue and transparent. Triumphantly, she smiled only to have that smile vanish as she saw her gigantic former master shooting fireballs at the water, making it slowly boil away. Sari cursed. She was sure she had absorbed at least half of Lydia\u2019s power, so why was she so much stronger. It couldn\u2019t be just because she was more experienced. Anger started to fill Sari and with that came a rush of power. Then it hit her. Hers and Lydia\u2019s powers were based on dark magic. Magic that fed on negative emotions. Her hate and anger were the reasons Lydia was so strong. So for the first time in years, Sari looked inside herself. And what she saw was shocking her. Her whole heart she had hidden all this time was overflowing with hate. She hated the people in her hometown who had treated her like shit. And she even hated Lydia. Yes, she was also an abandoned one, but it was her fault her people had banished her. Before that, they loved her. So in the end, her former master was just like all those other people. That was why she had betrayed her. That was why she wanted to gain all this power for herself. She hated everyone and everything in this world and she wanted to destroy it all, she wanted to make everyone suffer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she found what she had been looking for. She was about to give in to her hatred, but then she hesitated. Did she really want this? Emotions could not be controlled. Did she really want to become like Lydia? In her books she had read about other sources of energy. Those which did not depend on emotions. In her current form, she was able to escape through the ocean, but Lydia would have problems following her. She could search for old wisdom to learn about those kinds of magic. She thought about it when suddenly, the water temperature started rising dramatically. Lydia was once again pointing a beam of fire at her hideout. She had to decide, now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sari would never give in to her emotions. She did not want to become a raging idiot like Lydia. With an incredible speed, she moved away from the coast, away from Widowwood, away from Lydia, towards another continent. The older witch saw something move inside the water. \"Damn that brat.\" She was about to jump after her, but then remembered her current form would be allergic to water. She started thinking about a suitable new body, but then stopped. Sari was nothing compared to her. She would try to hide somewhere, but Lydia was about to conquer this whole world and then any other world she could find. Sooner or later, she would find Sari again. Only then, the mighty witch would be even mightier, making it easier to toy with Sari. Yes, she would save that pleasure for later. Turning around, she looked over the kingdom of Widowwood. She had thought she was pretty big, holding Sari in her hand and all, but even that brat was a colossus. So now, seeing the land of those pathetic, mortal people, she began to truly feel like a goddess. She was probably big enough to hold the whole castle Widowwood in the palm of her hand. An evil and sadistic smile formed on her face. This will be fun, she thought. The people in the castle could only drop to their knees and shake in fear as the titanic witch approached them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Sari swam through the ocean and for the first time in her life, she felt truly free. She had soon noticed that Lydia wasn't pursuing her, so for now, she could feel relieved. After what seemed like hours, she finally reached another coast. A city was build here and the people were shocked as out of nowhere, a giant wave erupted from the ocean, completely covering the whole place. To their horror, the water did not move back inside the ocean. Instead, it started to rise up, forming the body of an unbelievably beautiful woman. Sari looked around, smiling sadistically as she let her body flow in every corner of the city, absorbing all the tiny citizens. After all that desperate fighting against Lydia, completely dominating over this pathetic civilization felt kinda fulfilling. When she finished devouring every last person in this place, she started moving further into the land. She remembered from old maps that an ancient place must be nearby which was often mentioned together with long forgotten arts of magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she entered a desert. As the sun was burning down on her, she slowly started to feel weak and tired. Her current body was meant for being in cold and wet places. A desert was no good. So she chanted another spell, first transforming back into a more human form, then turning her arms into wings. She rose into the air and flew around, searching. Finally, she found what she was looking for. Ruins, covered in sand. She landed and, realizing that this place was not made for someone her size, returned her body to that of an ordinary woman. Well, that of an exceptionally beautiful woman. Standing in the middle of the place, she focused her magic to create a storm that would blow away enough of the sand to free the ruins. Then, she started looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she found out about the history of this place. An ancient race had lived here. They had found a way to gain energy directly from the other side, basically using magic in it's purest form. That art of magic was not bound to any emotions, but solely to it's user's will. The problem was that it was difficult to control this energy with your will. The ancient race managed to do so and all the nations around them viewed them as gods. But eventually, they got careless and took their powers for granted. They started using more and more energy while getting more and more casual in using it. So in the end, they lost control and destroyed themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari smiled. That was exactly what she was looking for. A power not controlled by emotion, but by her will. She always had a strong will and was always cool headed enough to not let her emotions make her loose her concentration. And if the ancient race was able to become like gods with this power, she wondered what she would be able to do. With the powers she has already acquired, she was far more powerful than a normal living being. She kept looking around and eventually found an old building filled with books. Luckily, the ancient race had been able to make the old tomes last for eternity. Of course, they looked old, but most of them were almost undamaged in spite of their age. Now, she only had to read them and learn how to use this art of magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time had passed, Lydia had laid waste to the kingdom of Widowwood and the surrounding nations. For each of them, she had changed her form and had tried to find new ways of using her powers to their full potential, testing her limits. Meanwhile, Sari had studied the old art of magic. Eventually, ...</span></div></div>",

But soon, the survivors rose again from those ashes, only to serve their new goddess. The witch had eventually returned to her original form, only she was still 200 feet tall. She had used a spell to craft herself a crimson robe. Her finger- and toenails were also blood-red. Using her powers, she had also created a throne for herself between two mountains and sat there, thinking about her next move while the poor mortals worshipped her to prevent themselves from ever being the target of her rage again. As the goddess-like witch was relaxing there, people climbing and massaging her feet, a beam of energy suddenly hit her. She flew back, her throne and the valley where it had been were completely destroyed. Her robes were burned, but her skin was unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an angry look, she rose and to her surprise and dismay, she saw Sari. The other witch was even more beautiful than before. Her legs were long, her curves were incredible, her buttcheeks looked like two perfect orbs, her tear-shaped breasts had become even bigger, her brown hair flew long down her back and from her perfect face, two golden eyes stared at Lydia. Also, Sari was now twice her size and an unfamiliar aura surrounded her, almost like she would emit a bright light. Yet, what worried the older witch the most was that she had not sensed her rival's coming. Still, she had to keep calm. She was still convinced she had the upper hand. No matter what power Sari had found, it wouldn't be able to rival hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up, looking angrily with her red glowing eyes at Sari. \"Well, well. Who do we have here? I thought I'd let you live in peace until I would find you again, but instead, you returned to me? Are you so desperate to be destroyed?\" She laughed maliciously, gathered her power and started growing, ripping her clothes apart, until she was two heads taller than her opponent. But Sari just smiled. \"I have gained power beyond yours. Let me show you!\" With that, she dashed forward, hitting the unprepared Lydia right in her chest. The impact created a shockwave that flattened the ground around them and sent the bigger witch flying back again. But instead of hitting the ground, she stopped mid-air. Slowly, she rose back to an upward position, a crazy smile on her face. \"You little brat. There is no way you could ever defeat me.\" With that, she sent a beam of energy at Sari, illuminating the entire area, completely vaporizing everything in a straight line before her. The people all tried to run, but there was no way they could escape the clash of these giant witches. Eventually, Lydia ceased her attack. An evil laugh escaped her as she saw that nothing was left of her opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she froze as she heard an all too familiar voice behind her, or rather, above her. \"What are you laughing about?\" Turning around, she directly faced the vagina of the other witch. \"That's right. Please me and maybe I'll let you live as my sextoy.\" Without hesitation, she grabbed Lydia's head and shoved her face into her wet pussy. The black-haired woman gave a few muffled screams as she tried to gasp for air. Sari moaned deeply. Humiliating her former master was so satisfying. But she should not repeat her mistakes. The other witch was still dangerous and she should finish her of. After that, she would have a world filled with sextoys. She threw Lydia away, focussed her will on the energy of the other side, created an orb of pure magic power in her hand and shot it at her opponent. The explosion created a giant crater, it's shockwave desolating the entire area around them. A satisfied smile on her face, Sari approached the spot where Lydia had been before. She stopped and bit her lower lip in frustration as the black-haired witch once again rose up, seemingly unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari did not want to go all out. She was still not sure how much of the energy of the other side she was able to control. But she was also tired of slowly raising the amount of power she put into her hits. She had to force Lydia to show her true potential to better calculate what it would take to defeat her. So she gathered more energy and shot upwards, doubling again in height. Looking down she noticed to her satisfaction a village by her foot, not much bigger than her big toe. She moved her toe slightly to the side, completely crushing the place. Smiling sadistically, she thought that soon, all those pathetic, little bugs would be hers to toy with. She then looked at Lydia and said: \"Ha! You're nothing. If you think you are so mighty, then when do you plan to show it? Come on! Show me what you can really do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, that was had enough. The moment that stupid brat returned, Lydia got angry again. Her anger rose more and more and now the younger witch was even taunting her. How dared she? She would show her what a true goddess was capable of. Completely giving in to her emotions, her body was filled with more energy than it had ever been. With a deafening roar, the witch almost exploded. Shooting upward, her expanding feet were crushing the already devastated land around them. Sari could only watch in awe as her opponent grew higher and higher. \"MORE! MORE!\" Lydia screaming and moaned and started to stick her fingers into her wet pussy. She had never felt this good before. So much power was rushing into her. Eventually, her growth stopped, accompanied by an orgasmic scream. She then slowly moved to a sitting position. Countless people screamed out in terror and some in pleasure as her titanic butt, each cheek as big as an entire kingdom, was coming down. As it hit the ground with a thundering noise, louder than anything ever heard in this world, the impact created cracks in the ground, large enough to swallow up entire villages. The titanic goddess then stretched her legs, trapping Sari between her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe much smaller witch could only stare at Lydia's giant pussy. Like a giant red cave, it rose before her. Even at her size she did not even reach halfway up the enormous sex canyon. Looking back, she saw the other witch's legs stretching far into the distance. As she eventually tried to look at Lydia, her jaw dropped. Her face was an unbelievable distance away and was almost entirely blocked by her gigantic breasts which had gotten even bigger, dwarfing every mountain Sari had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia smile satisfied when she heard a small voice. \"So this is the entirety of your power?\" \"Yes, it is, little mite!\" She smiled, but was still a little unsure. Because Sari was so small, she could not clearly get the tone of her voice. But the smaller witch's next action made it easy to get what situation they were in.</span></div></div>",

Try as she might, she couldn't pull any further power from within herself to match her former master's godly ascension. \"Damnations,\" she whispered. \"Why isn't my magic any stronger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned, trying to run, already knowing it was a futile effort. There was nowhere she could flee to; the entire landscape had been overwhelmed by Lydia's incomprehensible form. Within moments, she saw the shadow of her foe's castle-sized palm reaching for her, and was plucked by fingers as long as cathedral spires. Sari found herself being raised up, past the expanse of Lydia's soft, white stomach, past breasts that dwarfed mountains, up to a face that filled the sky, grinning with a darkness that chilled the younger mage to the bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, little girl, you thought to depose me?\" she purred, her hot, sweet breath washing over her prey in a wave. \"With new magics you've only recently learned, attempting to outdo the works I've been practicing with my entire life? It'd be hilarious if it wasn't so pathetic. And that's all you are, Sari. A pathetic joke, who could have lived forever as my right hand. And now...well, I believe the offer you made me was to be your sex toy, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titan licked her lips with a tongue that was almost serpentine. \"Despite my better judgment, I did enjoy your taste, little girl. I'll gladly take another.\" Without waiting to let the smaller giantess react, Lydia's tongue snaked out once more, sliding over ever bit of surface it could find on Sari's naked body. The younger goddess tried to resist, but the huge red muscle easily subdued her, violating every available crevice and lingering between her legs until the girl cried out in a mixture of fury and passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia withdrew her tongue slowly, moaning as she did so. \"I really should thank you,\" she purred. \"I'd grown content as I was, satisfied with the mortal as my slaves. I laugh to imagine how pitifully small I allowed myself to be. This...this form suits me. The power sings to me, and every sensation is magnified a thousandfold. I am no longer satisfied to rule this sad little world. I will ravage it, destroying everyone and everything in an attempt to sate my endless desires for pleasure and power. I am going to fuck this planet into non-existence, and ascend beyond it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch-goddess' words brought a new level of terror to Sari. She had no idea that her former master had descended so far into madness. What's worse, she knew Lydia was more than capable of realizing her terrifyingly insane desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But before I embrace my destiny and rape reality into nothing,\" Lydia continued, cheeks flushing with lust in anticipation of her coming orgy. \"I'm left with the pertinent question of what to do with you...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So why not start with you!\" Before Sari could fully realize the meaning of the goddess-like witch's words, she fell. Lydia had let go of her and now, the smaller witch was falling though the air, screaming. She saw her tormentor's face rising higher and higher, when she eventually landed of her left breast. She bounced of the titanic orb, hit it again, slid down down the soft flesh and eventually collided with Lydia's giant, pink, erect nipple, which was almost as big as Sari herself. Next to her, she saw Lydia grabbing her other tit with her right hand. Her breasts were so big, her hand sank almost completely into it. Looking down, she saw her left hand sticking in her vagina, moving around, while the goddess let out multiple deep moans. Sari cried out in fear again as Lydia began moving her body back and forth. She grabbed harder onto her nipple, making the giant witch even hornier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally seemed to stop, Sari was about to sigh in relieve. A sigh which quickly turned into another scream as a shadow was cast over her. Looking up, she realized that Lydia's right hand had let go of her breast and was now hovering above her minuscule form, extending her index finger and thumb. For a moment, she thought about just jumping down, but she knew it was no use. Everything below her was just ... Lydia. The goddess-like witch was everywhere and there was no escape. Her strong fingers grabbed her and lowered her towards her wet pussy. Not even trying to resist, Sari watched helplessly as Lydia was putting her into her giant sex cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's were you belong!\" She heard the load, godly voice from above. There was nothing she could do as the darkness swallowed her. She was surrounded by walls of flesh. She could feel the blood pulsating through it, making a noise louder than thunder each time. She tried to move, tried to escape. If it weren't for her enhanced body, she would have already drowned in Lydia's cum. But her struggle just made the titanic witch moan loader, made her stick her fingers and Sari's body even deeper into the vastness of her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the smaller witch heard a muffled, orgasmic scream from above. A scream witch deafened everyone in a few miles radius, making every structure still standing crumble. She was then flooded out of Lydia's sex cave and landed in a sea of her cum. Exhausted, she looked up at the other witch.</span></div></div>",

She continued to rub herself lewdly, looking at the gigantic, insignificant Sari through lidded eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to just kill you, you know,\" she breathed. \"But you were such a good little girl in there, I'll give you a further chance to serve me. Rejoice, little girl; you've graduated from 'sex toy' to my bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia's eyes glowed an even deeper red, and Sari felt an odd energy fill her. It was almost like her own dark power, but it was foreign, invasive, and outside of her control. She could feel it twisting and expanding her form against her will, and her attempts to resist caused her to cry out, wracked with pain. \"No need to fight this, little one,\" Lydia chuckled, enjoying the show. \"You're far too small for me to fuck at your current pathetic size, and I've no intention of ever again reducing myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore too long, Sari found herself several times her original titanic size, but still like a child compared to the goddess Lydia had grown into.

Of course, she was still frustrated that her plan had failed, and being at the mercy of this lustful and cruel goddess was not a pleasant experience. But on the other hand, she may be weaker than Lydia, yet everyone else was still at her feet. Also, she had to admit that Lydia, big, sexy and dominant, made her a little horny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she decided that the best she could do right now was to obey. Submissively, she got to her knees and started licking and fingering Lydia's pussy. \"Yes, that's a good girl.\", the titan purred. Sari continued to please her goddess, when her gaze wandered to the ground. There, next to her foot, was a small, grey spec. Thanks to her almost godlike powers however, she could make out details. It was a great city which surprisingly was still standing. Sari grinned maliciously and licked her lips. She wasn't the only one who should worship the witch-goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one hand, she dug the entire city out of the ground, along with a great portion of the land surrounding it. The people screamed in terror as the red glowing eye of Sari filled the entire sky. \"Time to get to work, little peasants.\" Sari then dropped the city on Lydia's clit, which alone was several times bigger than this home of millions of people. But nonetheless, it made the goddess moan in pleasure. \"Oh, yesss. I can feel them running around. I can even hear their screams. It's wonderful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia's right hand sank into her right breast, her left dug deep into the ground, creating new canyons and mountains. Sari crawled over her belly and started sucking on her goddess' left nipple. Lydia moaned faster, drops of sweat falling from her wet hair, creating lakes and rivers. Sari herself got hornier and hornier, too, and started fingering herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the massive goddess once again let out a scream of pure pleasure. Then, she focused her attention back to Sari. \"That was good work, little slave. But for the next round, I want ... something different.\"</span></div></div>",

It seemed as though the more she fought against it, the more tangled she became. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia simply watched as her pathetic apprentice fought the losing battle against her silken bindings. Eventually, Sari's futile struggles left her all but exhausted. Seeing her apprentice's struggles end as the last of her strength escaped her body, Lydia simply laughed.

Well I think that a traitorous fool like you might just be able to fill me up!\" Lydia said with a cruel grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari's face paled with fear. Was Lydia really going to eat her? But how? They were pretty much the same size as one another. How would Lydia be able to- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari's thoughts were cut short as she felt a surge of pain as Lydia's razor sharp claws pierced into her neck. Suddenly a corrosive toxin was released from the tips of Lydia's claws, spreading through Sari's veins throughout her entire body. It was then that a horrifying realization hit her like a ton of bricks. This was how spiders fed. They would cocoon their prey and inject them with a venom that would digest their body from the inside out. Eventually she would be eaten away from within until she was nothing more than a pre-digested soup inside that cocoon, and Lydia would be free to drink her liquid remains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia could tell that Sari knew what was going to happen to her from the look of sheer terror in her eyes, but she was unable to do anything to stop the inevitable process. Removing her claws from the wounds in Sari's neck, Lydia sat back and watched as her poison did its job. Within seconds of its injection, Sari began to feel a burning pain in the side of her neck. Soon that pain spread down to her chest, and then to her arms and legs. Her muscles started to become weaker by the moment as they were eaten away by Lydia's acidic poison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her organs started to degrade as well. Breathing began to become more and more of a chore as her lungs were torn apart by the toxins. Blood slowly stopped flowing through her veins as the poison attacked her heart. Holes were burned through the lining of her stomach, causing her stomach acids to spill out into her body and accelerate the agonizing process further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire experience was painful beyond comparison. The entire time Sari was screaming at the top of her lungs, her voice muffled by Lydia's webbing covering her mouth. Her entire body burned in unbelievable agony as Lydia's poison devoured her from the inside out. The whole time she was begging her body to simply die and let her escape from the pain at last, but poor pitiful Sari wasn't given the sweet embrace of death until the very end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After the rest of her body had been destroyed from within, the dreadful poison moved on to the final target that remained. It flowed up to Sari's head and attacked her brain. This was magnitudes more painful than anything she had experienced before. Within seconds the pain alone caused her to faint, and seconds later her brain was broken down to the point that it could no longer function. Without it sending signals to her now non-existant body, she died quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe process was horrifically gruesome, and the worst part was how long it was drawn out. From the moment the poison was injected into her, Sari was forced to endure that torture for several whole hours before her body was completely broken down. Lydia simply sat atop a nearby building and watched the terrifying process with sadistic glee. Half way through she even began to pleasure herself as she watched Sari suffering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her meal was finally ready for her, Lydia got down from her perch and walked over to the cocoon that was now filled to the brim with Sari-slush. Licking her lips, Lydia lifted the silken contained to her lips and began to drink her liquid apprentice down in one long gulp. As the digested remains of Sari passed her lips, Lydia could feel the magic she had lent to her being returned to its rightful owner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Lydia was finished devouring Sari, and with more power than ever, she set out to begin her next mission:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lydia was still angry with Sari for attempting to betray her. She didn't want to trust her after what she just did, but she couldn't deny the allure in Sari's words. Her traitorous apprentice was right in one respect, though. Of all the ways Lydia could have empowered her, she had chosen to do it via lip contact. There was something about Sari's lips that drew her in at that moment, and she had been unable to resist that urge. Why? Was it because she really did harbor a secret lust for her young apprentice? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't aware of it the first time that they had kissed, but now it was abundantly clear. Lydia could deny it no longer. As she savored the feeling of Sari's wonderful lips pressing against her own, the sensation of the girl's tongue invading her mouth and wrestling with her own for dominance, she had no other choice but to embrace the truth that was staring her in the face: Lydia was madly in love with Sari. She had fallen for her long ago, but she had never been willing to admit it until now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia had never considered Sari to be anything more than her apprentice before today. But right now, the feeling of their two naked bodies pressing against eachother, both towering over everything around them for miles, it just felt so right. It was meant to be. Sari had to be the one. The perfect ideal lover that Lydia had been searching for for ages. Overcome by lust, the almighty mage gave in to Sari's seduction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, young one. You and I were meant for eachother. We couldn't be more perfect together.\" Lydia said as soon as they broke their kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's right my dear master. Give in to your true feelings. Let your lust take over. You now know as well as I do that were meant to become one. We were destined from the beginning of time to rule over this planet side by side. To tower over all else and force the world to submit to our unquestionable superiority. Accept your fate, Lydia. This is who you truly are!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't agree more, my apprentice-\" Lydia began, but she was cut off as Sari gently placed a finger over her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no... You can't keep speaking like that anymore, Lydia. I am no longer your apprentice, and you are no longer my master. From this day forward we will stand together as equals. You can't let the beliefs you held in your previous life guide you anymore. We aren't human anymore, Lydia. We have ascended to become something much greater. We are goddesses now, Lydia. So say it, say that you love me. That you want to spend the rest of your life by my side. Cast away your inhibitions and embrace the new you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well... I... I love you, Sari. Please, stay with me forever and rule the world by my side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would be honored, Lydia. Together we shall bring this world to its knees. We will usher in a new world order, and there is nothing that can stop us. Our love is unbreakable, Lydia. You and I are two sides of the same coin. We can do anything so long as we have eachother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari then shoved Lydia to the ground once more and began making out with her. This time, however, it wasn't in order to drain power. It was simply pure love. The two titanesses rolled about, flattening numerous trees in the heat of their passion. When they both finally exhausted themselves in their love making, they got to their feet and gazed into eachother's eyes. This was the beginning of something beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the only thing on Lydia's mind now was her newfound love for Sari, the young girl had something else on her mind. She had fallen in love with Lydia as well. Somewhere in their passionate love making, her act to catch Lydia off guard had turned into real feelings of affection. Now she was torn between two desires; her old wish to dominate her former master and take everything for herself, and her new wish to share the world with her and rule together as lovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of thought, Sari came to a conclusion. She would enjoy this for now. She knew that she probably wasn't powerful enough to surpass Lydia right now anyway, but one day that time would indeed come. When the day came that she surpassed Lydia in every respect, she would enslave her and take over as the sole ruler of the world. For now, though, she would embrace these feelings and rule side by side with Lydia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would enjoy every minute of it and make Lydia treasure her love more than even her own life. When she became powerful enough to defeat Lydia, she would take even greater joy in watching her former master crawl at her feet, begging her to take her back. She would laugh as Lydia's love for her drove her mad, and when her will was finally broken, she would accept her back as her most valuable servant. Everything about the plan was perfect. Sari could feel herself getting wet just thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To borrow a stock phrase, it was Hell on Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA decade ago, the demon women had appeared, towering over everything around them, and destroying all they found. Although beautiful beyond human measure, both were also cruel beyond human measure, and used their great size and magical abilities to torment and enslave any survivors of their initial assault. The kingdom of Widowwood was the hardest hit, as the giant goddesses clearly held a deep grudge against the formerly peaceful land. Its population was devoured, its royalty kept as prisoners, and its castle, the only building left standing, was reassigned to the less-than-dignified position of Lydia's personal throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis, as it happened, was only the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Widowwood was properly dealt with, Lydia and Sari moved out further, looking for new lands to claim and ravage. It soon became clear that no place in this world was safe from their clutches, and anyone wishing to avoid them had to go deep into hiding. Cities fell, forests died, and oceans were drained in the name of feeding, maintaining, and entertaining these great, beautiful beasts. And for the giants themselves, all was well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari had initially enjoyed her new life as a goddess, with Lydia by her side. The romance had started out fresh, new, passionate, and even tender when the mood called for it. Certainly, all else would die for them, but the two enjoyed each other's company, and more than enjoyed each other's flesh. But Sari never forgot the long game she was playing, constantly seeking advantage in the relationship. She'd overpower and subdue Lydia soon enough, she'd initially thought. She had only to wait, and build her power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only a few years after their reign began, however, that Sari began to notice the changes in Lydia. The older mage-turned-demon goddess had become infatuated-no, addicted, to the rush of the black magics she mastered. She allowed them to seep deeper into her mind and body, making her stronger, but also colder, more inhuman. The sex between the two very quickly lost any sense of intimacy, as Lydia little more than used her partner for gratification. Her cruelty and sadism towards their subjects continued to grow, as did her desire for physical stimulation and gratification.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, she'd began to grow, again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a subtle thing, at first. But over time, Sari could tell that Lydia was simply so engorged with dark energy, and becoming so enamored with herself, that she ceased keeping herself in check at all. The first victim of her enlarged form had been the former royal palace of Widowwood, which simply collapsed to rubble under Lydia's expanding ass. Then, she began to eat a great deal more, practically driving the dragon race to extinction in her quest for satisfaction. Conversely, Sari, who was being conservative and economical with her energies, stayed at the same tremendous height; before long, Lydia was two heads taller than her demonic lover, and the emotional distance between them began to increase as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was that Sari determined she needed to act as soon as possible. Her powers had certainly grown, and despite the size difference between them, she felt she could more than compensate in skill and power. She'd put her former 'master' in her place, and become the undisputed Queen of...well, everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe approached Lydia, who was reposing lazily along a hillside. Dozens of human slaves dotted the giantess' body, cleaning and bathing her skin as if their lives depended on it. As Lydia casually grabbed a hapless slave from atop her breasts and tossed him into her cavernous mouth, it became obvious that their lives most certainly did depend on the quality of their work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how is your evening, my little one?\" Lydia noted as Sari approached. The nickname seemed dismissive, and Sari didn't like it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It moves well, my love,\" she whispered, preparing to move.</span></div></div>",

Lydia was simply too powerful and too cunning to be given a chance to recover, or make a proper counter attack. She'd have to have her overgrown lover at her mercy, and quickly. Somewhere in the back of her mind, the demonic mage realized that her attack would certainly kill those human slaves Lydia surrounded herself with; it hardly mattered, however. Sari lacked empathy for their serfs, and only wished to ensure she didn't accidentally kill Lydia in the process of subduing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong, dearie?\" Lydia asked casually. \"You seem distracted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no,\" Sari replied. \"Everything is fine. Soon, it will be better than ever before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she struck. Wanting to ensure that she hit Lydia with as much power as possible, Sari began to pull molten energy from the earth itself, adding it to her own maniacal might. A funnel of dark violet magic spun from Sari's palms, encircled by a stream of glowing orange ore for reinforcement. The blast struck the unsuspecting Lydia before the enormous woman could react; she was immediately pushed deep into the ground by the force of the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected, Lydia's slaves were vaporized before they even knew what happened, but Sari didn't let up. She kept the attack coming, ripping the landscape around them apart as she pressed forward. Finally, she relented, lowing her hands and allowing the magic to dissipate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe area around the titanic woman looked like a war-zone. The forest was completely burned away; all life had been wiped clean by the barrage of demonic power. The air hung thick with the smell of fire and death, and a huge gash in the ground beneath her feet concealed Lydia's form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted, but satisfied that she'd been successful in her attack, Sari smiled darkly. \"I'm so sorry to have to get rough with you, my love,\" she noted coolly. \"But I had to make you understand: there are going to be some changes around here. You will serve me, now, as my most favored slave. Any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt her feet, the debris from the attack began to stir, as Lydia pulled herself to the surface...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sari was concerned as the Mage left the enormous rend in the ground. Instead of moving like a beast near death, she merely seemed...angry. She could feel the power radiating off her enormous figure in waves strong enough to force her backwards. Lydia's skin shimmered with runic signs, scorched dark but not marred by even a single scratch. Her eyes burned a furious crimson. Sari wanted, needed, to flee but was held by the force of her master's glare. Standing to her full height Lydia towered over the other woman. Grinning, she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Favored slave?\" She asked, her voice dripping with sarcasm. Behind her normally loud voice Sari could detect the voice of something else, something beyond her capability to understand. She had underestimated the extent to which Lydia had given herself over to her magic. \"No, my dear Sari that would be your role. Although it seems you have forsaken your position. Instead of serving as my near-equal, I strip you of your powers,\" Lydia thrust out a hand as if grasping into Sari's chest. She screamed in agony as though her soul were being torn apart. The sky around the two titanesses darkened as the magic flowed back into its original master through purplish tendrils. The air around the magic crackled with energy, and Lydia let out a groan of pleasure as her own power grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I strip you of your form!\" She cried gleefully. Stepping closer over scorched earth and twigs of incinerated trees, Lydia struck Sari in the stomach. She felt herself flying backwards from the Mage. Everything in her hurt. She must have shattered everything in her body. Even forcing open her eyelids hurt. All around her flakes of black ash fell. Her world became darkness as a shadow fell over her. When she saw her master, still full-sized, standing hundreds of feet taller than her Sari gave up. Her coup had failed, and now she would pay the price. Her best hadn't even harmed the dark witch. The ashes were her damaged skin peeling off as a fresh layer was grown beneath it. Lydia looked fully, beautifully, human again. She raised one enormous foot over Sari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be punished for what you did, my beloved. I wish things worked out differently, we could have ruled the universe together. You've left me no choice.\" Lydia said with a bit of genuine remorse. Sari closed her eyes awaiting the end and liberation from her pain. She felt the foot slam down. Pain shot through her body as she was thrown into the air and landed on her broken back. Looking up again at Lydia, she saw her crouch over and extend one finger towards her. A blob of energy swirled around the tip. Sari wondered if she would crush her this way instead. But the member halted just above her. Gently, Lydia covered her former apprentice in the energy. She felt her body mending itself. In moments, it was as if she had never fallen. Sari was still just human-sized, but retained her goddess-like figure and was now fully healed. Shakily, she stood. Lydia gazed down angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't think I'd let you off so easily did I? When someone gets that close to killing me, I have to do much worse. For now, you'll be my entertainment.\" Lydia snapped her fingers and the world fell beneath them. Sari landed in the middle of a small cobbled road. She was in some kind of market. She looked around and spotted the banners on the local castle. After she had beaten her master, this place was to be her victory celebration. The street was relatively uncrowded, but it was dusk and the people were all heading home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention, mortals! Your goddess has put in your city a captive by the name of Sari. Bring her to me by morning, and I shall spare your city for eternity. If Sari reaches the top of the castle keep, you will be made to suffer greatly. Here is your target,\" the voice of Lydia boomed. Sari saw her behind the castle, dwarfing the structure. She pointed right at Sari, and a pillar of golden light grew from the ground beneath her. Townsfolk looked over at her. Sari realized she was unarmed and completely naked amid a fortress of hostile villagers. As the sharp and blunt objects sprung to hand, she began to run.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sari saw a tiny alley right behind her, and it seemed to have no one in it. She slowly backed away from the mob of about 20 people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'They would have made a lovely snack,' her mind considered. Sari angrily suppressed the thought since she was only a mere five or six feet. She couldn't even crush them beneath her foot, much less eat them. In fact, they might skewer her like an animal if she didn't get a move on. She turned and sprinted into the darkness, her are feet slapping against the cobbled stone. Shouts chased her along with the clinking of metal scraping walls or striking other metal. Sari was almost blind, but she thought she heard them getting closer. She tried to run faster. But then a shape reared out of the darkness in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get you now!\" A voice said unpleasantly. Sari saw a fat human blocking her path. The malnutrition these peasants suffered from stunted their growth, she observed. He barely made 5'6. With the angry villagers behind her, she was left with only one option. She lowered her shoulder and rammed him. His meaty skin flapped against her taut muscles, and with an unnatural scream he flew against the walls of the alley. The impact shattered several bones and set him bawling. Sari had no idea at her own strength! A little of her magic must have stayed, little enough that Lydia had failed to notice. She stopped running and walked back to the injured man. He tried to crawl away, but his broken ribs and arm kept him still. As the cruel face knelt down next to him he turned to whimpering. She scanned him like a lion inspects an injured gazelle. She reached out and grasped his face with two surprisingly soft hands, running them over his bristly chin while murmuring softly. He quieted down a moment, hearing more people come tearing around the corner. They stopped when they saw their target gently caressing an injured drunk. All was silent for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari's tender manner dropped suddenly. Her fingers dug into the man's skin and she yanked upwards. With barely any effort, her attacker's head and part of his spine left his body. She cried out in triumph and held it up like a trophy. She tasted the blood running down her bare arms. Its saltiness was even nicer now that she had killed her target as personally as she had. And she realized she had never killed another person when she was approaching person-sized. She threw the severed head at her foes, and it rolled to a stop just before their feet. Sari licked her fingers clean while staring at them, sizing them up, challenging them. Her eyes had adapted to the dark and let her count at least thirty of them. Sadly, she didn't know whether their courage would fail despite their numbers. Maybe she had just enough power left for...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's get her!\" Someone yelled and threw a burning torch at her. She easily sidestepped it, and grinned. People never had needed much power to be brainwashed. She told one man clutching a pitchfork to run forward. The entire mass surged forward behind him. It didn't even matter that Sari dodged his thrust, tore the weapon from his hands, and ripped him to pieces with one hand. Holding the pitchfork in her other hand, she waited for the next person to come within range.</span></div></div>",

Who else thinks they can take it, hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't just mindless bravado, or a disconcerting bloodlust; Sari had a plan. If she was to reclaim her throne and put Lydia in her proper place, she needed to regain her powers. What's more, she needed to be willing to do what she hadn't, before, and give herself completely to the dark magics she drew energy from. Lydia had, and at the time, Sari thought that to be a brash mistake. Recent events had corrected this misconception.

As she anticipated, plenty of them had the good sense to scatter. But many also met her charge, in an ultimately futile attempt to slay her.

She ran through a half dozen men before stopping long enough to realize that all her opponents lie dead at her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is a start, at least,\" she allowed, dipping her hand in a small pool of blood and painting arcane symbols on the ground beneath her.

But she had little choice otherwise, so she had to try. Her chant continued and the souls began to rise from the dead. They screamed in terror and agony as Sari's own soul absorbed them, sucking them dry before sending them away through a rift in realms. Sari did not know where they went, and hoped she would never end there. Every now and then, if she watched her victims plunge into this strange realm, she would see something watch her back. Something more powerful even than Lydia. And far more cruel. As soon as the souls were gone Sari closed the rift. She could feel it approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fear and sense of weakness was entirely gone when she focused again on the real world. She had grown to the height of fifteen feet and felt much more powerful. Lydia could rarely use human souls to gain her power, as magicians the world over had renounced this form. She would bring down indescribable suffering had she tried before her ascension. Now, Sari would bet she didn't even try because she considered herself a goddess. She smirked. Her master was quite predictable. If she used this method, she might even be able to challenge her soon. Sari forced her buxom form out of the alley, not an easy task. She was confronted by real city guards in full outfit and many more armed peasants. Sari almost regretted being her size. Killing them at their own height would have been very fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shout of malice, she crushed the most elaborately armored guard in front of her. She ground him into the cobblestone, listening to his armor crunch and bones shatter. The rest were almost paralyzed with fear. Sari raised her hands like a puppet master over the mass before her. She waved her fingers, making a few of the pikemen march towards her. Mechanically, their only emotion being terror in their eyes, they marched closer to the woman. In unison, they raised their pikes and jabbed Sari in the legs. Their steel weapons scraped or bounced off her gorgeous legs amid her laughter. She viciously kicked at them, and they flew backwards to land amid the crowd. Some brave souls in the back fired arrows at her. Sari giggled and lightly sprang out of the way, landing in the middle of the guards. She swept in front of her, flinging them aside like rag dolls. Her feet pounded them to armored paste as they futilely slashed and jabbed at her lower half. Someone behind her poked her in a sensitive area, eliciting a squeak very out of character for an avatar of destruction. She turned, mashing a man under her foot, and spotted the perpetrator. She yanked his spear from his hands and snapped it in half. After using it to skewer a fleeing guard, she thundered over to the other. Standing directly above him, she practically roared down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not worthy of touching a goddess so!\" Sari had to restrain hysterical laughter as she watched his abject terror. Maybe she should stop draining their strength to augment her own. It wasn't like they could hurt her anyway, now they'd just stare as she singled them out and killed them. But she could be crushed by one even bigger any moment, so she might savor the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But being kind, I will allow it. Come here!\" She said, making one final adjustment. Then she began to lower herself, her nether regions brushing against the paralyzed man's helmet. She kept getting lower, forcing the metal headpiece against her wetness. Eventually, the man beneath her was forced downwards. Sari finally had him pinned, his head partially stuck inside of her. The absolute power still dazzled her, even after she had felt dozens of other people his size disappear into her at once. At the thought of this, her maw quivered, crushing the man's head. With a laugh, she stood and killed the rest of them in the cruelest ways possible. The humans didn't stand a chance against her sadism and size. The streets were paved in bodies and Sari was practically soaked from head to foot in blood and body parts. Just clearing space to redraw the necessary symbols was a task. But the power that flowed into her from the town's people was unimaginable. The rush was even better than feeling the poor conscript's helmet against her crotch. Sari felt carnal desires wash over her as more and more energy was channeled from the humans and into her. She didn't pay attention to what was happening with their disposal until too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA force washed over her. Similar to Lydia's power after climbing from the crater, but colder, meaner, and stronger. In terror, Sari tried to shut down the rift and absorb the rest of the souls entirely into her essence instead. But when the rift was merely a crack, the being on the other side pulled it open. Sari pulled back in terror. That wasn't supposed to be possible. Even at her colossal height of 800 feet, she was petrified. From seemingly nowhere a figure had appeared far below her. It hobbled along the wreckage with a came, back hunched over and wearing a dull khaki robe. Despite its frail appearance, Sari knew it held untold power. She stepped backwards onto a small inn to get farther away from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dearest friend, do not run,\" it said in a voice larger than its form.</span></div></div>",

The robed form limped forward leaning heavily on an old wooden staff. It seemed entirely unaffected by the sea of bodies it had to walk through. The being stopped a few feet short of her gore-caked foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you need to do this? Have these people done anything to you?\" It asked mildly reproachfully. It waved it's staff over the devastated area. Sari watched in amazement as the broken bodies slowly knitted themselves back together, blood pooled into separate puddles and flowed back into its original body. Most of the people stood idly, their faces fixed in blank stares. A few started screaming uncontrollably. Others felt themselves and took the moment to run from their colossal killer. Sari would have said something, but the figure had not yet released her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Where are their essences? At his is most unusual. The newly dead do not show such reluctance to return to their world. How could their souls have drifted so far...\" His voice trailed off. Sari sensed his anger as his minuscule head swivelled back towards her. The very heat seemed to be sucked from the air and the sun dimmed visibly.<br>\r\n\"In many places such magic would get you punished. You are lucky the Imperium does not often inspect your realm. Do you know what you dabble in, witch? It is not your place to alter a soul. Mayhaps I should tear them from yours and restore those you defiled!\" Sari was scared for a moment, but anger quickly rose to replace it. She felt the bonds loosen and she seized her chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you to tell a goddess what it is or is not okay to do? You speak of Imperiums. I have consumed entire empires in less than a day! This will be just another to feed my hunger!\" She yelled down. She struggled against the coils that rooted her to the ground to crush this pathetic being, but she could not. Even worse, she sensed its amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are no goddess. I have seen goddesses, and even the weakest among them could erase you with a swipe of a finger. If you knew what I was compared to them, then you would speak more civilly. And if I myself fear the Imperium, they should be your worst nightmare. But regardless. I come to find another. Recently, there was a goddess born here. And I wish to find her. You will assist me.\" He stated. Sari sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will not help one like you. Assuming the size of the slaves demeans true power. Even in this form I could easily have restored some animation to a shell. Cheap tricks is all you have.\" She felt the bonds loosen. She was able to bend over and grab one of the tinies recently crushed and then restored. But to her terror, it was different.<br>\r\n\"How is it possible that you erase death?\" She gasped, practically dropping the human. Instead, she gently replaced it on the ground. The being laughed a deep, rumbling laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lord of death can easily enough undo it. But what can completely erase it but the true master of the thing? Any god or goddess can demand death in their name. What makes me special is that I demand life.\" With these words came dull realization of what Sari had allowed into their world. She had read about this one night when Lydia was out. It had been a large book kept deep in her deepest cells. Sari had wondered why a simple book would have such protections on it. After reading it, it had seemed like nothing more than a book of myths and legends. But this tome must have been so much more. 'Forgive me Lydia, I made a mistake,' Sari thought hopelessly. Her former master wouldn't stand a chance. Despite the attempt on her life, Sari found she still loved Lydia in a small way. So when an 800 foot shadow fell over the city followed by the sharp demanding shout of \"What's this?\", Sari tried to tell Lydia to run. But at the sound of stone being crushed beneath giant feet she knew it was too late. The mysterious force had frozen her again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sari, what have you done?\" Lydia gasped as she felt the presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, the beast recognizes its master!\" The figure said playfully. Sari recalled the one line that brought her assurance at night, thinking it meant this thing had long ago died. But now she realized it had meant something completely different. With strange eons, even death may die.</span></div></div>",

As well you should be. This entire universe will soon exist to do nothing but feed my hungers. Sadly, it seems that you would rather surrender your chance to rule at my side. Oh, well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari was still reeling from the attack, not able to defend herself as Lydia violently kicked her again. She hadn't felt pain since her ascension, and now, it was overwhelming her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she still had one card to play. If she couldn't overpower Lydia, she'd simply displace her. Beginning to chant, she opened a portal near Lydia's feet, hoping to send the power-mad giantess to another realm entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia didn't seem to notice her efforts, or didn't care, if she did. \"Trying to flee?\" she sneered, kneeling next to her fallen ex. \"I don't think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final burst of exertion, Sari made her move.</span></div></div>",

The younger giantess thought she had won, and moaned her approval as Lydia began to pull her closer, groping at her enormous form. Lydia ground their hips together obscenely, trying to guide her lover to the ground. Sari, aroused beyond belief, eagerly obliged, lying on her back and destroying a large swath of the forest beneath her gigantic ass. Lydia eagerly straddled her, eyes wild with lust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, the situation quickly changed. Rather than continue to embrace her, Lydia's hands instead clutched Sari's wrists tightly, pinning the younger girl to the ground. Before Sari could issue a protest, Lydia slammed her body on top of her apprentice's, knocking the wind out of her, and subduing her for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So sorry, my little traitor,\" Lydia purred. \"But you don't get off the hook so easily. Yes, it's true; I felt a certain soft spot towards you. And I certainly lusted for you, for many years. But you had to push things too far. You had to challenge the natural order. And that order is, I. Am. Supreme. So now, you'll suffer the consequences of your decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari frowned. \"But..but you care for me...you just said...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is the only reason your head is still attached to your body,\" she noted. \"You'll live. But not as the goddess you could have been. No, you're not even going to be my apprentice. You're a toy for my delight. A pet. My sex slave. Whatever you want to call it. I desire  your body, Sari, and I'll have it. Your thoughts on the matter are inconsequential.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Lydia moved her face close to the monstrous girl's neck, and took a long, slow, lick up the side of her face, moaning slightly. \"You taste sweeter than I would have imagined,\" she whispered huskily. \"Just give in, dear; you can enjoy yourself. I will, regardless.\"</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, as the thunderous footsteps of her pursuer grew ever-closer, Sari also realized that if left to flight alone, she was practically doomed. Lydia could cross entire fields in a single gigantic step, and Sari had no hope of outrunning her in a fair race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to think strategically, or she'd be little more than a smear under her master's foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first impulse was to make a break for Widowwood. Not only could she more easily hide in its mass of people, but the sight of that hated kingdom might take Lydia's attention off of her traitorous apprentice. If the giant mage got distracted in leveling her old enemies, Sari might be able to slip away to safety in the confusion and chaos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut wait, Sari realized. She was thinking like a mortal, when her new powers made her so much more. Why bother fleeing through forests, when she could flee through realities? It would be so simple to open a portal to another world, and escape into it. True, Lydia might be able to sense such a use of magic, but Sari would have enough of a head-start to ensure her survival and plot her revenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother of Lydia's footsteps caused an earthquake so profound that Sari stumbled, practically falling to her knees.

She wouldn't stand a ghost of a chance. With Lydia's new titanic stature, there was no way for Sari to outrun her. Her legs could cover more ground in a single step than Sari's could in a hundred. Fleeing was hopeless. She would be trapped in Lydia's hand long before she managed to lure her master to Widowwood. Even the cover of the trees above her was useless, as Lydia's incredible magic would allow her to sense where her apprentice was hiding instantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly one option remained. If a head on fight was out of the picture, and trying to escape to Widowwood would be futile, then the only choice Sari had was to flee into another dimension. Surely Lydia would track her down. She would follow her to the ends of reality in order to exact her revenge. But isolating her location in another dimension would take time. Time that Sari could use to learn the ins and outs of her new powers, and master them completely. Then she would be able to fight on even ground with her former master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcentrating her magic into the palm of her hand, Sari focused her energy into each of her fingernails. Preparing for the moment of truth, she took a deep breath and pulled back her hand. In one fluid motion, she swung her hand forward and raked her claws through the air. As her magic-coated fingernails swung through the air, they tore a hole in the fabric of reality. With a devious grin, she wedged both of her hands into that tear and pulled it apart. Tearing open her portal, Sari proceeded to jump forward into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the last second Lydia saw her, but as she reached down her massive hand to grab her, the only thing that was wrapped in her fingers was thin air. She as too late. Sari had escaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit! How could that traitorous wench have escaped me?! *sigh* Oh well, no matter... She can enjoy her freedom while it lasts. I've got bigger things to deal with at the moment. Soon this world will be mine, and once I've conquered this world, I'll go after her. Then I can punish her for her insolence and add another world to my domain at the same time! I'll be killing two birds with one stone!\" Lydia said with a laugh. She then turned her attention toward her true prize: The kingdom of Widowwood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, as Lydia stomped off to begin taking over her own world, Sari had just exited her portal and appeared in the modern world. She laughed as she looked around at her surroundings. She was in the center of a massive city. Buildings of unimaginable size, even a couple that would make the current Lydia look small, surrounded her from every direction. She was absolutely speechless as she took in the majesty of her surroundings. Sari was amazed by how advanced everything was in this new world. The technology of this world made that of her homeland look like the stone age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was almost intimidated by it all, but one thing made her overflow with confidence. This world had no magic. Sari had scanned around when she first arrived. She was certain that a society this advanced must have mastered levels of witchcraft that would rival even Lydia's, but she was pleasantly surprised. This society, as far as it had come in the development of technology, had never discovered even the most basic of magics. It was almost laughable, really. Even a 3 year old toddler in her own world could manipulate simple levitation spells, but this world knew absolutely nothing! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari had already won. As great as their technology was, no amount of technology could ever hope to compete with the power of magic. Especially not magic on the level that she was now able to wield. Sari wouldn't even have to try in order to take over this world. They would be helpless before her within mere minutes. Sari laughed maniacly as she thought about it. With a flick of her wrist, she sent a bolt of magical energy at a nearby building, and watched in sadistic glee as the towering structure burst into flames before her eyes. This was it. It was the dawn of a new age for this world. This was the beginning of the age of Goddess Sari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two witches had begun their conquests. Though they knew nothing of what the other was doing, they were both bringing an entire world to its knees at the exact same time. Lydia in her homeworld, and Sari in this new modern world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhose conquest do you want to follow?</span></div></div>",

In a perverse sense, she should be thankful to Sari; without her outrageous affront, Lydia wouldn't have tapped into her rage so deeply, and wouldn't have expanded to this glorious size. She took a moment to rub her hands over her enormous figure, cupping her bountiful breasts before teasing her taut tummy, and spending a few seconds sliding between her legs. Yes, this was good. When she found Sari, perhaps she would spare the traitor's life, in gratitude for this unexpected gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr perhaps she'd crush her beneath her feet. It was still up in the air at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kingdom of Widowwood couldn't help but be aware of the giantess' approach, and those valiant souls perched along the watchtowers quickly readied their bows to fire on the attacking monstrosity. Their weapons...were for naught. The arrows couldn't even pierce Lydia's skin, and only managed to make her body tremble with spiteful laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh, you'll have to do better than that,\" she purred. \"And really, was that any way to greet your favorite daughter, Widowwood? See what I've made of myself, after you cast me out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes grew darker as she remembered that day. \"Yes, you sent me off to die, rather than allow me to help you. I was alone for years, with nothing but my hatred of you all to guide me. Hatred...and rage...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the emotions flooded back, a terrifying transformation was taking place.

Her fury was allowing her to tap into even greater powers, powers to great for her to control. Soon her own magic began to overwhelm her. Lydia cried out in pain as the dark energy welled up withing her. Her own magic burned through her skin and escaped from her body, condensing into a massive purple cloud which engulfed her entire body. All the citizens who so much as looked at this cloud felt their bodies become paralyzed with fear, the sight of it emanating a wave of pure hatred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia's screams of pain were soon silenced as the cloud of darkness solidified into a thick black cocoon that trapped her within it. The citizens could only stare helplessly at the colossal shell. They were forced to gaze upon it in horror, for they knew that whatever would emerge from such a vile shell would surely be their end. They could neither see nor hear anything of the transformation that was taking place within, and thus could only imagine what kind of monstrosity would be born from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the cocoon, Lydia's body was beginning to change. She was no longer in pain anymore. No, much the opposite. As she sat in that magical prison and observed her body's transformations, she was overwhelmed by a wave of euphoria like nothing she had ever felt before. Not even she was completely sure what was happening to her, but she was sure of one thing; she liked it. She knew that she was becoming stronger, faster, more powerful in every way. She couldn't wait to see the looks of horror on those pathetic citizens' faces when she finally emerged from her cocoon and revealed to them her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the outside, the long wait was finally coming to an end. For the longest time there were no signs of anything happening to the massive black cocoon, but now a crack had appeared on its surface. At first it was just a single small crack in the shell, but soon more and more began to appear. And then at last, the moment of truth came. Lydia's arm thrust upward, breaking a hole through the top of the cocoon. She then reached her other arm through that hole and pulled the now-brittle shell apart. The magic that made up the cocoon quickly dissipated as the shell fell to the ground and shattered, and the energy was instantly reabsorbed into Lydia's new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere she stood, looking down on all the pathetic citizens in all her titanic glory. Lydia had undergone a horrific transformation, and now she glared down at her prey once again. Not with her previous expression of utter contempt, but with a cruelly playful smirk that somehow was even more terrifying to them. It was now clear that Lydia wasn't blinded by rage any longer. She was now fully aware of her surroundings and her actions once more. She knew exactly what she was doing, and she was enjoying it. The citizens didn't know how to respond to what they saw. Where the titanic but still mostly human looking Lydia once stood, there was now a creature that could only be described as a demoness straight from the fiery pits of hell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lightly tanned skin had been burned away as her magic escaped her earlier, and the skin that regenerated in its place was a vibrant shade of red. Her horns had become much more defined, moving from her forehead to the sides of her head and becoming much bigger than before. On her back were a pair of bat-like wings, the same shade of red as her skin, and from her rear she had grown a demonic tail. In the corners of her mouth a pair of pointed fangs were visible, and her long black hair had become as white as snow. Her ears came to a point like elf ears, and her nails extended into razor sharp claws. Lydia's new body had become the perfect figure of feminine appeal, with curves that would make even her previous form pale in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia laughed to herself as she realized what had just happened to her. Her rage and hatred had released the limiters that kept her power in check, and it had quickly become too much for her old body to handle. Since the magic needed an adequate vessel to be contained within, it transformed her into a form that was more suitable for the vast amounts of power she had just acquired. She had become more powerful than she had ever intended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is an unexpected development. Anyway, lets have some fun, little insects!\" Lydia said as she took her first step in her new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer massive foot slammed down to the ground, grinding dozens of helpless citizens into a paste beneath her sole, their bloodstains blending in with the red of Lydia's skin. At this first hostile act, the entire kingdom flew into a panic. All of them began to run for their lives, doing anything that they could to escape Lydia's wrath. She simply laughed a malicious laugh as she glared down at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run all you want, worms! You'll never escape from me! From this day forward, I own every single one of your insignificant little lives!\" Lydia said as she continued to ravage the kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Chuckling to herself, Lydia dropped that group in front of her face. Without a moment's hesitation, her tongue, long and serpentine, snaked out to ensnare them, pulling them into her massive jaws. Chewing thoughtfully, she moved back to her feet, crushing those poor souls under her breasts in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith new purpose, she dug her talons into the ground around the base of the castle, pulling it from the ground. \"Mm, are you in there, my king?\" she asked haughtily. \"I hope you and your family are watching this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes glowed more intently, as her magic began to work.

It couldn't be...no, it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari emerged from the rift, having enlarged to Lydia's titanic height. Although still human, her body was clearly stronger than before; her eyes practically pulsed with dark magical energy, and her clothing was barely staying attached to her enormous frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's this foolishness, now?\" Lydia hissed, still stinging from Sari's betrayal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found a source of power in the other world,\" Sari noted enigmatically, allowing the rift to close behind her. \"As you can see, it did wonders for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you think yourself a challenge to me? I've shed my humanity, Sari. I'm a demon. A god. You...you're just a larger version of the same failure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold your tongue, monster,\" she snapped, bracing for conflict. \"This kingdom is under my protection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia looked genuinely surprised at that, before letting out a mocking laughter. \"Protection? You can barely protect yourself, ant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari didn't let the comment phase her. She felt she had the situation under control; she'd defeat Lydia, drink her power dry, and in doing so, \"save\" Widowwood. The people would be indebted to her, and not resist when she took control of the kingdom...for its own protection, of course. And if she found herself unable to stop Lydia now, she'd return to the other world, recharge her strength, and try again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia becoming a demon, however...was not in her original plan. This could  be difficult...</span></div></div>",

Her apprentice physically charged at her, colliding with the enormous demon and sending them both tumbling backwards. Much of Widowwood was inadvertently crushed in the ensuing chaos, as Sari summoned a portal directly in front of them. The two titanesses passed through the portal, into a completely different reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lydia regained her footing, she realized that Sari had brought them...somewhere else. There was so much more noise, and the smell of humanity permeated everything. What's more, they were surrounded on all sides by enormous buildings that dwarfed not only their own enormous forms, but anything she'd ever seen in Widowwood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this place?\" the demon asked, in spite of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is to be my new empire, 'master',\" Sari snapped. \"Its ways are known to me. You? Not so much.\" With that, she pressed the attacked, forcing Lydia against a particularly impressive skyscraper.

Still, it was all part of her plan, so she kept up the act for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia laughed as she listened to Sari's admission of inferiority. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is that so? Well, it's good to see that you've finally learned your place! You will always be beneath me, no matter what you do. Now, come here and bow down before me. Kiss my feet and beg for my forgiveness, and I might just be willing to show mercy on you for your insolence.\" Lydia said with a superior tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari hated that she had to subject herself to this, but soon she would have the upper hand. Lydia didn't know that Sari still held a trump card, one that would turn the battle in her favor. She just needed to keep her master's guard down until just the right moment. She had to put on this pathetic act in order to stall for time. Reluctantly, Sari walked forward and kneeled in front of the the great demoness Lydia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, much better. That position really does suit you, you know. How fitting for a traitorous worm like you to be forced to kneel at the feet of your superior. Now, go ahead. Earn my forgiveness, you pathetic little insect!\" Lydia said as she lifted her foot into the air and slammed it onto Sari's head, shoving her face directly in front of her master's other foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari felt disgusted by this, but she held herself together. She just needed a few more seconds, and then victory would be hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiss.\" Lydia commanded bluntly, grinding her foot on top of her apprentice's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari was just about to obey Lydia's command when she felt a sudden surge of magical energy. This was it, her trump card was finally ready! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as I'd love to taint my perfect lips by planting them on your vile feet, I've got something else in mind!\" Sari said defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?! You ungrateful little worm! I raised you as my apprentice, and you betrayed me! I gave you a chance to atone for your insolence, and you insult me?! I've had enough of you!

Just as Sari was beginning to feel pain from the pressure, another portal opened behind her and a giant female figure came rushing out. She was easily twice as big as Lydia and Sari, and immediately tackled the demoness down to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay away from my master, bitch! I'm your opponent now!\" The towering girl yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia could only stare up in shock at this new rival as she reached down to help Sari get to her feet. The girl was clothed in a strange fashion that was alien to Lydia, and she shared the horns and red eyes that Sari possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who exactly was this gigantic girl?

I told you that I'd figure out these powers and beat your old master for you, and I meant it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia didn't know how to react. She could only stare up in awe as this new girl towered over her, a devious smirk spread across her face. She wore a bright pink tank top and a pair of jean shorts, and her long blonde hair cascaded beautifully down her back. This girl was also wearing a pair of light blue flip-flops, and her nails were painted pink. She appeared to be around 18 years old, and her figure was on par with Lydia's own. The demoness had never seen woman so beautiful, and her strange outfit only served to accentuate that beauty. Sari smirked as she saw her master gazing lustfully at her new apprentice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well <i>Master</i>, I'd like to introduce you to Alicia. She's a new friend that I met while I was in the other world. We've got a lot in common, and when I told her about my powers, she wanted to try them out herself. So I made a deal with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I become her apprentice, and she gives me all the power I want! All I have to do in return is crush her puny former master, and then we can rule the world together! So I hope you don't mind when I do this.\" Alicia said, planting her enormous foot atop Lydia's chest and pinning her to the ground. \"Nothing personal, bitch. But I love having all this power, and if Master Sari can get me even more, then I'll do anything she says! She said that you were an obstacle, and that you'd only get in our way, so I'm gonna fix that right now!\" Alicia then proceeded to put more weight onto Lydia, laughing evilly as she heard the older woman cry out in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia couldn't believe how much pain she was in. This young woman was insanely powerful, even for someone her size. In desperation, she came up with a risky plan. There was no hope of defeating this titaness, so Lydia decided that her only chance would be to make her turn against Sari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! You don't want to do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? And why not, shrimp? Do you want to say a few last words before I flatten you like a pancake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Listen to me! That girl is deceiving you! I granted her power and she betrayed me. You can't trust that traitorous worm! She may give you power now, but the instant that she has an opportunity, she'll betray you just as she did me! If you value your life, you'll end hers instead of mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia gasped for breath as she felt the rubber sole of Alicia's flip-flop lifting off of her a bit. It was still pressed hard enough to keep her pinned down, but she was no longer in such excruciating pain. Alicia then looked down at Sari with her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is what she says true, Master Sari? Would you really turn your back on me?\" Alicia asked, sounding somewhat confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-of course not! You're my apprentice, and I value you more than anyone else. I would never betray your trust.\" Sari said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't listen to her! She's only using you to aid her own crooked agenda! I'm more trustworthy than that rat will ever be!\" Lydia yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Lydia! You don't know what you're talking about! Alicia and I have a deal. I supply the power, and she obeys my orders. It works out perfectly for both of us, so why would I ever do anything to ruin that?!\" Sari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, well if it's only power that you're interested in, then I can provide you far more than she ever could! I've got years more experience than her when it comes to magic!\" Lydia said to Alicia. Much to her pleasure, the girl's foot was completely removed from atop her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia wasn't sure what to do anymore. If what Lydia said was true, then her life was in danger as long as she associated herself with Sari. But the two of them had really hit it off, and she trusted her. Could she really believe the words of this demoness? For all she knew, Lydia was merely lying in order to save her own life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing, Alicia?! I ordered you do kill Lydia! Don't let her words sway you! She's staring death in the face and would say anything to save her own life. Her words hold no value! Kill her now, and we can finally begin our conquest of the world together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be foolish, child! Sari has already proved her traitorous nature once. Join me, and I can make you into something far greater than anything she ever could! Unlike her, I honor my word above all else. Become my apprentice, and we can rule not just this world, but all worlds in existence!\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlicia stomped her foot down between the two girls and glared at them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, shut up, SHUT UP! I can't even think with you two yelling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari and Lydia both silenced themselves at once, not wanting to become the target of the much bigger girl's rage. Finally in quiet, Alicia began to think about both sides' arguments. After a few moments of thought, she came to a conclusion.</span></div></div>",

It was so fast it was practically a blur, and the stomp went so deep into the ground that no remains were visible. Lydia took a moment to register what had just happened, before erupting into cruel laughter. \"Oh, you made the right choice, my dear,\" she cackled. \"Together, you and I will-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia's melodramatic boast was cut short as Alicia roughly grabbed her, lifting the demon high into the sky. \"Shut up,\" she snapped, to which Lydia complied.

This girl that Sari had brought with her was far superior to her in every way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you're kinda cute.\" Alicia said, lust clearly visible in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Ali-\" Lydia was cut off as Alicia quickly pulled down her panties.

If this kept up, it was only a matter of time before she passed out from lack of air. Alicia continued to use Lydia's face as a sex toy, not caring at all for the physical well being of her captive. Just as Lydia was about to faint, Alicia finally climaxed and coated her face with her love juices. Alicia's hands then let go of her head, and Lydia fell over gasping for air as she choked on her fresh cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, you're good at that! I guess you really are useful even at such a puny size.\" Alicia said, calming down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia's eyes filled with rage. She couldn't believe that this girl just violated her like that. Her plan was to let this girl destroy Sari for her and then take her on as her new apprentice, but it was clear that Alicia held no respect for the much more experienced mage. Lydia wouldn't stand for this. She had worked for far too long to get this power, and she wouldn't let her rule be undermined by this woman. Alicia had no experience with magic, she wasn't even from this world. She had no right to command Lydia, who had spent her entire life studying the dark arts.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lydia stared up in horror at the massive girl who towered over both her and Sari. She was clothed in a simple red tee shirt and a blue skirt, and her feet were contained within a pair of black knee socks. She appeared to be young, with even less curves than Sari, and had her short brown hair tied into pigtails. What really caught Lydia's attention, however, was the girl's face. While she had a very cute face, her eyes were dull and lifeless. It was as though she lacked any sense of emotion as she stared down at Lydia with those soulless eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see you've noticed my handiwork. Allow me to introduce you to my new pet, Melody. I found her all alone in the other world, so I decided to hypnotize her and turn her into my loyal servant. The only reason I was submitting to you earlier was because I needed to stall for time. Melody just wasn't ready yet, you see, so I left her behind to devour her entire home city and use those people's life force to augment her own power. This girl is nothing but an empty shell now, one who answers to me and me alone. By my order she swallowed thousands of innocent lives, and soon she will snuff yours out of existence as well! With her as my instrument of destruction, I will rule this world without any opposition!\" Sari boasted as she stood next to the massive young girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia laughed as she listened to Sari's bragging. If the only thing keeping this girl loyal to her was a mind control spell, then it would be simple to counteract. Quickly chanting a spell, Lydia pointed toward the massive girl's forehead and fired a beam from her index finger. The beam hit her forehead and shattered the hold Sari had on her mind. Instantly life returned to the girl's eyes, and she looked around in shock upon finding herself in such unfamiliar territory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-where am I?! Why is everything so small?!\" Melody nervously cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Sari's trump card in such a confused state, Lydia decided to take advantage of the opportunity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You! Girl! That woman by your side is an evil witch! She kidnapped you from your home and is using you to terrorize this world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Melody said, staring down nervously at Sari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't listen to that demon, girl! I am the trustworthy one! She brought you here to kill me and take over my kingdom, you must stop her before she brings harm to my people!\" Sari said, also trying to take advantage of Melody's confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough talk! I say we let this poor girl decide who she wants to believe. I'm confident she will make the right choice.\" Lydia yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then, the choice is yours. Which one of us do you want to believe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Um, I don't really... Ummm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody didn't know what to do. Who was she supposed to believe? Should she even trust either of them? After a bit of thought, she...</span></div></div>",

In her head Lydia cursed herself for transforming into this vile form. Had she maintained her human appearance things might have been different, but as it stood this would be the end of her. It only took a second, and Melody's massive socked foot came crashing down on the demoness. The last thing Lydia felt was Melody's soft sole crushing her like a bug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter grinding her foot into the ground to finish the job, Melody lifted it up to look at what she had just done. The sight was revolting. Lydia's body was completely mangled beyond recognition, her blood staining the bottom of Melody's black sock. Melody quickly slammed her foot back down, unable to look at the demon corpse on her sole any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I did it... I really did it! I killed her! She's really dead and it's all because of me! I... I'm a murderer!\" Melody said to herself, tears forming in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari used her magic to fly up in front of the massive girl's face and wipe away her tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did a good thing, young one. Thanks to you, my kingdom will be forever safe from that woman's evil ways. You're no murderer, you're a hero. You've saved all these innocent lives.\" Sari said, gesturing to the remains of the kingdom, and the people who were still running in panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a hero? I did good?\" Melody asked, starting to calm down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you're a hero. You deserve to be rewarded for what you've done.\" Sari said, forming a ball of energy in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" Melody asked nervously, noticing the energy ball that Sari was holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're reward.\" Sari replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a cruel grin, Sari threw the orb at Melody's forehead.

The girl is here, too, but she's far too weak to challenge me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...you'll crush me, now?\" Sari asked, preparing to flee again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, as if you could be so lucky,\" Melody snarled. \"You'll beg for death before we're done with you.

She needed to make some changes to her form, make it into something more appropriate for someone like her. As she began to think about what to do to her body, how to improve it and make it fitting for a goddess such as her, she noticed Sari trying to run away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't! I'm not finished with you yet!\" Lydia yelled as she stomped Melody's foot down in front of her former apprentice, cutting off her escape route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari turned around and looked up in terror as Lydia glared down at her. The face looking at her was the cute young face of Melody, but the hatred that could be seen clearly in her eyes was without a doubt Lydia's. With a snap of her fingers, Lydia conjured up a rope of light and made it wrap around Sari's body. Sari struggled against her bonds, but it was all in vain. Lydia's magic was far to great for her to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First things first. I don't think that you are very deserving of the power I've given you anymore.

Soon Sari's body began to shrink back to her original size. Her skin became pale once again and the horns on her forehead vanished. Sari had been reduced to an ordinary girl once more. Finally her curvy magically enhanced figure reverted to her previous bland  frame. Sari began to cry as she realized she had lost everything now. What made it all worse was that Lydia's magical bindings had shrunken themselves to keep her restrained, and so she was still completely unable to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, is the little baby crying? Don't worry little girl, you're going to get to see something special! You'll be the first one to see me as I mold this body into my new perfect form!\" Lydia said as she now held Sari in the palm of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia then tossed Sari into the air and used her magic to make her float there.

Soon a black fog began to seep out of her skin, burning it away in a horrifying manner. Sari could hear as Melody's voice cried out in pain, but the look of her eyes showed that Lydia was enjoying the transformation. Soon the black fog solidified into a cocoon of dark magic, and Sari was no longer able to see what Lydia was doing to Melody's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the cocoon, Melody's skin was quickly repairing itself. However, rather than her usual skin tone, her skin was now as red as her blood. Horns began to grow from the sides of her head, and a demonic tail sprouted from her rear. Lydia moaned with pleasure as the transformation to her new body continued. Melody's nails lengthened into razor sharp claws, and a pair of devilish wings sprouted from her back. Her short brown hair extended all the way down to her waist, and its color faded away to be replaced by a beautiful silver shine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Finally, the transformation had ended. Lydia licked her lips and smiled evilly, revealing a pair of pointed fangs in the corners of her mouth. With a malicious laugh, she clawed her way out of the cocoon and allowed the dispersed magic to be absorbed back into her body. Sari was horrified when she saw what Lydia had done to Melody's body. She still had the same pathetic curves as before; the same flat chest, the same unimpressive butt, and the stick-like hips. But now, she had become a terrifying demon much like Lydia was earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh, this is much better! I don't know how I ever lived without wings like these!\" Lydia said as she flapped her wings and flew into the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Looking down below her, her attention was drawn to someone who she had almost forgotten about in the joy of her transformation.

You weren't in control of your own body. That woman there used you as her puppet. She controlled you and made you commit those atrocities against your will.

Give her what she deserves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Punish her... Yes, I will!

You saw my body be destroyed, so how?!\" Sari yelled, furious that even her final plan was foiled by Lydia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of a fool do you take me for, child?! I'm not an idiot like you! I taught you everything that you know, so of course I would expect this from you.

In fact, I think that you'll make a nice little accessory for my new servant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia snapped her fingers, and the cage holding Sari's spirit transformed into a crystal ball. She then conjured up a magical chain and tied that crystal ball around Melody's neck as a beautiful necklace. Sari pounded against the walls of her glass prison, but she was unable to escape. Lydia simply laughed at her futile efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you happy now, Sari? You brought this upon yourself, you know. Had you not rebelled against me, I would have gladly allowed you to rule the world by my side. But now, you're going to be forced to watch as this girl takes your place. She will be my new loyal servant, she will have all the power that you could have had if only you'd obeyed me like a good little girl.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia then turned her attention back to her puppet and smiled maliciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Melody... I've given you a magnificent gift. I have just freed you from the shackles known as emotions, and granted you an eternal source of power. That girl around your neck is nothing but a phantom. Her spirit is bound to this plane by that crystal ball, and as long as she remains here you can tap into her magic at will. Draining power from her soul will cause her great pain, but that is none of your concern. She is merely your tool now, so use her however you see fit, and conquer the world in my name. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, master... Your wish is my command... I will bring you the world as you desire...\" Melody replied in a monotone voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody then began to siphon Sari's energy into her body, causing the trapped ghost to cry out in pain. Her very essence was being torn apart, and there was nothing she could do about it. She was trapped like a caged rat, helpless and at the mercy of this heartless shell of a girl. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Melody stopped draining Sari's power.

The same pleasure she had felt back when she first grew to this size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a malicious smile she embraced the power that Melody was injecting into her, and allowed herself to grow ever larger. Before she knew it, she had expanded to be just as tall as young Melody herself was. The two both stood, towering over everything in sight, at at least 250 feet tall. As soon as Lydia had ascended to match Melody's height, the young girl ripped the necklace containing Sari's ghost off of her neck and wrapped it around Lydia's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you have the power that you rightfully deserve, master. I am merely your loyal slave, I don't have the right to use this power for myself.\" Melody said emotionlessly as Lydia looked her in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, child. You are an incredible slave. I shall be sure to reward you later.\" Lydia said as she examined the orb hanging from her neck, and the terrified spirit of Sari held within it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are too kind, master.

This was all too perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, I sense that you are becoming aroused. Would you like me to pleasure you?\" Melody said bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It seemed as though Melody's spirit, although sealed away in the corner of her mind, still had some influence over her body. The extreme embarrassment that she felt for saying such a thing was causing a light blush to spread across her otherwise expressionless face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia didn't know how to react to this.

She simply stared at the crumbled remains of the building that she had ever so casually burnt to the ground, watching as the confused citizens of this world flew into a panic. They had no idea what had caused that building to fall, nor did they have any idea of what would soon happen to them. All who were nearby scrambled to escape the burning building, and in the chaos Sari went completely unnoticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari burst with sadistic laughter at how pathetic these people were. They were so powerless against her. Even the peasants of Widowwood would be able to put up a better fight. At least they would have had a basic understanding of magic, and would have been able to use their own to try and resist her. It wouldn't have been much of a difference at all, she was so powerful now that not even an army of their greatest mages could stop her, but at least it would have been better than this! Sari was almost disappointed by how easy it was. She was confident that this world would be hers within a single day, if even that long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Sari remembered her original purpose for coming here in the first place. In the pleasure of the moment, Sari had completely forgotten that she was being pursued by Lydia. She had no way of knowing what her former master was doing back in their home world. It wouldn't surprise her if Lydia tore her way into this world at any given moment. Sari knew that she needed to prepare for that. She had to gain more power, find a way to tap into the hidden potential that her master had unleashed. She needed a way to grow to the same towering size as Lydia herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when she saw it. Not far from where she was standing, Sari's eyes locked onto a building that was surrounded by fencing. She noticed a sign on the fence that read 'Power plant - Keep out!' and a smile spread across her face. This was it, this was exactly what she needed. As Sari walked toward the power plant, she could sense an amazing amount of energy coming from it. She quickly put two and two together and concluded that this one building was the source of the entire city's power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a devilish giggle, Sari leapt into the air and flew over the fence, landing gracefully on her feet inside the power plant. Thrusting her arms into the air, she began to concentrate her magic to manipulate the electrical energy of the facility. She forced the streams of energy to stray from their paths and fly into her, and as the electricity came into contact with her, she felt her body begin to tingle. She laughed as she absorbed more and more energy from the facility, further augmenting her already unthinkable power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As Sari continued to siphon the power into herself, the surrounding buildings began to react. The sudden loss of power caused their lights to flicker on and off. Soon Sari finished draining every last bit of electricity from the entire city, and she laughed as all the city's electronics abruptly ceased functioning. She had caused a city-wide blackout, crippling this already pathetic society by stripping them of the one advantage they had: their amazingly advanced technology. What made it all the better was that Sari had made herself even more powerful in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it happened. As the new power coursed through her body, Sari began to feel herself changing. She smiled maliciously as she began to rapidly ascend toward the sky above. Within moments her naked body was towering at the same size that Lydia herself had taken on. While she had gone unnoticed by the helpless citizens until now, something as big and sexy as her was simply impossible to miss. Sari giggled as she saw all of the citizens gathering at her feet, simply staring up at her perfect form in awe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy the view while you can, pipsqueaks!

Once that was all in order, she'd return to her home realm, and put her former master in her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari smiled coldly. \"Yes, that will be lovely,\" she whispered, taking a gigantic step forward. Without any hesitation, she strode into the city, not taking notice of the humans and vehicles being pulverized under her heels. No, she had bigger targets, literally so. Stopping in front of a skyscraper which dared to rise higher than her, Sari bared her dagger-like nails, and literally sliced through the entire top of the structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing will rise higher than your goddess, worms,\" she hissed, watching the carnage unfold as seven stories of building toppled into the streets below. Her attention was drawn back to the now-exposed top floor of that building, where dozens of terrified office-workers were desperately trying to take cover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh,\" she whispered, eyes wide with amusement. \"What have we here?\"</span></div></div>",

Those trapped in its path had no recourse against the gigantic pink mussel, and dozens of people were pulled into her mouth when she retracted it. As Sari pulled her face away from the tower, people in opposing buildings could see that she'd licked the entire exposed floor of the building clean. There was no evidence anything had ever been there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari's eyes lit up with delight as she swallowed. \"Well, there was a little more roughage in there than I'd like,\" she admitted. \"But you people have the most delectable meat I've ever had. Forgive me for making a glutton of myself, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she plunged her first into an adjacent building, greedily grabbing as many fleeing people as she could. Taking a moment to admire her catch, she casually opened her mouth and deposited them inside as a normal person might snack on some popcorn. She did this repeatedly, until the building she was pounding could take no more abuse, and simply collapsed in upon itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a belch that shattered windows in nearby buildings, the giant girl turned away from her lunch's desolate remains, back to the city itself. </span></div></div>",

The sensation of power pulsated through her body as she grew larger and larger. Eventually, the skyscrapers reached only to her hips. The people in them were mere ants to her. She closed her eyes, enjoying this feeling of power and control. But her enjoyment was interrupted as something exploded at the back of her head. It did not harm her, it did not even hurt, but it was annoying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around to see flying, metallic object, shooting exploding projectiles at her. She grinned maliciously. \"Time to use my new powers.\" She held forth her arm to summon the energy, but ... it hurt. The strange, electrical energy she had absorbed hurt as it flew through her body. But she was a mighty witch, almost godlike. She just had to change to use this power and it's hidden potential. She focused on combining the lightning with her magical power. And it worked. She could feel her body change. Her skin went from pale to almost transparent. Light blue veins were pulsating with energy. Her eyes were glowing blue. Even her hair changed to a shimmering azure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her transformation complete, she again pointed at her enemies. A beam of light shot from her hand. But it stayed connected to it, like a whip made of electricity. She moved it around with her will, destroying all resistance. She looked again at her body, fascinated. She possessed so much energy. No, she had become pure energy itself. Sari let out a mighty roar as she used her new power to suck up energy from even farther away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, the stream of energy stopped. She looked around like a hungry predator. \"More!\" She walked across the land, covering miles within seconds. And then, she found it. A construct called nuclear reactor. She did not know how exactly it worked, but it was full of energy, producing more and more each second. She connected herself with it, sucking even more, getting even stronger. After what felt like hours, she felt she had enough. Looking around, she noticed a giant army, firing at her. She laughed. She hadn't even noticed their attack. With a wave of her hand, she destroyed all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, she felt almost invincible. \"I think it is time to go back and finish what I started.\" Without any effort, she opened a portal and walked through it. She found herself in a tiny village. Her confidence rose as she saw the buildings. Until now, she had compared her size only to the giant skyscrapers of the other world. But the huts of this village were no bigger than her big toe. She casually sent down a shockwave, killing everyone in the village. Then, she sucked up their lifeforce. Next, she started looking for Lydia. Time to continue this battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what happened to Lydia?</span></div></div>",

It didn't occur to Lydia, when she'd initially opened the door between her energies and Sari, that Sari would discover a way to keep the door open, pulling out more power. The younger mage was more diabolical than Lydia had given her credit for. Still, Lydia was the master, and it would be simple to take control, again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo...why wasn't she doing so?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about the sheer nerve of Sari's move, about feeling her full, pouty lips hungrily pulling Lydia's towards her, about the girl's weight increasing on Lydia's chest as she grew larger and stronger...it was stirring something deep in Lydia's breast. She felt her cheeks flush, her nethers grow wet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped struggling, and returned Sari's kiss, eagerly pushing more and more energy into her enlarging apprentice. Sari, for her part, was surprised, but smugly satisfied. She broke the kiss, looking down at her dwindling 'master' with cold, complete, contempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's right,\" she whispered, eyes wide with wicked glee. \"Feed me, 'master'. Make me stronger. You love this. You're right where you belong, right where you want to be...beneath me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia nodded, shivering. \"I...I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say it,\" Sari breathed, shivering in her own arousal. \"You want to.

She was about to become all-powerful, an unstoppable goddess who would be able to bend the world to her will, and she wanted someone to rule by her side. Naturally, the only person she deemed worthy of this honor was her own servant, Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am about to become omnipotent, my dear pet. And luckily for you, I'm willing to share a fragment of my soon-to-be unlimited power with you. Be honored and accept this gift, for you will soon rule this world by my side!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia then drew her arm back before quickly thrusting it toward Amanda's chest. In an instant, her sharp fingernails pierced through Amanda's flesh like the knife that Lydia had stabbed herself with earlier. At firs Amanda was shocked, and a wave of pain flooded through her body. However, the pain was soon replaced by a wave of complete euphoria, and she couldn't help but gasp in pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Amanda began to feel an unbelievable amount of power entering her body. The power continued to flow throughout her being, and within moments she herself was undergoing physical changes similar to the ones that Lydia experienced earlier. Her already decent figure was changed to be all but perfect, as all of her curves became incredibly defined. Much like Lydia, her skin went from a pale white to a deep tan, and a pair of small horns appeared on her forehead. Lastly, her eyes changed color from a vibrant green to the same blood red as Lydia's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the transformation was complete, Amanda's body had become absolutely flawless. Her curves were enough to rival those of Lydia herself. As Amanda's transformation was completed, Lydia removed her hand from Amanda's chest and backed away. Much like when she had stabbed herself with the knife, Amanda's wound was healed almost instantaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what did you do to me?\" Amanda asked nervously as she regained her senses and realized the changes to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've made you into a goddess, my pet. With the power that I have given you, you will be able to rule by my side as I bring the world to its knees!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but I never wanted to rule the world... I just wanted a place to belong...\" Amanda said, sounding distressed by her transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, but now you don't have to worry about such petty things like 'belonging'. If you want something, you now have the power to take it for yourself. Just think about it, you can do anything that you want now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I can?\" Amanda replied, starting to calm down a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you can. Like I said, you've become a goddess. Anything that you desire is now yours for the taking. After all, there isn't anyone capable of stopping you now. So, what do you think, my pet? Isn't this a perfect opportunity for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow will Amanda respond?</span></div></div>",

She stumbled over, dazed and a bit confused. What did Lydia have in store for her? She looked up hesitantly, embarrassed to see Lydia's titanic buttocks looming over her. Lydia's rear was large enough at normal size, but now that she was a towering giant, it was practically a land-mass unto itself. Following Amanda's gaze to her perfectly-shaped ass, Lydia gave it a playful smack, the sound of which reverberated through the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I desire a seat,\" she noted simply. \"And you're it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Amanda could process the implications of the statement, it was too late; Lydia let her enormous body slide down, pinning her servant under her gigantic ass cheeks. Amanda should have been crushed instantly, but the power Lydia had left within her kept the girl alive, for better or worse. Amanda cried out in pain and surprised as the firm ass flesh pinned her immovably into place. She tried her best to force Lydia off, or at least pry herself free, but it was a fool's errand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer efforts didn't go entirely to waste, however; above her, Lydia was purring slightly. \"Oh, you have no idea how good that feels, little one,\" she moaned. \"I should have made a toy of you ages ago...here, let's try something different...\"</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, Amanda drew back her arm just as Lydia had before. She hesitated for a moment, but quickly gritted her teeth and thrust her hand forward to impale Lydia's chest. Using the same method that her master had used to grant her this power in the first place, Amanda proceeded to suck even more power out of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the energy was quickly being sapped away from her, Lydia grabbed Amanda's wrist with both hands and struggled to pull her hand from her chest.

There's no way she could possibly win this. At least, that's what Lydia thought, until she looked into Amanda's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat lurked behind them chilled Lydia to the bone. There was rage behind her eyes; a lifetime of being treated like dirt had imprinted a deep river of anger within the outwardly-timid girl. And now, with such power within her grasp, Amanda had a level of determination Lydia had never seen. And unfortunately, that was making the difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one's gonna' hurt me again,\" Amanda whispered, as the power continued to flow into her. \"No one's gonna' be mean to me, again. I won't go hungry. I...I'm gonna' be in charge. I'll be queen...of everything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final retch that practically pulled Lydia apart, Amanda was done. The power was all hers. She stood, disoriented, overwhelmed. Her body was practically crackling with energy; she felt like she could do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia tried to take advantage of her confusion to dash for the exit, but she was far too slow. Without knowing her own strength, Amanda grabbed the back of Lydia's neck and tossed her aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Oh, I didn't mean to do that,\" Amanda admitted, even as Lydia tried to crawl back to her feet. \"I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused. She didn't have reason to apologize to anyone, did she? \"So, don't make me do it again,\" she said, much more firm. As she spoke, her body began to grow, filling out even more. She was an Amazonian seven feet tall, and still inching upwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now. Things are going to be different around here.\"</span></div></div>",

She knew this all to well, and seeing the woman who she had pushed around like a slave all these years towering over her, Lydia was scared for her life. There was no doubt in her mind that Amanda had a lot of pent up aggression from her treatment over the past few years. Aggression that she would now be able to vent on Lydia herself. Still, even in spite of her current helplessness, Lydia's pride got the better of her. She wouldn't let her own servant take control like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand down, worm! You're out of line! I am the master here, and you are my slave! I'm not going to stand for any rebellion out of you!\" Lydia said harshly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, Amanda simply laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's rich! I've taken every last bit of your power, and you still think that <i>you</i> are the master here? Awww, that's so cute... Fine then Lydia, you don't have to stand for it. In fact, you are never to stand in my presence again. From this day forward I am your goddess, and I want you to kneel before me like the dog you are!\" Amanda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never! There's no way I would reduce myself to such a level!\" Lydia said, now fuming with rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said... <b>KNEEL!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Lydia's body collapsed to the ground like a lead weight. An invisible force had shoved her to her knees, and struggle as she might she was unable to stand up again. Amanda laughed once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, this power is amazing! I can control your body through my words alone!\" Amanda said as she looked down at Lydia and smirked. \"Now... Lick my feet, slave.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia tried to resist, but Amanda's words carried magic in them, and her body was being forced to obey regardless of her own will. Soon Lydia's tongue extended and licked the top of Amanda's dainty foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good slave. Know your place down there. From this day forward, you belong to me and me alone. Now, what should I do with you next?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda contemplated her options for a moment before coming to a decision.</span></div></div>",

Lydia would perform until Amanda got bored, at which point Amanda would move on to wreak a horrific revenge on the rest of the world. But at the moment, Amanda was far from bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda's eyes lit up as she contemplated her next move, a warmth growing between her thighs. \"You may stand, slave,\" she said, voice haughty. \"I need you to, in order to perform your next task.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia, still on her knees, face looking down, didn't comply. \"...please, Amanda, stop this...just let me go,\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She's begging me to release her. Actually begging!' Amanda thought, face flushing. 'By the gods, this is making me so amorous...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I can force you to stand,\" she noted. \"So why don't you go ahead and do it of your own will?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another moment's hesitation, Lydia complied. Her head was still lowered. \"Come on, look at your master,\" Amanda said firmly.  Lydia did so, eyes filled with terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda smiled down at Lydia, peering over her now-ample bust. \"There's a good slave,\" she noted, before moving forward with a shocking swiftness. Lydia barely had time to let out a cry before she found herself penned against the wall, Amanda's gargantuan breasts pushed into her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda purred to herself as Lydia panicked and tried to force her away. Her captive's thrashing not only felt wonderful against her very sensitive flesh, but just the fact that she was so easily cowing her former master made her even hotter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen well, Lydia,\" Amanda whispered in a husky voice. \"This new power is doing wonderful, terrible things to my body. I've never been in heat as much as I am right now. You're going to service your master's desires, as if your life depends on it. Because, it does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused, to let the words sink in, and drink in Lydia's terror. \"Don't bother protesting,\" she continued. \"Because you know that with a simple command, I can make you serve me, regardless of your own desires. So. Will you please me willingly, or must I force you?\"</span></div></div>",

This went on for what felt like an eternity. Amanda continued to violate her former master's face with her sex, and Lydia struggled to please the powerful woman in front of her. Finally Amanda came, practically suffocating Lydia with her love juices. As Lydia coughed and choked on the vile liquid, Amanda simply laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now slave, don't get too comfortable.

The weaker mage blacked out for a moment as her body began to dwindle, growing smaller and smaller as Amanda laughed coldly. In mere moments, Lydia was a miniscule two inches tall.

However, Amanda sensed her movement and stopped her in her tracks with a single word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Freeze!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia's body instantly became stiff as a rock. Try as she might, she was unable to move an inch. She was absolutely terrified now. With a single word Amanda had paralyzed her entire body, taken away what little freedom she had left. That was the extent of Amanda's control over her. She could do nothing without Amanda's approval, and she could do anything that she wanted with her. Soon Amanda returned from another room, holding in her hand the same whip that Lydia had used to discipline her with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a very naughty slave, Lydia. Trying to run away from me? Really? You know how much control I have over you, so why even bother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry master...\" Lydia said, flat out terrified by how much Amanda had changed with her newfound power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you should be sorry.\" Amanda said as she walked circles around Lyda's paralyzed body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then stopped in front of her again and placed her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Get down on your hands and knees, slave!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia's body followed the command, but as soon as she was in the position that Amanda desired her in, she was once again unable to move. She could only look up at her new master in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you see these scars, slave? These scars that you yourself gave me?\" Amanda asked, moving her hands down her body as she gestured to dozens of whip marks that coated her entire figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, master...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These scars really hurt, slave. Do you have any idea how much pain I was in when you did this to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia began to open her mouth to respond, but Amanda interrupted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, of course you don't! You think that you've suffered, but in reality you've never felt what real pain is like! But don't worry, slave. I'm going to fix that. I'm going to share my pain with you. When I'm done, you'll know exactly what I've been enduring by serving you all these years. You'll know why I'm doing what I'm doing to you. And most importantly, you'll know why I deserve to be the one in control from now on!\" Amanda said, her tone becoming increasingly hostile as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Lydia could say a word, Amanda swung her arm down and lashed at her side with the whip. The cruel leather tore at Lydia's skin and she cried out in pain. She couldn't believe how horrible it was. She had been doing this to Amanda on a daily basis?! Even a single blow already had Lydia in tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, crying already? Come on, slave! Toughen up! We're just getting started!\" Amanda said as she lashed out at her former master once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive lashes past and Lydia was already begging for mercy. Mercy that Amanda was unwilling to give.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you having fun yet, slave?! I bet you wish that you had treated me better now, don't you! This is just a small taste of the agony that you put me through!\" Amanda yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cruel former slave whipped Lydia dozens of times. She continued to swing that whip until it broke through Lydia's skin, drawing blood for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go, slave! Now we can have matching scars! But you'll be needing a lot more than that if you want to match me... Let's see if we can fix that, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia was breaking down in tears as Amanda continued her punishment. Her whippings were absolutely ruthless. She left at least a dozen bloodied gashes on her back by the time she was finished, but just when Lydia thought her suffering was over, Amanda's cruelty reached all new levels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roll over, slave. We're only half way done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please master... Please... I can't take it anymore! Please! Have mercy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda kicked Lydia harshly in the face and grabbed her by the hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you ever have mercy on me when I was in your position?! No, you didn't! Now shut up and do as I say! Don't make me use my command on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia trembled. She tried to do as Amanda asked, but her body was still paralyzed from the earlier command. Try as she might, she couldn't turn onto her back. She looked up at Amanda pleadingly, but the heartless look in her eyes told her that she was well aware of Lydia's plight. She was just toying with her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's too bad slave... It looks like you still haven't learned your place yet. Since I have no other choice, <i>roll over</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly Lydia's body moved to follow Amanda's command. As she lay down on her back, the gaping wounds left by Amanda's whip began to sting fiercely. She cried out in pain once more, but her cries were silenced as Amanda slammed her bare foot over her mouth. Amanda simply laughed to herself as she started her whipping on Lydia's front. This went on for quite some time, and when she was done with Lydia's body, she moved on to her arms and legs. By the time Amanda was finished, Lydia's entire body was a bloody mess. She was covered head to toe in deep gashes, and Amanda simply laughed at her suffering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you know the pain I've endured, Lydia. I only gave you what you gave me, nothing more. I hope you're happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia couldn't believe it. She had done this to Amanda? She had made her go through this unbearable pain? How did she stand it?! If Lydia were in such a position, she would have run away at her first opportunity. So why did Amanda stay with her for so long?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to know why I put up with your torture all these years, Lydia?\" Amanda asked, as if reading Lydia's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's quite simple really.

Lydia screamed in protest, her wounds lit on fire by the exertion. Amanda ignored her pain, pulling the other woman close, as if to tell a secret. She took a moment to slowly lick the side of Lydia's neck, enjoying the taste of her former master's blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because...you ignorant sow,\" she whispered, voice filled with rage. \"I loved you, Lydia. Even in spite of all you put me through, I still love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a bit too much for Lydia to process. \"That doesn't...how...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it was so perfect, at first,\" Amanda noted, voice dripping with disdain. \"I was at my lowest point, lost, alone. Then you came, like an angel, to give me a home, and purpose. But it couldn't be so simple, could it? You're more like a fallen angel, intent on making everyone as miserable and wretched as you are. Well, congratulations! Enjoy your handiwork!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slammed Lydia against the wall, obviously enjoying every moment of it. \"Every time you spewed venom at me, every time you hit me, every time you brought out that damned whip, I told myself, it was the last. I'd do better, next time. I'd win your heart. You'd feel for me what I felt for you. But it wasn't true. It's impossible. All you love is yourself, and your hatred and rage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amanda,\" Lydia whispered, voice weak. \"I never meant-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say, 'I never meant to hurt you', I'll cut out your tongue right now,\" Amanda snapped. \"You never gave me a second thought. It's why you were stupid enough to trust me with this power in the first place; it never even entered your mind that I might disagree, that I might rebel. I'm not supposed to be a person, just an extension of you. And now I am. I'm your rage, and lust, and power, and I'm so much more that you'd dare to be. Everyone is going to suffer in the worst ways imaginable. And you...you'll see it all. By my side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved to the cowering Lydia, strutting sexily towards her. \"Because I love you, of course,\" she whispered, eyes cold. \"And I'll teach you to love me. More than anything.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Lydia saw Amanda coming toward her, her hips shaking seductively as she walked, her fear began to fade away. No, it wasn't that. She wasn't any less terrified of Amanda than she was before, especially considering what she had just done to her. She was still afraid for her life, that much was undeniable, but something else was beginning to overshadow her fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was lust. Lydia was looking at Amanda's perfect body in all her naked glory, admiring every curve she possessed. Even the scars that covered her skin seemed alluring in a way. They were a symbol of the hardships that she had been through. A reminder of everything that Amanda had to endure in order to reach this point. Before she was no more than an insignificant slave, but now she had become nothing short of an almighty goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The look of pure sexual dominance that she wore on her face was incredibly arousing to Lydia as well. Up until now she had always assumed herself to be the type who gets the most pleasure from being on top, but she had never felt anything like this before. She was more aroused than she had ever been before, and the cause of her arousal was being dominated and abused by her own former slave. If she was getting this turned on after everything Amanda had just done to her, there was only one explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia was a switch. She was the type who enjoyed both dominating and being dominated. She was both a sadist and a masochist. She couldn't deny it any more. She was loving this. Being held at the mercy of her former slave like this was the ultimate turn on for her. She wanted more. She needed more. And much to her joy, Amanda was going to give her more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Get on your back, whore!</i>\" Amanda commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Lydia obeyed her master's command, laying on her back and revealing her body to Amanda. The former slave bent down and ran her finger through one of Lydia's open wounds, coating her finger in her blood. Lydia cried out in agony as Amanda brought her finger up to her mouth and licked the blood off, moaning with arousal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! Ohhh, your blood is so delicious, slave! I can hardly stand it!\" Amanda said as she reached down for another sample.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again her finger traced its way through one of Lydia's wounds, and once again Lydia screamed out in pain. In spite of how painful this was for her, Lydia could feel herself getting wet as Amanda continued to take advantage of her. This pain was the ultimate aphrodisiac. As amazing as the rush of power she had felt while dominating Amanda in the past was, this was even better than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lydia may have been both a sadist and a masochist, but her masochistic side was definitely the stronger of the two. Lydia's screams were as much from her arousal as they were from her pain. Lydia tried to hold herself back, but it was too much for her. She could no longer hold back her lust. As Amanda stood up again and began to walk away from her, Lydia rolled over onto her hands and knees to prostrate herself before her new master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More...\" Lydia mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that, slave?\" Amanda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More. I need more! Dominate me, Amanda! Make me your bitch! Treat me even worse than I treated you! Show me the true extent of your love!\" Lydia pleaded, going insane with lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda simply stood there, mouth agape in shock. She couldn't believe that Lydia was acting this way. Lydia, the woman who had abused her for years and gotten off on it in the process, was now begging to be abused herself. Had all the pain broken her?! Had the sudden role reversal between the two made her snap?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda didn't care one bit. Looking down at Lydia like this, seeing her former master begging on her hands and knees and completely covered in her own blood, it was too much. She was so turned on right now she didn't know what to do. Her hand reached down between her legs without even thinking about it, and she began to finger herself. Lydia could only watch as her new master got herself off on her suffering. A few moments later, Amanda stopped playing with herself and looked back to Lydia again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really want me to torment you even more, slave?\" Amanda asked teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Master Amanda... I need to feel you asserting your superiority over me again. Please, make me suffer. Make me cry out in pain and worship you like the goddess you are!\" Lyda said.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSeeing how pathetic Lydia was, Amanda burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahahahaha! Well, this is certainly an interesting twist! My former master, the one who gave me all these scars, is now begging me to beat her into submission! Oh, this is just too perfect for words. Very well, Lydia. I am a gracious master, and I'm in a good mood today. Simply confess your undying love for me, and I'll grant your wish and then some!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, I love you more than life itself. I'm eternally sorry for not realizing your feelings sooner. I never accepted your love for me, but now I would do anything for you! Please Master Amanda, show me your cruel love and make me yours for all eternity!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA devilish smile spread across Amanda's face as those words left Lydia's mouth. She couldn't believe it. Finally, after all these years of pain and suffering, Lydia was at last willing to reciprocate her love. Hearing the love of her life humbling herself before her like a dog, Amanda was overcome with joy. She didn't know if she could contain herself anymore. She was so turned on, but she also wanted to grant Lydia's wish. What should she do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill Amanda hold herself back in order to give Lydia what she wants, or will she give in to her lust and command Lydia to satisfy her before she gets her reward?</span></div></div>",

The influx of dark power she'd drained from her former master had changed her even further, and her concept of 'love' along with it. Hers was a vicious, selfish love, one that was practically synonymous with ownership. So why should Amanda care for what Lydia wanted? Lydia was hers, and she'd do with her as she pleased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an orgasmic moan, she pulled Lydia up, locking lips with her viciously. Lydia responded, a bit surprised, but still hopeful that she'd get the painful release she'd just humiliated herself for. And while there was some pain as Amanda bit her lip hard enough to draw blood, Lydia didn't care for what came next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda shoved the other woman to the ground, and pulled her face towards her eager sex. \"Now, work,\" Amanda commanded, voice husky, hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...but you said-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda glared at her. \"Don't think my fondness for you is going to make me forget what you did to me. You're a lifetime away from earning that sort of consideration. You exist for my needs, slave, and I need you to eat me out. Or I'll deal you the type of pain you won't get off on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia was suddenly afraid again, as the dynamics of the situation sank in. Fearing for her life, she moved forward, diligently working Amanda's lower lips. Amanda moaned her approval, using one hand to guide Lydia's head, while the other teased and tortured her own nipples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda had never felt more like a goddess before, and it was beginning to show...</span></div></div>",

It took Lydia some time to notice what was wrong, but as she pulled away from her overbearing master, she realized the girl was a head taller than she had been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda, irritated that the attentions had ceased, finally opened her eyes and looked down. \"What do you think you're...oh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough initially confused with her increased size, Amanda broke into a grin moments later. \"Now, this is more like it,\" she purred, rubbing her expanded curves lewdly. \"Get back to work, love. There's more of me to serve, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia was nervous. \"If...if you lose control, and start growing again,\" she offered, timid. \"I could be injured...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda glared at her. \"Who said I'm losing control? I want this. I'm a god, and the whole world should see.\" With that proclamation, she closed her eyes and began to finger herself, steadily growing larger as her excitement mounted. \"Just imagine what I can do to you...\" she panted. \"When you're bite-sized...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia most certainly didn't want to imagine this, but found herself doing so, anyway. Amanda's allure was very quickly being outweighed by her selfishness and cruelty, and Lydia was terrified of the godly girl becoming a giant...</span></div></div>",

What kind of person did this to someone that they loved?! She had to do something fast. She couldn't take much more of this. She had to stop Amanda before she <i>loved</i> her to death! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Amanda, forgive me for my insolence! I never knew that you felt that way about me! Had I known... Had I known, I swear that things would have been different between us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right! You never cared about me one bit! You only saw me as a tool, never as a person! The only reason you're changing your tone now is because I'm the one in control for once!  Now, as your master I command you; <i>stop lying to me and accept your punishment</i>!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia's body moved on its own at Amanda's command. She got down on her hands and knees, bowing before Amanda and awaiting her next form of torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not lying to you, Amanda. The only reason I treated you the way I did was because you came from Widowwood. Everyone there hated me for my beliefs. I had assumed that, outcast or not, you were the same. I thought that you hated me, and were planning to betray me at your first opportunity, so I made you my slave and never gave you that chance. If I had known how you really felt about me, I would never have treated you the way I did! I... I never knew what love felt like before... I couldn't see the signs, because I didn't know that that was what they were. If you had just come out and told me how you felt, I would have gladly accepted your feelings! In truth, even though I believed you were only with me to stab me in the back, I really did appreciate your companionship. Before you arrived, I always felt so lonely here by myself. I wanted nothing more than to meet a companion who I could share everything with. That's why I gave you this power in the first place. In spite of all the doubt in my heart, I had hoped that perhaps you would truly turn out to be that companion I longed for.\" Lydia said, tears beginning to flow down her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda froze in place as she heard Lydia's speech. She couldn't believe it. Lydia couldn't be lying to her, though. She had just commanded her to stop lying. Anything more that came out of her mouth had to be the truth! These were Lydia's true feelings! All these years of torture... Lydia never really saw her as the worm she treated her as. She saw her as a threat, and it was all done in order to keep her in line. It seemed that beneath Lydia's cold and heartless shell, the real her was actually just traumatized by how Widowwood had treated her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no surprise that she was unwilling to open up to people. Lydia had spent her entire life studying the dark arts. She had done it with nothing but the purest intentions. She wanted to harness that forbidden power and help bring Widowwood to greater heights. She thought that she would be loved and respected for her hard work, but instead she was labeled as a traitor and banished from the very kingdom she spent her entire life trying to protect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was truly tragic. She had already been betrayed by everyone she held dear to her, so of course she didn't want to take the risk of trusting another person that way again. Especially someone who was from the same kingdom that betrayed her in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really mean that, don't you Lydia. You aren't lying to me, are you...\" Amanda said, reaching down and wiping the tears from Lydia's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't lie to you if I wanted to, Amanda. You control me now, and you commanded me not to. I speak only the truth. And... I still want a companion to share the world with. If you truly love me, then would you consider giving me a second chance?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Return my power to me. We can start over from the beginning. Between the two of us there would be nothing in the world powerful enough to stop us. We can rule over everything. Not as master and slave, but on equal ground. We can be lovers, just as you wished. So what do you say?\" Lydia said, reaching out her hand in hopes that Amanda would forgive her and help her to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda once again didn't know how to respond to this. She looked down at Lydia with confusion clouding her heart. On one hand, her love for Lydia hadn't wavered since the day she met her, and she would like nothing more than to rule the world at her side. On the other hand, the rage she had built up over the years made her hesitant to relinquish her position of power now. If she gave in to Lydia's request, it would be as though she was okay with all the suffering she put her through going unpunished. Was she really willing to forgive Lydia's cruelty just because of love?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill Amanda listen to Lydia's request and forgive her, or ignore her request and punish her more?</span></div></div>",

Soon, her face broke into a warm smile, and she took Lydia's hand, pulling the other woman to her feet. Lydia's spirits lifted, feeling hopeful for a single moment. And then Amanda's smile turned grim, and Lydia found her former slave's hand around her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, my love, what point there is in me relinquishing any of my own powers?\" Amanda whispered. \"It's a false choice; I can keep them, and have you. With a single command, you will be mine. Now, slave...I command you to love me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment's silence, as Amanda realized Lydia's expression was still one of terror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...why isn't it working?\" Amanda muttered, loosening her grip on Lydia's neck to allow her captive to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...to...to control a person's heart and mind...takes a higher degree of magic,\" Lydia managed. \"Requires more skill...than you have...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is that all?\" Amanda sighed. \"Well, I'm a quick study.

In time, I'll understand everything, and my control over this world will be absolute.

The young girl eyed her mother with a lust that she had never seen before. The sight shocked Lydia, but it greatly pleased Amanda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I take it that you are going to accept my offer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I've wanted this for so long. I can't hide it any longer.\" Alexi said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha! Very good, child! You know better than to turn down such an impeccable offer! You're a smart girl. No go ahead, have your fun. Do what you've always wanted to do. Rape your own mother!\" Amanda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexi nodded to her before turning her attention back to the immobilized Lydia that lay before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy, you are the only one I've ever cared for. And now... Now I'm going to make you mine forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... No! You can't do this, Alexi! I'm your mother and you are my daughter! It wouldn't be right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We aren't related, Lydia. You know that as well as I do. There's no reason why we can't be together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I raised you since you were a child! Don't you have any shame?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, mommy, I don't. I'm a very naughty little girl. Do you know how many nights I've spent, alone in bed, pleasuring myself to dirty thoughts about you? I want you so badly I can't stand it, mommy. I don't care about anything else right now. I just want to make you mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia was horrified by this situation. She never would have imagined that her own adopted daughter harbored such feelings for her. She wanted nothing more than to be able to move, to escape from this situation. Unfortunately for her, Amanda had used her magic words to command her to stay still. No matter how badly her mind wanted to break free, her body was helpless to resist Amanda's will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, unable to do anything to stop her, Lydia had no choice but to watch as her now-naked daughter climbed over her and began to rub up against her body. Lydia was about to open her mouth once more to protest, but her words were cut short as Alexi leaned forward and forced a deep kiss on her. As there lips locked, Alexi began to grind her crotch against Lydia's leg. She reached one hand behind her mother's head to force her into the kiss even more, and with her other hand she reached forward and began to grope at Lydia's bountiful breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alexi continued to have her way with Lydia, Amanda sat in a nearby chair and watched the scene unfold. It aroused her greatly to watch the mother and daughter engage in passionate sex right before her eyes, and the way that Alexi was asserting her dominance over her helpless mother... Dear god did it turn her on. Before she even realized it herself, Amanda began to reach down to her crotch and finger herself. The scene before her was simply too hot. She couldn't hold back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of sex, Alexi reached the point of climax. As she rubbed her dripping crotch against Lydia's leg one last time, she finally pushed herself over the top, releasing her sticky cum all over her mother's leg. Lydia couldn't believe what had just happened to her. She had just been violated by her own daughter of all people. Over on the sidelines, Amanda was also nearing her limit. Soon after Alexi came, Amanda followed her lead and did the same. Now, all three women were laying there panting from the exhaustion of their arousal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

The former servant couldn't help but chuckle at the sight. \"Well, I trust you're satisfied, little Alexi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexi moaned her approval softly, taking a moment to lick the side of Lydia's neck in appreciation. \"That was wonderful...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure it was. But seeing as I made this possible for you, I think that puts you squarely in my debt. What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexi regarded her, confused. \"You didn't say-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to work for me, dear,\" Amanda said, cutting her off. \"I'm going to rule everything that exists with my new power, but I see no reason to do so alone. Be my servant, and you'll be given power and rewards unimagined. I'll even let you keep Lydia, forever. Just as you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger woman frowned slightly. \"And if I say, 'no'?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't kill you, if that's what you're asking. But in that case, I'll be keeping Lydia for myself.\" Lydia's expression of absolute horror immediately told Alexi that this particular outcome was completely undesirable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexi had to consider this. It didn't matter to her one way or another what Amanda's goals were, but...if she refused, she would lose Lydia. And despite how twisted and perverse her affections for her adopted mother were, Alexi did truly care for her, and want to be with her. She'd agree to anything to get that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression brightened. \"I'd love to,\" she told Amanda. \"What do I have to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stand, pet,\" Amanda told her, clearly convinced she'd manipulated the girl to her will. With a gesture, she forged a beam of energy from her hand to Alexi's exposed chest, granting the girl a formidable portion of her own godly powers. Alexi moaned in surprise, practically cumming a second time as her body filled with power, filling out in the same way Amanda's had when she'd been empowered. The experience was such that her knees buckled; she fell forward, panting for breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...amazing,\" she managed, glancing first to Lydia, then to Amanda. \"So, so amazing...\"</span></div></div>",

One look at Lydia and Sari smiled to herself. This was going to be so much fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh mommy... I hope you aren't tired out from before, because I'm just getting started, and I need you to satisfy me again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia's face paled. The first round of sex with her adopted daughter had drained the vast majority of her stamina. She was still panting from exhaustion, and now Alexi wanted more from her?! The girl was clearly insane! Even if Lydia had wanted to do this, her body was far too worn out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I can't do anymore... You twisted little girl... You can't force me to-\" Lydia said in between her deep breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh be quiet, mommy!\" Alexi yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly Lydia's mouth was sealed shut by magic. It seemed that Alexi could now use the same magical words as Amanda. Giggling to herself as she saw her helpless mother's mouth slam shut, Alexi continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like you have any choice in the matter, anyway. I own you now, so you have to do what I say. And I say that you have to fuck me now, so FUCK ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexi then laid down on the bed next to Lydia and spread her legs wide. Lydia, bound to follow the commands of her young adopted daughter, leaned forward and began to eat her out. Against her will Lydia worked her tongue between Alexi's legs, lapping desperately at her dripping young pussy. Alexi let out moans of pleasure as she felt her mother's tongue squirming its way through her inner workings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lydia's body was so tired out that it was barely able to function, yet she still did everything it took to satisfy Alexi's desires. Soon the stimulation was too much for the young Alexi to handle, and she finally released her orgasmic fluids all over Lydia's face. As soon as her daughter came, Lydia found herself physically incapable of continuing. She collapsed into unconsciousness with her head laying on Alexi's crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Alexi couldn't help but giggle to herself. This power was amazing. Even after such a forceful orgasm as that, her sex drive hadn't diminished in the slightest. She still craved more, and with her mother now unconscious, she only had one place to turn to. Looking toward Amanda, Alexi spread her legs once more and beckoned for her to join. Feeling horny herself, Amanda decided to satisfy the young girl's lust for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda and Alexi engaged in the most passionate sex they had ever experienced. They were both higher beings, no human could ever hope to satisfy them like this. The two rolling about on the bed knocked Lydia's unconscious form to the ground, but neither of them paid her any mind. Right now they were only focused on one thing: eachother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several hours of passion, Alexi and Amanda finally wore eachother out. At around that time, Lydia was finally beginning to reawaken. For a moment her memory was clouded, but as she looked up and saw the two superior women looking down on her like some sort of insect, she began to remember just what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She found this completely unacceptable, of course; despite how twisted this new power had made the girl's mind, she did legitimately care for Lydia, and didn't trust Amanda not to kill her. Rather than start a direct confrontation, however, Alexi decided to redirect Amanda's attentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we've been playing around too much,\" Alexi offered. \"You wanted to take over the land, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda smiled, eyes alight with glee at the thought. \"Oh, yes. Quite right. Dress yourself, my lieutenant. We've work to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the former servant left the room to prepare herself, Alexi paused to give Lydia a surprisingly-tender kiss on the top of her head. \"Don't worry,\" she insisted. \"Everything's going to be fine, now. I'll take care of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's mood-swings were almost as terrifying to Lydia as if she was consistently deranged. The older mage realized that this was simply Alexi's natural, somewhat bi-polar, disposition, amplified a thousandfold by the magics she'd received from Amanda. She did believe the girl was sincere when she claimed to care for Lydia's well-being, but she also realized that Alexi was far too immature and quick-tempered to be trusted with such power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't trust her,\" Lydia allowed quietly. \"Amanda is a viper, and she'll strike you as soon as you give her cause.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I won't give her cause,\" Alexi replied as if her caretaker was upset over nothing. She quickly dressed and left Lydia alone, following Amanda on the way to Willowwood.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the two goddesses walked away, eager to begin asserting their will over the rest of the world, Lydia struggled to her feet and dusted herself off. She couldn't believe how far she had fallen... Earlier today it was her and her alone who had possessed that power. She could have easily taken over and ruled the world herself, but instead she foolishly trusted her servant girl with an equal share of that power. She had expected her slave to comply with demands even when they stood on equal ground, but the new power went to her head, and Amanda quickly betrayed her. Had she not been so caught off guard by her servant's sudden personality change, she might have been able to stop that rebelion in its tracks. Unfortunately, the whole thing was such a surprise to her that she didn't know how to react. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she had been stripped of all her hard-earned magical power, and her own former slave was about to do what she had been dreaming of doing for years. Even her own daughter had betrayed her, choosing to side with Amanda for the sake of gaining more power. It was clear that Lydia had lost. Amanda had beaten her in every way, and now she was left with nothing. However, although she had lost the battle, the war had only just begun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia still had a trump card to fall back on.One that would surely grant her enough power to at the very least stand on equal ground with her rebellious slave once more, if not surpass her entirely. Several years back, very soon after she had moved in to this tower, Lydia used a spell to kidnap a young woman from Widowwood and imprison her in a secret chamber beneath the tower. The chamber was sealed away long before even Amanda came to work as Lydia's servant, so Lydia was the only one who should know about it. The woman was kept alive by the very magic that was sealing her in the chamber, and with each passing day a bit of the magic that maintained that seal was injected into the captive's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the years she was held captive, the magic that that woman had accumulated within her would surely have become great enough to oppose the dark power that was now held by Amanda. The woman had been isolated from the world for years, and by now she would have surely gone insane. If things went as Lydia had planned, then her unstable soul would be easily torn from her body. From there, Lydia would be free to inject her own consciousness into the hollow shell, gaining all of that power for herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven without her magic Lydia could still manipulate a spell that she had already cast, and as long as the woman remained alive, she would be able to take control of her body by manipulating the seal. This was her last resort. A failsafe that she had set in place in case something ever went wrong during her studies and rendered her powerless. Without magic her dreams of conquering Widowwood would never come to fruition. Lydia had to take precautions to ensure that her magic was never taken away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis woman was her only hope of returning to power. Everything Lydia had worked toward now hinged on the hostage she had captured years ago. There was so much that could go wrong. If someone had somehow located the chamber and killed the girl, all the magic she had absorbed would be lost, and her body would be worthless. And there was also the possibility that she had accumulated too much power and become too great for the seal to contain. The seal on her would weaken the instant that Lydia tried to take control, and if the woman had become powerful enough, she would be able to break free at that exact moment. So many things could make this plan backfire, but it was all that Lydia had left to fall back on. She had no choice now but to open that chamber and take the risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what does Lydia see when she enters the chamber?</span></div></div>",

Today, you're free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...free?\" the prisoner managed, barely able to form the word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in a manner of speaking,\" Lydia chuckled, as she cast the soul reversal spell.

There was a blinding flash of light, an overwhelming sense of disorientation, and then...everything felt...wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, it did to the poor prisoner, who didn't understand how she was now staring at herself. It took a moment for the change to register: her soul had been pulled from its body, and now residing in Lydia's! And that meant...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia began to chuckle softly as she came to her senses, a chuckle that soon escalated into a bone-chilling laughter. It wasn't a sane laugh, either. The feral insanity that had plagued her prisoner due to years of isolation had now infected Lydia's mind and soul when she swapped bodies. But Lydia couldn't care less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis new body had power. So, so much more power than she could have imagined. Her senses were completely overwhelmed by the feeling of godliness she was in command of. Without hesitation, she began to grow, assuming a stature better suited for her new position in life. In mere moments, she outgrew her tower completely, moaning as it fell apart around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her expansion slowed, she looked at the tiny form shivering at her feet. The wretched soul now clad in her old body was muttering something to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no,\" the girl whimpered. \"Let Candy go...Candy wants to go home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Lydia purred, her voice echoing with her new size. \"'Candy'? Was that your name? I never bothered to check. Then again, it's certainly appropriate, because I could just eat you up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even bothering to question this primal insanity, Lydia scooped her old form up without compunction, messily devouring both her old body, and her prisoner's very soul. She smiled as her face shifted to match her original appearance...somewhat. While the giant goddess certainly looked like Lydia, she was a more feral, wild version of herself. This new creature was deadlier than Lydia had ever hoped to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" she whispered, eyes overcome with fury. \"I have two traitors to deal with.\"</span></div></div>",

Sure, if left to her own devices, she was certain to find an alternate means of ousting Amanda from power. But it seemed that her own devices were about to be measured in seconds, and she had no way to stop this copy of Amanda from redecorating the room with her own brain matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes, wincing in anticipation of the blow from this murderous creature...a blow which never came. Lydia looked up, in time to see the shocked clone cry out, having been struck from behind. As Amanda's clone fell to her knees in pain and surprise, Lydia was amazed to see her unlikely savior. It was Alexi, or what she assumed to be a clone of Alexi, who smiled sweetly at Lydia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you,\" she noted calmly. \"I wouldn't let any harm come to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Amanda clone, having recovered her senses, got back to her feet, eyes burning with rage. \"You dare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexi shot her a murderous look. \"Of course I do! You lied to me! Lydia is mine, and you said you wouldn't hurt her! I don't care if you're the original Amanda or not; you'll both pay for this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clone chuckled. \"You're a twit, and so is your original self. I'm clone from a far more powerful woman than you; your little sneak attack is the only victory you'll have. I think I'll enjoy ripping you apart; it'll whet my appetite for wiping out your worthless lover. Stupid, little girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the Amanda clone shot forward with inhuman speed, preparing to murder the younger woman. Her eyes went wide with terror and shock, however, as the Alexi clone easily intercepted her, practically crushing her hands in a vise-like grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one problem, servant girl,\" Alexi sneered. \"I sent my clone with the real Amanda. You're fighting an original.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a single motion, Alexi plunged her hand into the clone's chest, ignoring her screams of terror and pain. She purred slightly as she converted the clone back to its base energies, absorbing them into herself. Without hesitation, she also turned the corpse of the slain mage on the floor, draining what remained of her powers, as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Alexi turned her attention back to Lydia, she was obviously more powerful than she had been moments ago, and Lydia cowered slightly at her cold gaze. However, Alexi's expression softened almost immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's time for that servant girl to learn her place, 'mommy',\" Alexi noted. \"I'll kill her, and take her powers into me. I'll be a god, and you and I will be together, forever.\"</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, as she caught up with her prey, she began to realize that would be easier said than done.

The clone Alexi sent to spy on her 'master' was nowhere to be seen, although a small splotch of red on Amanda's foot hinted at the poor creature's fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexi frowned; at her size, it was impossible to be stealthy. Sure enough, Amanda turned to face her, smiling with satisfaction. She'd deduced from her interrogation of the clone that Alexi would betray her, and was prepared for the possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexi was a foolish, impulsive, hormonal young woman, Amanda thought.

No, her adopted daughter couldn't be so foolish to fall for this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had fun,\" Amanda whispered into Alexi's ear. \"There's no reason we should stop.

As she reached the bottom of the steps and took her first look into the room, she breathed a sigh of relief: The woman she had captured was still there, her body practically glowing from all the magic she had absorbed over the years. Lydia smiled as she saw this, as it was obvious that her power was far greater than that of Amanda. Taking over this woman's body would all but ensure her victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lydia took one step into the room, however, she was hit hard by a wave of pure terror. Lydia looked at her captive in shock and realized just how outmatched she was. She thought of what Amanda had done to her earlier and realized that this woman could do things far worse. If the seal failed and the woman broke free, that was it. Game over. Still, Lydia knew that the chance of things going right far outweighed the risks. If she didn't do this, she would still be a slave to Amanda and her torture would continue. If this worked, however, she could ascend to become the most powerful being on the planet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitating for another moment, Lydia pressed her finger against her captive's forehead and began to execute her plan. This was the moment of truth. Soon the seal would weaken and allow Lydia's soul to pass through into the woman's body. If she was strong enough to break free, she would. It all came down to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the instant that the seal's power weakened, Lydia saw the woman's emotionless face shift into an insane grin. Suddenly a surge of power filled the room, and the seal holding her body helpless shattered. Much as Lydia had feared, her captive's power had become too great. She was now completely uncontrollable, and the years of isolation and imprisonment had warped her mind to insanity. Lydia had created a monster. This woman was the most powerful being on the planet, and she was incapable of rational thought. She was a beast that sought nothing but the joy of destruction, and the entire world was her playground now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that her final plan had failed, Lydia began to run to the exit in hopes of escaping the room. Her plan may have backfired, but if this beast got free and killed Amanda for her, maybe things wouldn't be all bad. Unfortunately, Lydia would never leave this room alive. The woman behind her quickly lept into the air like a ferocious lion and landed directly between Lydia and the door. One look into her heartless eyes froze Lydia in place with terror, and as the woman casually waved her hand, a surge of magic forced Lydia to her knees. Just then, the woman began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Candy remembers you... Hehehahaha, yeah, you! You're the one who put Candy here, aren't you! You took away Candy's life, so now Candy is going to make you suffer lots of pain. Every little bone in your body will go crunch, and Candy is just going to laugh at you as you scream in agony. You're going to die now, oh yes you are. Candy is going to kill you!\" The woman said, the degradation of her mind clear in the way she spoke. Her insanity terrified Lydia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitating, Candy got down on all fours and stalked toward the immobilized Lydia. Her appearance was truly that of a beast now. Over the years her blazing red hair had grown out into an insanely long mane, and her nails had grown into claws. Somehow, however, she still remained incredibly attractive. Not a single speck of dirt was present on her body, and her figure was astounding. It was clear that the magic she absorbed had warped her body just like it had Lydia, Amanda, and Alexi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising one of her clawed fingers, Candy carelessly jabbed the helpless Lydia in the eye. As Lydia cried out in pain, Candy simply laughed and twisted her finger around in Lydia's eye socket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, scream like that! Cry and be miserable! Suffer more for Candy! Be in agony!\" Candy teased cruelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while she removed her finger from Lydia's skull and held it in front of her face. With a crazed smile Candy began to lick the blood off of her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yummy, your blood is really tasty. Candy loves it! But you know what Candy loves more? Candy loves making people suffer like bugs the most! Become a bug for candy, little bug!\" Candy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she said that, a wave of magic hit Lydia and caused her body to shrink. Within moments Lydia was reduced to the size of an insignifficant bug. Looking down at her victim, Candy began to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy, you got super tiny! Now Candy can make you suffer a bunch more! You'll scream and cry and beg for mercy, and then poof! You're gonna die for Candy's amusement! Get ready little bug, because Candy is gonna make you dead soon!\" Candy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what does Candy do with her shrunken Lydia?</span></div></div>",

Her body was paralyzed by Candy's magic, her eye had been gouged out leaving her half blind, and now she had been shrunken down to a mere 3 inches tall. As Candy loomed over her with that insane grin on her face, Lydia began to realize the magnitude of what she had done. She was the one who had created this monstrosity. Much like Amanda before, it was her own magic that had given birth to this uncontrollable beast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, even Amanda's power paled in comparison to the magic that Candy now possessed. Amanda's power was great; she was so powerful now that she could control another's body against their will with a single command. But Candy's magic far surpassed that; with the amount of power she had built up over the years, she was able to warp reality itself with a mere thought. If ever there was a being who could be rightfully called a goddess, she would be it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust laying there in front of her, Lydia could feel the force of Candy's magical power washing over her minuscule form. Simply being in her presence was overwhelming. Power like this was not meant to be possessed by mere mortals. It was clear that Amanda's rise to power had brought out something that she had long kept hidden within herself. If the amount of power she held could warp her personality from meek and subservient to heartless and dominating, then it was no surprise that Candy's mind had been torn apart by the magic she had absorbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n In her current state, Candy was nothing but a mindless beast. Driven by insanity and only satisfied by destruction, she was truly a perfect killing machine. Surely one as powerful as her would be unstoppable. She would ravage the entire planet, leaving nothing but a trail of ruin in her wake. Lydia paled as she began to realize just what she had unleashed upon the world. However, the sound of Candy's terrified her even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Candy is hungry, bug. You're going to be Candy's snack now. Get ready to suffer and die in Candy's belly, little bug!\" Candy said, licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Candy reached down and wrapped her long slender fingers around Lydia's shrunken body. Lifting her captive in front of her face, Candy held Lydia there for a moment and sniffed her before casually tossing her into her mouth. Without a second thought, Candy's tongue threw Lydia to the back of her mouth, and she began to chew her up like the helpless morsel she was. Lydia cried out in agony as he body was mashed to a bloody pulp between Candy's molars. Her flesh was ripped off her bones and her bones were ground into a fine powder. By the time Candy swallowed her mangled remains, Lydia was long dead. With a crazed laugh, Candy wiped her mouth and began to talk to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm, that little bug was really super tasty! Candy wants more! Candy needs more! More pathetic little bugs for Candy to eat!\" Candy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResponding to her desire to taste more human flesh, Candy's body began to grow. Bigger and bigger the mindless woman became, until finally she outgrew the entire tower and her naked body burst free to be seen by the outside world. As she grew her body began to perfect some of the minor flaws that she possessed. Her long untrimmed fingernails were refined into razor sharp claws, and her messy hair began to straighten itself out. Then, in order to better reflect her bestial nature, her canines extended into a pair of piercing fangs and her pupils narrowed to resemble those of a predatory cat. Anyone gazing upon her gargantuan form would say that it was a perfect mixture of beauty and terror. Her bountiful breasts and curvaceous figure would make women the world over go mad with jealousy, but her heartless eyes and terrifying fangs would make even the bravest of men cower in fear of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh, Candy got really big! Now Candy can eat all the little people in the world! Everyone is Candy's snack now! Ahahahahahahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Candy got down on all fours and began running toward the nearest civilization; one that just so happened to be the kingdom of Widowwood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in Widowwood, Amanda and Alexi had grown themselves to equally amazing heights and were wreaking havoc on the powerless kingdom. As they went about their revenge, they were blissfully unaware of the horror that was coming toward them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they realized something was afoot, it was already too late. Out of the blue Candy came, raking her claws across Alexi's chest and leaving her victim with a bloody gash. Alexi cried out in pain and fell to her knees, but Candy wasn't through with her just yet. The crazed woman pounced on top of Alexi's body and sank her fangs into her flesh. Without hesitation Candy tore off a chunk of Alexi's flesh and devoured it, licking the blood off her lips before going in for another bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda could do nothing but watch in sheer terror as her ally was eaten alive right in front of her. She was frozen in fear, something about this woman just made her feel like an insect by comparison. As Candy ripped the last of Alexi's meat from her bones and swallowed it, she turned her gaze to Amanda. Amanda almost fainted from fear in that very instant. The look in her eyes was like nothing she had ever seen before. Candy's body was now covered in the splattered blood of her meal, and she truly did look like a monster at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding upright again and licking some of the blood off of her hand, Candy spoke to Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your friend was a tasty treat. Candy likes tasty treats. Candy wants to eat more, devour more! You... You look nice and tasty too, yes you do. Candy is going to eat you next, yes she is! And then the whole entire world will become Candy's delicious little buffet!\" Candy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, Candy lept toward Amanda with the intent to kill. With amazing speed Amanda dodged out of the way. When Candy landed and realized she had missed her prey, she began to pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hold still! Candy wants to eat you, and Candy can't eat you if Candy can't catch you first! Come on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vile beast! I will never become a meal for a creature as disgusting as you! I am a goddess! I am the one true ruler of this world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For reals? Hmmm... Candy has never eaten a goddess before... Oh well! Now is as good a time as any to try!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Candy lunged at Amanda, and once again Amanda dodged. Unfortunately for her, she didn't escape unscathed this time. Candy's claws had grazed her arm as she jumped to the side, leaving her with a bloody gash on her shoulder. Clutching her shoulder in pain, Amanda quickly began to think of how to react. After a moment of thought...</span></div></div>",

This wasn't something that she would take lying down. She needed revenge. She would beat this beast of a woman into submission and have her beg for mercy. However, in the back of her mind, Amanda knew that a straight up fight was not the way to go here. It was obvious that her assailant wasn't exactly right in the head. However powerful her body was, it was clear that her mind was weak. The smartest course of action would be to attack Candy, not through her body, but through her mind. Not only would there likely be much less resistance on that front, but if she invaded her mind, Amanda could reprogram Candy into a loyal slave to replace Alexi. Everything told her that this was the smarter course of action, but in her rage-blinded state, would Amanda actually realize that in time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Amanda decide to do?</span></div></div>",

But at this point, Amanda was just pissed. This savage had the unmitigated GALL to challenge  her? Amanda was a goddess, and she was going to put this stupid animal in her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what hovel you crawled out of, and I don't care,\" Amanda snarled, charging black energy in her palms. \"You've made your last mistake, creature. This world, and all within it, belongs to me, and you'll burn for your insolence!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandy was briefly distracted by the energy Amanda harnessed, idly enjoying the pretty lights it gave off. After a moment's distraction, however, she processed Amanda's threats. Her only response was an insane giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis irreverence in the face of her threats only angered Amanda further; she practically snarled as she unleashed a volley of energy, clearly intending to fry her foe into oblivion. The kingdom of Widowwood was completely erased in the crossfire, its people dying out before they even had a chance to process what was happening. There was a blinding flash, and when Amanda's vision cleared, Candy was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess smirked in satisfaction, which lasted for about two seconds before she felt Candy's hot breath against the back of her neck. \"Too slow,\" the feral titan practically sang, before brutally shoving Amanda forward. Amanda cried out in surprise, trying to turn and fire another attack. It was too late, though; Candy pinned her without trouble, holding her captive's hands into the smoldering ash that had been a kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda continued to struggle, but she already realized it was futile. Candy was simply too strong to fight physically, and with a sinking sense of terror, Amanda was beginning to realize that this creature's magic far outstripped her own, as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Candy, though, this was all merely a delightful game; she knew full well she was in no danger of harm. She nuzzled Amanda's neck, inhaling her prey's scent deeply. \"Hrmm,\" she purred, closing her eyes. \"You smell good, pretty one. Like power, and fear...do you fear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda sneered up at her, defiant at all costs. \"You...you're just an animal! You're nothing compared to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why are you on the ground, pretty one? In the dirt, like the little ones. But you're not little, are you? You're my size. Maybe I won't eat you, after all. Maybe I can do something more fun. Do you want to have fun, pretty one? It's been so, so long since I've had any fun...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an errant swipe of her claws, Candy sliced Amanda's top open, exposing her pendulous breasts to the world. Amanda cried out in outrage and protest, which only elicited another giggle from the beast woman currently mounting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're so pretty, my pretty one. Yes yes, we'll have fun. And if you play nice, you get to live. If you don't...\" She let the threat trail off, giggling again at whatever horrors she was planning...</span></div></div>",

Complying with Candy's perverse desires couldn't be that bad, could it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As...as you wish,\" Amanda whispered, seeing the aroused eyes of her rival dilate in pleasure. \"We'll have fun...however you like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh,\" Candy whispered, voice husky. \"Good choice, Pretty One...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the beast went to her work. There was no foreplay, no games, nothing even remotely sensual or romantic. Rather, Candy simply began rutting her captive obscenely, grinding into her like an animal, again and again. Amanda cried out in surprise and protest, but it was drowned out by the dominant giantess's grunts of satisfaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda tried to pull free, only to be struck by the animal on top of her. \"More,\" Candy practically roared, working herself into a sexual fury. \"Want...more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes, Candy roared again, signaling her climax. She collapsed on the terrified Amanda, who was by now practically senseless from the intensity of the attack. For a few, blessed moments, Candy was still, breathing deeply. </span></div></div>",

Candy simply laughed as she got to her feet as well, the insane smile never leaving her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, you're a feisty one. Candy is gonna have to punish you, naughty girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will do no such thing!\" Amanda yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn desperation, Amanda focused everything she had left into a single orb of magic and hurled it at her deranged opponent. Candy simply stared at the orb, distracted by its radiant glow, and allowed it to collide with her body. On contact the orb burst into a massive explosion so powerful that it made Amanda's previous volley of magic look like a mere firecracker in comparison. The entire area was razed by flames, the destruction of the blast spreading out for miles in all directions. Seeing the devastation she had caused to the environment around her, Amanda smirked victoriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh... Hahahahaha! That's it! Game over! There's no way that beast could have survived through that! She couldn't possibly have-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda's gloating stopped cold as the smoke from the explosion cleared, and she saw something that sent chills down her spine. Standing there in the epicenter of the blast was Candy. Her skin was blackened by a layer of ash from the explosion, but otherwise she was completely unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, that kinda tickled. Oooh, and Candy is all dirty now too. You made Candy dirty, you naughty girl.\" Candy said, giggling to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no... NO! That's not possible! You should be dead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, Candy is sorry... But Candy can't be dead because Candy is stronger than death. Candy makes everything else dead. Nothing makes Candy dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-this can't be real... No, there's no way this can be really happening! This is just a nightmare, it can't be reality! There's just no way!\" Amanda cried, freaking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A nightmare? Candy can make a nightmare for you, pretty one. Watch this!\" Candy said playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, much to Amanda's horror, Candy began to glow. Her body was surrounded with light, and then suddenly her form began to expand outward at an alarming pace. Within seconds she had doubled in size, and she was showing no signs of slowing down. In minutes her knees had reached Amanda's height. Eventually her growth slowed to a stop, and Amanda was barely taller than the psychotic girl's ankle. The light faded away from Candy's body, and she quickly got down on all fours and lowered her head to get a closer look at Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe, you look really tiny from up here. Candy used to be tiny like you, but now Candy is really really big. Candy is the biggest ever now! So pretty one, is this a good nightmare fore you?\" Candy said, opening her mouth to allow Amanda to gaze into the gaping cavern in horror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked up at the giggling colossus looming above her, Amanda finally faced the facts. She had lost. Candy was simply too powerful to defeat. She knew that she would die if she remained here any longer. If she had any magic left in her she would have opened a portal and fled into another world, but unfortunately she had already exhausted all of her power in her final attack. Now she was helpless, unable to escape or do anything to resist as Candy had her way with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she realized it, Amanda found her body surrounded by the long slender fingers of Candy's enormous hand. She could do nothing but tremble in fear as she awaited her inevitable fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what does Candy do with Amanda now?</span></div></div>",

She knew all too well that it was hopeless to resist any further. She had used all of her strength and failed to even put a scratch on Candy's flawless skin. Even with every single shred of power in her body being unleashed at once, the most she was able to do was cover that skin in a thin layer of ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe environment for miles around them was reduced to a barren and lifeless wasteland, yet Candy still stood unharmed in the epicenter of the destruction. It was clear that she had become all but invincible by now. Her power was beyond comparison, and it would only continue to grow ever greater as she devoured more lives. The world was nothing to her now. Nothing but a helpless little morsel for her to consume and use to fuel her infinite power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Candy had now goals, no reasons for doing what she did. She was merely acting on her base instincts; the need to feed, the subconscious desire to improve herself further, and the intense sense of arousal that she got from exerting her control over all those helpless little insects beneath her. These were the only things that drove her. Her mind, long since destroyed by her own uncontrollable power, was ruled by these base instincts. Incapable of logical thought, she was little more than a savage animal now. A savage animal that held the fate of the entire world in the palm of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding Amanda in front of her face, Candy licked her lips and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha... Oh, my pretty little toy... You look so yummy. Candy really wants to eat you, but Candy still has to punish you for making Candy dirty. Candy is going to make the pretty little toy suffer! You're going to scream, cry out in pain, beg for mercy! But Candy won't give you any mercy, little toy. Candy is going to torture you until you break! And then, once Candy is done playing with you, Candy is going to eat you and chew you up like the tasty little snack that you are! Your tiny little body will become fuel for Candy; you'll make Candy more powerful, more sexier, more of a goddess than ever before! Don't you like the sound of that, pretty one? Doesn't that sound like fun?\" Candy said, an insane grin spread across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do your worst, beast... If I'm to die here, then I will accept my fate with dignity...\" Amanda said emotionlessly, having seen her inevitable fate and resigned herself to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, that's no fun... Candy wants to hear the pretty dolly beg for mercy! Come on, dolly, squeal in agony. Beg Candy to kill you and end your suffering quickly!\" Candy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Amanda knew what was happening, Candy reached down with her free hand and pinched her left leg between her thumb and index finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scream for Candy now!\" Candy yelled as she gave a sharp twist and snapped Amanda's leg in two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda was filled with an unbelievable surge of pain. She wanted desperately to cry out, but her mind wouldn't let her give this beast that satisfaction. Frowning at her stubbornness, Candy growled and gave Amanda's leg another twist. Still not getting the reaction she wanted, Candy pinched tighter on the mangled limb before giving a harsh tug and ripping it straight from Amanda's body. As blood began to gush from the gaping wound where her leg once was, Amanda was unable to resist the pain any longer. It was too much for her to take, and before she knew it she was screaming out at the top of her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, yes! That's the sound! That's the sound Candy wanted to hear! The sound of a pathetic little toy like you suffering, the true agony you're going through right now... Ohhh, it's music to Candy's ears! Candy wants to hear more... Scream more for Candy, little one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitating, Candy pinched her fingers around Amanda's other leg. This time, however, rather than snapping the limb and tearing it off, Candy simply tightened her squeeze until Amanda's leg was crushed into a fine paste by the intense pressure. Blood squirted out from between Candy's fingers as her captive's limb popped like a grape. Once again Amanda screamed, and once again Candy laughed at her suffering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Suffer more! Suffer more for Candy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandy moved her fingers to grip Amanda's left arm before twisting it and twisting it until it popped off in her grip. Candy laughed and tossed the severed limb into her mouth, chewing it up before licking the blood off of her fingers. Ignoring Amanda's screams of pain, Candy moved on to the final limb. Gripping Amanda's right arm between her fingers, she began to slowly pull on it until she heard the sound of the shoulder popping out of place. Candy continued to pull, slowly ripping the limb from Amanda's bloodstained body. Soon the skin around her shoulder began to tear, revealing the muscles that were straining to keep the arm attached to Amanda's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHHHHHH!!! Please, stop it! Please! Make it stop! Just kill me! KILL ME NOW! PLEASE!! I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!!!\" Amanda pleaded, growing desperate for the sweet embrace of death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandy simply giggled and continued her slow and drawn out torture process. Soon Amand's muscles reached their limit and, unable to be stretched any further, tore apart as the arm they were connected to was ripped from her body. Candy laughed to herself as she held the tiny arm between her thumb and index finger. With a mischievous smirk, Candy pulled back and tossed the arm off into the distance. Somewhere, miles away, the severed arm of a giantess came crashing down onto an unsuspecting village, crushing all that was caught beneath it into oblivion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fun, little dolly! Candy had lots of fun torturing you! Candy made you suffer lots and lots, and your screams were so very good! Candy wishes that she could play with you like this forever and ever, but sadly you don't seem to have much left of you to play with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please... Just kill me now... Finish me off... I'm... Begging... You...\" Amanda pleaded, her voice worn out from all of her screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Finally, the merciful embrace of death was taking her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking her lips, Candy eyed the near-lifeless Amanda who was skewered on her fingernail.

Her expanding form grew larger and larger by the second, and soon she became so massive that the earth's gravity was no longer able to hold her down. Floating off into space and free of all obstacles, Candy's growth accelerated further. She gained miles of height with each passing moment, and she showed no signs of stopping any time soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, Candy's growth finally slowed to a stop. By the end, the very planet she once stood on measured up as no larger than a gumball to her. As the colossal Candy leaned in and smiled at the earth, people worldwide were able to look up and be pierced with terror by the sight of the immeasurably large female head that now occupied their entire sky. She was beautiful beyond comparison, but the sheer overwhelming size of the girl made her more terrifying than even the most vile of monsters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandy giggled as she saw how small the world was to her now. Then, to the horror of everyone on the planet, Candy began to open her gaping mouth and reveal her pure white teeth. Several strands of saliva dripped inside her mouth, and her warm breath washed over the entire world. Moving her head forward, Candy positioned herself so that the earth was rested gently on the tip of her tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitating a moment longer, Candy began to curl her tongue and pull the puny planet into her gaping maw. When the planet entered her mouth, she slammed her teeth shut, sealing the earth within the moist cavern that was her mouth. She then used her tongue to push the globe over between her teeth and began to bite down. Chewing slowly to savor the flavor for as long as possible, Candy devoured the entire world like it was nothing but a snack to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she finished chewing, Candy swallowed the chunks of earth and let them flow down her throat into her awaiting stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, delicious planet is super tasty! Candy wants more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, as the remains of earth entered her stomach and melted away, something clicked inside Candy's mind. As she digested the planet and all of its inhabitants, Candy unknowingly absorbed not only all of their magical power, but also all of their knowledge as well. The collective knowledge of the now extinct human race flowed into her brain, and Candy's once insane persona was transformed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly her mind was capable of thought once more, and one thought stood at the forefront of her mind: that she was a goddess now. Candy had all the power and intelligence of the entire human race within her, all being magnified exponentially by the dark magic that she had been imbued with by Lydia all those years ago. She was now all-powerful. Her will could warp the very fabric of reality, molding the entire universe to satisfy her every whim. A broad smile spread across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am no longer the pathetic beast that I once was. With this power, this knowledge, I have become nothing short of a true goddess! And as a goddess, I think it's only fitting that I cast aside my mortal title 'Candy' in exchange for a much more divine name. From this moment forward, I shall be known as Belleria, Controller of Worlds! Soon all beings across the universe will learn to bow down and worship my divine image!\" the newly-renamed Belleria said with an imposing laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelleria then paused for a moment to think about what to do first.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Quickly slinking off into the forest, Sari made her way to a small cave. Standing in the mouth of the cave, Sari whistled loudly and then waited. Several moments of silence passed, but then a sudden roar echoed through the cave. Slowly a massive figure crawled out of the cave toward Sari. At first its form was obscured from view by the darkness of the cave, but as it got closer to Sari its appearance became more and more clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Sari stepped backward and the beast exited the cave. Stepping out into the light, its appearance was now clearly visible. Standing before Sari was an enormous dragon, coated in a layer of beautiful purple scales. Sari smiled devilishly as she gazed up at the dragon. Any onlookers would have thought Sari insane for standing so calmly before such a tremendous creature, but Sari knew something about the dragon that they didn't. Around its neck was a beautiful golden collar, embedded with all types of priceless gemstones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the malicious smile still fresh on her face, Sari pointed down to her feet. Slowly the lumbering beast craned its neck down and lowered its head to the ground, as though bowing down and submitting itself to the young girl who stood before it. Seeing the beast submitting itself to her will, Sari grinned and began to pet the dragon's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl. I've raised you very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, master...\" The dragon spoke in a fairly deep, but still somewhat feminine, tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, my pet. Now, lets get this nasty little thing off of your neck, shall we?\" Sari said as she reached around and placed her hand on the dragon's collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the glow of her magic flowing into it, the collar opened and fell to the ground. The instant that the collar was removed, the dragon began to change. It stood up and rose to balance on its hind legs, while its forelegs morphed into a pair of arms. From its chest a pair of mountainous breasts appeared. Its long neck became much shorter and its face started taking on a much more humanlike appearance. Slowly but surely, its entire body began to shift from that of a ferocious firebreathing dragon to that of an incredibly beautiful female woman. When the transformation was complete, the dragon had become a figure of feminine perfection. She possessed curves that would make even the most gorgeous of women cry out in jealousy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was very clear that she was not a normal human woman. Throughout the transformation many of her dragonic traits were interpreted into her new design. Her skin was still coated in the same vibrant purple scales as before. Her fangs could be seen peaking out from the corners of her mouth, and her massive wings still adorned her back. Her long tail still swung behind her, and her nails took the form of razorsharp claws. Most obvious, however, was the sheer size difference between her and an ordinary human. She had maintained the enormous stature of her dragon form, even adding to its height by standing on two legs, and towered over the pathetic Sari as though she were a mere doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you've come a long way in your transformation, Maria. Ah, how I remember those days long past when you could barely even stand on two legs. Now look at you, you've become the perfect embodiment of all the best parts from both humans and dragons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your praise is much appreciated, master, but I would never have been able to reach this stage if not for your care. This wondrous body is nothing but a symbol of your talent as both a mage and as my caretaker.\" the dragoness said, now with a much more feminine voice than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you are correct. I raised you from birth with but a single purpose in mind. You were created solely to aid me in my mission to destroy Lydia and assert my rightful position as her superior. However, you are also my precious pet. I care deeply for you and seeing you in such a state of perfection shows only reminds me of how far you're grown since that day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, master. I am eternally grateful for everything you have done for me over these many long years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari smiled warmly as she looked up at her pet, her greatest masterpiece, her secret weapon. The memories of the day they met flooded back to her as she looked at Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral years ago, not long after she had run away from home and met Lydia, Sari had found a large egg abandoned in the middle of the forest. At the time Sari was out searching for potion ingredients to bring back to her master, and she assumed that whatever laid the egg would surely come back for it. Ignoring the egg, Sari wandered through the woods until she finally returned home. The next day, however, she wandered into the forest alone to do some magic training and found that the egg was still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, the young Sari reached out and pressed her hand against the shell of the egg. As soon as she touched it, her hand began to glow and the egg cracked. Before she knew what what going on, Sari saw a tiny scaly head popping out from the top of the egg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama...?\" The little baby dragon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill confused by what had just happened, Sari grabbed the small winged lizard and held it in front of her face. Without warning the dragon extended its forked tongue and licked Sari's face. In shock Sari dropped the dragon and ran back to her home. She completely ignore the dragon's cries as she ran. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Sari returned to that clearing once more to train. She looked around quickly to make sure that nobody was nearby, and then began chanting several spells from memory. Suddenly, something slammed into her from behind, knocking Sari down and startling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama! Mama!\" the baby dragon said excitedly as it sat on Sari's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up, Sari dusted herself off and looked down at her pintsized assailant. The little dragon simply smiled up at her and wagged its tail. The sight was so cute that it won Sari over, and she decided to keep the little dragon as a pet. Over the years, the dragon known as Maria began to grow larger, and Sari became increasingly resentful toward her master Lydia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sari's hatred for Lydia finally peaked, she started to treat Maria less as a beloved pet and more as a tool with which to exact her revenge. On Sari's orders Maria flew from village to village, devouring their citizens and using the power of a spell Sari cast to absorb their life force into her own. Hundreds of innocent civilians were sacrificed to fuel Maria's growth, and the more humans she ate, the more humanlike she became. Eventually Sari had to use a magical collar to reverse the transformation so that Maria could continue following out her orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter what she was made to do, Maria always remained loyal to the girl who raised her. She knew all along that she belonged to Sari, so rather she was treated as a pet or a weapon was of no consequence to her. Her only wish was to see her beloved master happy. And she would do anything and everything within her power to make that happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Maria's calm voice happened to interrupt Sari's flashback of ages gone by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So master, tell me. What  have you summoned me for today? Is there something that you desire of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my beloved pet, there is. There seems to be some trouble going on back home, and I need you to sort it out. This will be your first real mission, Maria. Do not let me down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes master.\" Maria said as she reached down and scooped Sari off the ground. \"So tell me master... Where is it that you wish for me to go?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari contemplated for a moment. On one hand she wasn't sure if even Maria was a match for the newly empowered Amanda. She thought it would be a good idea to take her pet and feed her one more time to power her up for this battle. On the other hand, every moment she waited was a moment that Amanda could be becoming ever stronger herself. If she did  take the time to do this, there was a chance that Amanda would have become too powerful to be stopped by the time she returned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, Amanda was a major threat. How will Sari deal with this issue?</span></div></div>",

She felt relatively certain that Maria would be able to deal with Amanda. So clouded was Sari's judgment, she barely considered the possibility that her loyal pet may be injured in the process. It didn't matter. Those types of soft emotions were long dead within the mage, if they were ever there to begin with. True, if she held any warmth in her heart at all, she certainly held some for Maria. But Sari being warm in any capacity was a dicey proposition, at best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria didn't care. Being a dragon, her conception of 'love' and loyalty were a bit more subdued than a human being's. She'd imprinted on Sari, and that was all there was to it. Sari had raised her, made her terrifyingly powerful, and could do with her as she pleased. The fact that Maria held her supposed 'master' in the palm of her hand was irrelevant. She was completely devoted to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her great size and fast flight, Maria arrived at Lydia's tower in mere moments, easily twice the height of the shadowy structure. Sari gestured, and the great dragoness ripped the roof right off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Amanda had Lydia tied to the bed, and was sitting on her captive's face, rutting obscenely and moaning loudly. Any shock she might have had at the nude dragon woman standing over her tower was quickly consumed by irritation at her game being interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this, then?\" she allowed, sliding off of her unwilling lover. Lydia coughed and thrashed mightily, to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever plans you have, servant, end now,\" Sari declared coldly. \"Maria will feed on your bones. Surrender is your only option.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSizing up Maria, Amanda considered this.</span></div></div>",

Must you mindlessly follow that girl's orders?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is my master. She raised me from the day I was born, and I owe my life to her. Even if she ordered me to kill myself right here and now, I would not hesitate to do it if it would please her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Amanda realized that trying to sway the dragoness may not be possible. It was clear that Maria was fiercely loyal to Sari. Still, she wanted to avoid a fight if at all possible. She knew she had enough power to at least match the dragoness in battle, if not surpass her, but she simply wasn't in the mood for conflict right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amanda thought about what to do, two choices came to mind. She could either continue to try and persuade the dragoness to turn on its master, or she could turn her attention to Sari and convince her to call off her pet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda was almost certain that she could convince Maria betray Sari if she used her magic words, but dragons were highly resistant against magic, so it would take far greater effort to manipulate Maria than it did to take control of pathetic Lydia's body. The most her magic could do would be to plant the seeds of doubt in Maria's mind, make her question her loyalty to Sari. By no means did that guarantee she would betray her, and even then there was no telling rather or not she would join forces with Amanda afterward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking that into account, it would probably be much easier to simply manipulate Sari's mind directly. The two had much in common, from their hatred of Widowwood to their desire to see Lydia suffer.

My only grudges are against that vile kingdom of Widowwood, and this heartless little wench right here.\" Amanda said, pointing to the still-paralyzed Lydia laying on the bed next to her. She then continued to speak. \"From what I understand, you too hold a deep rooted hatred for both of these things. We have much in common, girl. Why should we fight when we can join forces and exact our vengeance together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My master need not concern herself with the words of one fated to die. Remain silent and accept your fate like the vermin you are!\" Maria said angrily as she began to lower her foot toward Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maria, stop!\" Sari commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly the dragoness's looming sole froze in position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But master, is it not your wish that I exterminate this woman?\" Maria asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but hold on a moment. Her words intrigue me, and I desire to hear her out. Remain at the ready, though. If her proposition fails to please me, then I'll be needing you to finish her off for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish, master.\" Maria said, lifting her foot back up but keeping it hovering over Lydia's tower in anticipation of her master giving the order to kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, servant, what exactly do you mean when you say we could join forces?\" Sari asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is as I said, child. I have turned the tables on our 'master' Lydia. She is now my helpless slave, and I've drained every drop of magic that her pitiful body possessed. As you can imagine, I have become quite powerful as a result. What's more is that I have discovered a way to gain even greater power: when my pitiful slave Lydia made me climax, my power became amplified to even greater levels. By having her pleasure me I can both satisfy my desire to abuse her and increase my own power at the same time.\" Amanda said, reaching down to rub between her legs. The simple act of describing how she had dominated Lydia and made her her bitch was turning her on immensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting... So what you're saying is that you've turned that woman into a living power source?\" Sari said as she also rubbed between her legs. She too was getting aroused by hearing what Amanda had done to her foolish 'master'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. I possess what is essentially a limitless supply of power, and I am willing to share it with you. You and I both desire to bring ruin to the kingdom of Widowwood, and we both wish to see Lydia writhing in agony at our mercy. Join me, and we can share both of those pleasures. So, what say you Sari? Will you join me and rule the world by my side?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari took a moment to consider her options. On one hand, she hated sharing and would love to kill Amanda and take all that power for herself. On the other hand, if what Amanda said was true, she may have already become too powerful for Maria to defeat. It would be a great risk to attack her right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter mulling it over for a few seconds, Sari spoke up again to give Amanda her answer.</span></div></div>",

Her sole plowed through floor after floor of the tower until it crashed into the ground below.

She had to admit, the sheer, ruthless animal power her servant held was a bit..enticing. Still, best to remained focused. Without paying any heed to Lydia's immobilized body, Sari began to chant, pulling life energy from Amanda's liquid remains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was hers,\" she breathed, even as the dark magic flowed through her. \"Will now be mine. Her magic, her strength, and even her slave. I am going to enjoy rending your pathetic form, 'master'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral yards away, Lydia was incapable of answering. Or moving. She was close to death, and it was only the magic that Amanda, and now Sari, used to bind her, which was keeping her alive. It hardly mattered to her, now. One insane tormenter was the same as the other. Such was the threat of working in dark magic; all of your allies would turn on you at a moment's notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sari's spell neared its completion, she felt herself growing more and more excited. The power! So much more than she'd ever dreamed! She didn't need Maria to act as her enforcer any longer. No, she could now destroy anything in her way, with her own two hands! The cruel, twisted young girl was going to rip reality apart to satisfy her depraved urges, and Lydia would be the first of many souls to be torn asunder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I need...something,\" Sari moaned, voice husky. Although not a chaste woman, she was still a virgin by circumstance, and hardly used to these incredibly intense passions that were now stirring within her.

Yes, she would do this thing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm better than 'well', loyal Maria,\" she whispered, starting to glow a pale violet. \"Lovely Maria. You've done all I've ever asked you. Have I ever showed my appreciation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria seemed a bit put off by her master's odd behavior. This...this was a bit unprecedented. \"It's not necessary,\" she allowed. \"I belong to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do,\" Sari agreed. \"Which means I can do as I like with you. And I want to do this, now.\" With that, Sari began to enlarge, growing taller and stronger with astonishing speed. Maria was struck silent by the sight, never guessing her owner had such power. Or perhaps she had gained it from the slain servant girl? Regardless, the dragon woman felt a pang of regret; with such power, would Sari still require her aid? What use could she possibly serve?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari moaned in appreciation as she continued to climb higher into the sky, taking a moment to look down at the still-prone Lydia on the forest floor. Lydia's stark terror was obvious, and Sari savored it. She gave her former teacher a simple, haunting look that clearly said, 'your time will come'. But for now, Sari had other plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer growth slowed when she was Maria's size; actually, she was a half-head taller than her pet, which made for an odd sight. Maria actually cowered slightly; she had never met another creature that even came close to her mighty height, and combined with her master's odd behavior...she was actually quite nervous. Sari smiled at her, placing a hand gently on the side of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to be afraid, my little girl,\" she whispered, eyes clouded with lust. \"This is going to be wonderful.\" Without another word, she pulled Maria towards her in a passionate embrace, kissing the dragon woman with absolute abandon. </span></div></div>",

However, as her master's lips pressed against her own, she began to realize just how much she loved her. She had never been willing to admit it to herself until now. After all, what kind of pet would ever come to lust for its own master? It simply didn't make sense to her. But now that Sari was the one taking the initiative, Maria began to accept her true feelings. After a few moments Sari broke their kiss and gazed into her pet's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Maria, please tell me... Are you still scared?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N... No master, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was interrupted as Sari placed a finger over her lips to silence her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no... My dear Maria, you can't call me master anymore. You are no longer my pet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria felt her heart stop for a moment. Was it really true? Now that her master had all this power, she was no longer needed. Was she really going to be discarded like an old tool that had outlived its usefulness?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Does that mean that you no longer need me, master? Am I unnecessary?\" Maria asked sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, my precious Maria. You mean more to me than anything in the world! You have remained loyal to me for all these years. Always following my orders, never questioning my judgement. I'm certain that there were times when you wondered if what you were doing was really right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, master... I never doubted you. You were my everything. As long as it pleased you I didn't care what you asked of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... And that is why I think it's about time that I start treating you with the respect that you so rightfully deserve. No longer will we be separated by the boundaries of master and pet. Your love for me transcended those boundaries, and now I shall return the favor. From this day forward, the two of us will rule the world side by side. Not as a pet and her master, but as equals. As lovers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh master!\" Maria cried, tears of joy streaming down her cheeks as she wrapped her arms around Sari's massive form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Maria, what did I just tell you. I am no longer your master, nor are you my pet. We now stand on equal ground, so it is only fitting that we address eachother the way that lovers should. Please, from now on, simply call me Sari.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...If that is what you wish, Sari.\" Maria said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria then surprised Sari by shoving her to the ground and climbing on top of her, rubbing her body vigorously against her former master's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, Maria! I never would've guessed that you were such a naughty girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, you have no idea how long I've wanted to do this with you, Sari! Every day that we spent together it took all of my effort to restrain these desires.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, you poor thing... That must have been terrible for you... Having the object of your affection standing right in front of you every day but not being able to do anything with her... Well don't worry, Maria. From this day forward you will be able to embrace those wild desires of yours! Don't hold anything back anymore! I am yours now, and you are mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Sari! Thank you so much!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take me, Maria! Take me now and make me yours forever more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two titanic lovers started to engage in passionate sex that all but flattened everything around them. In the end the only thing that remained was Lydia, who was horribly wounded and only kept alive by the magic that was placed on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... Was... Amazing... Maria...\" Sari said, panting from exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... Glad... That... I was... Able to... Please you...

They're lesser creatures. Insects. The two of us are far beyond them. They should fear our movements, and work for our favor. We're...we're the dominant predators, Sari.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari considered this; it certainly held appeal. \"You..I'm not a dragon, like you,\" she allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no other dragon like me,\" Maria purred. \"You saw to that.

The dragoness may have been the one who attacked her, but she would never have done it had it not been for Sari giving her the order to do so. With her eyes locked on Sari and a devilish smirk on her face, Amanda slowly walked toward her prey. Sari was terrified. Amanda was more powerful than anything she could have imagined, and now she was the one being targeted by her. On instinct she turned around and attempted to flee, but Amanda wasn't about to let her escape that easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freeze!\" Amanda ordered, using the same magical words that she had used to paralyze Lydia before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly Sari's body was immobilized, any hopes of escaping wrenched away from her with a single word. The magic carried by Amanda's voice easily overpowered her, leaving the poor girl completely helpless. Amanda took her time as she approached the immobile girl before her. She wanted to soak in every second of the pitiful brat's terror as she watched her terrible fate draw ever closer with each passing moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari was scared out of her mind. She had never felt such helplessness before. This feeling of being able to see your doom walking right toward you and being completely incapable of doing anything to resist. Being unable to even raise a finger to protect herself. Amanda was a monster, a demon, her power was something that no human could ever possess. Now that devil of a woman had set her sights on Sari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst part of it all was that this whole situation was her own fault. She was too prideful, too greedy. Amanda had offered her a chance to rule the world by her side, and she had foolishly betrayed her with the intention of taking all that power for herself. Had she simply accepted that act of good will when she had the chance, she would have been able to become a goddess just as powerful as the one who was walking toward her. Such an amazing opportunity had been held right in front of her face, but she was stupid enough to through it all away! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs all these thoughts flashed through her mind, tears started to stream down Sari's face. She couldn't do anything. Amanda was about to make her suffer for her insolence, and there wasn't a single thing she could do to stop her. Soon Amanda reached Sari, and with a light tap to her forehead, she knocked her paralyzed form to the ground. Amanda then planted her feet to the sides of Sari's head and began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foolish little girl, what exactly were you thinking when you decided to deny my offer? What kind of pitiful thoughts were running through that feeble mind of yours? I already told you that I had attained limitless power. Did you really think that an overgrown lizard would be able to stop me? Hahaha, oh, big mistake child. I am invincible. I can do anything I want whenever I want. You were incredibly stupid to get on my bad side, girl. Now you have to face the consequences.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda then lowered herself down and pressed her crotch against Sari's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As punishment for irritating your goddess, you will have to pleasure me. Now, start licking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearing for her life, Sari obeyed Amanda's command. She extended her tongue and drove it into Amanda's pussy. She put everything she had into pleasuring the woman on top of her, knowing that if she failed to satisfy her she would surely die. Sari began to cry once again from the humiliation of her current position. Maria, who was just recovering from being tossed aside like a rag doll by Amanda, quickly noticed what was going on. Seeing her master suffering like this enraged her, and she quickly jumped to try and save her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get your filthy body off of my master, you bitch!\" The dragoness yelled as she dove toward Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I think I should show you just how helpless you really are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda then conjured up several rings of magic that wrapped around Maria's body, binding her in place. Try as she might, Maria was unable to break free of her bindings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?! Release me at once!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? And why should I do that?

You? Crush me? You're no bigger than my foot! How exactly do you think you can crush me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, my stupid little reptile. If you're too big for me to crush, then I'll just have to make you smaller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda then formed a ball of energy in her hand and tossed it at Maria. The orb melted into the dragoness's chest, and quickly Maria began to feel its effects. Her body was getting smaller. Rapidly her once enormous form began to dwindle away until soon she was reduced to the same pathetic stature that Amanda had been compared to her. It was a complete role reversal within a matter of seconds. Maria, so used to towering over everything around her, quickly panicked as she found her size advantage taken away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, she noticed that the magical rings that kept her bound and helpless moments ago had faded away. Maria tried to fly away and escape, but her path was cut off as a massive foot slammed down in front of her. Not knowing what to do, Maria crashed into the giantess's leg and slid down to the ground. Instantly the foot lifted up again, only to adjust its position and slam down on top of Maria herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness cried out in agony as Amanda's soft foot flesh engulfed her minuscule form. She could feel her own bones cracking under the pressure. The pain was quickly becoming unbearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well... Looks like the shoe is on the other foot this time, huh? Remember when you had me in this exact same position? Well, I was able to handle it a lot better than you are... I hope you realize now just how much better I am than you. I can do anything I want and you can't stop me. Now, let's get your pitiful master over here so she can watch as her precious little pet goes splat beneath my sole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda then snapped her fingers, and Sari got to her feet. Against her will she walked toward the horrid woman who was standing atop her beloved pet and kneeled down to get an up close view. Sari couldn't believe how cruel Amanda was. Maria was the only thing in the world that Sari could possibly call a friend, the only one who she cared about at all, and Amanda was about to kill her right before her very eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe... Looks like this is the end for me, master... I'm sorry I couldn't be more useful to you... I did my best though... No matter what happens to me, remember that I'll always love you... Master, you are my everything...\" Maria struggled to say as she strained for breath beneath Amanda's sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, isn't that touching! You're puny pet lizard really loves you! Well, I hope you enjoyed seeing eachother one last time, because this pathetic excuse for a reptile is gonna go squash now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amanda was about to increase her pressure and end Maria's life then and there, Sari grabbed onto her leg and began to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Please... Please Amanda, don't do this! Maria is innocent, she only followed my orders and did as I told her to! I'm the one at fault! Please, don't kill her! Do whatever you want to me, just don't kill Maria! She's my only friend, the only one I care about! Kill me if you want but please spare her!\" Sari pleaded desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari's pleas made Amanda laugh. To think that the once-prideful girl would go to such lengths just to save a pitiful little dragon! Well, this was certainly an interesting turn of events. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will Amanda do now?</span></div></div>",

Sari continued to cry and beg for mercy, doing anything she could to save Maria from the wrath of this demon servant girl, but she was just as powerless as Maria was. Amanda prolonged their suffering for as long as she could before finally her foot pressed into the ground, crushing Maria into a fine paste under her sole.

That heartless woman had just stolen the one thing in the world that she cared about. Rage filled Sari's mind as she glared at Amanda, who now stood there laughing maniacally as she sadistically ground her foot into the mangled remains of Sari's precious friend. Seeing this made something inside Sari snap. Amanda had crossed the line. What she did was unforgivable. She had to pay for what she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Sari... Can you hear my voice, master?\"</i> a mysterious voice echoed in Sari's ear, grabbing her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maria?! Is that you?! Where are you?!\" Sari said quietly so that Amanda wouldn't hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm sorry Master Sari, I couldn't fulfill my duty... I wasn't able to protect you...\"<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\"I don't care about that, Maria! You did everything that you could! Now please, tell me where you are!\"<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\"I am no longer with you, Sari... My life has been extinguished...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... You mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm afraid so... The voice you are hearing right now is merely my spirit communicating with you from beyond. I may no longer be able to stand by your side, but I would sooner burn in the fiery pits of hell than let that witch make you suffer any further!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, Maria?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"My body is gone, Sari, but a part of it still exists in your world. Do you remember that day that I bit you on the arm?\"<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\"\"I do... Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"At that time, I injected a bit of my own blood into your body. I knew that there would be a time when you would need great power, and I wouldn't be there to assist you. By injecting you with my blood I granted you a fragment of my own power. Over the years that power has grown along with your own, and now is the time for you to finally awaken it. On my own I was not able to defeat that woman, but the power I granted you has been amplified over time and now far exceeds my own. If you use it you should be able to defeat her.\"<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\"Really? I can... I can kill her with this power? I can avenge you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yes... I am confident that you can do it. Now, there is only one thing left to do. You must devour my soul and awaken the dragon blood that sleeps within you.\"<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\"Devour your soul? But then what will happen to you, Maria?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I shall become a part of you. I will live on for all eternity within your body. Your pain will become my pain, and your joy will become my joy. We will become one. Now, take me Sari! Devour me and reach your full potential!\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then an orb of light materialized in front of Sari's face. Without hesitating for a moment she took the orb into her hands and swallowed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Together forever, right Maria?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yes Sari, together forever.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nAnd with that, Sari's body was engulfed in a cocoon of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden burst of light drew Amanda's attention. When she turned around and saw the cocoon of light, she knew that something big was about to happen. For the first time since she gained this power, Amanda actually felt nervous. She wasn't sure what was going on, and she wasn't sure she would be able to defeat whatever came out of that cocoon. In desperation, she launched forward with all of her might and lashed out at the cocoon. She was determined to stop whatever transformation Sari was going through before it was complete. Unfortunately for her, even with all of her strength, Amanda found herself unable to break through the shell of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the cocoon, Sari was undergoing a drastic transformation. Her arms from the elbows down and her legs from the knees down were now covered in shimmering purple scales, and her nails grew into razor sharp claws. From her forehead sprouted a single horn, and from the corners of her mouth peeked a pair of piercing fangs. Her pupils narrowed into reptilian slits and her hair lengthened and changed to a vibrant shade of red. On her back grew a pair of massive wings capable of whipping up galeforce winds with a single beat, and from her rear grew a long tail strong enough to topple a dozen buildings in a single swipe. Overall her figure became far more developed, her form morphing into the perfect embodiment of pure feminine beauty. Sari was becoming something far greater than even Amanda. She had claimed to be a goddess, but she was nothing more than a lowly human that got her hands on a little power. What Sari was turning into would make Amanda pale in comparison. If anyone could be called a true goddess, she would be it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the cocoon, Amanda watched in horror as the newly reborn Sari emerged. She expected Sari to be looking at her with an expression of pure contempt and hatred, but much to her surprise the girl's face was far more calm than that. If anything it looked as though she pitied Amanda. That look on her face made Amanda's blood boil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh pitiful worm whose heart has been swallowed by the darkness, allow me to extinguish your life's flame and bring an end your feeble suffering.\" the new Sari said, speaking in a voice that sounded like a combination of her old voice and Maria's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Who do you think you're fooling, Sari! So you grew some wings and a tail, whoop-de-doo! I'm still a goddess and I'm going to make sure that you know your place!\" Amanda said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation she concentrated all of her magic into a single orb and fired it at Sari. The orb exploded in a massive blast, ravaging the surrounding area and leaving a cloud of smoke in its wake. Amanda panted as she struggled to stay standing. She had put everything she had into that one attack, and now she was exhausted. But it was all worth it. She could always recover her power over time, but now Sari was dead for sure and she was never coming-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that the best you've got, vermin?\" Sari's voice spoke from the center of the crater, striking Amanda with sheer terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... How can you... How are you still alive?! Sari... What kind of monster are you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am neither Sari nor Maria. Those two beings have died, and in there place I stand. I am judgement. I will destroy all who would do harm to others, and bring the world under a perfect order. I am the rightful ruler of this planet, and I am the bringer of your demise. You can call me... Saria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a single bat of her wings, Saria blew away all the smoke and launched herself into the air. She came down to land right in front of Amanda and grabbed her by the neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now... What should I do with an insect like you...\"</span></div></div>",

This mutant...thing that Sari had turned herself into couldn't possibly be stronger than her. Amanda just needed to regain her composure, and put this freak in her place. \"You...call me an 'insect'?\" she managed, even though Saria had her neck. \"I will-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith lightening speed, Saria opened her mouth, revealing rows of dagger-like teeth. With no more ceremony than if she was eating an apple, she pulled Amanda towards her and took a massive bite out of the girl's throat. Amanda didn't even have a moment to react before the life drained from her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the clearing left by the struggle, Lydia was still watching, horrified, as the newly-christened Saria continued to devour Amanda's body. Apparently, fusing with a dragon's essence hadn't just gifted Sari with her power; it had also given her a dragon's appetites, as well. What's more, Saria's body began to grow and swell with her meal, until the dragon-human hybrid stood at over ten feet tall. Lydia recalled how massive Maria had been, and was struck dumb at the thought of Saria expanding to such proportions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria, on the other hand, felt no such compunctions whatsoever. She noticed her increased size, and accepted it. Her mind was still her own, but it had been altered slightly by the infusion of Maria's cold, reptilian thinking. Everything seemed much clearer, now. Maria had seen the world in a wonderfully simple black-and-white mosaic; anything that served her master was good and desirable, and anything that harmed or frustrated her master was foul, evil, and to be eliminated. To serve these aims, Maria needed to be as powerful as possible; every animal instinctively understands that the strongest survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria found this attitude attractively simple. Further, since she was now the strongest creature in existence, all others should bend to her. She would bring the world to a perfect order, as she defined it. She would destroy those who harmed others...as she defined it. Such was her own black-and-white view of the world: everything that served her vision was good, and all else would be destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking her clawed hands of Amanda's blood, she turned her attention to Lydia, walking towards her silently. Lydia closed her eyes, bracing for an inevitable death, and was surprised to feel the healing magics surge through her. \"You...you're helping me?\" she managed, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so bold as to mistake my mercy for affinity,\" Saria noted. \"You are an arrogant fool, Lydia, and our partnership was nothing more than a stepping-stone for my own rise to power. But obviously, the situation has changed. It seems to me that you've clearly suffered enough at Amanda's hands. And, despite your foolishness, you may still prove useful to me. Which begs the question: will you serve me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she slowly got to her feet, Lydia nodded. It was clear that she couldn't disobey this creature and hope to live. \"I...of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria smiled. \"Excellent. Then we have much to do.\"</span></div></div>",

As Lydia felt her strength returning, she looked up at Saria confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you are to serve under me as my loyal vassal, you will need to possess the power to assert my will onto those who would resist me. Just remember that this power is but a mere fraction of my own. You saw how easily I vanquished its previous holder. I give you this gift trusting that you will use it wisely.

Everything that she had been through in the past several hours had all but eliminated any sense of pride that the mage possessed. Amanda's torment had instilled her with a new sense of humility, and she now knew just how pathetic she was in the grand scheme of things. Considering that Saria had just saved her from a life filled with nothing but eternal suffering, Lydia was more than willing to submit to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Master Saria. I will not disappoint you.\" Lydia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I certainly hope not, Lydia. You will be my greatest enforcer in my quest to unite this world under its one true ruler. A position such as this is more than a woman like you deserves. Now, on to the mission at hand. I believe that you are more than familiar with our first target. It is a vile kingdom filled with heartless people. Its inhabitants hold no concern for the lives of their fellow citizens, and those who fail to conform to their ideals are exiled without a second though. They must be taught the error of their ways.\" Saria said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia's heart skipped a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, you wouldn't happen to be referring to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed I am, my loyal pet. It would seem you will finally be able to exact the revenge you so desired upon the kingdom of Widowwood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, Lydia couldn't believe her luck. When Amanda stole her magic away and left her powerless, she thought that her dreams of revenge were shattered forever. But now, her new master was giving her the opportunity to make those dreams a reality. If Lydia held any doubts about swearing allegiance to Saria before, the promise of being able to finally see that hated kingdom suffer quickly silenced them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you ever so much, master! I have no greater desire than to see that horrid kingdom brought down. Please tell me, how exactly do you plan to do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Saria had to pause and think for a moment. On one hand, she really wanted to test the full extent of her new powers, and what better target than the kingdom she hated the most. On the other hand, Lydia's grudge against Widowwood was far greater than her own, and letting her fulfill her greatest desire would likely cement her loyalty in the future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of thought, Saria answered Lydia by saying...</span></div></div>",

She fondled her engorged breasts as she grew, moaning obscenely as the titflesh spilled between her lanky fingers. The smell of her enhanced arousal permeated the entire forest, getting stronger with her increased mass. Within seconds, she was Maria's height. And she didn't stop; her growth finally ended when she was almost twice the titanic dragon's size, leaving Maria just below the level of Amanda's tremendous tits. She was like a child to the inconceivably vast mountain of woman that Amanda had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Sari was struck dumb at the sight. And then she regained enough of herself to remember Amanda's threat. \"Maria!\" she shrieked at the top of her lungs. \"Flee! Run away, now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis broke Maria from her trance, as she realized that was an incredibly prudent course of action. Unfortunately, she tried to take Sari with her, and that gave Amanda the opening she needed. The incomprehensibly vast giantess easily grabbed the dragon woman's shoulders, forcing her to the ground with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda chuckled, like peals of rolling thunder. \"Where do you think you're going, you sexy little lizard?\" she purred, her voice husky with her own arousal. \"You have work to do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she pinned the smaller Maria to the ground, and straddled her obscenely. \"Are you watching, Sari?\" she taunted. \"Your little pet is now my little bitch. And I'm going to break her in the process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSari could only wail in horror and despair as Amanda began to violate her dragon. Although she called Maria her 'pet', and even 'servant', the truth was, Maria was her only friend. And she couldn't just let this happen...</span></div></div>",

I'm going to take over that pathetic kingdom that you hate so much, and you'll be coming along for the ride. You can watch first hand as I tear Widowwood to the ground and turn it into my own domain!\" Amanda said with a sadistic grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia smiled at this. While this wasn't exactly the situation she wanted, Lydia would still be able to see the citizens of Widowwood suffer. As much as she wanted to be able to torment them herself, being able to watch her former slave do the deed was good enough for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to Lydia's surprise, Amanda's body soon became shrouded in a thick purple mist. At first she wondered what was going on, but soon the answer became apparent. Amanda was growing. Faster and faster her body grew, and soon she was beginning to fill up the entire tower. Knowing that she would be crushed if she didn't escape quickly, Lydia made a dash for the closest window to her and jumped out. Luckily for her she was still on the bottom floor of her tower, for without her magic she couldn't protect herself from a higher fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia watched as the purple shrouded figure exploded out of her tower, quickly expanding to a massive 200 feet tall. Finally Amanda's growth slowed to a stop, and Lydia was left to stare up at the towering woman above her. The purple fog dispersed to reveal Amanda's perfect feminine figure to the world. Across her skin there were several scars that she received whenever Lydia had whipped her for doing her job poorly. Amanda laughed to herself as she looked at those scars, and then looked down at the pathetically small woman at her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one who had given her those scars in the first place was now nothing but a helpless little insect to her, one that could be crushed out of existence with a single well placed stomp. Amanda reveled in the fact that she was no longer Lydia's slave. The roles had been reversed, and now she was the one in command. Most people would probably have taken this as an opportunity for revenge, but Amanda was different. She didn't hate Lydia for what she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n On the contrary, she was actually quite grateful to her. Before she met Lydia, Amanda had been nothing. She was an empty shell without purpose. Becoming Lydia's slave had given meaning to her life, and while the beatings for disobedience were harsh, the rewards for doing a good job were always worth the hard work. Amanda could tell that somewhere deep down, Lydia did in fact care for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had never been forced to go a day without food, and although it was clear that Lydia was struggling to even feed herself, she never held back when rewarding Amanda for pleasing her. That life was harsh, but it hadn't been one without enjoyment. Rather than seeing her scars as a mark of her oppression, she viewed them as a trophy that symbolized how far she had come. How much she had endured to get where she was now. How Lydia had taken her in and given her life meaning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at her former master, Amanda smiled. She owed Lydia so much, and now it was thanks to her that she had become this all powerful goddess. She knew she had to do something to pay her back, and what better way than to demolish the kingdom that Lydia hated the most. And it wasn't as though Amanda was without her own grudges against Widowwood, so doing this would be enjoyable to her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wave of her wrist, Amanda levitated her former master into the air. She then encased her in a small glass orb and hung her around her neck with a magical string. Lydia had been turned into a beautiful necklace, the only article of clothing that remained on Amanda's titanic body. From inside her glass prison, Lydia could see everything. Looking down she would be able to watch as Amanda's dainty feet flattened her hated kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them grinned maliciously as Amanda stomped off toward Widowwood. It took mere minutes for her to arrive there, and when she did she wasted no time getting to work. Lifting her foot over one of the buildings, she brought it down in a ferocious stomp. In that instant the entire building and all who were inside it had been wiped from the face of the earth. All that remained was rubble and a pool of blood from the many bodies that the building held. Taking a moment to soak in the feeling of what she had just done, Amanda moved on to the next building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to demolish building after building, paying no attention to the hundreds of lives that were being ended beneath her feet as she walked through the kingdom. People ran in panic but none managed to escape from Amanda's destructive rampage. Soon every building in the kingdom had met its end beneath the feet of Amanda. Every building save for one: the royal family's castle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an evil laugh, Amanda tore the roof off of the castle and stared down at the terrified royal family within. They were all hiding together in a single room, trembling like leaves in fear of what Amanda would do to them. Licking her lips, Amanda scooped them all into the palm of her hand. Her first victim was the young prince, who she threw into her mouth and cruelly chewed up like the delicious morsel that he was. She then moved her attention to the princess, who was carelessly tossed into the air and fell to the ground with a sickening splat. Her body hit the ground hard, splattering and leaving nothing but a pool of blood and a mangled corpse behind. Next was the queen, who was placed into Amanda's bountiful cleavage and crushed into a fine paste between those beautiful boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaving the best for last, Amanda turned her attention to the king. Having just watched his entire family die at the hands of this merciless giantess, he had already given up. He was ready to die and be reunited with the rest of his family, the only thing he hoped was that his death would be quick and painless. Amanda wouldn't allow that. Gripping the king's tiny body tightly with both her hands, she began to squeeze him. Her fingers constricted around his body mercilessly, like an army of pythons all joining forces to squeeze the life out of a single victim. The pressure was unbearable, but it wasn't enough to kill him. Instead, the poor king was forced to endure this pain until he suffocated to death. Amanda made sure that he was unable to breath, the tightness of her grip crushing his lungs. It was a slow and agonizing experience, but eventually the king's body went limp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king was dead, and with a victorious laugh, Amanda placed his lifeless body on the ground and splattered his corpse beneath her foot. Grinding her heel into the remains of his body, she reveled in the fact that she had singlehandedly destroyed this entire kingdom. And it had been easy. Nothing that anyone did to oppose her had any effect on her. Amanda truly was a goddess now. The whole world was hers to do with as she pleased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her glass prison, Lydia had watched the whole thing. She was amazed by her former slave's cruelty, and the entire show was something that she could only dream of. Watching what Amanda did to the royal family made Lydia incredibly aroused. As much as she would have loved to be able to do those things herself, she couldn't deny that her former slave had proved to be more than worthy of the power she had taken. Amanda was absolutely perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing as she towered over the demolished kingdom, Amanda thought about what she should do next. After a bit of thinking, she...</span></div></div>",

True, she didn't bear malice towards Lydia, but she wasn't a fool, either; Lydia was still a selfish, highly-ambitious mage who probably wasn't pleased that Amanda had usurped her place. Still, Amanda was feeling magnanimous, and it would likely be lonely with her only true companion to remain the size of a bug in comparison to the young goddess's enormous body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snapped her fingers, and the chain around her neck disappeared, allowing Lydia's crystal cell to tumble to the ground. At first, Lydia was terrified that Amanda was going to let her plummet to her death, but she soon sensed that the orb was actually slowing as it fell, rather than speeding. When she finally reached the ground, the orb simply popped like a soap bubble, leaving Lydia on the ground at Amanda's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda's feet. And the rest of her. Lydia looked up in awe at her former slave's glorious, powerful, gigantic form. Already aroused by seeing the violent slaughter of the kingdom, Lydia grew wetter looking up at the unearthly beauty. Even the scars visible on her back and shoulders were somehow alluring. Most telling of all were the cold, cruel eyes that looked down on her, judging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so small, Lydia,\" Amanda purred, causing the mage at her feet to fear the worst. \"Absolutely insignificant to your goddess.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused. \"Let's change that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia felt a great warmth within the center of her being, and suddenly realized that she was rising, again. Only this time, it wasn't levitation; she was growing, expanding larger and larger by the moment. The feeling of supreme, arrogant confidence returned to her, as she realized that soon, she'd be the untamed force of death and destruction Amanda had just been. Her lusts were increased along with her size, practically driving her mad with desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn mere moments, her size matched Amanda's, and she gazed into the other giant's eyes. \"Now, you're a proper size,\" Amanda noted. \"Other power may follow, if you behave yourself. What do you say?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lydia's lust was hitting its peak. She was getting more and more aroused with each passing moment, and the cause of it all was her beautiful former slave. Amanda stood before her, looking her in the eyes not as an equal but as a superior. While it was true that they were now the same size, Amanda had held on to all of the magic she had drained from Lydia. Her towering stature aside, Lydia was still just an ordinary human. But Amanda's vast magical powers made her something far greater; she was a true goddess, able to bend the fabric of reality to her whims. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerely being in the presence of such a powerful woman was driving Lydia insane with desire. Unable to contain herself any longer, Lydia pushed aside all other thoughts and threw herself at her beautiful new master. Wrapping her in a sweet embrace, she forced her lips onto Amanda's. Lydia's hands groped her ass, feeling her fingers pass over several of the scars that she herself had inflicted. She moaned with arousal as her sex began to moisten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Amanda was shocked by this sudden display of affection. She had expected Lydia to show at least some signs of hostility after her earlier betrayal, but much like her former master she too was quickly overcome by lust. The feeling of Lydia's perfect body pressing against her own, their soft lips connected in a passionate kiss, and Lydia's hands fondling her plump rear end. It had her turned on so much that she couldn't hold back. She had to have sex with this woman immediately, or she would go mad with desire. With her vastly superior strength, Amanda tossed Lydia off of her and looked her in the eyes once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure are a naughty girl, aren't you Lydia.\" Amanda said seductively, reaching out and caressing her partner's face with her slender fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm sorry, master... It's just, the way you destroyed this pathetic kingdom, it was so incredibly hot. Everything about you is so perfect, I just couldn't hold myself back.\" Lydia said submissively, knowing full well that Amanda would be the one in control from this day forward, and not wanting to anger her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry my little pet. I know exactly how you feel. Truth be told, I'm quite turned on right now myself. But if we're going to do this, then we should at least do it right.\" Amanda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Amanda tossed Lydia to the ground and mounted her face. Her damp pussy grinding against Lydia's nose and stimulating her even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat me, slave! Make me cum like the filthy little whore you are!\" Amanda cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yes master...\"</i> Lydia mumbled, her voice blocked by the wet crotch of her former servant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia extended her tongue and skillfully ate out her new master. Amanda moaned with arousal as she bent over and pressed her face into Lydia's own crotch, doing the same to her. The two titanic woman continued to eat eachother out, driving eachother ever closer to an overwhelming orgasm. They were both in complete ecstasy, nothing in the world mattered to them but eachother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey rolled around as they engaged in their passionate sex, their enormous bodies grinding any buildings or civilians that had survived Amanda's earlier rampage to dust. It was the perfect feeling, no words could even come close to describing it. And then, it happened. With simultaneous cries, Lydia and Amanda both came into eachother's mouths. Exhausted from what they had just done, the two women released eachother and simply lay there, panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh master, that was absolutely amazing... Thank you so much for allowing me to experience that with you...\" Lydia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My pleasure, Lydia... You did well yourself... Keep pleasing me like that, and one day I might start to view you as an equal again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women then struggled to get to their feet, their bodies worn out from the overwhelming sex they had just had. Looking eachother in the eyes, they shared one last kiss before laughing to themselves. This was the beginning of something great. They were going to rule the world together, and nothing could stop them. Even without her magic, Lydia's size alone made her superior to all else in the world. And compared to her, her master Amanda was on a whole other level. The two of them together were all but invincible now, and with a clear goal in mind, they set out to begin the path of complete world domination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after the titanic twosome left the borders of what was once Widowwood, Amanda saw something that caught her attention. Off in the distance, she discovered what would be her next target. It was...</span></div></div>",

But now...all she felt was hunger. She'd never wanted anything more in her entire life than she wanted meat at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubbed her bare stomach, chuckling. \"I suppose it's to be expected, with all these improvements to my body,\" she purred. \"Very well. I'll have some dinner before the night's entertainment truly begins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left her tower, not bothering to dress; what do gods care of what mortals see? She didn't waste time checking her own meager larder for food; she already knew there wouldn't be nearly enough to fill her. No, tonight, she hunted big game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Blackfire Forest was so named because of the number of dragons that inhabited its many acres. These dragons, having lived near Widowwood for generations, had little problem in keeping in harmony with the people of the kingdom. For the most part, the two species ignored each other. The dragons knew not to enter the kingdom proper, save the occasional flight high overhead. The humans knew that the dragons would not initiate hostilities, and should someone accidentally stray too close to a dragon's lair, the beast would simply snarl and smoke for a bit to warn the careless person to change direction. Thus it had been, to the mutual benefit of both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo one can imagine the confusion of the poor dragon currently snarling and billowing smoke, as Lydia calmly approached its burrow. The beast was confused enough to see a human female alone, this far from the kingdom, and nude to boot. Even beyond all that, there seemed to be something...off about her. Still, the dragon wasn't overly concerned. He was forty-feet long from teeth to tail tip, and if he had to get a little rough with this odd human, it wasn't a problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lunged forward to force her away from his territory, and was shocked as she effortlessly leaped into the air to avoid his strike. Not just that, but she kept going up, rising thirty feet in a single jump. Before he could truly register how impossible that should have been, she was coming back down, landing on his side. And then, the pain began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Lydia, this was barely an exertion. After landing on the dumb animal's side, she allowed her nails to grow. Sprouting to a length that more properly qualified them as \"talons\", they were quickly put to work, slicing into the dragon's flesh, greedily shoving it towards her face. Her teeth elongated to become equal to the task, messily devouring the creature even as it began to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon shot a hot river of flame at his assailant, who simply raised her hand, parting it harmlessly. Panicking, the dragon elongated its neck and twisted back, trying to catch her in its jaws. In response, Lydia turned her attention from its side to its throat, sinking her fangs into its jugular, and letting the warm blood wash over her. She laughed coldly as the life drained out of its eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" she purred. \"You're nothing. Nothing! But a snack...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she ate, allowing the great beast's blood to drip over her naked body as she devoured it alive. As she ate more and more, she could feel her body changing, growing taller with each added mouthful. Soon, she was ten feet tall, bathed in crimson, with little more than a red pulpy mess left at her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer red eyes blazed with sadistic madness, and she spoke a single word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More.\"</span></div></div>",

As Lydia traversed her way through the thick brush of the vegetation, she quickly found herself losing her balance more than she would have liked. Hell, her constant falling had injured her more than her meal had! Fed up with her sub-par coordination, Lydia took the opportunity to rest against a large oak tree and assess the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take long for the crimson-stained woman to discover the cause. Her tummy, instead of being at its normally flat state, had ballooned out. Stuffed with (most of) the half-digested remains of the dragon, her abdomen had swollen to the point that it looked as if she was nearly five months pregnant. Audible gurgling noises occasionally escaped from the round mass as her hardworking stomach did its best to process the outrageous meal she'd just shoved down her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia was shocked that she hadn't notice her belly's growth until now, though in retrospect, it did make sense. She'd been enthralled by the thrill of the hunt to the point that everything between her initial attack and the dragon's end as a pulpy mess was a blur. The only thing she could clearly recall was the pleasure she felt with each delicious bite. It filled her soul as the meat filled her belly. Along with her near-double growth, it was no surprise that a bulging belly was the least of Lydia's concerns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than being appalled at her discovery, the goddess rubbed her stomach with proud strokes. Like her height change, she considered it yet another trophy of her victory over the beast. She could picture the future now; one day, long after she'd conquered the kingdom, her bloated belly, perpetually filled by a daily sacrifice, would serve as a reminder to all those who dared to oppose her rule. A glorious future indeed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the issue now resolved, Lydia began anew her trek through the forest. Compensating for her lowered center of gravity, she no longer struggled to make it through the twists and turns of the dense brush. With her hunger still burning, she decided that...  </span></div></div>",

Clearly, a dumb animal wouldn't appreciate her height, curves, or plump stomach as much as a human would. And she wanted her prey to fall victim to her beauty, as well as her appetite. She knew of several farms outside of Widowwood's boundaries. It was time to put them to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was late when Balthazar and his family laid down their heads after a hard day's work in the fields. Tilling the soil and caring for the livestock left them drained at the end of each day, so it was very hard to rise them before the morning. So, one can only imagine the commotion the animals were making that raised him from his slumber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the devil?\" he muttered. The animals were going crazy, as if a wolf or some other predator had made it inside the fences. But that shouldn't have been possible; he'd secured the farm before turning in. Leaving his wife in bed, he moved to head for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noise had died down by the time he reached outside of the family cabin, which was equally distressing. It was now completely silent, which shouldn't be. It was as if...there were no animals at all. He was shocked. He had a full herd of cattle, and several hogs. All of them were gone, without a trace...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn enormous echoing rumble was heard behind him; he turned, and screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia didn't feel embarrassed by her belch; she was far beyond shame, at this point. And in her defense, she'd just had quite a meal. The cattle and hogs had added a great deal to her size and girth; she was now over sixty feet tall, retaining her sizable belly, breasts, and buttocks. Her face was a bit more plump as well, but she was still a stunning visage of demonic beauty. What's more, she was still hungry. She wanted to eat and grow and eat and grow until she was all that was left in the valley.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Having tasted the delicious meat of a dragon for the first time in her life, Lydia knew that she had to have more. The taste was unlike anything that she had ever eaten before in her life. While the scales were thick and moderately difficult to pierce even for someone of her unrivaled strength, the tenderness of the meat underneath was unbelievable. It practically melted away in her mouth as she chewed it, and she swallowed she felt a wave of euphoria that sent shivers down her spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't just the unrivaled taste of the dragon's flesh that Lydia wanted more of. No, while the dragon meat was a delicacy like no other, what Lydia truly wanted was to experience the thrill of dominating one of the mighty beasts once more. The feeling of supreme control that she felt as she had devoured her first dragon, the look of sheer terror on its face as she had effortlessly repelled its flaming breath with a single hand, the way the beast had used all of the strength within its massive form to escape from her but was unable to do so, and listening to it's pathetically helpless cries of agony as she tore the skin right off of its bones... Yes, she needed to feel all of it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, with that feeling of absolute domination fresh in her mind, Lydia set out on her hunt for more of those delectable dragons. It didn't take her long before she located another of the fearsome fire-breathing behemoths, and while this one was a good bit bigger than the last one she had brought down, Lydia herself had also grown bigger since then. Her power was more than enough to bring this dragon to its knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the same strategy as she had the first time, Lydia lunged onto the dragon and sank her razor-sharp nails deep into its flesh. Holding herself in place, she then proceeded to ravenously devour her prey, completely ignoring any attempts it made to defend itself. The dragon's long tail whipped at Lydia's back, its claws raked at her sides, its flames bathed her entire body, but nothing that the dragon did had any effect on the newly empowered Lydia. All of it was simply shrugged off with a maniacal laugh as Lydia continued to tear into her feast. Within mere moments the beast let out its final cry, and its body collapsed to the ground in a lifeless heap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished of the last of her defeated prey, Lydia let out a loud belch and patted her stomach victoriously. The dragons' meat had already been digested and absorbed into her body, the corrosiveness of her stomach acids having been augmented along with the rest of her body by the dark power she now possessed. Absorbing the beast's strength had made Lydia significantly more powerful than before, but the only change to her body's physical appearance was that she had gained another 5 feet in height, and now stood at an imposing 15 feet tall. Being able to eat as much as she wanted without ever having to worry about it affecting her flawless figure would be very useful in the near future, as even after her most recent meal, Lydia still hungered for more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next dragon that Lydia found was a good deal smaller than either of the two she had already slain, and with the height that she gained from her most recent prey, Lydia was able to look the beast eye-to-eye. Seeing a human that matched their size was not an ordinary occurrence for the dragons, so this little one was understandably worried as it saw Lydia standing before it. Not knowing what to do, the terrified dragon quickly turned to try and fly away. However, before it could even manage to get its body off of the ground, Lydia reached out and grabbed it by the tail, halting it in its tracks. Then, with a mighty heave, she swung the dragon over her shoulder and slammed it into the ground at her feet. The impact knocked the wind out of her helpless prey, and before it was able to lift a claw to defend itself, Lydia swung her free arm forward and severed the beast's neck with her nails. Having easily beheaded the dragon, Lydia began devouring the lifeless corpse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis cycle continued several more times, each time becoming easier than the last as Lydia grew in strength and size with each kill. Over the course of her hunt, Lydia noticed that each dragon she devoured made her own body take on a more draconic appearance. Eventually, after having slain and devoured over a dozen dragons, Lydia's physical appearance had undergone some drastic changes. First was her height, which had ascended to a mighty 50 feet tall. Then there was her skin, which was now coated in a layer of armor-like red scales. On her back she had grown a pair of massive crimson wings, a single beat of which was capable of calling forth a fearsome gale. Her eyes had once again changed, now being golden in color, and her pupils became reptilian slits. The last change of note was that she had grown a powerful tail, which she had quickly learned to manipulate at will as a terrifying weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she was powerful before, Lydia was all but invincible now. Ignoring the fact that she was now big enough to crush a man flat beneath her feet with a single stomp, and that her magic was powerful enough to bring down an entire army, she now possessed new physical abilities that would make even her old self tremble in fear. Her new body was coated in a layer of natural armor so thick that not even the sharpest of blades could put a scratch on it, and her tail was essentially a third arm that she could use to fend off attacks from behind. Her defense had absolutely no blind spots. In addition to that, Lydia had gained the ultimate weapon of dragonkind: their ability to spew forth a searing inferno from their mouths. With wings that would allow her to soar through the skies, Lydia could rain fire down from the heavens. None would be able to escape from her wrath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a moment to admire her new form, Lydia decided that it was time to set out for her next destination. With a beat of her mighty wings, Lydia took to the skies. As she flew off into the distance, she couldn't wait to reach the place she had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut where exactly was Lydia headed?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lydia wanted to put her godly new form to good use, and she knew exactly where to go to do so. There was a small village in the forest that she knew of, one she could comfortably toy with without alerting Widowwood of her presence until she was ready. It was mostly a farming town with little defense, so there would most likely be plenty to feed her gnawing hunger, as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titanic dragon-woman flew without hesitation to the village, landing with a tremendous crash just outside its boarders. She attracted the attention of most of its inhabitants by doing so, although most did not immediately panic. After all, no one had seen a beast like Lydia before, but they'd seen dragons. And the dragons of this area were reasonable and often harmless. This new creature might be, as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this optimistic speculation was put to rest the instant they saw her face. Although still beautiful, Lydia's visage dripped with such visceral hatred that it was impossible to mistake her intentions. Many people turned to flee, while others went to warn their families. Once brave soul raised a bow and fired upon her; the arrow shattered upon impact with Lydia's invulnerable scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a lightening-fast motion that belied her great size, Lydia raised a clawed foot and stomped the archer into oblivion. \"No more of that,\" she hissed. \"You will learn your place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused for a moment; how should she punish these people? She needed a method appropriate for her new dragonic form. After a second, she smiled darkly. \"If you want to be spared, you will present your virgin maidens for sacrifice,\" she declared, eyes gleaming with madness. \"All of them. Now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis certainly didn't sit well with the townspeople, but after Lydia punctuated her demand with a mighty roar, (\"NOW!\"), the terrified villagers had no choice but to obey. Certain that they were damning their maiden daughters to a fate worse than death, they presented Lydia with a group of about a dozen young women. Lydia smiled, looking down at the group of terrified girls that gathered at her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her mouth, and a stream of fire erupted from the depths of her throat. She used the flame to encircle her new toys, keeping the girls in place. \"Stay here, now,\" she said calmly. \"I have work to do.\" And with that, she attacked the village in full force. It was needlessly vicious, and she was needlessly cruel. She stomped buildings into nothing, burned anyone who tried to fight her alive, and killed many a man unknowingly with a deadly swipe of her sizable tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paid special attention to the village church. \"Thou shall have no gods before me,\" she sneered, ripping the tower out with her bare hands. Smiling perversely, she slid the tower between her thighs, taking a moment to pleasure herself before tossing it carelessly over her shoulder. \"Mustn't get too distracted,\" she noted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that out of the way, she ate. And ate. Crops, livestock, people, she made no distinction. Anyone who tried to hide was quickly ensnared by her serpentine tongue and swallowed alive. The rest were mercifully crushed before sliding down her gullet. After a few more minutes of this hellish display, no one was left in the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one, that is, save the terrified girls trapped in the circle of flame. They watched helplessly, many openly weeping, as their home was completely destroyed for Lydia's pleasure. And when the tremendous dragon woman returned to them, they openly cowered, fearing their own deaths may  be at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to be afraid, girls,\" Lydia purred. \"You have a wonderful future ahead of you. You will gloriously serve as my slaves for the rest of your lives. I...oh...Oh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a practically orgasmic moan, Lydia began to grow again, terrifying her captives even further. Her already-enormous body stretched and expanded, rising another twenty feet in the air. Lydia absently ran her hand between her thighs again, so lost was she in the sensation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmmm, oh, that never gets old,\" she moaned. </span></div></div>",

She'd been teasing herself for some time, but now...now she wanted release. She smiled down at her trapped group of slaves. \"So sorry, girls,\" she whispered huskily. \"But your goddess needs you right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mighty flap of her wings, Lydia blew out the ring of fire she'd been using to keep the girls in place. Their attempt at freedom wasn't going to last; with a resonating shake, Lydia sat down in front of them, crossing her legs to trap them between the mountainous scaled flesh of her thighs. Her dripping sex was splayed in front of them, far, far too close for comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" Lydia purred, eyes lit up in perverse delight. \"To work, girls.\" There was no immediate response; her captives continued to cower before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia rolled her eyes, scoffing quietly. \"Let me make this clear,\" she hissed. \"You'll do as you're told, and make your goddess happy. Or, I'll shove your squirming bodies into myself, and take my enjoyment from you that way. It doesn't matter to me which you choose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that terrifying ultimatum looming, the young women decided it was best to please her willingly. They hesitantly approached her sopping lips, beginning to rub and tease her waiting sex. Lydia smiled, shivering in delight. It wasn't just the physical sensation, although the threat of violence certainly did a great job in motivating their busy little hands. No, it was the knowledge of the power, the fear she inspired in her little toys, which truly made Lydia moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed more. Without hesitation, she reached to her crotch, grabbing an unfortunate woman from the pack. She lifted the screaming girl to her face, eyes glazed over in lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need your taste, little one,\" she breathed, serpentine tongue slipping out to slide up her slave's legs. The girl tried to force them shut, but the warm, wet muscle was far too strong; withing moments, Lydia was eagerly lapping between the girl's legs. At first, the terrified slave was protesting, but after a few moments, she started to moan involuntarily, turning red at the sensation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia withdrew her tongue, eying the girl lustfully. \"You like that, little slave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl nodded. \"..y...yes, goddess,\" she whispered. \"I...I've never felt this...before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serve me well, little slave, and you'll experience so much more,\" Lydia moaned. She was so, so close to climax...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Groaning Lydia urged her slaves to go on. Finally she came with ground shaking force. Two of the smaller huts crumbled, unable to withstand the violent tremors the dragoness body emanated through the ground. A thunderous roar escaped Lydia's mouth as the sensation intensified even more. Her new and improved body started to grow again, apparently the growth was triggered by her climax. She felt her expanding ass flattening a fence, the wood splintering and offering no resistance at all. Aroused she felt the skin of her female slaves tickling her breasts, as two of the girls struggled not to slide from her expanding bosom. With closed eyes Lydia felt herself climaxing again, before her growth finally stopped at a size of 100 feet. Slowly she rose, and carefully set down her slaves, who starred at her with large fearful eyes. Lydia bowed down, overshadowing them completely. \"You did well, tinies! As a reward I will keep you! You will stay here and wait for my return and pleasure me, when I command it! Satisfy me and you shall notice that my grace is the biggest reward any living soul in this kingdom could hope to receive! \u201cShe unfurled her gargantuan wings and started to fly, the wind almost blowing her maiden slaves away. She had big plans for her revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 weeks later<br>\r\nTrisha was running through the woods. Occasional she would hit an obstacle, but nothing seemed to be able to slow her down. \"Of course not\", she thought. Not after the changes the dragon-goddess had brought. She remembered the day, the giantess had appeared. It had been an ordinary day. She had been helping her father - the village\u2019s blacksmith - at the forge. Habitual he had complained about that. \"A beauty like you shouldn't work like that. Or one day you will look more like a knight than a maiden! \u201cShe had smiled at that, like she always did. To be honest, she was gaining more muscles, as her strong arms clearly showed, but she was still a fair beauty. Her mother had died when she had still been a child. But according to her father, Trisha had inherited her stunning beauty. Long fiery red hair, cascading over her back, touching her beautiful butt with their tips. An almost noble heart shape faced, with ruby-red lips and a gentle smile and shining emerald green eyes. She was tall with perfectly shaped, long legs and the largest bosom in the village. Secretly she was very proud on her breasts, taking joy by just looking at their perfect tear-shaped form when she was bathing. And as a positive adverse effect of her work in the forge, her improving pectoral muscles emphasised them even more. She was careful not to exaggerate with the arm training and used both arms, because she was ambidextrous. Trisha tried to avoid an oversized right arm, like her father had. Being proud on her body didn't flaw her character so. She was always a joyful and helpful person and everyone in the village liked her. Some made jokes about her dream of marrying a knight one day, but she had no enemies. Pious like her father she prayed the gods and believed in the protection of the king... Till the horrible day of the dragons descend. She still saw her father\u2019s last smile, when he pushed her into the house, promising her that she would be save... Before the cruel mistress ate him. Trisha had been captured like the other girls from the village and been forced to satisfy the dragoness lust. After that she had run into her father\u2019s home, buried herself under the pillows of the bed and started to cry. And this night the changes had begun...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrisha was moaning. To her own shame neither from grief nor from crying, but in pleasure. She had been a maiden till today. Dreaming of giving her maidenhood to a tall and handsome knight, who would take her to his castle. But since the dragoness had despoiled her, she felt a burning desire to feel this pleasure again. An hour ago she had finally had given in and started to please herself. Since then she had climaxed several times, but her hunger for pleasure seemed to be insatiable. Gently she strokes her wet cunt, pushing two fingers in her moist and warm vagina. Her other hand massaged her left breast, cupping it soulful. Her night gown was soaked in her sweat and juices and still she went on. When the sun rose, she hadn't slept the whole night. Slowly she staggered to the door, not noticing that her night gown was tighter and the door frame smaller than last night. Trisha didn't bother to switch her clothes. Everyone was dead, except for former maidens who shared her fate. She strode to the burning remains of the ruined village, headed for the centre, sure to find her companions in misfortune there. There they were. The other girls looked as sleepless as Trisha, but all emanated an energized aura. \"They feel the lust, too.\" Trish thought. Some of them were even kissing and touching each other. Suddenly the whole world drowned in darkness. Horrified they looked skywards to see the colossal form of their dragon-goddess. Trisha was puzzled how it was possible, that something so large could move so silent if it wants to. With a forceful impact the goddess landed, placing her feet left and right of the group of girls. Forcing them to look upwards, but her enormous bust obscured the view on her face. \"Good morning, my pleasure maidens! \u201c Lydia's mighty voice thundered. \"Let me introduce your other superiors!\"<br>\r\nFrom her back jumped two large figures. Shocked the girls backed away from the newcomers. <br>\r\n\"First my daughter, Alexi! \u201c Lydia said with a proud voice pointing at the left creature. Like the goddess, Alexi was an unearthly beauty. Terrible and tempting just as her mother, but lacking the dragon aspect. Her skin was deep tanned and her unearthly body sensual. Seducing hips, an enormous rack, long black hair, but also a demoness wings and small horns on her forehead. Her red eyes burned with barely contained fury. A twisted tongue caressed her sharp white teeth as she mustered the frightened girls.<br>\r\n\"And my apprentice, Sari! \u201c Lydia said pointing on the other woman. Despite the fact that Sari also had a body that would put most girls to shame, she differed in many ways from Alexi. Her cold eyes glared in blue. Her long white hair emphasised the paleness of her skin. Even her wings were white.<br>\r\nBoth were around 25 feet tall. Radiating an aura of power and might. While their curves were still nothing compared to those of her master Lydia, both were busty and seducing. \"Succubi! \u201c Trisha thought. Demoness temptresses. <br>\r\n\"You will serve them, as you serve me!\" Lydia ordered. \"I made a plan to tear this little kingdom apart. I have waited for my revenge so long, I will savour it and it will be long and painful for this joke of a king and his pet mages.\" Lydia lowered herself on all fours, pressing her breasts on her slaves. \"I have to go early today, my little maidens! And as much I would like to grow, I can't gain size to fast, or I will be unable to even see their insect faces, when I finally destroy them. So I have to be content with some gentle strokes from you little hands! \u201cFearful Trisha massaged the hard scaled but oddly soft and gigantic breasts, which forced her on the ground. She heard an unearthly giggle as Sari an Alexi joined the maidens. To her shame she felt herself getting soaking wet. After a while Lydia finally took off. Moaning something about destroying a castle. Sari and Alexi almost immediately lost their interest in the girls and started to erect two large buildings with the help of magic spells.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her moist vagina had soaked the sheets already and she couldn't resist and started to finger herself. Suddenly she paused, something was different. Why she was hogging the bed? Shocked she realized: She was huge! No wonder she was hogging the bed -- she had to be seven feet tall, at least! Her long, long legs were bent to keep her on the mattress. Trisha's night gown clung to her like a second skin. Every part of her was more athletic, giving her a statuesque frame. She cupped her huge breasts in her hands, the cloth struggling to contain them. She shut her eyes and ran her hands over her big breasts and down her long torso, stretching her arms downward. The redhead moaned softly as she tilted her head back, growing another two or three inches in a matter of a few seconds, her head inching closer to the ceiling! Hardly aware of the insanity of what was happening to her... Trish just was enjoying it. The supple curve of her cleavage was emerging from beneath her ever-tightening, seemingly shrinking nightgown. With each passing second another millimetre was creeping into view. A pair of wondrous orbs making a slow-motion escape from their wool prison. She moaned some more and grew still taller! In a matter of a few seconds, her head was inching closer to the ceiling! Intense pleasure coursed through Trisha's body. Her garment finally was ripped to shreds around her, revealing her titanic tear-drop globes. By now Trisha\u2019s muscles were starting to show some serious definition. The last bit of fat on her stomach had vanished, replaced by a perfect six-pack. Her arms were broadening with muscles, her legs becoming thick and powerful, her body hard as rock and sculpted but unmistakably feminine. Her gigantic breasts heaved with her quickening breath, when she started to masturbate more quickly. And then, and then, she started to grow again, with a sudden giggle of pleasure. Finally she let out a deafening orgasmic scream, and rolled over opening her eyes. Slowly she tried to stand. Leaned over, she tried to straighten her legs... but even they were too long and her butt pressed against the ceiling with her knees still bent. By now she was at least fifteen feet tall! With a moaned grunt, she straightened her legs, falling plaster from the ceiling collapsed against her mighty ass! Unbelieving she tried to examine her gigantic, naked body in the darkness. Her breasts were each curved with a perfect teardrop shape and swollen to the size of her head. Carefully she ran her fingers along the ceiling, licking her lips. It crumbled, revealing tie-beams. One of them snapped easily at her touch, like a small, dry twig under a foot. Trisha gasped, it looked like her muscles weren't just for show. Slipping out the back door at this size was impossible, Trisha concluded. With ease she pushed down the wall in front of her and escaped from the building. Slowly she stepped out of the house, breathing the fresh air of the dawn. Her lower body was still slick with the syrupy juices of her desire. When the sun was rising behind her, it bathed her gargantuan body in golden light. Trisha was impossibly huge, and covered in a thick, sexy sheen of muscle. She estimated herself to be eighteen feet tall. To test her strength, she lifted the anvil, it was almost weightless. Still stunned she just crushed it with one hand and gasped. Was this a blessing of the gods or the demonic touch of the mistress?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer question was answered when she saw the other girls. All of them had grown and undergone improvements of her female endowments. Even formerly flat chested girls sported now a above-average bust. But only two of the other maidens had gained an amazonian stature like Trisha, who towered two heads above all of them. When the mistress returned she was cheerful. It seemed like she hadn't forseen this, but talked about an own army. Trisha frowned. She didn't want to fight for the dragoness. Among the \"blessed\" maidens developed a divide. Some changed their behaiviour after recieving the gift of size and strength. Talking openly about supporting the dragoness in her conquest, by vanquishing knights and armies. Sari and Alexi chose some of them to follow them on raids. But Trisha was never asked, being one of Lydia\u2019s favourite toys. She was too valuable to risk a scratch. Lydia had brought them new maidens from her raids on the kingdom. In a week their numbers doubled. After victories Lydia wanted to be spoiled. When they caressed the goddess body, she would occasionally show them her deeds with large illusions. How she pulverized the gate of a small castle with her powerful tail cooked the advancing knights with her flame breath and finally tumbled the largest tower, by rubbing her enormous breasts against it. There she had captured Mara. Mara was one of the new maidens, who didn't fit in. Noble-born she resented the \"lowborn sex-slaves\" of the \"monster\" openly. Alicia, the second largest after Trisha felt provoked and forced the blond haired noble on the ground in the former pig compound. Helpless against the might of the black haired amazon, Mara struggled to get up, but was always thrown back in the mud with casual but brutally strong flicks of Alicia. Even standing the blonde noble was just eye-level with the lower parts of Alicia's thigh. The dark haired measured 16 feet. Bruised and covered in stinking mud, Mara tried in vain to defend herself. Alicia lifted her up, pressed by the cheers of her four closest followers, who were watching from outside the compound. \"Looks like Milady are a dirty low-born now. Just like us! \u201cAlicia japed cruelly. With a fast movement she tore Mara's clothes, revealing an ivory-pale body, where the noble\u2019s skin wasn't soiled by the dirt. \"I think to show you that you're one of us now, I'm going to deflower you myself, piggy! \u201cThe amazon thundered. Trisha had just joined the scene and dashed forward. The memories of being despoiled against the own will still fresh in her mind.<br>\r\nViolently she shoved her huge chest in Alicia's face. The startled amazon lost her footing and stumbled. Easily Trisha grabbed Mara from her hands, holding her gently to her left breast in a protective stance. Snarling Alicia rose again and Trisha heard other giantesses closing in. Surprisingly fast she overwhelmed them all. Even one handed she was by far the strongest of the maidens. She grabbed Alicia and lifted her up, when a large shadow loomed over them,<br>\r\n\"Stop it!\", a booming voice demanded. \"How dare my toys to harm each other, without my order or consent! \u201c Lydia boomed. Her body now at 120 feet. \"Forgive us, mistress! \u201c Trisha said with her most sultry voice. \"But those brutes tried to take what is rightfully yours: This one\u2019s maidenhood! \u201c<br>\r\n\"Is she speaking true! \u201c Lydia demanded angrily. Scared the four giantesses bended even lower.<br>\r\n\"So you deserved the beating! \u201c Lydia finally chuckled. Her left clawed index finger pointed at Trisha. \"You\u2019re responsible for her safety, red!\" With earth-shaking steps she left. Alicia slowly rose \"You'll pay for this, Trisha! Do you really think, we wouldn't look through your mummers\u2019 farce? You resent the goddess, despite her gifts. Weak-minded you clamp to the past and seek revenge instead of seeing new purpose. And when you fall from the goddess grace, we will be there to punish you! \u201cLightning fast Trisha dashed her with her shoulder and sent her sprawling in the mud: \u201eWithout her help none of you is able to fight me. So if you touch Mara again, I will beat you to a pulp.\"<br>\r\nAfter that she left, the shivering noble born cradled in her strong arms. This night she took her to her home. She still used to sleep there. Crawling into it on all fours. Mara still didn't speak, so she washed her carefully. At last she gently placed her between her large breasts to keep her warm and waited till Mara slept. Mara was a most delicate woman. Despite her slender frame, accented by her endless long legs, she had a large bust. The nobles skin was pale, her face statuesque: Emerald green eyes like Trisha's own, long golden hair, mostly worn in an artful braid and full lips. Even after Alicia's attack her soft silk-like skin smelled like flowers. Gently Trisha kissed Mara's forehead, before she closed her eyes. The following days Mara was following her, still silent. So Trisha talked to her, telling her all kind of things. Mara was with her, even when they had to please the goddess. Oddly enough after three days still none of the new maidens had grown. Although their hunger for pleasure was growing. Trisha spotted some of them pleasing themselves during other tasks and heard new screams and moans at night. On the fifth evening, after crawling in Trisha's former house, the noble suddenly stroke Trisha's face tenderly. Then she leaned forward and planted a kiss on Trisha's upper-lip. Pleasantly surprised Trisha returned the favour.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She despised having so many of them so close to her home. She'd been trying to convince her father how unseemly it was, but he didn't seem to care. Old fool. He didn't understand; they were royalty. They were so much better than that common scum who served them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, her father disagreed; that's why he ensured she'd never be part of the line of succession. She'd never be queen, which was truly maddening. She'd teach these people their proper place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing with frustration, the beautiful but vain princess turned, started to find a woman standing in her bedchamber. Further, she was nude.

Perhaps she could use this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were it only possible, that they could truly be bugs beneath you,\" Lydia offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delightful,\" Eliza agreed. \"I'd take no hesitation in crushing them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia's smiled only grew wider.</span></div></div>",

I'm here to grant your desire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza raised an eyebrow. \"Forgive my skepticism, 'dark mage', but why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia smiled, dark, moving closer to the other woman. She circled the princess slowly. \"Why not?\" she asked seductively. \"Who better than you, to rule this land? To control the entire kingdom? It needs to happen, but...unless we take certain, drastic steps, it won't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza should have been uncomfortable at the proximity, but something about this woman was alluring. And it didn't hurt matters that her words were equally tempting. \"What...what sort of steps?\" she allowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia kissed the girl lightly on the cheek. \"As you said,\" she noted. \"They will be bugs at your feet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza felt a strange sensation in the pit of her stomach as Lydia began to cast her spell. The mage seemed to be getting smaller before her, before Eliza realized that the entire room was dwindling as well. No, it...it wasn't that. To her shock and amazement, the princess realized she was getting larger! A warm, sensuous feeling spread through her body as she continued to fill the room, confused and disoriented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia smiled. \"To the balcony, my dear Eliza,\" she said brightly. Eliza, still in a state of shock, heeded her request and made it to the balcony while she was still able to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused a commotion below, as people in the courtyard were unable to tell exactly what was happening. Unfortunately, the balcony soon surrendered to the princess's burgeoning weight, and she fell the fifty feet to the ground, landing in a crouched position. She stood, slowly, noting that her garments were fortunately increasing in girth with her. As she rose to a full thirty feet, and continued to grow, she began to clear her thoughts. No longer confused, she was now in awe of herself, and what she was becoming. The people at her feet, knowing full well her cruelty, began to retreat, if they had any senses left at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd still, she grew. She was pleased to see her bust increased with her height, stretching and tearing the top of her dress to allow for its increasing mass. Forty feet came and went, followed by fifty, and finally, sixty feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her perch at the top of the tower, Lydia looked at her creation with malicious glee. This...this should be wonderfully entertaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Eliza looked down, and, to the terror of everyone below, began to smile.</span></div></div>",

You've all been witness to the rise of Queen Eliza. You will be able to tell your children and grandchildren of this blessed event. Assuming, of course, that you all do exactly as you're told, and don't give me any cause to...discipline you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia was now perched on the tower that formerly held Eliza's bedchamber, and had taken the opportunity to help herself to a sleek black dress from the oversized princess' wardrobe. It hugged the mage's curves tightly, but she didn't mind; she was enjoying herself far too much. A deranged smile was plastered on her face as she watched this increasingly hilarious display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, Lydia found it funny, anyway. The citizens at Eliza's feet were far less inclined to agree. They knew that Eliza was a spoiled, cruel princess, and they could certainly sense the other shoe that was about to drop. They only hoped it was to be metaphorical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Eliza continued. \"With that in mind, there's obviously going to be some changes around here. First, all fine metals, artwork, fabric, and food is to be taken from your homes and presented to me, immediately. Consider it a tax. And be merry, for after today, you'll never be taxed again. Whatever your Queen deigns to give you will be yours, forever. Of course, I don't think you...well, peasants, need much more than a few bare essentials to live. The rest will be properly directed to my care and comfort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could sense the wave of unease and distrust washing through the crowd. Best to nip that right in the bud, she decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a speed that belied her great size, she moved her left foot and quickly crushed the closest bystander into a bloody smear. The crowd erupted into terror at the senseless cruelty. \"Should you decide to resist, you can look forward to many more such displays,\" Eliza noted casually. \"Get what I asked for. NOW!\" She practically roared the last word, demanding submission from the people at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the citizens practically ran each other over in an attempt to comply with her demands, something caught Lydia's attention from her perch. Someone of great importance was emerging from the castle in response to Eliza's transformation. Lydia's smiled grew to grinch-like proportions.

He wouldn't act as shocked farther, he was there to act as the indomitable ruler of the kingdom, unwilling to shrink back from any threat to his rule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of his daughter's reach he harshly stopped his horse. His voice, deep, calm and demanding absolute obedience was clearly understandable, even in Eliza's and Lydia's lofty heights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what cursed you, daughter! I cannot fathome yet, which dark powers coruppted your body and made you abandon all sense of decency and sanity, exposing yourself like that and ranting mad demands... But I can and I will stop this madness!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gazed fixed on his giant daughter, who was genuinly uninteressed, standing spread-legged and tenderly massaged her succulent breasts, occassionally moaning softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand down and the mages will fix this! We will compensate your victims and you will be brought before the royal court to answer for you crimes! Resist and we will bring you down by force!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza pinched her pink nipples, a horny smile playing around her full lips. Slowly she leant over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll sure like to see you and your toy soldiers try!\", she moaned. Lydia's grin widened even more; Eliza was all she could have hoped for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beautiful behemoth approached the riders with tow large strides. Showing why they were rightly feared for their prowess as warriors in all kingdoms, Widowwoods knights spread out disciplined, while they unsheated their weapons. Immediately the king was surrounded by his personal guard, who were covering his retreat to the backlines. Troops with spears and halberds surged onto the plaza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a beast from old legends, Eliza smashed into their front rows, dwarfing even riders on their horses, the tallest of them still unable to reach her knees. With mighty swipes Eliza sent infantry, horses and riders flying. The pleasure from her growth and the intocxicating feeling of power compensating her for the sharp pain direct hits of their weapons inflicted. Despite her size and strength they were actually able to hurt, allthough they hadn't inflicted real wounds yet. To Eliza their weapons were like bite an stings, annoying, hurting, but not nearly as fatal as they had hoped them to be.<br>\r\nEnjoying the view of them scuttling in her mighty shadow Eliza roared furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you, insects?

She'd expected a flurry of guards to try to stop her, and had been looking forward to smiting them. But this, was a bit unexpected. It Gwenneth, Queen of Widdowwood, and Eliza's mother. An older woman in her late 40's, Gwenneth was nonetheless a sight to behold, in a stunning scarlet dress and her auburn hair tied into an elaborate bun behind her head. Unfortunately, her own refined beauty was rendered completely insignificant next to the sight of her overgrown offspring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eliza!\" she called, obviously very shocked, but still maintaining her dignity. \"Eliza, my child! My girl! You must put a stop to this! What have you done to yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza rolled her eyes, not bothering to hide her annoyance. \"I'm no longer a girl, mother. I'm quite a lot of woman. And while I didn't do this to myself, I owe a debt to the one who did. I'm afraid you're no longer the queen of this realm. I did a whole speech, and I should think you'd have heard it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwenneth should have been intimidated by her daughter's new size and lust for cruelty, but she was much more irritated by her complete lack of respect. \"No matter what size you are, you are my daughter. Even if you don't wish to, you must listen to me. Whatever has turned you into this monster is no boon to you. It-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a minor (to her, anyway) stomp of her foot, mere inches from where the former queen stood, Eliza swiftly silenced her mother, smiling with satisfaction as the miniscule woman toppled back in terror, all composure gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Monster'?\" she repeated. \"Really, mother? I take a great deal of offense to that. If I am a monster, it's because you, and the rest of this pathetic rabble, are too small. Small bodies, and small minds. I've become something more, and you're all too concerned for your own miserable safeties to take proper reverence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a speed that belied her uncanny size, Eliza spun on her heel, turning away from the gathered crowd. No one moved, terrified of what she might do next. With a single elegant motion, the giant princess lifted her left leg, showing generous portions of her ivory thigh in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clearly, I won't be served by confining myself to your timid, tiny worldview. If you're so attached to the crown, mother, you may keep it. Being a queen is beneath me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, her raised foot came down with astounding force, crashing into a lone building attached to the east wing of the castle. Eliza didn't know or care if anyone remained inside it; if they did, they were killed instantly. Still on her perch at Eliza's tower, it took Lydia a moment to realize what the building was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Eliza had just destroyed the castle's church.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not your queen,\" Eliza said, voice both cold and satisfied at the same time. \"I am your god. You'll have none other before me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Gwenneth began to panic. Her daughter was clearly out of her mind. With masterful self-deception, she told herself that whatever demonic forces made Eliza so huge had also corrupted her. Willfully ignorant of her own daughter's temperament, she tried to reach out to the \"true\" Eliza whom never existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eliza! Darling, please! What you're doing-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza glared down at her, finally fed up with her mother's resistance. \"On your knees,\" she hissed. \"And bow, in witness to my greatness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time since she'd grown, Eliza turned to look at Lydia. \"The power you granted me,\" she said, lowering her voice. \"I need more.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><div align=\"justify\">The whole castle shook, when the titanic power-drunk princess moaned deeply. The ground trembled, when - with an orgasmic grin on her beautiful face- the already gigantic princess started to grow again. Eliza hunched over and held herself tight, trying to contain the maelstrom of pleasure she felt growing within her body. In an instant it seemed her noble clothes had suddenly become very confining. Under her emerald skirt her silken panties dug deeply into her filling hips, and were quickly overcome as the fine silk ruptured from the force of alabaster flesh. Her delicately crafted robe was struggling, feeling very tight, then way too tight. Her hips and endless long legs had puffed the sides out like clown pants. It didn't last long either, first it strained, then it split, shredding about her tiny waist. Eliza was reaching back, grabbing at the remains still hanging off her still rounding ass.<br>\r\nThe blonde's breasts stuck out like twin zeppelins, casting a shadow over the other castle\u2019s court. Her master-crafted corset, once seductive yet comfortable, now was barely able to contain her relentlessly growing, ample bosom. Satisfied Eliza noticed that her proportions were changing; her perfectly shaped breasts grew faster than the rest of her body. The succulent and already magnificent orbs of her breasts improved every passing second, dominating the sight of her torso. The gaps between the straining lacing were widening, each a window to her pale and persistent flesh. Finally the back lacing tore, and she stood there in all her naked glory. Her gargantuan alabaster body shimmered in the broad daylight. Eliza\u2019s hair fell down onto her back in a gentle sea of golden waves and curls. <br>\r\nAt the far court of the castle, the army gathered. Panic in their eyes, increasingly tiny soldiers fell in line. Laughing, Eliza knew, she couldn't be stopped. There was nothing to do for them, but watching her grow,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand grow\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nand grow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling was unbelievably great. Eliza kept concentrating, not wanting the feeling to stop. Her tremendous body continued to expand and stretch upward. Moaning deeply she watched as her shadow grew, covering the puny people down below. Satisfied she realized that her already incredible body was improving even more. Her breasts were growing a bit faster than the rest of her body and became even fuller and perkier- two teardrop-shaped hills, defying gravity. Eliza\u2019s endless long legs were lengthening in proportion, keeping their perfect shape. Suddenly the sensation intensified even more, when her stature received another improvement. While her height growth slowed, she started to gain more and more muscle. Eliza loved it and was pleased to see, that the witch had obeyed her, but none overdone it. From a delicate noble frame she expanded to the athletic stature of an amazon, adding a whole new layer of beauty to her awe inspiring looks. A sexy skeen of muscle covered her body, defined but not massive\u2026 not yet at least.<br>\r\n\u201cMore! More!\u201d she moaned, while she continued to grow more titanic. Her love juices were pouring out all over her inner thighs in a deluge, coating her new bulging leg-muscles. She had turned into a large, powerful, busty and gigantic amazon. The best part was \u2013 she wasn\u2019t done growing\u2026 <br>\r\n</div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lydia adored the sight of her new \"pet\", the way her toes curled as her feet spread further along the courtyard, the way her legs trembled with ecstasy as her fingers found her loins, the way her shield-sized teeth dug into her lips.  The Princess had already outgrown any sense of modesty she ever had.  The combination of overwhelming power and freedom was already enough to leave her salivating, but the growth spurts only shoveled kerosene onto the fire of her libido.  In the village below, the entire population could see Eliza's face rising higher and higher over the walls, followed by her enormous firm breasts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinety feet ... One Hundred Feet ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia allowed the growth spurt to slow down, just enough that Eliza could regain her focus.  Sure enough, as the 80-foot Princess's ascent slowed, her overwhelming ecstasy tempered.  She reopened her eyes and carelessly pulled her hand from her loins, entirely unashamed.  \"Sensational,\" she cooed, her voice reverberating through the courtyard.  \"Why does it feel so <i>sensational </i>to grow bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I wanted it to,\" Lydia winked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More!\" Eliza panted, \"Give me more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have plenty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MORE! NOW!\" Eliza's fury couldn't mask her desperation from Lydia, and the Demon's smile only grew wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it the worst feeling in the world,\" Lydia laughed, \"Getting <i>that</i> close to the grande finale and getting interrupted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Eliza could respond, a volley of arrows flew into her side.  Most of them hit her arm, and feel without having left a scratch.  Some of them collided with her breast, doing exactly as little damage.  But the ineffectiveness of the attack did little to calm Eliza from her already frustrated state.  \"I THOUGHT I MADE THIS CLEAR!\"  Eliza roared like a Titan and barreled over to the forward wall.  Her mother barely had time to duck out of the way of her daughter's enormous feet, big enough to leave craters in the courtyard with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Repeat volley!\" the King, Eliza's father, was yelling at the few holdouts in his retinue.  \"Kill her now!\"  As Eliza stomped to the wall of archers assailing her with arrows to no avail, the King hurled himself down the stairwell out of reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia's jaw fell open with delight as Eliza began to rampage like a petulant beast.  \"There we go,\" Lydia muttered to herself, enjoying the show, \"I love watching you grow bigger and lustier ... but first things first...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Princess's bragging about her utter contempt for other people hadn't been an act; Eliza's rage could be heard in every one of her punches to the barricades and kicks to the foot soldiers.  The ground trembled as men in armor were flattened into the earth by the soles of Eliza's feet.  Guards she had grown up with, guards she had <i>slept</i> with; it made no difference to her, she swatted them like insects all the same.  Eliza had always viewed them as playthings, and now they simply matched the size she expected of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one-hundred-foot Princess made a game of plucking each archer off the high wall one by one, and flinging them with a smooth flick of her wrist.  They screamed as they flew faster than an eagle for hundreds of feet, before landing unceremoniously in the clearing, splattering.  The sight made Eliza giddy, almost <i>overwhelmed</i> with power.  She had often fantasized about the day she'd be Queen, so she could have her servants catapulted from the walls whenever she desired.  Now she was Queen and <i>so much more</i>, and she could toss her subjects herself as easily as a coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DIE DEMON!\" The King's war cry rang hollow as his sword collided with his giant daughter's ankle bone.  He had swung with all his strength, and had still barely drawn blood.  The sound of his men screaming was getting softer, but this only worried him.  He looked up and realized most of his men were already gone.  The few who hadn't been smothered under Eliza's heel or tossed like an unwanted sock were fleeing for their lives.  \"Demon...\" he repeated, no longer a war cry, just a mortified mutter of defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not the Demon, you buffoon, <i>I</i> am!\" Lydia cackled from her vantage point, standing on the ruins of Eliza's balcony.  \"I'm starting to understand why you never left me and your daughter alone in the same room; we get along famously!\"  As the King swung around to see Lydia, Eliza looked down to see her father.   \"Look out, you stupid Monarch!\" Lydia laughed in feign concern.  Eliza's fingers wrapped around him like the iron maiden he had shoved so many peasants into. <br>\r\n \"Too slow!\"  the Demon cackled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia could not believe how easily her vengeance had come.  The seed to topple everything had been resting in Princess Eliza the entire time.  A malevolent tyrant festering, waiting to burst forth like a volcano and smother the land in her fury.  Lydia hadn't created this monster, she simply fed it, gave it what it wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Lydia could see exactly what Eliza wanted as the giant Princess squeezed her father until he popped into a mess in her fingers: more power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen down below shrieked in horror as the giant Princess rubbed her father's remains on the grass nearby.  Leaning over, Eliza's enormous body was no less intimidating.  Her eyes turned to face her mother, and her grin only grew sharper.  \"Go inside and tell the servants,\" Eliza chuckled, \"<i>my</i> servants to get my dinner ready.  I'm going to meet my subjects in town and then maybe grow some more.\"  The sadistic cackle that rose out of Eliza's throat would scar her mother for the rest of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza rose back to her full height and enjoyed the view of her new Kingdom.  She was still frustrated from her interrupted pleasure, but this moment was too important for her to spend pleasuring herself.  She was ready to ensure every living soul in Widowwood would fear her and worship her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget about something?\" Lydia called from the ruined balcony, but Eliza either didn't hear her or pretended not to.  The 100-foot-tall Princess began a casual stroll out of the courtyard, stepping over the lower walls and stepping through what she needed to.  Her audience was waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia couldn't decide how to feel about this.  The King was dead, the Queen was traumatized, the Castle was in ruins that would take a century to repair.  She had achieved her goals, more or less.  But she didn't know how to feel about her new \"pet\" running wild.  </span></div></div>",

Not only was a member of the royal family itself terrorizing the kingdom on her behalf, but now even this overgrown brat of destruction was forced to ask for Lydia's aid. It did strike the mage, however, that this girl might have become a bit too bold for her own good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBest to remind her who was really in control, here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill smiling, Lydia shook her head. \"Oh, not so fast, little Eliza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza's egotistical rant tripped up at this sudden road-block. She'd been so caught up in her newly-christened godhood that she'd completely taken it for granted that Lydia would do as she asked. Admittedly...this was a bit of a bold assumption on the girl's part. She silently chided herself for this carelessness. Still, it wasn't as if her request was unreasonable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slightly more respectful tone, Eliza ventured a simple question. \"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't command me, little Eliza,\" Lydia replied smugly, repeating and stressing the belittling nickname. \"You hold power at my whims, and nothing more. While I do so enjoy your performance so far, and it's met and exceeded all of my expectations...you serve me. If you desire more power, it's time we solidified that fact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Eliza allowed, slowly, contemplating this. \"What would you ask of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bow,\" Lydia replied simply. \"Before the whole kingdom, bow and pledge yourself to me. You may be master of these ants, but I am master of you. At least, I will be if you want to hold onto your new status.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza's cheeks burned a bright scarlet; the giant was filled with rage at the very suggestion. But the mage was correct, to an extent; she held power over Eliza. Perhaps it was worth submitting to one lowly serf for the chance to dominate the rest of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr perhaps she should simply murder the witch then and there. </span></div></div>",

Lydia's smile stayed in place, pleased that everything was going so wonderfully to plan. It's a moment of supreme irony that this was to be her last complete thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she lowered, Eliza's tremendous hand snaked out with lightening speed, violently ripping the mage from her rooftop perch; Eliza knew that Lydia was too dangerous to give any chances to retaliate. In a single fluid motion, she brought the startled woman to her cavernous jaws, and slammed them down upon her, biting the witch's head clear off. Lydia barely had time to comprehend what was happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was to be the end of it; Eliza's original intention was to immediately spit out the disgusting remains and leave them for the dogs. But, to her surprise, she found the warm, albeit comparatively small, spray of blood to be rather enticing. The coppery flavor teased her senses, and she opened her mouth slightly to slide the rest of the body in. She smiled, moaning slightly with satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now,\" she managed, after consuming her hapless victim. \"It seems I've found a new use for you horrid little things.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe implications of this statement sank into the petrified crowd below, and the citizenry finally broke into an absolute panic. A frantic, fleeing mob tried its best to get as far away as possible from the spoiled titan, all sinking into chaos. Eliza chuckled at the sight, drinking in their helplessness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's not as bad as all that,\" she taunted. \"Your god will certainly allow some of you to continue to live, and serve my...my...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it was asking too much for the people below to stop and heed what was happening, any calm observer would be able to tell that something seemed wrong with Eliza. Her eyes fluttered slightly, and she clutched her toned stomach, which churned oddly. A wave of fear passed over her, as she realized she had no idea what was happening to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she had, it wouldn't have been fear, but mindless joy, which consumed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevouring Lydia's body also equated to devouring Lydia's power; Eliza was getting the additional energy she'd initially demanded, and then some. Moaning in ecstasy, she rolled her head back in completely bliss. When she regained herself and looked down again, there was a change in her. Her blonde hair was now positively golden, complimenting the radiance that seemed to flow from her skin. The true terror, however, was in her eyes; all black, with a crimson iris. She smiled slowly, revealing a pair of demonic fangs which peeked over her lower lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm,\" she purred. \"You scurrying ants just missed the most important event in the history of the world: my true ascension. Oh, well. It's not as if any of you will live to tell the tale...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Princess Eliza stood out on her balcony, gazing out at the vast expanse of land that existed outside the castle walls, she let out a depressed sigh. She was beginning to grow tired of spending her days like this. Her father never let her leave the castle, and she hardly had any time to herself. Every day was spent being tutored by the many scholars who had been hired by the king. He wanted to raise her to become a proper and refined young lady, one who would be fit to one day rule as the queen of his land when he passed away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Eliza didn't want any of that. All that she wanted was to be a normal girl, to go out into town and play with other girls her age. But no, instead she was forced to do as her father said. She was a prisoner in her own home, and she wanted nothing more than to break free and see the world. And perhaps have a little sweet revenge on her bullheaded father for refusing to let her be herself. Sadly, Eliza knew that this would never happen. She was seen as a princess before she was seen as a person, so her father would never allow her to fulfill her own dreams. Knowing that dwelling on the subject any further would be pointless, Eliza decided to return to her room and simply go to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into her room from the balcony, however, Eliza found herself greeted by a shocking sight: standing before her in the middle of her bedroom was another woman, one who was completely naked and had small horns growing from her forehead. Eliza gasped in surprise as she gazed upon this mysterious woman, and she began to take in just how stunning she looked. Her skin was absolutely flawless, her breasts and her butt were both quite large, her body had the most luscious curves imaginable, and her hair flowed down from her head like an endless ocean of ebony strands. It was then that the princess began to recognize something about the woman standing before her. She may have just been imagining things, but this woman looked a lot like Lydia, the powerful mage that her father had banished for studying the secrets of dark magic.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\"What an idiot he was...\"</i> Eliza thought to herself,<i> \"Dark magic or not, if it could have been used to bring about an even greater age of prosperity in our kingdom, then I don't see what's so bad about it.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza's thoughts were interrupted by the sultry voice of her nude guest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why hello there, Princess. Remember me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you happen to be Lydia? The one that my father banished back when I was 8?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that would be me. And I'm sure that you can assume what I'm back here for after all these years, right?\" Lydia said, grinning maliciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess, you want to get revenge on my father for neglecting the potential of your research and banishing you when you had never done anything wrong, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be correct.\" Lydia said, clapping her hands to congratulate the princess on her detective work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well in that case, I'd like to make a request.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're going to beg me for mercy, don't bother. I want to make that pathetic excuse for a king miserable, and what better way to do that than to eliminate his one and only daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, that's not quite it. You see, unlike my idiot of a father, I'm smart enough to appreciate the potential of what you've got going on. I want in.\" Eliza said, a devious grin forming on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Are you serious? You, the princess of the kingdom, what to side with me, a dark mage who plans to kill your father and take control for myself?! Am I hearing this correctly?!\" Lydia said, completely surprised by Eliza's request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! I'm sick of being locked up in this castle all my life! I want to go out and see the world, to be my own person! My father never saw me for who I really am, he only saw me as his precious princess and his heir to the throne! I want to make him pay! He truly is a fool, and this kingdom deserves a better ruler than him. One who isn't afraid to take risks. And you, Lydia, you have real ambition! Trying to harness the power of dark magic and use it for good was a noble ideal. My father had no right to do what he did to you, and if I were the one in control, I would have definitely rewarded you for all the hard work you did for our kingdom. You have every right to be furious with my father after what he did to you, and I think that he deserves everything that you plan to dish out. So I'll ask you one more time: let me join you on your quest for revenge. I promise that you won't be disappointed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia simply stood there and smiled. She had never expected an outcome like this. And now she could do something even more painful to the king than killing his precious daughter: She could take his daughter on as her apprentice and let <i>her</i> be the one to kill him! How deliciously ironic it would be. His own flesh and blood daughter, taking the side of an exiled witch who was planning to overthrow his kingdom. It would be the ultimate blow to his pride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, Princess, I shall accept your deal. From now on, you will no longer be Eliza, princess of Widowwood. From this moment forth, you shall be known as Eliza, supreme princess of darkness! Now step forward, my new apprentice, and receive your new master's wicked blessing!\" Lydia said, Laughing maniacally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a dark grin on her face, the princess began to approach the dark mage. As she approached, Lydia reached out her hand. Nodding in agreement, Eliza took that witch's hand and held it tightly. As soon as she did so, she felt her body being filled with an unbelievable amount of power. It was like nothing she had ever experienced before. As the dark energy flowed through her being, Eliza felt her body beginning to change. Much like Lydia, Eliza's figure was the first thing to be improved. Any excess fat on her body vanished instantly, having been relocated to the ideal locations of her breasts and butt. Her skin began to take on a beautiful tan, and her eyes changed from an alluring hazel to the same vibrant red as Lydia's own. Lastly, a pair of small demonic horns appeared from her forehead as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The contract has been completed!\" Lydia shouted out victoriously, knowing that the king's only daughter now belonged to her. \"So, my princess of darkness, welcome to your new life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, my queen. I swear that you will not be disappointed with your decision.\" Eliza said, giving a polite bow to her new master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes... I do believe that this is the beginning of a beautiful partnership.\" Lydia said, a sadistic smile formed on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Perhaps Lydia shouldn't have been as gleefully demonic as she had been, for a loud rapping soon echoed through the chamber; someone was knocking on the door. \"My lady,\" a clear voice called out. \"Is everything all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza's face showed a moment's surprise, before breaking into a smile. \"My dear queen,\" she whispered to Lydia. \"Could you please make yourself less noticeable? I don't wish to alarm anyone just yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia frowned slightly. \"Why not just kill him and be done with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but my queen, I do so like this one,\" Eliza insisted. Lydia decided to comply with her request, concealing herself behind a chest of drawers while Eliza opened her chamber door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man on the other side of the door was Eliza's personal guard, a young paladin known as Arro. He was a tall, rather lanky young man with thick blond hair and piercing blue eyes. As one of the royal guards, he was also clean-shaven, and a bit more well-groomed than a soldier might be expected to be. As they were currently safe within the palace walls, he wore no armor, but a crimson dress uniform, with a sword ready at his hip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard noises, my lady,\" he noted. \"Unusual sounds. I became concerned...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza smiled. \"You're always so concerned for me, my dear solider,\" she said, gesturing him to enter. \"I was observing something of interest in the courtyard. Take a look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArro was still alert; he thought he'd heard a second voice in Eliza's chamber. Further, something about her attitude, her bearing, seemed off. Eliza had quite a temper, and was often quite rude to him. It was odd to see her so well-behaved. Even aside from all that, something seemed...off about her in general. She was backlit by the sunlight from the balcony, and Arro couldn't see the changes to her figure. Cautious, he entered the room at her request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gesture, Eliza used her new powers to slam the door shut behind him. Arro was immediately startled. \"What is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wouldn't get a chance to finish, as Eliza brutally shoved him against the wall, eyes glowing. Her strength was insane, and Arro was temporarily knocked breathless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So sorry for the rough treatment, my dear soldier,\" she whispered. \"But I don't know my own strength, sometimes. What I do know is, you are a fine, fine specimen of a man. And I do appreciate how you look after me, even when I get into one of my moods. Let me show my appreciation. Have you wanted to do this? Because I have, for some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Arro could object, Eliza locked her lips with his, moaning softly. She'd had a little crush on the guard ever since her father had assigned him to her, and now, with her inhibitions completely burned away by Lydia's magic, she was going to do what she'd often fantasized about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia, meanwhile, sighed with irritation. For this, the princess had delayed her plans? Was it worthwhile to allow this indulgence?</span></div></div>",

He was enough to satisfy her last time, and should she need any more power he would be the perfect victim. Lydia smiled a predatory smile. Yes, this could be a good idea. But there was always the possibility he was stronger than her.<br>\r\n\"Nonsense!\" Lydia exclaimed. Banishing the thought, she prepared to set out if only to prove herself the stronger one.<br>\r\n\"Although there are others, who would be a somewhat safer bet,\" she murmured quietly. This required an internal admission of weakness to another, and Lydia the god did not like this sentiment. And besides, a lowly prison guard who had helped her escape a vengeful king or even the dragonslayers who had brought her to the king were nothing compared to her. She demanded a true rival!</span></div></div>",

Certainly, there couldn't be a better way to welcome her new self than to reunite with her old mentor, and former flame. Lord Dante, as he was known, was descended from a long and decadent family line, which lived in their expansive estate deep in the forest. Of course, what many in Widowwood didn't suspect was that Dante was a vampire; indeed, the last three generations of his \"family\" had simply been Dante adapting different guises to displace suspicion about his true nature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia had discovered the truth about him quite by accident, but Dante had been amused by her interest in the dark arts, and gladly supported her. There had also been some... indiscretions. Lydia wasn't proud of her affair with him, particularly when she realized that it was simply a game to him, carrying no emotional weight. Still, his knowledge and training had been invaluable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got further into the forest, Lydia began to ruminate on the bad times, as well. Although a skillful dark mage, Dante was incredibly vain and arrogant. Indeed, one of the reasons he hadn't become as skilled as she had with his magic is because his immortality and decadence robbed him of any great need to improve his skills. No, Dante took much more pleasure in getting hangers-on like a young Lydia to fawn over his skills. And when Lydia's skills reached a level that meant teaching her further would require actual effort on Dante's part, his simply discarded her. At the time, she'd been crushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" she mused to herself, as his estate came into view; as always, it was so deep in the forest that the huge trees completely obscured sunlight from reaching its grounds. \"Perhaps it's my turn to crush him. Turnabout is fair play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she decided, that may be too far. She could still enjoy her body with him. Or...perhaps he could turn her. Adding the abilities of a vampire to her own demonic powers would certainly produce...interesting results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed to decide, soon. She was approaching the doors to his mansion.</span></div></div>",

When she knocked on the massive oaken doors to Dante's mansion she was worried they might burst into flame. Somewhat disappointingly, the only results were three sharp taps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one's home,\" Dante called, his voice still familiar after all these years. Lydia was disgusted and unsurprised at his response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me,\" Lydia called, contemplating just destroying the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's me? I've seen a lot of 'me's in my time. Did I kill someone you knew? If so, I'm sorry. There, you can put down your pitchforks and go home now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's Lydia. You remember your eager apprentice don't you?\" Lydia called, trying to sound seductive while controlling her inner loathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, I can literally hear the pitchforks. I said I'm sorry and I won't eat any of your family again. Now leave please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Lydia resorted to her second to last plan.<br>\r\n\"I'm naked.\" Silence reverberated from within the mansion. Heavy furniture shifted and there was muted mumbling. Something fell with a crash, and she could hear Dante swearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a coincidence! So am I!\" Dante said, phasing through the doorway. His eager grin faded, seeing Lydia fully clad, if somewhat scantily. His pale features hardened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get really tired of your lies, temptress. Mayhaps it's time I taught you some respect, ungrateful wench\" Dante ranted. A pair of fangs descended from his upper teeth, telegraphing his wishes for Lydia. Finally fed up, she grabbed the vampire's throat and walked backwards. He laughed, fading through the door again. Lydia kept walking, her hand still firmly attached to his ethereal neck. He stopped laughing when her hand reached the doors, and they disentigrated at her touch. His fangs quickly retracted, and his eyes gained a new look in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems you've gotten better. Maybe you're ready for the higher lessons,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd do well to stop talking. I'm not here to learn from you, I'm hear to teach you a few lessons,\" Lydia snapped, her patience at an end. As her anger was unleashed the room darkened and heat drained from the air. With a wave of her hand, she placed the vampire in a chair. Strutting around the room, Lydia examined the relics on display. Dante now seemed distinctly uncomfortable. Finally, Lydia walked up to him. He'd stopped trying to move, trying to seem as comfortable in his current position as possible. She knew better. Leaning in close, she whispered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know how much I hate you?\"<br>\r\n\"Not a clue. More or less than Widowwood?\"<br>\r\n\"Enough to want you dead.\"<br>\r\n\"Is that more?\"<br>\r\n\"I want to skin you alive.\"<br>\r\n\"Getting a definite 'more' vibe here.\"<br>\r\n\"Now, I can do just that. I will have my revenge.\"<br>\r\n\"Under normal circumstances, I'd be worried.<br>\r\n\"We're not in a great position to mock your captor, are we Dante?\" Lydia said, smiling sweetly.<br>\r\n\"Most certainly not. In fact, I should grovel. But you're going to sleep with me before we're done tonight. That's how it usually works. You have no idea how many vampire hunters that works on. Almost none looked quite as eager as you though.\"<br>\r\nLydia had had enough. Incapable of restraining herself, she forced his neck to break. Dante went limp, head dangling at impossible angles. She instantly cursed herself for such foolishness. With a kick, she sent the body shattering against the far wall. She sat in the chair, thinking about widowood. She'd be much more patient there. So lost in thought was she, Lydia didn't look at the vampire's body. When two icy hands landed on her shoulders, she almost launched through the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear Lydia, you haven't changed a bit. Still that enormous temper, still so easy to use. You are no stranger to the dark arts, you should know my kind. I am a ruthless monster. Only a man can kill a monster. And you,\" he smirked, holding up one of her hands. It pulsed with magical energy. \"Are most certainly not a man.\" With that, Lydia found herself back at her own lair. Smiling foolishly, she allowed the lesson to sink in. To cover the shame of her defeat, she decided it was time for Widowwood to be erased. But her new magic gave her wonderful possibilities. How would she grind out every spark of life in the hated town?</span></div></div>",

These places were sometimes barbaric and backwards, but more often than not, they were simply strange. Lydia's personal favorite was a world that had ignored magic entirely. Rather than focus on the mystic arts, its people focused on technology and science; in some ways, their society was more advanced than the one Lydia knew. But in other ways, it was helplessly vulnerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike, say, by an attack from an unknown magic force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling viciously at the prospect of destroying a world unaware, Lydia chanted the spell to transport her to this new world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does she appear in our world?</span></div></div>",

No, these ones were massive skyscrapers, so huge that they all but dwarfed even the biggest buildings from back in her own world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there were the streets, which were practically overflowing with people, many of whom where driving around in strange horseless carriages made of metal. Truly, the world she had entered was an impressive one, and it's technological advances put those of her own world to shame many times over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this society had made one critical mistake: they had neglected the study of the magical arts. As great as their technology was, there was no amount of technology in the world that could outmatch the limitless potential of magic. A single powerful mage could easily make short work of any weapons that this society possessed, and bring this world to its knees with very little effort. And of course, there was no greater mage in this or any other world than the newly empowered Lydia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling evilly to herself, Lydia began to consider her options. Surely she was capable of conquering this pathetic world at any time she wished, but it would be a shame to come all the way to another world without first taking some time to enjoy the new sights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n So the question was raised: Should Lydia conquer this world immediately and put its people in their rightful place beneath her, or should she set aside her ambitions for a moment and simply enjoy the new surroundings?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was somewhat cautious, assuming her to be either schizophrenic or perhaps on drugs, and potentially dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, do you think you could get some clothes on?\" he asked. Lydia regarded him coldly. And then she struck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than a second, she covered the distance from herself to the officer, and plunged her hand directly into his chest. As his expression turned to one of inhuman horror, she pulled her hand out, clutching his heart. The officer fell over, dead.

It was only then that she had realized two very important things. First of all, she was standing in a dark, hidden alley with only one exit, blocked by the oncoming men. Second of all, she was buck naked. Her revitalization process and her subsequent dimensional travel left little time for donning some clothes. Lydia's beautiful form was on full display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were gonna rob you, you know,\" said the man again. He was tall, with tan skin and a small combat knife in his hand.

The combat knife in his hands wouldn't have even broken her skin. Instead, she was more focused on how she should deal with these soon-to-be-dead thugs. Her goddess instincts were urging her to unleash her full power and rise to a gigantic height to deal with the three. On the other hand, she felt that she could easily handle them at her regular size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA third, and final option was to let them have their way with her. The residual energy from her ascension had driven her libido into high gear. Beads of moisture formed at her pussy as she eyed the bulges through the men's pants.

She proceeded to reach back and spread her cheeks apart, exposing her tight little asshole and quivering pussy. The men, dicks removed from their pants, froze in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" the leader sputtered, his eleven inch cock twitching in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you waiting for something?

As she had commanded, the leader took a spot behind her, placing the head of his cock against her asshole. The other two shuffled to her front, one placing his member against her plump lips and the other letting it rest against the palm of her right hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you waiting for boys? Go!\" Lydia yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt her word, the three began their fuckings in unison. Lydia would have gasped as she felt the thick, coffee-mug thick cock pierce her tight anus if not for the fact that she had another rod being jammed through her lips and to the back of her throat. Her basic instincts took hold as she began to gyrate her hips, pump her neck, and stroke the third mans cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia was impressed at how expertly she had managed to turn what was going to be a rape into her own personal fucking session. She was in full control of what was going on and, unbeknownst to the three men she was pleasing, it was about to get a lot worse for them. Deadly, even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of the magical energies present within and around Lydia, it didn't take long for the men to reach their climax. They exploded simultaneous, squirting their thick, milky seed into Lydia's colon, down her throat, and onto the ground below her. The fluid going down her throat was particularly sour and awful, but that didn't bother her much for they were about to meet their end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spit out the dick in her mouth and let go of the one in her hand as they continued to guzzle out their seed. Only the man behind her remained trapped. They were too overwhelmed by pleasure to realize that something was going horrible wrong. It started with their muscles and fat; they melted away as Lydia's magic converted them into seamen to fuel their continuing orgasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took only a minute for them to burn through that, leaving them almost skeletal and looking like victims of starvation. But it didn't end there; their bodies proceeded to shrink whole as their entire mass was converted into that thick fluid. Their forms shrunk down, down, down until they finally disappeared into their clothes, leaving behind only a disembodied cock. Those two finally came to an end, exploding into a mess of the stuff. All that remained was a large puddle of cum surrounded by two sets of clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man behind Lydia had lost his muscles and fat, like the first two, but had yet to shrink. Lydia howled with laughter as she shoved her ass back, bringing him to the ground. The pool of cum slowly drained under and around him as he continued to spurt his own seed inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spending time with you friends, are we\" she said, laughing even harder. \"This is what happens when you mess with a Goddess. But don't worry, your death will be much worse than theirs. I could have turned you into that foulness like I did to them, but I have a better idea. See, since your so conveniently stuck in my ass, I figured I could just sit here and let you shrink slowly. That way you'll gradually be crushed under my weight, guaranteeing you a painful death, no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man grunted and struggled but a quick elbow to his emaciated gut stopped him in his tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or, I was thinking I could let you shrink small enough that I could swallow you whole. I could even add some air to my stomach and light to let you really suffer. Let you feel the full power of my hungry gut. Actually, I don't know why I'm explaining this to you. I'm not going to let you decided anyways. You know what? How about we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
