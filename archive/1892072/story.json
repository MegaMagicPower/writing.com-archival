But soon you will watch the fear in their eyes. When trained to tap into your power, your fame will spread throughout the universe. You will see the fiercest warriors, flee your presents. Armies brought to their knees- entire nations, crumble at the mere mention of your name. You will know power you would've never known on earth: never again, will you be lost. From now on you will stand with The Light. forever The Light. Only The Light.\"<br>\r\nas the man spoke, he had continued to advance. At some point, you had begun to back away.

You could feel the life-force all around you.<br>\r\nSo young, so vibrant.<br>\r\nThe skeletons that were moving the last of your things into place, suddenly shuttered.<br>\r\nYou quickly shook off the desire to drain the life of the area.<br>\r\nWhile Oskuria College had taught you both light and dark magic, you had always preferred dark.<br>\r\nIt likely had something to do with your past living in the shadows of a city.<br>\r\nDark magic LOVED life energy, much like how a great white shark loved bleeding fish.<br>\r\nlight magic, on the other hand, LOVED shadows. For how could light exist without the darkness there for it to shine against.<br>\r\nThus a balance was formed.<br>\r\nA knock at the door drew your attention.<br>\r\nyou wave your hand and the skeletons dissolved into nothing.<br>\r\n\"enter.\" your tone was even and tempered as you fought the exhilaration from the magic.<br>\r\nthe door opened and an older woman stood in the doorway.<br>\r\nHeadmistress Faragonda. <br>\r\n\"you're late. The students have been waiting.\" she said, slightly cross.<br>\r\n\"yes ma'am.\" you say evenly.<br>\r\nGathering your supplies, you hurry out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you entered, you could feel the eyes of the students on you. Some hungry, others curious, most just eager.<br>\r\nAs you approach the board, you recall the subject you were to teach. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My name is Rayne, and I am a witch, or I thought I was. I'm was a freshman at CloudTower. I have three sisters, Icy, Darcy, and Stormy, in whose shadows I thought I was living. Well, that's what most of the other students are saying, my sisters are seniors, soon to be graduates, but you see there's a bit of a snag. Our mom hid a bit of a secret from our dad, he was warlock, she was a fairy. My sisters are swimming in dad's end of the gene pool, and to an extent so am I, but I draw my winx more from my mother's side of the family.I wish I had known that sooner. It started in the third week of school, I was on my way to Professor Grimwhicks class, when I got blocked my Madusa of Serpentia, a real witch and I don't mean that as a complement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the baby trixter is by by herself today.\" she said with a smug tone, \"Too bad for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madusa, I don't have time for you right now.\" I replied trying to channle as much of Icy as I could, Icy just had a way of making people not want to be anywhere near you. which at the moment was my desired objective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, how cute,\" She teased, \"You're pretending to be Icy now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low growl escaped my lips, i was so deathly sick of people compairing me to my sisters, I already had a long discussion with Miss Griffin, which ended with her saying that she expected me to be just as vile as my sisters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, did I get the ickle firsty angry? do something about it, you miserable excuse for a witch.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI threw a raging witch ball at her, \"I JUST SAID I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR YOU!\" I screetched, \"AND QUIT COMPAIRING ME TO MY SISTERS! I'M NOT THEM AND I NEVER WILL BE!\"  And that would be when my beloved sisters chose to show up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Icy said, \"that was the loudest i ever heard you get.\" Darcy and stormy were standing there tight lipped and wide eyed clearly they had never seen me lose my temper either, Icy tried to say something else, probably to calm me down, but I was too wound up to hear. Correction I heard, but didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AND YOU THREE!\"  I shouted turning on them, \"HOW DARE YOU TRY TO MAKE ME BE YOU! NEWS FLASH SISTERS I-AM-NOT-YOU! SO STOP TRYING TO MAKE ME BE YOU!\" I suddenly felt a surge of energy flowing through me, everything went white and then black. That continued for a few more moments, before it cleared, and when it did I found myself looking down at my sisters. Who were looking surprised, but Icy actually looked more horror struck than surprised. it was then that i felt them, the wings,and I knew what miss Griffin did to faires found on campus. With out warning, Icy grabbed my arm and transported us back to my dorm. Now up until this moment I had no clue that our mom was a fairy, but Icy apparently knew the whole story.<br>\r\n\"Icy?\" I asked cautiously as she packed a room packing spell, \"What's going on? Why did I just grow wings and flutter like a pixie?\" Icy turned back to me with actual tears in her eyes, \"I'm so sorry,\" she said, \"I should have told you this sooner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should have told me what sooner, Icy, what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It all started when mom met dad,\" Icy explained quickly, \"dad is as you know a warlock from Valisto nine, but mom well, y'see here's the thing, mom wasn't a witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she wasn't a sorceress either...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy we were narrowing down possibilities weren't we? If mom wasn't a witch or a sorceress, that only left...<br>\r\nOh no.<br>\r\n\"Please tell me that mom wasn't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saddly, you're proof that she was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur mom died when she had me, since then dad was like super distant and almost hateful towards me, like it was my fault mom died? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did daddy know?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not until mom had you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found out when mom was pregnant with you.\" she replied, \"she made me swear not to tell, and to protect you at all costs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because when she first got pregnant she had a vision,\"Icy said, as she ushered me to the passage way that she, darcy, and Stormy always used to break into Alphea, \"A vision of you, she told me that you would grow to become one of the most powerful beings in the universe. And there's something else you may want to know about mom, she was the princess of Valisto. She gave up the throne when she married dad. but Her vision showed you sitting on the Valistan throne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be right,\" I protested trying to process this, \"I'm not a princess, the fairy part I have no choice but to buy,but I belong here in cloud tower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Rayney,\" Icy replied as she handed me my pack, \"But you're more fairy than witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Icy I'm sorry I yelled at you earlier,\" I said trying not to cry, trying to accept a hard truth, \"I didn't mean it and madusa got me so mad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, sis it's all right,\" Icy replied, \"We should have tried to make you like us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye Icy, tell darcy and stormy that I love them,\" I whispered, \"And try to stay out of trouble I wanna be around when you do something wicked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIcy laughed, as she gave me one final hug, \"Perhaps there's hope for you as a witch yet.\" she whispered back, \"Now go, I can hear griffin.\"<br>\r\nBefore the portal closed, Icy pressed a letter into my hand, adressed to fairagonnda, from my mother. When I reached Alphea it was nearly nightfall, and when I stepped out of the tunnle the first person I bumped into was horribly mean looking woman. <br>\r\n\"What are you doing in the tunnles young woman? Were have you come from?And who are you?\" she demanded, sheesh and I thought Miss Griffin was scary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Rayne Trixmen, I was in the tunnles because i was coming from cloud tower,but if you'll plea-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CLOUD TOWER! MOST UNEXCEPTABLE! COME WITH ME AT ONCE MISS FAIRAGONNDA WILL DEAL WITH YOU!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis horrible, must have some troll blood in her somewhere, woman lead me to the head mistresses office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This witch was was caught trying to break into the school.\" she informed a neat looking older woman who was seated behind a desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older woman reguarded me with a considering eye, \"I see, thank Grizelda I shall take it from here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Grizelda left, the woman sat as silently as i stood, before finally motioning for me to sit down. Truthfully I was scared, I knew what miss Griffin did to fairies caught in cloudtower, but what did Miss Fairagonnda do to supposed witched who 'broke' into cloud tower?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has been along time since I have seen a grandaughter of Titianna.\" she said finally breaking the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked, as I remembered the letter and placed it on her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is all right there in the letter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it is adressed to you.\" I replied, appauld at the thought of reading a letter from my mother to miss fairagonnda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But sometimes things are not always as they appear.\" she replied as she opened the letter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr should I say letters, one for miss fairagonnda, and one for me. As miss fairagonnda read her letter I poured silently over mine:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><i>'My dearest Rayne,<br>\r\nNo doubt by now, you have gotten your winx, and more importantly, your wings. I hope that by now the truth has been made clear to you by your father,or at the very least your sister Icy. If not then I shall explain as best I can in this letter, I was the princess of Valisto nine, my parents disowned me when I fell in love with your father. A warlock of the realm.do not think that i was disowned becuase your father is a warlock, he simply wasn't rich. But wealth meant nothing to me, your father loved me very much. I never quite told him that I was a fairy. I hope that I can after I have had you, my darling, but if your are reading this than I never quite got the chance. Valisto nine is a realm near the planet that once was sparks, our magix is strong my love, stong and fiery, just like i know you are. By this time I've no doubt that you are in alphea and that miss fairagonnda has gotten my letter, i know that you are very confused right now my darling, but try to understand you are destined for great things. And always remember, no matter what happens, you always have your sisters, and they will always protect you.'</i></span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up from my letter, tears in my eyes, \"So I am something in between.\" I whispered, \"That would explain why my dad hates me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"your father doesn't hate you child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've obviously not met my father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps not, but I do know that it is impossible to hate your child, now then, every thing seems to be in order,so then I'll have someone show you to your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you ma'am.\" I said,realizing that she didn't expect me to be like my class mates,or my sisters. What she expected was for me to be me.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>October 31st. All Hallows Eve, or rather, more commonly referred to as Halloween. On that very night, where almost everyone was going out in costume, my life was changed...forever. While the average teenager would either stay indoors and watch a horror movie or go out to a Halloween costume party, I was out there. In the dark. Tagging a wall or two with graffiti. Like I said before, I wasn't the perfect child my parents wanted, but I definitely knew how to not get caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut..when I got a call from my dad, the last thing I remember him speaking to me, was him saying that someone or something was attacking them. But before he could speak anymore, the line was cut. Although I was merely a 16 year old teenage rebel to my own parents, I...I still cared about them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo in worry, I just packed up my spray cans into my pack and hurried toward. Unfortunately, by the time I got back home....it looked like a bomb went off inside, as the front of my house was blown apart. Out of some form of concern, I went through the wreckage and found my dad, bloodied and on the brink of death. As I tried to get him back on his feet, he screamed in pain, forcing me to put him back down, then I looked at him and said, \"Come on, D. I'm getting you out of here!\" \"*coughing blood* It's no use, kid. I'm in no condition to get up, those 3....witches already k-killed your mom, and banged me up real good.\" My dad answered, feeling the pain I saw him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when he told me that Mom was killed by 3 witches and blew up the front of our home, I...I was shocked back then. At first, I thought he was joking about witches blowing up the house as I replied, \"Dad, now's not the time to crack a damn joke! Where's Mom?!\" That was when I felt the blood coming from Dad's abdomen and....seeing my Mom's lifeless body on the debris-coated floor. I went over to her and shook her body repeatedly, saying, \"Come on, Mom! Wake up! WAKE UP DAMMIT!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack then, I felt my own hands shaking out of grief and fear, seeing a loved one dead was....traumatic for me. Hearing the painful grunting noises from my dad made me instinctively reel back to him, as I looked him in the eyes and said, \"Nonono! Dad, you are not dying, you hear me?!\" \"*painful grunt* Forget about saying those words, Dalton. I was a dead man walking when your mother and I took you in as our son.\" My dad replied, which made me greatly confused as to why he was saying this to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell, Dad?! Why are you even saying this crap to me?! I'm your son!\" I asked him, wanting answers as to why he was saying his final words. \"I know that!! But...you're not my biological son.\" I heard him answer to me. And it was the first nail on the coffin on my old life, which left me completely lost in both confusion of what my dad was telling me, and the fact that his life was slipping from my fingertips, as my voice cracked a bit, holding back tears for the inevitable was approaching, and I said, \"W-What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Painful and bloody cough* The c-cello case...open it.\" My dad said to me, asking that I open that cello case he bought for Mom, but she never uses it. At the time, I wasn't sure why he wanted me to open it, but as I approached the case and tried to open it, the case had fell over onto it's side. From there, when I undid the clasps on the case, it flipped wide before me, revealing.....</span></div></div>",

It didn't look like a traditional scythe farmers would use, as I noticed the jet black steel rod that's connected to the serrated scythe blade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike a normal scythe, it did not have those handles on the sides, which looked like it was meant to be wielded like a spear, since there appeared to be a smooth but wicked-looking spearhead on the other end of the rod, which looked to be around 5 to 6 feet long from where I was standing. \"You were dropped on our doorstep when you were still a baby, along with that scythe and a note saying to not give you that until you *painful and bloody cough* you were old enough to know the truth *bloody cough*.\" My dad said to me, answering why I was seeing a scythe that came straight of some stylized anime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, I turned my head to look at him and replied, \"So what? Are you saying that I'm actually the son of the Grim Reaper, is that it?!\" \"*painful and bloody cough* Truth can be stranger than fiction, son.\" My dad answered to me, just as his injuries took an ever bigger toll on him, causing blood to drool down his mouth a bit, as I quickly went to him, kneeling down to face the man I once called my 'Dad'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if you and Mom aren't my real parents, I'm not leaving you here to die!\" I said to him, as I tried to move my foster dad once again, only he screamed even louder than last time, just as we then heard the sound of multiple explosions just behind my damaged house. Left with no other choice but to leave him there to die, I set him back against the wall, where he put his bruised arms around me in a final embrace and replied, \"Even...even though you're not m-my real son, I was proud to call you one...Dalton.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the fire in my supposed father's soul died out, I couldn't hold back the tears anymore, feeling the grief that came with losing the two people I deemed as my parents, now an orphan. However, moments after standing up from my foster Dad's deceased body, I no longer felt sadness and grief, but a swelling rage and bloodlust for vengeance. I wanted to hunt down the bastards who did this to my family, and make them pay, and give them a slowly painful death!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I clenched my fists, I then turned my head to look at the scythe, still laying on the debris-coated floor, tempting me to pick it up and take vengeance. In anger, I aggressively reached for the scythe, grabbing the metal rod handle, as I yanked the weapon upright. From there....</span></div></div>",

And on a scale between 1 to 10, it felt like someone just shoved my brain into a blender at full speed, as I instantly let go of the scythe and grabbed the sides of my head with both hands from the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the process, I painfully screamed as if I was being burnt alive, as I kept banging my body into several different stuff inside my wrecked home, now knowing how it feels if someone was trying to use psychic powers to control me, begging for the pain to stop hammering my vital organ. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as I let out one final painful scream, arching my back and screaming into the dusty air, I felt...something wash over my face. I couldn't see what it was, because I wasn't even able to see what it was, as I collapsed onto my knees when the pain receded. Moments after my skull-splitting headache, I then got back up onto my feet to grab the remains of a mirror, whose reflection was cracked in several different areas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, I carefully wiped the dust off to get a better look, but what I saw in front of me was something....different.

I mean, my left eye was perfectly intact and still jade green, but I couldn't say the same for my right eye, as the eye color had changed from it's usual look that I was so used to seeing, to an undead purple hue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" Was all I could muster in words, as I slowly moved my right hand up to my face to see if I wasn't seeing things. Unfortunately, I wasn't seeing things, my right eye had changed, and it wasn't going away anytime soon. Trying to regain my grasp on reality, I stood back up on my feet and went toward the back door.

But when my right hand touched his head, I felt another surge of energy rush through me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't stop it, as my eyes opened the widest as they possibly could, with me screaming at the top of my lungs from the pain clashing inside my mind. From there, I wasn't sure what I was seeing, but I was....I was looking inside my deceased Dad's mind! It was then I beared witness as to who or what attacked my supposed parents; 3 women. I couldn't tell very well, but they appeared to be a little older than me. They had these glowing accessories on one part of their bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I looked at the events unfolding from my Dad's point of view, he fought back against them, but with no success, as the one woman summoned ice to knock him down. But as she held my foster Dad by his throat, I got a better look at the face of my parents' murderers. She had icy blue-white hair arranged into a ponytail that reached just above her thighs, along with these ice cold pale blue eyes. They say that \"the eyes are the windows to the soul\", but from what I could tell from this woman's eyes, her heart must be as cold as ice if she had enjoyed giving other people grief and misery, displaying a pair of dark blue eyeshadow around her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround her neck, she wore a glowing blue necklace, which somehow spelled out bad news in my opinion. She wore what appeared to be a dull navy blue one-piece suit, with a blue cape attached to the suit, along with wearing a pair of dark blue boots. The suit had fingerless gloves, showing her dark blue fingernails on full display. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe expression on this woman's face was that of an evil grin, as her cold fingers clenched around my Dad's throat. I couldn't understand what they were saying due to Dad just being dead very recently, but after seeing the 3 women leave out the back door, I was brought back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI...I couldn't believe what I just saw; those 3 women were real witches! But...they didn't look like the witches people would regularly see in pop culture, you know, flying on broomsticks, having green skin and a disgusting appearance, you get what I mean. In that very moment, I wasn't sure what to believe in anymore, now that I knew that magic actually does exist outside of cheap magic tricks and dangerous life-threatening stunts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, I knew one thing for certain; I now knew the face of one of these witches who murdered my family in cold blood, along with her name....Icy. I was unsure of what I did to get inside my Dad's head like that, but I knew that my Dad was right: he and Mom weren't actually my real parents. In fact, I wasn't even sure if I was human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut one thing's for sure; I felt angry, I felt like I wanted to put this \"Icy\" bitch through Hell, slowly and painfully, whether she wanted to feel the heat or not! But then....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>And speaking of that heartless witch, I heard her ice cold voice outside my back door. And it wasn't just that sadistic bitch's voice I heard outside, there were others outside. And from the sounds of things, they weren't exactly friends of hers. However, one of the voices I recognized belonged to a neighbor of mine, Bloom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't sure what was going on here, but I was only focused on avenging my parents to even care, as I grabbed the scythe with my left hand, and angrily walked toward the back door. But then, noticing my Dad's handgun on the ground, I picked up the gun and unlatched the holster around my Dad's waist, attaching it around my jeans, then checking how many bullets were left before bolstering the gun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Dad. But I think I might need this more than you right now.\" I said to his dead body, ready to put a bullet in between that Witch's eyes. However, as I put the hood on my jacket over my head, I noticed Icy putting her foot down on a girl's neck, restraining her from getting up, along with the perfect opportunity to deliver a boot to Icy's face. I mean, I could clearly see Icy in plain view outside my door!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could hear Bloom's voice yelling at Icy to let that girl's go, which made me think that the girl's was a friend of hers. Seeing that sadistic grin on Icy's face as she grinded her heel on the girl's neck made my blood boil to the breaking point, causing me to grind my teeth in rage as I growled, \"ICYYYY!\" That was when I completely and utterly snapped, as I when into a full-on sprint, magic scythe in hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ICY!!!!\" I roared at Icy, just as I came out of the doorway and delivered a mid-air spinning heel kick to that bitch's face, causing Icy to launch backwards just a few yards away from where I stood. It was weird, I was known to have a athletic but scrawny physique, and yet, I just one of my parents' killers flying. Whatever that scythe did to me, I felt faster, stronger, and more powerful than ever! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the scary part of it; it felt so damn good. I didn't who else was behind me, but apparently Bloom had some friends, some were girls like her, while a few of them were actually a part of the opposite sex. I noticed that Bloom's friend managed to get back to her comrades. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dalton, is that you?\" Bloom's said to me, with a concerned tone in her voice, recognizing me from my voice moments ago. Then, I heard a guy's voice behind that said, \"Who is he, Bloom? A friend of yours?\" \"His name is Dalton Kent, Sky. He's a neighbor of mine that just moved here to Gardenia from another city.\" Bloom answered to the guy, which I now knew him as \"Sky\", as I let out aggressive breathing from looking at Icy and her cohorts, feeling a swelling fire within my heart, only it wasn't love I was feeling, it was anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, little did I know, but one of Bloom's girl friends saw some of the blood from my Dad on my hands, as she spoke with an almost British accent and said, \"Bloom, take a look at his hands.\" It was then that Bloom saw the blood on my hands, causing her to get even more worried about my sanity, as she spoke to me and asked, \"Dalton, is that...Blood?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was official; they now know of the blood on my hands. So in response, I stood up from my fighting stance, then turn my head to the right, looking at Bloom and her comrades, putting my face out in full view, where they saw my altered right eye, causing a few of the girls to gasp somewhat, as Bloom looked at me with a shocked look on her face and asked, \"Dalton, your eye! What happened to you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, I had a look of grief on my face, as I looked at Bloom and her friends and I answered, \"My...My parents....they're dead, Bloom. They're dead.\" \"And it's all thanks to THOSE BITCHES!!\" I yelled, looking back at Icy and her 2 equally evil comrades with a look of rage, pointing my scythe directly at the 3 witches, just as the 2 witches helped Icy back up onto her feet, even though they heard what I called them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you just call us, you puny human?!\" Icy growled at me, grinding her teeth with a set of ice cold eyes glaring at me like daggers, so I snapped at the sadistic trio, venting out my swelling rage at them and yelled, \"You heard me, you messed up pieces of bullshit! You and your fucking girlfriends murdered my parents in cold blood, Icy, all while you were smiling like the heartless monster you are underneath, YOU GODDAMN BITCH!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't see it, but Bloom and her friends were in complete shock to hear what I said, as I heard another guy speak out and replied, \"Whoa, I can't believe those witches would actually stoop so low as to kill someone.\" However, I couldn't see it at the time, but I felt almost a burning sensation in my right eye, almost as if it was actually on fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dalton, please! You need to calm down!\" Bloom said, as I heard her speak to me with a fearful tone in her voice. Ever since I moved into Gardenia, Bloom became a sort of sister figure, even though she and I aren't related by blood. But knowing me, Bloom somehow knows what happens when I get pissed off, and it's never good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, I unintentionally snapped at Bloom from my blind rage, as I yelled, \"Screw it, Bloom!! I am not calming down until these fuckers pay for what they did!!!\" \"So, what are you waiting for, you hot-headed divas?! COME GET ME!!!\" I roared, as my voice sounded more distorted and inhuman. In reaction to my insults towards them, Icy started channeling some sort of power into her hands, as she aimed the magic energy buildup at me and growled, \"Hot-headed divas!?! Alright you annoying human, you asked for it! ICE COFFIN!!\"  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back then, when I was facing against something like Icy, I considered myself a complete idiot. That is, if I wasn't so hooked on getting vengeance on Icy and her 2 bitches to think straight. However, what made things different was when my fight or flight instincts kicked into high gear, as I quickly dodged to the left, attempting to avoid Icy's \"Ice Coffin\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut...something felt different when I moved. By the time I stopped dodging, I looked back at where Icy's Ice Coffin hit, as a big sheet of ice the size of a Dodge Ram truck stood before me just 12 feet away from me. I wasn't sure what I did, but whatever I did, sure as hell felt good. When I looked at Icy and her cohorts, the looks on their faces was of disbelief and frustration. \"GRRRR! That's impossible, nobody can dodge my Ice Coffin! NOBODY!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn rage, Icy kept throwing \"Ice Coffins\" at me, forcing me to keep dodging with inhuman speed, as I noticed a purple ethereal trail behind me when turned my head to look back, giving me a bit of a surprise. Anyway, as I kept dodging Icy's attacks, I quickly advanced my way toward my parents' killers, just as Icy's witch friends joined in on attacking me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, just as the 3 witches let out a combined attack on me, I let out a powerful jump, as I lunged toward them, scythe in both hands, swinging the serrated blade at the very trio who murdered my parents in cold blood, as I screamed, \"YOU'RE DEAD, BITCHES!!!!\" Delivering my first strike on them, I didn't hit Icy unfortunately....but I did hit one of her witchy friends by cutting into the girl's left leg, forcing her to scream and fall on one knee from the pain, as I then kicked that bitch in the face with my right boot, breaking her nose a bit, since I heard these cracking sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n What I did force Icy and her other friend to split and keep their distance from me a bit. Then, I heard Icy's other friend launch some sort of spell at me as she yelled, \"You bastard! This is what you'll get for hitting Stormy!!\" \"YEAH, AND THIS IS WHAT YOU GET FOR KILLING MY FAMILY, YOU FUCKING WITCH!!\" I yelled back, speaking in that inhuman voice of mine, now knowing the name of Icy's downed comrade, as I rushed at the other witch while dodging Icy's pussy Ice Coffin attacks, using my newfound powers to gain momentum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, I wasn't sure how I was able to use them, but so far, they were giving me an edge in this fight. When I got up close, I started swinging the scythe at the brunette witch, who attempted to dodge each swing I sent her way. However, she couldn't dodge all of my attacks, as I delivered a nasty kick to the outer side of her right leg, right where her kneecap is located at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused the witch to scream in pain, as I saw the damage I did upon her leg joint, forcing her onto her knees. Although I knew that Icy was nearby still firing her Ice Coffin ability at me, I quickly pulled out my Dad's handgun out and aimed at Icy from behind me, as I rapidly pulled on the trigger twice, countering Icy's attack, since one of the bullets hit that albino bitch in one or both hands, due to hearing the sound of her screaming. Ah, music to my vengful ears!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting back to the witch in front of me, I slowly circled the injured witch, ready to play executioner. From where I stood, heard Bloom yell out to me and said, \"Dalton, No!!\" I swung the scythe like it was a golf club, with the serrated blade aimed at the witch's back. From there, it punched through the skin on her back, without hitting her spine, seeing as how I wasn't aiming there. From there, the scythe bladetip can be seen sticking out of that bitch's abdomen, causing her to scream from the sharp pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that grabbed the witch by her long hair and slammed her against the stone barbecue grill my Dad made. \"Darcy! How dare you hurt her!! I'm the one that hurts her!!\" Icy yelled at me with rage, blasting ice at me, forcing me to dodge again, as I used my powers to quickly approach and confront Icy with inhuman speed. Upon reaching her, I rushed toward that witch, grabbed her by the neck, and slammed her against the ground, stunning that heartless magic user when she hit the back of her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was stunned, I....</span></div></div>",

Then, I heard Sky speaking to me as he said, \"Dalton, what you're doing isn't justice, this is vengeance-\" \"I don't know who in the flying fuck you're supposed to be, dude!! Or have you didn't notice that ICY AND HER WITCHY BITCHES KILLED! MY! PARENTS!!\" I yelled at Sky, violently interrupting him and showing how enraged I was at what Icy and her friends did to my parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after letting my temper out a bit, I went back to giving Icy my own brand of justice, as I lifted that witch's head up onto the grill. However, she tried to blast ice in my face, but I quickly twisted Icy's arm behind her back, and slammed the right side of her face against the grill's sizzling hot surface, causing that bitch to scream at the top of her freezing lungs, as I looked down at her and yelled, \"Loving the cold, Icy?! Then let's see if you like it if I heat things up for ya!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DALTON, STOP THIS NOW!!\" Bloom yelled at me, as little did either of us knew, but the first witch I attacked, Stormy, aimed a magic blast at me, hitting me in the back with a nasty electric jolt. It felt as if being shocked by several tasers all at once. In other words, painful as hell, even with these new powers of mine. That jolt caused me to accidentally let go of Icy, as my legs buckled from the electric charge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there.....it all went blank, as if I just whacked the side of my head against a rock, knocking me out cold. I mean, I wasn't sure how long I was out at that time, but by the time I woke up.....</span></div></div>",

I mean, I wasn't sure if I was having a bad dream or what I did was actually real. Getting out of the bed I was laying in, I got up onto my own two feet, clumsily moving toward a mirror nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally making to the mirror, I stood there looking at my reflection, where I was bandaged up in several different places. I mean, I wasn't exactly wearing my boots when I just woke up in that room. However, I noticed a large bandage patch on the right side of my head and short dirty blonde hair, reminding me how I got that wound in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom looking at that certain wound, it brought back those dreadful memories. I wasn't dreaming, my parents were dead (even if they weren't my real parents), I beat the living shit out of those 3 witches, and scarred one of them in the end. Stormy. Darcy. Icy. The names of those 3 witches kept swirling around in my head like an angry swarm of locusts, forcing me to sit down on a nearby chair inside that chalk white room from that stressful migraine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, I slowly looked up from the chair and saw the the only thing that wasn't in white; that black scythe I used to attack Icy, Stormy, and Darcy. Out of all the words to describe my situation, I spoke to myself and said, \"Where the hell am I?\" \"It's simple; you are currently in Red Fountain Academy.\" A voice said to me, which belonged to what appeared to be an old man in his 70s or 80s when I looked to my right and saw him standing there, with the door open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man was a good deal shorter than me standing upright, wearing a dull-green robe. On his face, he had these thick gray eyebrows and gray hair that reached down to his waist. In his right hand, he held a golden staff with an ornament that looked like a dragon's head on top, as the dragon head had some sort of purple jewel lodged inside it's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who are you supposed to be? The man in charge?\" I asked him with a rhetorical and frustrated expression on my face, looking at the old man with my undead purple-colored eye. Besides, I just lost my parents, and I didn't need some Yoda knockoff to give me some advice. So in response, the old man let out a small chuckle, then approached me, using his golden staff like a cane, as he spoke to me and answered, \"In a way, I am. My name is Saladin, as in Headmaster Saladin, Dalton Kent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, that definitely raises a red flag in my accord! I mean, how the hell did this old geezer managed to know my full name! Sure, I should be in mourning over the deaths of my parents, but my \"Dad\" said that I wasn't even his biological son before he succumbed to his wounds. So in response as to what this \"Saladin\" guy was telling me.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If we were talking back when I was still hell-bent on getting vengeance on Icy and her bitchy entourage, I would've snapped and go for Saladin's wrinkled throat. But since I was now somewhat calmed down, I stood up from the chair, growling some in the process, as I faced the old man, looking down at him due to our....height difference, and mumbled, \"How the hell do you know my name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning his head upward to look at me, I heard Saladin speak as he answered, \"Bloom and her friends, alongside two of this school's students, Brandon and Prince Sky of Eraklyon, explained to both me and Miss Faragonda about who you were. They said that you were from Earth, and that you were Bloom's next-door neighbor in the Earth city of Gardenia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that's completely new! I mean, how the hell did Bloom managed to become friends with a goddamn prince!?! Where was I when this was happening?! And yes, that was a rhetorical question, amigos! Anyway, while I was listening to what this \"Headmaster Saladin\" had to say to me, I slowly walked back toward the mirror, putting a hand on the mirror's frame, and another hand on the wall nearest to the mirror, as I moved my eyes to look at my reflection and said, \"Let me guess, Bloom and his Highness also happened to tell you about what those 3 bitches Icy, Stormy, and Darcy did to my parents?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*depressed sigh* I'm afraid so, Dalton. I deeply apologize for this personal tragedy of yours. It is never easy when a loved one dies before your very eyes.\" Saladin replied to me, trying to be sympathetic to the pain I was suffering. But in response, I quickly turned around to look at the old man, snapping at him as I growled, \"What would you know about my loss?! I just lost my parents to those heartless she-devils!! And you know what's the worst of it, Saladin?! They're not even my real parents!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after snapping at the Headmaster of Red Fountain, I let out several deep breaths in &amp; out of my mouth, finally calming down from venting out what's left of my anger from the fight against Icy and her cronies. \"Are you finally calm, Dalton?\" I heard Saladin say to me, waiting patiently until I vented some steam out. Then, I looked at the old geezer with my two eyes and answered, \"Yeah, you can say so.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking toward the next wall in the room, I leaned my back against it, as I slumped down onto the hard cold floor, legs bent inward. \"*sigh* What the hell did I get myself into here?\" I murmured, obviously now lost from the madness that occurred on Halloween Night, as I heard the hollow thumping sounds from Saladin's staff smacking against the hard floor, getting closer to me until I noticed him kneeling down just a foot away from me, then I heard Saladin speak to me and said, \"Listen, I...understand that you want to be left alone due to all of the recent events in your life. You lost your family, I understand that. But that does not mean that your life as a whole ends where your foster parents died.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I was still pissed off as I was when I gave Icy those burns, I would've thrown common sense out the window and give Saladin the middle finger. But...that old geezer was right about one thing though; I'm still among the living, and I showed those 3 witches who's boss. In a way, it wasn't all that bad for me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo in response to what he told me, I moved my eyes to look at Saladin and replied, \"*long sigh* Well....I guess you're right about that, Saladin. It could've been much worse for me.\" Despite calming down and being reasoned with, I was still confused about all of this. You know, why Bloom was dressed up in that outfit, why she was with those other girls and those two guys, why I had these....powers, you get the freaking point! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, I looked back at Saladin and started my barrage of questions as I asked, \"You said..that I'm currently in someplace called Red Fountain Academy, right? What is this place, some kind of school?\" \"Yes, that is correct. For you see, Dalton, Red Fountain Academy is not just a school, this is a school for heroics and bravery. The students here are trained to become heroes and warriors, whom we call 'Specialists'.\" Saladin answered to me, speaking with a sense of pride in his voice, as if he was proud to call himself the Academy's head honcho. Hmph, and they say that \"Pride is a sin\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering what happened to Icy and her heartless entourage, I looked at Saladin with an angry look on my brow and said, \"So, what happened to Icy, Stormy, and Darcy? Last time I saw them, I...I remember burning Icy's face on my Dad's grill.\" \"Unfortunately for all of us, they escaped. However, it seems that what you did to Icy has....permanently damaged her face, even if she uses magic to cover it up. Brandon and Sky confirmed that after your...'branding', Stormy hit you from behind with an electric spell, where she then teleported Icy, Darcy, and herself away from where you fought them. Whatever you did to Icy, Dalton, it must have sent these 3 witches running.\" Saladin answered to me, giving me some sense of satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, remembering what I did to Icy that night salon made feel...guilty, as well. I mean, I wasn't sure why I was thinking this way, but....I think it was because Bloom was yelling at me to stop torturing Icy, like I did last night. And yet, I didn't listen to her and just continued burning that Ice Queen in the face. In the end though, that's sort of my sin to bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that would explain how I was knocked out back there.\" I said to that old geezer, relaying the information Saladin gave to me. So yeah, finally making some progress on my end! For once. Anyway, getting toward that third question I had in mind, I slowly stood back up onto my feet, eyes still trained on Saladin, and asked, \"Okay, then can you explain to me why my next-door neighbor Bloom was dressed up like...like, um...like some freaking fairy?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*light chuckle* That's simple; you just happened to answer your own question, Dalton.\" Saladin said to me, making me facepalm myself due to my short moment of stupidity. But then, relaying the few words he said to me, my eyes opened wide in surprise, as I replied, \"Wait, she's actually a Fairy? Aren't they supposed to be the size of a mouse or something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was Saladin's turn to do a facepalm, obviously not amused by my question, which oddly enough made me smirk a bit, as I heard him speak to me and answered, \"*sigh* Another human misconception. Dalton, fairies happen to be Human-sized, like you and me. Their powers come from a magic source they call \"Winx\". They receive their education at a nearby school known as \"Alphea\", while the witches are educated at Cloud Tower, another school next to both Red Fountain &amp; Alphea. After all, Miss Faragonda is the Headmistress of Alphea, for your curiosity, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, can anybody say \"Heroes, Fairies, &amp; Witches Oh My!\" And yes, I just had to make that damn joke, because I felt like it. Now, making it to that final question, I looked at Saladin with my green and purple eyes, and asked, \"Alright, um...if you happen to know all about this stuff, then how could you explain those powers I used back when I was fighting Icy and her friends, hmm?\" From there, in response to my question, Saladin.....</span></div></div>",

He threw a fucking fireball at me, I was trying to stay alive dammit!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, as I was saying, just as Saladin threw that basketball-sized fireball in my direction, my fight or flight instincts went from cold to hot in a snap, causing me to dodge to my left. In the process, I could feel that purple ethereal trail from behind me, as I quickly lunged toward the wall where my scythe was leaning on, rushing to grab it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I grabbed it, I swung the scythe around so the spearhead on the bottom was facing toward that old bastard, posing in a combat stance. But the weird part for me was that...he only fired at me once. I mean, I wasn't aware of that at the time, since my mind was more focused on surviving this insanity!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out some heavy breaths, my green and purple eyes were trained on Saladin, who oddly enough had his left hand rubbing his chin in some form of curiosity. From there, I heard him say, \"Hmmm, Interesting. It is just as I had suspected.\" \"Interesting!?! Have you lost your mind?! You threw a goddamn fireball at me, you bastard!!\" I yelled, snapping at Saladin from launching a fireball the size of a basketball my way, flaring my arms outward to show how pissed off I was from his little pyrotechnics stunt (even if it wasn't exactly pyrotechnics).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Dalton. Despite what it looks like, I wasn't making an attempt to take your life. It was merely a test.\" Saladin replied to me, trying to calm me down before I did something stupid that I would regret later on. In response to what he told me, I looked at the old man with a frustrated look on my face and angrily asked, \"A test?! A freaking TEST!?! Why the hell would you even say that?! Last time I checked, when somebody throws a fireball at you, it means they want you burnt to a crisp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I deeply apologize for betraying your trust in this...lethal manner, Dalton. But I needed to see what Brandon and Sky had told me about your...'unique' abilities, when you fought against the Trix.\" Saladin answered to me, trying to make it up to me for throwing a fireball at me. But....I guess he did have a good reason to go pyromaniac on my ass. I mean, I would've done the same thing if I was in his shoes. But what made me cock an eyebrow at the old geezer as I slowly lowered my guard bit by bit, was when he said \"the Trix\" instead of \"Icy, Stormy, &amp; Darcy\", as I looked at Saladin with my green and purple eyes and asked, \"The...Trix? I'm guessing that you're talking Icy and her supposed 'sisters', Saladin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Saladin just looked at me in the eyes, nodding yes and answered, \"Exactly. Prince Sky said that it was Bloom's idea to call those 3 witches by that name.\" Of course. That name definitely had Bloom's name written all over it, not that she was a member of that group, of course. I mean, I'm just saying that because that sounded like her idea, as I let out an amused smirk and light chuckle then said, \"Fitting name, Bloom. Fitting name.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting back on topic, I looked back at Red Fountain's Headmaster and said, \"So, why just throw a freaking fireball at me when you could've just asked me about these...powers of mine? I mean, to be honest, I don't know jack about what's happening to me.\" It was then that Saladin started walking toward the opened doorway. From there, he stopped just inches from getting outside the room we're standing in, as he turned his head to look at me and answered, \"If you truly want answers, Dalton, then I suggest you follow me to my office.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't sure what Saladin was aiming for by having me following him to his \"Office\", yet I wanted some answers as to what I really was and who my parents were. So, weighing my options....</span></div></div>",

After all, the two people I thought were my parents weren't my actual parents, I had these powers that basically scream \"what the hell\", and I managed to literally look inside my dead foster Dad's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI never asked for any of this, but if I was going to get some answers, Saladin was the only way I was going those answers. So, with no other choice, I put my boots back on my feet, put on my hooded jacket that was hanging on a wall, and grabbed the scythe with my right hand, leaning it against my right shoulder, I soon followed Saladin out the doorway he exited out from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his age, he was somewhat fast for an old man, I'll give him credit for that. I wasn't sure how big Red Fountain Academy was, but it definitely felt like a long walk for my tastes. Along the way to Saladin's office, I got looks from various students passing by me and the old man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until I was walking right next to Saladin that I spoke to him and said, \"So, any reason why these guys are giving me looks here?\" \"You see, Dalton, gossip can sometimes spread fast here in Red Fountain, drowning on the information. And judging from how many of my students have noticed you, it seems that you're a popular topic among the school's gossip. After all, last year, the Trix had summoned a powerful force known as the \"Army of Decay\" in an attempt to take over the realm of Magix. One of the casualties in our fight against them was the original Red Fountain Academy. Fortunately, we stopped their plans, thanks to the efforts made by Bloom and her friends, known as the \"Winx Club\". As for what happened to Icy, Stormy, &amp; Darcy after the battle, we had them under arrest and put the 3 witches in a reformation facility known as \"Light-Haven\". Originally, we thought we could dispel the pure evil inside their hearts, but they escaped. It would appear that the students also happen to respect you some for your...handiwork against the Trix.\" Saladin explained to me, filling in the details as to why these Red Fountain guys were looking at me as they walked by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. Yeah, I guess what I did to them had left a strong message that I wasn't aware of until now.\" I replied, as the old man and I approached what appeared to be an elevator, where the elevator doors opened for us. From there, Saladin went inside first and then me, as the old man pressed a button that led up to an upper floor, causing the doors to close and the elevator went up. Noticing the glass pane acting as an elevator wall, I looked out the window and saw how huge the school was, with my reaction being, \"Holy Shit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you are impressed by the view then. You can say that we had the school undergo massive renovations, due to the Trix's attack on Red Fountain.\" Saladin answered to me, as the elevator continued moving until it reached the 24th floor. Wow, this place is massive! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, the elevator doors opened, allowing entry to these wide hallways. From looking out the large frameless windows, I could see the entire landscape ahead of me, putting me in both shock and awe, as I could see a vast forest in front of me, with what appears to be another school on the other side. I'm guessing that must be Alphea, the Fairy school that Saladin had told me about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, I thought I was seeing things, but I could've sworn that this gigantic school was actually moving. Anyway, before I could ask that old geezer anything else, I felt the golden dragon head on his staff tap me twice on my left shoulder, getting my attention, as he said, \"I can give you the academy your later, Dalton. But right now, let's head to my office. Fortunately, it happens to be a few doors down this hallway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd like Saladin said before, his office happened to be a few doors down the hallway, on the right side. When we reached the front doors to his office, I noticed how decorative they are, having that classic Era look to it. When he grabbed his keys, I watched as Saladin unlocked the doors. Although I had to help him a bit, we went inside his office and it was revealed that....</span></div></div>",

There were so many books in here that you can accidentally mistake his office for a freaking library! I wasn't sure how many books that old geezer has collected over the years, but there was a fuckton of books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked through the office, I noticed a large portrait hanging on the right side of the room of a man wielding the exact same staff that Saladin was holding, as the old man made his way to his large desk. Putting two and two together, I figured that the guy in the portrait and Saladin were one and the same person, expecting that the guy in the painting must've been Saladin when he was at a younger age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you noticed the portrait of me when I was younger, Dalton. Ah, life can pass you by when you least expect it.\" Saladin said to me, snapping me out of the current distraction. From there, I approached the old man as I asked, \"Don't tell me; You're some sort of Wizard, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are correct, I happen to have a vast expertise on magic from my experience over the years. Anyway, onto a more serious matter at hand....\" Saladin answered to me, as I noticed his left hand was raised and aimed at one of the bookshelves behind me, his hand glowing with some form of magical energy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until it passed by me that I realized what the old geezer was grabbing for; a black and purple book, with tan-gray colored pages. And judging from how thick the book was, there must be a lot information inside it, whatever that information may be. Then, I heard Saladin's voice once again as he said, \"Tell me, Dalton; Have you ever heard of a mythical entity known as \"The Grim Reaper\"?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, that was new! Saladin asking me if I had heard of the Grim Reaper? Damn straight I know of him! I know that he's the Reaper of Souls, the Angel of Death, the Ghost of Christmas Yet-To-Come, one of the Four Horsemen of the goddamn Apocalypse, and the freaking personification of death and the afterlife! So in response to what he asked me, I scoffed at Saladin and his question and replied, \"*scoff* Of course I've heard of the Grim Reaper, everybody on Earth has heard of this guy! I bet you 50 bucks that even Bloom's heard of the Grim Reaper, you crazy S.o.B.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, why was Saladin asking me something as simple as seeing if I knew about the Grim Reaper? Something was off about this! So, I just cocked an eyebrow at the old wizard and asked, \"Er, why are you asking me something like that?\" \"I think it's best that you see this for yourself, Dalton.\" Saladin answered to me, peeking over the opened book to look at me with a pair of serious eyes and furrowed brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom looking at that expression on his wrinkled face, I had a feeling that he was serious at this point. In response, I slowly walked around his large desk, putting down my scythe and leaning it against the side of his desk. Once I finally stood beside him, I got a good look at what the black and purple book's pages contained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet mother of crap.\" I said under my own breath, looking at two of the book's pages, which contained large amounts of writing and a expertly good drawing of what appeared to be the one and only Grim Reaper himself! Then, Saladin had me get a look at the book's front cover, where the title read.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I wasn't able to understand the gibberish that was written on the front cover, but out of nowhere, the migraine that I felt when I touched Dad's corpse had made a comeback! Agh! Damn, that hurts like hell! However, unlike the last time this headache made an appearance, the gibberish that I saw on the book's front cover started shifting around into words that I could understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were finished, I read the title aloud as I said, \"The Civilization of...Nekross?\" \"So...you are able to read the Magic Dimension's writing without the education required, huh? Hmm, interesting.\" Saladin said to me, rubbing his chin a bit, as I put the book's front cover back down on the desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was weird, but that name...Nekross. I could feel it on the tip of my tongue, and yet, it didn't ring a bell in my mind. The name itself reminded me of the Latin word \"Necro\", which means \"dead\" in that old language. Fitting, I guess. Turning my head to look at the old man, I spoke to Saladin and asked, \"So, what is Nekross, anyway? Isn't it the name of a planet or something like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dalton, Nekross isn't just the name of a planet, it's also the same name of a civilization. The very same civilization that gave birth to the legend of the Grim Reaper. Their buildings, cities, and structures have a Gothic appearance. As for the inhabitants themselves, they are given the name \"Nekrons\", due to originating from their homeworld of Nekross.\" Saladin answered to me, giving me a better understanding as to what exactly I was dealing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly turning a few pages in the book, I stopped at the two pages that showed what appeared to be a Nekross getting damaged. But suddenly, those visions came back, causing me to instinctively grab the front of my head, screaming from the internal pain, as I saw what appeared to be the destruction of the same gothic city I kept seeing in my dreams. I couldn't see it, but I could hear Saladin's voice, asking me in worry if I was alright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut moments later, I suddenly snapped back to reality, breathing heavily from the painful vision, feeling the increased beating pace in my heart, as it slowly decreased in pace bit by bit. \"Dalton, are you alright?! You started screaming when you touched one of the pages.\" Saladin asked me, obviously concerned for my health and well-being. So in response, I looked at him with my green and purple eyes and answered, \"I...I'm not sure myself. Before all of this, I kept having these nightmares...of a city getting destroyed. It didn't look like any city I've seen on Earth, but...I think, No! I now know that wasn't an Earth city.....i-it was a city on that planet...Nekross.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Saladin gave me a look of...sympathy, as I heard him speak to me and said, \"3 months before a planet called \"Sparks\" was destroyed by an evil coven of witches, Nekross capital city, known as \"Thanatos\", was wiped out in one single attack by the same coven of witches. They were looking for a powerful source of magic known as the \"Dragon-Fire\", which currently now resides in Bloom. What your...vision has shown you might not have been a look into the future, but rather, a memory that was repressed inside your mind. And judging from you told me, Dalton, you might have been born originally from the planet Nekross, but were brought to Earth for safety and refuge when you were just developing your memories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just couldn't believe what I was hearing with my own two ears; I might've been born on another planet! And from what Saladin had explained to me, it...it all makes sense now. So in response to what the old man had said to me, I looked at him and asked, \"Alright, so I might be born on this Nekross planet. But...how do you explain these powers of mine, hmm?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Due to the overabundance of Nekross's planetary magic energy and the exposure to this source of energy, the Nekrons are naturally born with this source of magic in their blood. In other words, you are a natural born magical being.\" Saladin answered to me, finally giving me an explanation as to why I had these powers in the first place. I guess I was sort of born this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the palm of my left hand as this purple ethereal source of magic started flowing throughout my hand, circling around it like the Earth orbiting around the Sun, as I curled all the fingers on my left hand into a fist, speaking to Saladin and said, \"So, what you're saying is that I was born with this sort of power, is that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding once, Saladin looked at me and replied, \"Exactly, my confused young friend. Fortunately, Red Fountain also teaches boys who happen to exhibit signs of using magic, helping them learn in the ways of magic. However, we also happen to have some room to spare, if you choose to join our prestigious school, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd here I was, standing at a crossroads, having to choose between either attending Red Fountain Academy and become a better fighter along with learning how to use my powers, or deny Saladin's offer and just go after Icy &amp; the rest of the Trix, finishing what I started. Oh the choices, choices, choices. Either way, I was going to have to make a choice, whether I would like it or not. However, in the end though, I....</span></div></div>",

Insane, do I look like the stereotypical Grade-A student to you? No, I don't. Besides, Grade-A students don't skip school and sneak out at night to tag some walls with graffiti, now do they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n But this was...different. First off, my \"parents\" were no longer among thanks to the damned Trix. And second, I wasn't even born on Earth goddammit! Plus, I had this magic source of power pulsing through my veins. Even though I couldn't see this power, I could most definitely feel it with each heartbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about my decision, I began to weigh the pros and cons in my decision to join Red Fountain. On the positive side, Saladin did say that this place also teaches guys how to use magic, especially for those who can actually USE magic. I mean, if I did have these magic powers, I should be learning how to control these new abilities of mine, right? You're damn straight I'm going to learn how to control these powers of mine! Who knows? I might pick up a few new tricks along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh, and now for the negatives. For one, I would be wearing those jumpsuit uniforms that the students wear here in Red Fountain, seeing as how I'm not a fan of wearing uniforms whatsoever. Plus, if I'm going to be attending this school, I might have to work a little harder than the others, since I might be skipping a grade due to my age....I think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, there were more positives than negatives in my choice to join Red Fountain. Finally making my decision, I looked at Saladin, as I slowly extended my left hand out toward him to shake his hand. From there, I answered, \"Alright...I'll join.\" However, just as he reached his left hand out to shake my hand, I quickly yanked my hand away for a moment and said, \"But I'll join under a few certain conditions...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what would those conditions of yours may be, Dalton?\" Saladin asked me, wanting to know of my conditions. But I already had some in mind, as I looked at the old man with my green and purple eyes and answered, \"First off; I am not wearing your school's uniform. I'm sorry, but I'm just not a fan of wearing some sort of dress code. And second, well um...I'm still working on that second condition, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Saladin looked up at me, looking through his pockets as he replied, \"Normally, those who attend here at Red Fountain usually take the school uniform willingly. However, since you happen to be one of the few who don't wear the uniform, take this instead.\" In his hand, he had what appeared to be a bandana. It's colors were a navy blue and pale yellow, but in the center of the bandana, it had a white isignia of a dragon with it's wings spread out, with two swords that crossed in the background. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI figured that the bandana was for identifying me as a member of Red Fountain Academy, at least that solves my problem in case someone mistakes me for some civilian. Taking the bandana, I tied it around the bicep of my right arm, securing it there firmly, as I moved the tied bandana to show the isignia in clear view. From there, the old man also gave me what appeared to be a holster for my scythe, which had this round purple jewel attached to the strap. I noticed that the students had these jewels on that held their blue capes on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, after putting on these pieces of equipment, I noticed Saladin extending his left hand out to me, wanting to congratulate me in joining his school. In response, I extended my left hand and shook his own left hand, as I heard him speaking to me and said, \"Welcome to Red Fountain, Dalton Kent.\" \"Thanks. So, um...what happens now?\" I asked, just as I let go of his hand, grabbed my scythe, and sheathed it into the holster on my back. From there, Saladin just looked at me and said....</span></div></div>",

From there, he pressed a wrinkled index finger on one of the buttons, spoke into the machine, and said, \"You can come in now, boys.\" I wasn't sure who he was talking to back there, but....let's just say I got my answer when I noticed the doors to Saladin's office opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was there that I saw two familiar faces; the same two guys I saw back when I was \"branding\" Icy with a nasty scar on that bitch's face, Sky, the \"Prince\" of Eraklyon, and.....well, I didn't know the other guy's name, but he had short dark brown hair and brown eyes. Upon first glance of them, my only reaction from seeing them was \"Oh, you have got to be shitting me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least he remembers us.\" Sky said, as I could see that he still remembers me from what happened back in Gardenia. Then, I heard the brunette beside Sky speak toward Saladin and asked, \"You needed us for something, Headmaster Saladin?\" \"Yes, Brandon, I do. Some Dalton here will be staying here at Red Fountain as a student, I've decided to transfer him into the same squad as you, Sky, Riven, Timmy, &amp; my nephew are comprised of.\" Saladin answered, catching me completely by surprise, as I looked back at the old geezer and yelled, \"The same squad?! What the hell, Saladin!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before I could speak anymore, the old man used his own staff as a makeshift muzzle of sorts, putting the golden dragon head ornament underneath my lower jaw, shutting me up. From there, Saladin spoke to me and said, \"First and foremost, Dalton, you're not making the situation any easier. Second, the reason why I assigned you to Brandon &amp; Sky's squad is to keep an eye on you. Though I do admit that Icy did deserve the punishment you gave her, but what you did to her was what we here at Red Fountain prefer to as 'an act of vengeance'. Due to this, you are considered as a 'loose cannon', so I recommend that you respect the opportunity that I have given you. Understand?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom looking at the reaction on Brandon and Sky's faces, I could see that this must be rare for them to see their own headmaster lash out like that, which made me considered the fact that I shouldn't lash back at him. After all, the part where he threw a fireball at me was still fresh in my mind. So in response, I decided to back off, looked down at the old man with my green and purple eyes and answered, \"Yes...sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom hearing what I was forced to say, Saladin, just moved his staff away from my lower jaw, finally allowing me to use my own mouth again, as I rubbed the bottom of my jaw a bit from where he placed the dragon head at, feeling a sore red spot from the staff ornament being used to clamp my mouth shut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nResuming what he was saying, I heard Saladin speaking toward Brandon and Sky, as he said, \"Now then, my apologies for lashing out. So, can I trust you two with Dalton here?\" \"You can count on us.\" Sky replied to Saladin, as I saw Brandon motioned me to follow him and Sky. Left with no other choice, I decided to follow their lead, heading out of the large double doors, where I could hear them close, just as the 3 of us were walking away.</span></div></div>",
