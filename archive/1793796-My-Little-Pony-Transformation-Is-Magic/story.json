Feathers floated up from the couch and covered the floor.

I don't know how to explain this but she is acting like a kid. I came back from the store after getting some food and then she was acting like a kid jumping up and down on the couch while talking in the style of one.. I don't know what is wrong with her. But I hope someone can give me a helping hand to find out what is wrong with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--Spike.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike had made four more copies of the same letter and in the blanks that followed \"Dear\" on each one, he signed each with the names of Twilight's friends, Applejack, Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, &amp; Rarity. After Spike sent out the message to the respective ponies, he went back upstairs to see what Twilight was doing. He slowly went upstairs, listening for any loud noises that might have happened just in case she hurt herself or did something she wasn't supposed to do. After he reached the top of the stairs, he took a deep breath and slowly poked his head into the room and saw Twilight. She was lying on her bed, on her back, looking up at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do the stars look so bright?\" said Twilight playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike watched as she started to get off her bed and looked out the window at the stars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is everyone mean?!\" Twilight said with a sad tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked behind her and saw a small piece of cake that was sitting there on a lonely small wooden table. She slowly walked over to it and licked it slowly to take the icing off the top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This cake is nice... Why is Spike so mean to me?\" said Twilight was a big frown on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike was a little angry and shocked that Twilight had said such things about him and he slowly walked into the room, properly pretending that he didn't see her licking the cake and looking out the window. Then quickly, Twilight turned around and zoomed straight to her bed and then hid under her quilt covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please go away! I just want to pway with my toys...\" said Twilight who was looking pretty scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight, I just wanna know why you're acting like a kid, that's all I wanna know,\" said Spike with a curious look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know! Leave me alone, meanie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike heard the knocking on the door downstairs, as he hoped it was Twilight's friends, who would be able to knock some sense into Twilight and stop making her act like a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get it!!!\" said Twilight with a massive smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got up from under her bed, she tried to run down stairs but Spike was in the way and then he stopped her by putting his hand right in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't!\" he commanded. \"You are still in time out, so you gotta stay up here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight stopped and then sat down on the ground while crossing her arms with a big frown on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... you win!\" said Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike quickly ran downstairs and looked through the window and outside of the library was ...</span></div></div>",

While there was a slice of cake that she had licked all the icing of the top of the cake and there was a bite mark at the side of it. She also looked at her bed and saw near Twilight that all the sheets on her bed were removed and liking thrown off by Twilight and as Fluttershy got closer to Twilight she noticed that Twilight was falling asleep and this was the perfect moment to inspect Twilight. Fluttershy slowly and delicately creeped up to her and gave her body a good inspection. Nothing was wrong with her body and it seems that she was drooling a little bit while Twilights hair/mane was also messy and it was out of shape. As Twilight couldn't keep still during her sleep she rolled her body left and right into finding a comfortable spot but soon enough as Fluttershy was going to leave she noticed Twilights arms and legs hanging off the bed and so Fluttershy did the welcoming thing and decided to push most of her body back into the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly though as Fluttershy knocked over a table thus causing her to squeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeep!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight quickly opened her eyes and looked around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.. who is there...

He said hesitantly holding it out afraid of scaring Twilight again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy took it with a kind smile and handed it over to Dash. Um, Flutters. If its not obvious I have very little experience with foals. Dash said nervously eyeing the bottle. Twilight had also noticed it and was making excited happy noises reaching for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth mares and the dragon smiled at the cute act. Just hold her like this Rainbow. The yellow Pegasus said demonstrating the proper position. RD copied it and soon Twilight was nursing making happy cooing sounds as she rapidly drained the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prismatic Pegasus was distracted by the scene for a moment before snapping back. Oh yeah! Hey Spike, do you know how to get into contact with Twilights\u2019 parents?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon blinked then facepalmed. Argg! Of course! They would want to know what happened. And Celestia too, she can probably fix this! I\u2019ll send them a message right away, express to Canterlot. She\u2019ll make sure they know. I\u2019ll be back when she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks Spike! Thank you Spike. RD and Shy said together. The dragon rubbed his arm. Hey its nothing. I, I want to help to and fix this you know?  Both mares nodded and Spike left to send the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what do we do in the meantime? Dash asked as Twilight finished dropping the empty bottle with a content look on her face, which soon turned to confusion and discomfort and she made a whimpering whine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShy giggled. Well first I think a little filly needs to be burped, then we should probably get her into a diaper. Rainbows\u2019 eyes shrunk at that and she quickly passed the foal off to Fluttershy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yellow pegasus rolled her eyes but took Twilight and gave the foal a few pats on her back. A massive belch escaped her mouth, making the foal giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe diaper change itself was, relatively easy. As a foal Twilight was easy to pin down but the foal wanted to play some more, and some part of her mind knew that she wasn\u2019t supposed to wear the fluffly white thing that the nice-not-mommy was trying to put on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finally managed to distract her and quickly get the diaper on. Twilight poked it with a hoof, feeling the garment crinkle and how soft it was around her flank. Giggling the foal started rocking back and forth making both mares smile at the cute scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now what? Dash asked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What is that!?! Both mares immediately turned towards Twilight. The foal was still playing happily obvilous to the stink coming from her diaper. Rainbow swore she could see the stink lines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she noticed the attention Twilight smiled at them, and then laughed at the faces of the two older ponies. The scrunched up look was just so funny!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh come on! We just diapered you! Rainbow whined flaping her wings to disperse the smell. Ok Fluttershy, I'm sorry but I cannot do diapers. I'll be with Spike when you're done! So saying the pegasus flew out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight ooed and tried to reach for the rainbow traile she left, and when it was gone tried to follow the blue pegasus. Fluttershy gently scooped her up. Now yet, lets get you into a fresh diaper and then we can go see Dashie. Ok? Twilight gurgled something and Shy giggled. I'll take that as a yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomepony made a big stinky didn't they? Shy cooed as she changed the diaper. There we are. All done! The gentle pony said pickign the foal up who cooed happily. Shy disposed of the used diaper and carried her regressed friend downstaires. Twilight whimpered a bit when she saw Spike, but perked up imedatly when she saw Dash, and then looked confused as she noticed the mare was talking to the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe the scary thing wasn't so scarry?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon and pegasus turned at their approach and Spike held up a scroll. Ok so good news, I just receved a replay. The dragon said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was fast. The yellow pegasus commented. And the bad news? Shy asked setting Twilight down on the floor. I haven't read it yet. Spike admited emberessdly making Dash chuckle and Shy hide a giggle. Thats ok Spike what does it say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike nodded and unrolled the scroll reading through its contents in moments. He looked up face worried. Ok so, Celestia does know what spell Twilight used, but she also says that there isn't a counterspell for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Twilights going to stay a foal? Rainbow asked cutting Spike off both worried for her friend and horrified at the thought of the endless stream of dirty diapers she suddenly saw in her future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike coughed to get her attention. There is no spell, but there is a potion that can reverse it, but she dosn't know how long it will be till she can create it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth mares let out a sigh of relief. Well, I guess we'll just have to be foalsitters untill this is fixed. Right Twilight? Fluttershy booped the foals nose making her giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThats the second thing. Spike continued. Celestia also alerted her parents and they<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Luna shook in a far corner of her crib, clutching a teddy bear for comfort in the fear of her 'mother.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia magically threw the intruders out of the room, slammed the door, and cared for her little Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she teleported outside, the group had finally gotten uncluttered off the floor and readied to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia smirked, \"Oh, what?! Wishing to attack me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckled, then continued, \"Please. We can all be civil here, yes?! I don't wish to fight you! I just want to regress you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow attempted a flying kick, of which Celestia sidestepped. Celestia, faster than Rainbow could focus on dodging, punched her in the side, sending the girl soaring to the hallway's end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia cracked her own neck to prepare herself for a workout, saying, \"Next!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity snorted, then ran up to the royal, blasting away with magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia dramatically yawned, using a shield of pure magic herself. Though, she had much strong defense than Rarity's spells, so the protection she created didn't take a major beating from the repetition of castings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity drew in deep breaths from exhaustion by the time she reached Celestia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried one more blast at near point-blank range, but Celestia struck her on the head hard. Rarity's eyes closed, and she fell unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack snuck up behind Celestia somehow, and jumped up on the larger pony. She put Celestia in a chokehold, squeezing with all her Earth pony strength. Celestia struggled to thrash Applejack off her, and did so after almost losing consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClutching her own neck, Celestia said with some labor, \"No...more...nice...mommy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack got caught in Celestia's telepathic grip, and started being slammed into the walls on either side of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with a pretty large amount of endurance, Applejack didn't last past the seventh wall strike, dropping to a heap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie giggled, \"Hi, Celly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia raised an eyebrow, \"...Yes, Pinkamena?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought out her signature party cannon...from nowhere seemingly, \"Bye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, released volley after volley of surprisingly devastating confetti shots. Only the first two smashed into Celestia, but didn't hurt too bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia teleported behind Pinkie, yanked her up, jammed her into the cannon, then pulled the string.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie rocketed into a wall, and said before joining her defeated friends in dreamland, \"Nighty-night...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that remained was Spike and Fluttershy. Not the best team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy just cowered on the floor, and Celestia walked around her to stand against Spike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia responded to him taking his claws out, \"Oh, put those away! Honestly, I won't fight a baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike lowered his guard, and was shot with a Sleep spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia grinned, \"Didn't say I would not let you take a nap though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, finished the battle by returning to Fluttershy, also casting a Sleep spell on her.</span></div></div>",

She studied hard and her magic grew beyond my own expectations. I would have thought her parents would have been proud of her...... but instead seemed fearful and almost jealous of her growing knowledge. Out in public, they praised her, but when they were home and thought nopony was watching, they would belittle her, beat her and even....\" Celestia forcefully held back tears \".....other things. This I later discovered led to Twilight's OCD and her fear of displeasing me. For if something was wrong with her, her parents would.......not hold back. As time passed and she became my student, I realized this wasn't the first time I saw this happen.  I had realized my own sister was a victim of our parents. I realize now the reason she wanted the night to last forever was not a question of subject loyalty, but the hope our parents would realize her importance. Luckily they did not live long enough to see the monster they had created. Even after all these years, the scars still run deep for Luna and many nights have been restless for me as she would cry in her sleep. I decided there was only one solution to end her pain: to turn her into a foal and show her a loving parent in the form of me. My plan appears to be working as she seems happier now then I ever remember. My next target was to be Twilight, however you all brought her to me and I saw she did the spell for me. Now Luna has a sister to play with and all they will remember is that I was their loving and caring mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack looked around, surprised to see the others were still asleep after the time it took Celestia to give that speech. \"Ah still don't like this princess.\" Applejack said as she struggled in her chains\"Ah understand your intentions, but that still don't make this right.\" With a scoff Celestia answered \"Says the mare who hardly knew her parents.\" Hearing that, Applejack froze \"I can look right into you little miss honesty\" Celestia said with a grin \"I can tell your jealous of your friends just because they actually had parents for their foalhood and what did you have? Your big brother and your grandmother? You should be happy, am letting you have a second chance at living the life of a foal that knows what it's like to have a mother to protect her from harm. However, despite your current situation, I won't force this on you. Just say the word and I can let you go. The others could use a big sister anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack looked to her friends as they began to finally wake up, then back to Celestia and the two foal she just realized were here. \"Ah don't have any regrets for my life...\" she thought \".... and yet Celestia's right.\"       </span></div></div>",

She could feel sompony behind her and looked to see a tall ,white, and familiar alicorn smiling at her. She remembered why the alicorn looked familiar: she was her mommy(and she remembered her name).

You knew all along didn't you?\" As tears began streaming down the alicorn's face, she continued. \"All she wanted was to be a good daughter and her parents punished her, for what I ask? SIMPLY FOR LEARNING!!! Not only that, but you saw how troubled she was and the effects it was having on her. I ask you, WHAT DID YOU DO TO HELP HER?!? NOTHING!!! WHILE YOU WERE TRULY PRAISED AND RESPECTED, YOUR SISTER WAS GOING THROUGH THE MOST HORRID YEARS OF HER LIFE AND YOU DIDN'T LIFT A HOOF TO HELP HER!!!!!\" Shining sat in the pool, mortified not only by Celestia's turn of voice, but also how she had a point. In fact, he had actually witnessed his sister getting a tough beating simply for having figured out a spell a week before most unicorns did. His parents never knew and he never shared it with anypony. Seeing her words were getting to him, Celestia went back to her comforting voice and spoke. \"But it won't matter soon, Twilight will have a happy foalhood thanks to me. Alongside her is Luna, Applejack, and soon the rest of the Twilight's friends.\" Looking at Shining with motherly eyes \"However, I can also give you a second chance as well.\" Laying down and holding out her hooves \"Come to me, come out of the pool and you can join your sister and my family. Shining looked at the comforting hug, given that he was on the verge of crying he wanted some comfort. At that moment, he wanted nothing more then to start it all over, and now was his chance. </span></div></div>",

These treasure kept growing more and more priceless until he reached a large, circular room filled with the most beautiful gems and treasures imaginable. Everywhere he looked, Shining saw emeralds, sapphires, rubies, topazes, and most certainly: gold. What really surprised and shocked him though, was a giant dragon statue that reminded him of Spike and was was curled into a sleeping position. At least he thought it was a statue, until he noticed the smoke coming through his mouth.Curled around the Spike's hooked claws, much to Shining's displeasure was Rarity. At least it seemed to be her, however her body seemed quite like that of a crystal pony, then again she looked less like a pony and more like a dragon. Looking around, Shining was relived to see a door behind the two sleeping creatures that was no doubt the way out.

Rarity finished with a little squeal several outfits now hovering in her magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilights eyes widened in horror. A part of her was briefly aware of Spike making a hasty exit to another part of the shop as Rarity set Twilight up on the show stage.<br>\r\nWawity! Nu! Me not gonna be a mod-wal! Twilight declaired stamping a hoof defiantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAw, come on Twilight smile! Rarity pleaded as she adjusted the bonnet on the foals head a camera hovering in her magic. Twilight just looked at her with the mother of all outs her forelegs crossed defiantly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was Raritys' model for the day it seemed.  And she was not happy about it! Twilight had learned some more things about her predicament which only soured her mood further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst her magic strength and control were gone. She had tried teleporting, levitation, even opening a door were beyond her now. Twilight also discovered that her vocabulary had shrunk. When she tried to speak she found herself only able to say small simple words and phrases a young filly or colt would know. Lastly Twilight discovered if she got really excited, or really upset, the few words she could say started mixing together until she was babbling like a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all it made for a very unhappy filly. Twilight wanted to fix this, not moddle foal outfits and she was making Rarity know it! Twilight had to admit they were cute though and would look good on a real foal. Twilight however was just emberessed having Rarity constantly mix and match, swapping them on and off her and dressing her in such emberessingly infantile garmets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome on Twilight, just smile please. This is the last one. Rarity pleaded. Twilight continued to pout. Rarity frowned, then she got a wicked grin on her face as she remebered something she used to do with Sweetie Bell. Before Twilight knew it she was squealing wiht laughfter as Rarity tickled her hooves. The mare stopped after just a moment letting Twilight catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple foal was still smiling happily when Rarity snapped a pciture. And perfect! Thats going on the cover! Rarity exclaimed as Twilight calmed down and started chewing on her hoof again. What was she upset about again? Well it wasn't important if she couldn't remeber it. Oh what a pretty dress! Twilight cooed happily and started playing with her outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this Rarity frowned. Twilight was giggling happily seemingly without a care in the world, and that worried her. Was their friend regressing in mind as well, or was this jsut a side effect of the spell?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair were interupted when<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looked back at the pile biting her lip.  \"A few minutes won't hurt.\" She finally decided toddling over and setting down on her diapered rear near the pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight let out a little squeal of delight when she spotted a familiar doll amongst the offerings. \"Smawty-Pants!\" The filly cooed scooping her old doll into a hug.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity looked up briefly to see Twilight playing with her doll and toys, holding a babbling conversation with her doll as blocks, rattles, and even a few books were examined and played with.  True fully Rarity was a bit hesitant looking after Twilight when she was like this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity and foals just did not mix most days, but.  Maybe it was just the fact that Twilight was a dear friend but there was just something about the little purple foal that made Raritys' heart flutter.  Rarity knew that the other girls would swap Twilight until this was fixed, but honestly Rarity wouldn't mind looking after Twilight a bit longer.  The alabaster mare smiled and went back to her work. Twilight would look absolutely precious in this new onesie!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight soon lost track of time as she played, simply enjoying the carefree feeling as she tested each toy out.  After trying everything else out though, she found a book of her favorite stories from her fillyhood and was determined to read it from beginning to end.  So she sat with Smartypants hugged close as she read page after page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight had just gotten half-way through when Rarity suddenly picked her up.  Twilight let out a cry of shocked-protest reaching for her precious book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, Twilight.\"  Rarity gently chided.  \"You can go back to your book later. Right now a certain little filly...\"</span></div></div>",

Once Twilight was asleep, Rarity went back to her design for the new line of clothes for young fillies and colts. Rarity felt good taking care of her friend like this. It gave her the chance to see what it was like to be a mother. Just then, a new thought popped into her mind. What if she made something for mothers who nursed their babies.

The room was still in order, the only thing that seemed wrong was Twilight.  The little foal was crying at the top of her lungs, tears in her eyes as she kicked her legs and waved her arms widely her face dark red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity was over in an instant scooping the crying foal up halting the crying for a moment.  \"Twilight?!? What's wrong darling?\"  Rarity's question was soon answered when she noticed an awful smell coming form the purple foal.  Rarity recoiled managing a small \"Oh.\" as she realized the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight needed a diaper change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing her friends reaction Twilights' face got even redder in embarrassment and she started crying again.  Rarity, now holding Twilight at a distance, started panicking. The alabaster mare had been having so much fun with Twilight, she had honestly forgotten the other part about looking after a foal.  Now Twilight needed a diaper change but not only was Rarity not looking forward to changing a dirty diaper, but this was also Twilight her friend.  \"Now, now Twilight. no need to cry. please calm down.\"  Rarity cooed bouncing her friend slightly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn't work but that's when Pinkie stepped in.  \"Awwwww! Why is wittle Twily crying huh?\"  Pinkie cooed taking the foal from Rarity before making a comically exaugurated expression.  \"Uh-oh! Somepony made a stinky didn't she?  Well don't you worry! Auntie pinkie will take care of it.\" So saying pinkie popped a pacifier she got from, somewhere, into Twilight's' mouth. Rarity briefly noticed that it was the same pacifier Twilight had been nursing when she had when Rarity had started looking alter her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn didn't question where Pinkie had gotten that from, but more importantly and surprisingly it worked!  Twilight was apparently surprised too.  She kept trying to look for at the pacifier as if bobbed in her mouth, apparently just as shocked it was working.  With Twilight quiet Pinkie quickly got to work grabbing the diapering supplies soon disposing of the dirty diaper and wrapping a clean one around Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go! No more stinky diapee!\"  The pink pony cooed bopping Twilgihts' nose making the little foal giggle around her pacifier.  Rarity just let out a sigh of relief.  \"Thank you Pinkie. I, guess I panicked there didn't I?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww no problem Rarity! I know diapers aren't your thing and I don't mind looking after this cutie.\"  Pinkie replies happily scooping Twilight up to cuddle and boop the foal more making Twilight let out a stream of happy sounds.  Rarity felt her heart melt at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but still this was my day to look after Twilight so I really should have done it. I must insist on taking the next one.\"  Rarity replied.  Pinkie just responded with a shrug and her trademark grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that that's over though: Twilight, what would you like to do now?\"  Rarity asked.  Twilight just turned to the unicorn still nursing her pacifier.  With a sigh Rarity gently removed the object so Twilight could talk.  \"Come on now Twilight, what would you like to do?  I still have your toys here, or we can model a few more outfits, or Pinkie can play with you.\"  Pinkie looked really excited at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just need to know dear.\"  Twilight blinked and seemed to think before saying</span></div></div>",

What are you working anyways?\" Asked Pinkie Pie as she handed over the book. \"It's something for my new mother and child line of clothes. It was originally just going to be for young fillies and colts, but after the first time I nursed Twilight, I thought to create something for the mothers as well.\" Replied Rarity. After Twilight was done, Rarity placed her friend on the floor with her toys to play with for a moment while she got back to work. \"Do you think Twilight would mind if I looked after her for a while.\" Asked Pinkie Pie as she followed the alabaster unicorn. \"I don't see why not.

Twilight was well aware of how she was acting like a real foal. Crying when she woke form her nap needing a change, to her recent nursing to now crying over a loud noise, but she couldn't help it.  It just seemed natural, almost right to behave this way, and it was starting to scare her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie was over in an instant soon calming the purple foal while Rarity glared at whoever was at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer glaze softened when she saw it was Spike, then morphed into concern when she saw the state he was in.  The baby dragon was panting and out of breath hanging onto the door frame like it was his lifeline.  From the ragged breathing and amount of sweat covering his scales Rarity concluded he must have run the whole way here.  The drake seemed like he was trying to say something but Rarity couldn't make out a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spike! What happened? No! Don't talk. Let me get you some water.\" Pinkie continued to hold and cuddle a now calm Twilight as Rarity brought Spike the largest glass of water she could find. Spike drained the thing in seconds, but seemed much better afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thanks Rarity.\" He muttered.  \"Your welcome Spiky, now what's the problem?\"  Spike suddenly looked nervous, glancing at Twilight.  \"Well, you know I left when Twilight woke up right?\"  Both Twilight and Rarity gave him a small glare.  Yes, they did remember how Spike had ducked out right before the \"fashion show\" but neither could blame the drake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill Spike gulped at there expressions.  \"Right, well after I left I decide to let the rest of the girls know about. There were only a few, like Pinkie, so I managed to get them pretty fast.\"  The pink party pony waved happily at her name.  \"And then I just kind of wandered around town, and then thought about what had happed and what I could do, then I started panicking and.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity stopped his nervous ranting with a gentle hoof to his lips.  \"The point Spike please.

Isn't she just the cutest?\"  Fluttershy cooed hovering over to get a better look at there regressed friend.  Twilight looked up at the movement and her expression became on of shocked embarrassment.  Twilight was not happy with all the ponies that were seeing her like this, especially since she was caught playing with foal toys!  Her cheeks flushed in embarrassment Twilight tried to pretend she had not just been playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the girls found this utterly adorable, but Rainbow Dash couldn't help but snicker.  \"Wat funny?!?\"  Twilight demanded in her high pitched lisp, which only made Dahs snicker harder.  \"You can talk?\"  Fluttershy exclaimed, but it was at her normal tone of voice so no one heard her.  At the look Rarity gave her the blue pegasus was forced to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry ok.\"  Dahs explained sounding honestly guilty for laughing.   \"Its just.  You really messed up Twilight.  Having fun with you toys? Have you needed a diaper change yet?\"  \"It no fu-ny Wain-bow!\" Twilight argued pouting, before she felt something.  Twilight looked down noticing a growing stain on her diaper: she was wetting herself!  In front of all her friends!  Twilight squeaked in shock and tried to cover up the growing mark but everypony saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShy and Pinkie immediately cooed and went to tend to Twilight while Rarity glared at the snickering pegasus.  Rainbow knew she should stop, but like she said the prismatic Pegasus just found the whole situation darkly amusing.  How could Twilight mess up so badly that she turned herself into a foal?  Dash knew she should stop, but every time she tried she started comparing the little foal in the wet diaper to her studious friend and couldn't help but let out another snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you would like to change Twilight?\"  Rarity hissed.  Rainbow immediately stopped her snickering.  \"No way! Un-uh! I do not do diapers, or foals in general!  That's why you were the one to look after Twilight in the first place!\"  Rainbow protested.  \"So your abandoning your friend when she needs you?  Some element of loyalty!\"  Rarity shot back.  Then Rarity and Rainbow got into an argument, which AJ soon joined as Fluttershy and Pinkie continued to coo at Twilight as if she was a real foal saying things like \"I'll change you when your done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight covered her ears and whimpered feeling something well up inside her.  All the noise, the embarrassment, Dash's snickering, being treated like a real foal, realizing that she had been acting just like a real foal!  Twilight again felt something snap inside her.  She started crying again her loud wail immediately silencing everyone as her horn started glowing brightly fueled by her emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic surge!\" Rarity shouted her eyes going wide in horror.  Immediately everypony went to dive for cover just as Twilights horn let out a massive flash of light.  When she could see again Twilight looked around blinking in confusion realizing what had happened!  Twilight immediately covered her mouth in horror!  \"Giwls! Me so-wy! Tu o-tay! Pwease!\"  Twilight felt like crying again as her friends came out of hiding and they realized that</span></div></div>",

Twilight was still feeling horrible about her surge had kept as far away from Dash as possible, thankful that only her friends body had been affected.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow for her part was angry and embarrassed at her situation.  Rainbow had even tried to remove her diaper out of embarrassment, and had been so adamant that Pinkie had actually taped the thing to keep her from ripping it off.  Pinks had explained that RD needed the diaper now, that Twilight already needed a change and they had no idea how long this would last so.  With all that Dash was quite happy to avoid Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo for the first few minutes in the nursery both foals just sat in a corner and ignored one another, waiting until they fixed this or Twilights mother found them.  However, there plans didn't last five minutes as the Cake Twins soon noticed the new ponies in there nursery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Pound and pumpkin simply looked at the new foals, foals that looked so much like Pinkie's friends. But her friends weren't small and wear diapers. After a bit both foals decided they didn't care and they had new playmates!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Twilight and Rainbow had waved the twins off, with Rainbow being very vocal about it, but as the Twins kept insisting they play the two regressed ponies became more and more interested. Though they still had there minds the foolish toys and activities just seemed so, so fun! Hesitantly at first Twilight and Rainbow began to join in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon all four foals were laughing and playing, there earlier troubles forgotten as Rainbow and pound played a game of flying tag and Twilight and Pumpkin moved toys with there magic creating a grand story. Eventually though Twilight yawned, which was soon taken up by the other foals. Not long after the four just crashed, grabbing whatever was nearby as a pillow and taking a nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after Mrs. Cake entered to check on her foals. Seeing all of them asleep the mother mare smiled and gently scooped them up and set them in a crib. Her twins in one and the regressed mares in another.</span></div></div>",

The owners of Sugar Cube Corner were not happy with the idea of hiding what had happened, especially since Twilight's mother was in town looking for her daughter.  After some convincing, and an assurance that this was only temporary and Spike was looking over the spell to fix it as they spoke, the earth ponies agreed to help and stay quiet about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that the ponies busied themselves for the next hour, waiting for something to happen.  After a bit Applejack reluctantly left.  She had farm work and her market stand to run afterall, and fixing a magic spell wasn't her area of expertise.  The farmmare promised to come running if she was needed though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity spent that time nursing a milkshake and wondering what would happen when Twilight grew up again. Once again the alabaster unicorn felt a stab in her heart at the thought of losing \"her foal\" but pushed it back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight needed to be her correct age, no questions.  Twilight was her friend, not her foal!  So why did she feel so upset at the thought of getting Twilight back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was started from her thoughts by the sound of several foals crying. Immediately Rarity, Fluttershy and Mrs. Cake were rushing upstairs.  Pinkie Pie started to leave, then remembered she had a line of customers and stayed put.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue earth pony had a smile fixed as she walked into the nursery. \"Hello dears, what's wrong?\" At her voice Pound and Pumpkin stopped crying. Twilight also stopped noticing Rarity walk over, but was still red faced and actually looked away<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow though kept throwing a tantrum, trashing and crying as only a very upset foal could. Fluttershy picked the crying foal up. \"Whats wrong Dashie?\" Fluttershy soon got an answer noticing the smelly lump in the back of the Pegasus diaper. \"Oh, I guess somepony needs a change?\" Fluttershy asked bouncing Rainbow trying to get her to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they all do.\" Mrs. Cake said already tending to her children.  \"Just give me a minute dears and i'll be out of your way.\"  Twilight clung to Rarity red faced in embarrassment. The purple pony had woken up to Dash crying and had noticed that she also had messed her diaper while she slept.  Twilight was embarrassed beyond words, but Rarity's warm presence calmed her.  Without noticing Twilight began to suck on her hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow though was still crying.  \"Calm down Rainbow Dash. Its ok, just a stinky diaper. I'll get you changed and make it better. Its ok, little foals make messes all the time.\"  Rainbow didn't calm down though.  She wasn't supposed to be a foal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some doing, and borrowing a nearby pacifier, but soon Rainbow had calmed down and all foals were in new diapers.  \"There we go, now that wasn't so bad was it?\"  Fluttershy asked with a kind smile.  Rainbow just nursed her pacifier and turned away still to embarrassed to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now what?\"  Rarity asked after a bit.  Mrs. Cake shrugged.  \"That's up to you dearie.  Carrot and I won't mind if you want to hang out here till this mess is fixed, and I think the twins would love to play with Twilight and Rainbow some more anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins babbled excitedly at that.  Twilight perked up seemingly eager to play, but Rainbow just blushed and shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy and Rarity shared a look before deciding.</span></div></div>",

A low growl reached the ears of the assembled mares who turned towards the source.  Twilight and Rainbow blushed as there stomach growled again.

Rainbow though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nu-uh! Nu ay!\"  The blue foal said stubbornly refusing to nurse. Rarity sighed.  \"Come on Rainbow Dash, your much to young for most foods, so this is only way.

I am sorry to say but right now you are a foal until we can fix this so please don't fight me and eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow looked up at Rarity in shock, a hurt expression on her face.  Rarity felt something stab in her heart at the expression but kept a stern face.  Rainbow was notoriously stubborn and Rarity knew that she had to drill what had happened into the prismatic pegasus head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity did not like it, but the sooner Rainbow stopped fighting that she was a foal again, the easier this would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Rainbow's expression morphed and the blue foal</span></div></div>",

His second reaction was to lie his tail off and hope they go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first plan was ruined because Pinkie Pie. She <i>would</i> find a way inside and figure out what had happened no matter what Spike did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis second plan was thwarted because of Applejack. She would know he was lying and would wring the truth from him. So that left only one option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon gulped, and hoped Twilight wouldn\u2019t be too angry as he opened the door a bit further inviting the two mares in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUm, well you see. Its kind of complicated. He began nervously as AJ walked in and Pinkie bounced inside. It um, well Twilight was trying a new spell and. He groaned. Why was this so hard to explain?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two mares were now looking at him worriedly. Something happened to Twilight? Pinkie gasped dramatically. This is horrible, disastrous, terrible! She cried jumping into the air, then stopped blinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait? If something happened to Twilight, why did my dozy tell me to bring this? Pinkie asked dropping her saddlebags and opening them revealing diapers, bottles, powder, toys and everything else you needed to look after a foal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike gulped. Well, you see. Its because Twilight turned herself into a foal. He admitted. There was a pause. Applejack looked at him with an expressing of confused disbelief. Pinkie though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party pony gasped again her smile beaming. Twilight is a wittle bitty cutie foal! She squealed. Oh this is super, tremendous, wonderful! I have to see her. Where is she? And with that Pinkie zoomed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike followed with AJ on his heels. Pinkie wait! Twilight might not want to see you yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight for her part was unaware of this. The foal leaned back in the booster seat sighing contently having finished the applesauce. The little pony was covered with bits and pieces of her meal but was either unaware of her messy state or simple didn\u2019t care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did Spike even find a booster seat anyway?\u201d She though unaware that she was starting to suck on her hoof. A moment later she felt thirsty and eyed the glass of milk Spike had set out. Twilight eagerly reached for it, not thinking to use her magic first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe managed to grab it, the small glass looking massive next to her small hooves, but forgot about a foal\u2019s coordination. Twilight only succeeded in spilling the milk all over herself when she tried to sip it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foal blinked then immediately felt the need to cry again, which she did. \u201cWhy am I acting like this?!?\u201d Twilight thought as she cried realizing that she was acting more and more like a foal but found herself unable to stop. Which only made her cry harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped crying in shock when she felt herself be picked up and found herself looking at the smiling face of Pinkie Pie. Aww, don\u2019t cry little Twiliy. Pinkie cooed bouncing the foal a bit before setting her on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere\u2019s one surefire way to calm a crying foal. Pinkie said seriously. Where\u2019s Twily? Pinkie cooed covering her face. Where\u2019s Twily? The party pony suddenly threw her hooves away and gasped dramatically. There she is! Pinkie cried grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight blinked finally registuring that Pinkie Pie was in the room with her, had seen her cying liek the foal she now looked like and was currently playing a game of peek-a-boo with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat\u2019s Twilights response to this relevation?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Twilight was sitting on the floor, covered in applesauce and milk, and laughing as Pinkie continued to play and make silly faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery time Pinkie would pause Twilight would get ahold of herself and looked like she was going to say something, and then Pinkie did something else that made her break out into infantile laughter again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon picked his jaw off the floor and shared a look with Applejack. The farm mare looked just as lost as he was. So the two just looked on as Twilight continued to, well act like a foal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though after several minutes of this Twilight suddenly yawned. Aww. Is wittle Twily ready for her nappy? Pinkie cooed scooping the foal up and rocking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNu, nu sweepy. Twilight muttered her eyes already closing as Pinkie hummed a song she often used for the Cake twins. In moments Twilight was dozing, and starting to suck on her hoof again. Pinkie giggled and replaced the purple hoof with a pacifier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party pony sighed happily. You are such a cutie. Pinkie squealed before setting the foal down. Spike broke from his trance then. What, hey? Pinkie what are you doing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting a diaper on this little cutie before she has an accident. Pinkie replied simply removing the supplies. Bwa? But why? The dragon asked confused. Pinkie giggled. Silly Spikie. All foal need diapees. Pinkie said taping the garment shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike groaned. I know that, but this is Twilight. Don\u2019t you think she doesn\u2019t need them? The pink pony just shrugged. Well, we\u2019ll see after her nap won\u2019t we? Now I better get her cleaned up a bit as well. Where do you keep the wash cloths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike just wordlessly pointed and the mare and foal hopped off. Applejack watched them go before finally speaking up. Spike, could ya please tell me what jus happened here?!? The fame mare groaned out clutching her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing Spike gave a rundown of what had happened that morning. So we need to find a way to reverse this. He finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAww. Why would you want to reverse this? Pinkie asked cooing at the sleeping foal. Because you saw how she was acting Pinkie. Spike said giving her a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight is acting more and more like a foal. This wasn\u2019t on purpose and this isn\u2019t a game. I\u2019m worried about her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie blinked. This, isn\u2019t a game? Twilight didn\u2019t mean to do this? Oh. That, is bad. She finished dully as she literally deflated. Spike and AJ winced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, nothing saying ya can\u2019t play with her while we\u2019re looking to fix this. AJ said hesitantly. Pinkie was immediately back to her old self beaming widely. You\u2019re right! The twins will love having a new playmate! She squealed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike coughed, hoping that Twilight would forgive them for whatever Pinkie was going to put her through. In the meantime, I need to send some letters to Celestia, and her parents and see if anyone can reverse this. He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie, think you can bring Twilight with you and watch over her for a bit while I get everything sorted out? Spike assumed the way she was smiled and rushed out the door was a \u201cyes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ sighed. Twi won\u2019t be to happy when she wakes up. She muttered following her hyperactive pink friend.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ok this isn't funny say something!\"   Tears welling up in her eyes Twilight tried to explain but only more baby babble escaped her mouth.  \"I can't talk!\"  Twilight realized feeling a coldness settle in her stomach.

Could it be reversed?  Would she have to move away from her friends?  What would Celestia think?  All these thoughts and more swirled around Twilights mind and a new feeling bubbled in her.

Don't cry! We'll fix this, somehow.\"  The dragon pleaded as he acquardly rocked the crying foal trying to calm her down.   After a few minutes Twilight did calm down slightly and looked up at Spike with teary eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt suddenly hit Spike that his/mother/big sister/boss figure was now a baby and needed a caretaker herself.  \"Now what?\"  Spike thought gulping.

She knew that Twilight was working in her library this day, but she was in \"desperate\" need of Twilight's help. She had several gray strands of hair in her mane and they just wouldn't come out no matter what she tried. The local spa dyes just weren't powerful enough. So, her next option was magic. Currently, she was wearing a beautiful hat to hide her mane, but she wanted to show her gorgeous mane to the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity trotted slowly to the library door and then carefully opened the library door with levitation. Once inside, she noticed only Twilight was in sight which gave her a sigh of relief. She didn't want Spike to see her ugly gray hair. Twilight, on the other hoof, was someone Rarity could trust. Still, she was quiet, slowly closing the library door behind her and gradually walked up to Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, when she was nearby she moved one of Twilight's organized pens, taking Twilight out of focus. Twilight quickly lost focus to reorganize the pen, warmly greeting Rarity. \"Hi Rarity, How are you doing? Why'd you decide to come over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity kept her cool, \"Good, good, I just need a little magical assistance, that's why I came over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what can I do for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity took off her hat and almost instantly lost her demeanor \"My-my mane. There's gray hairs in it! I need a youthinizing spell. None of the spa dyes work and they tried everything. Please please help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight chuckled \"Of course Rarity. This shouldn't be too difficult now that I'm an alicorn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity sighed \"Oh thank you. Thank you! You are the best friend I could ask for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all Rarity. Though, you're going to have to stand still while I cast the spell. Just give me one moment while I search for the book.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity sat in a library chair patiently waiting for her friend to come back. It took about two to three minutes, but Twilight was finally back. \"Alright Rarity, just sit tight and you should be a week younger. That should give you time to prevent the prevent the gray hairs coming in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again Twilight, you're a life saver.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight just nodded and begun the spell. She blasted Rarity with a magenta bolt, levitating her into the air. In the air, a magenta auras started spinning around Rarity. The faster these auras spun, the younger the casted would become. Twilight last casted this spell when she was a unicorn and would up over shooting the spell, turning Rarity into a ten month old foal. Twilight and Rarity were both closing their eyes and had no idea what was happening. Twilight started to levitate her down and Rarity kept her eyes closed until feeling the cushion of the chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey opened their eyes at about the time. Twilight was astonished and couldn't even spit out what happened to Rarity. Rarity was scared by her friends response and slowly turned to her body, seeing in horror her body regressed to that of a baby. Tear droplets quickly formed around Rarity's eyes and within second she broke the silence, wailing at the top of her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next</span></div></div>",

No need to cry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of Twilight's rocking, Rarity started to calm down. Her facial expression quickly went to anger though.

Rarity yelled running, er, toddling away as fast as her tiny legs could go. Twilight resisted the urge to \"DAWW\" at the sight of a foal trying to avoid her diaper change and cut Rarity off in three steps. Come on Rarity. She soothed. This is for your own good. The spell will be over in a week and I really need to get you into one before you have an accident. NOOO! Rarity denied again turning to run the other way. Twilight caught her friend in her magic before the foal could run off. Please don't fight me Rarity. Twilight pleaded. This will all be over before you know it. ME AM BIG PONY!  Rarity yelled as she squirmed and kicked in the purple glow, her own horn glowing as tried to perform a spell of her own. ME NO NEED DYPEES! WET ME GO TU BIG MEANY EAD! WAAAHHHHHHHH! Rarity began to wail like the upset foal she had become the situation overwhelming her. Not only would letting herself be diapered prove she was a foal but the thought of using the diapers! The thought of a dirty diaper pushed the grime and dirt avoiding unicorn over the edge. Twilights surge of sympathy for her friend was quickly drowned out by her friends crying, along with everything else. Sweet Celestia she has a powerful set of lungs! Twilight thought covering her ears wondering if they would start bleeding any moment. Rarities cries continued to build, as did her distress and the glow of her horn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes something happen?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To the shock of both ponies it worked. Rarity started sucking on the rubber nub, either unwilling or unable to spit it out. Judging from the look she was getting Twilight figured it was the later. Tightening her magic to hold Rarity gently but firmly Twilight lowered her friend so the white unicorn lay on her back on the floor and began the delayed diapering process. Rarity whimpered and squirmed still trying to fight, but in the end Twilight managed to apply the lotion, powder, and tape the diaper closed. Now that wasn't so bad was it? Twilight asked cuddling her friend to her chest. Rarity continued to whimper and whine for a few moments before growing silent. Confused Twilight cradled Rarity in her arms, and smiled when she saw the sleeping foal sucking on her paci. Guess this was too much for you huh Rarity? Twilight asked softly starting to rock the foal. The alicorn sighed. Well Twilight looks like you are a mother for the next week. Now what? The alicorns mind hit overdrive as she began to schedule the next week. I can convert one of the rooms into a nursery for the week and I can afford plenty of supplies, so no problem there. Our friends and Sweetie Bell need to know thought. Oh I can only imagin how she will react. \"Cutie Mark Crusaders Foalsitters! Yay!\" Or Spike! I can't imagine how he will take this. Twilight looked at the foal, sleeping peacefully after her emotional and physical exhaustion. How am I supposed to explain this?!?</span></div></div>",

Rarity still slept, well like a foal undisturbed by her friends and sister. Twilight sighed tiredly. Well Rarity came to me wanting to remove some grey hairs. Wanting to help I decided to use a youthinizing spell, not an age spell I want the difference to be clear, to help. She rubbed the back of her neck. I guess I overloaded the spell because she ended up like this. The good news is that it will wear off in a week. Twilight finished with forced cheeriness. Currently the Main six, Spike and Sweetie Bell were gathered in the room Twilight had chosen as the nursery. It consisted of soft pinks, whites, and purple crystals covered in soft carpet with a changing table, crib, and plenty of toys and books. It was perfect. Twilight had checked all of her books to make sure. Of course her friends had reacted differently. Spike was looking through the crib bars with a blank look, his expression unreadably as he looked at his crush that was now younger than he was. Sweetie Bell was crowding against the bars smiling as her \u201cbig sis\u201d slept, her mind already filling with crusading ideas. Fluttershy was cooing at Rarity a look of pure bliss on her face while Pinkie was bouncing around chatting quickly but quietly about all the fun things she could do with Rarity and the Cake twins. Rainbow had thought the situation was funny, but was nice enough to limit it to snickers. Applejack still didn\u2019t seem to grasp what had happened, as this was the fourth time she had asked. So, what do we do? The farm mare finally asked looking at her regressed friend. Well, all I have to do is take care of her till the spell wears off. Twilight said. Really that\u2019s the long and short of it. I just called you girls, and Spike, so you would be aware and to help out if you could. Instantly Fluttershy, Pinkie, and Sweetie Bell\u2019s hooves went into the air causing Twilight to chuckle. Maybe you could turn us into foals to play with this little cutie. Pinkie added, surprising serious. Twilight hummed at the suggestion then shook her head.Thanks girls, but I got her for now. That is somethingto think about Pinkie but we will have to see. This should wear off soon and we\u2019ll have everything back to normal in a week! Nothing could go. Twilight found her proclamation cut off by a pink hoof. Shhhhh! Pinkie shushed covering Twilights mouth, somehow, despite being three feet away from the crib on the other side. Don\u2019t say it. Wha?! Pinkie! Twilight hissed batting the hoof away. Don\u2019t you know Twilight. You never say \u201cNothing could go wrong\u201d or \u201cwhat could possiable go wrong\u201d because you\u2019re just inviting something bad to happen. And I just said \u201cWhat could possiable go wrong!\u201d Pinkie covered her own mouth with both her hooves. At that moment Rarity began to stir, cutting off Twilight impending rant. The foal yawned cutely, causing the mares to daww, rubbed her eyes as she looked around at the assembled ponies and dragon. Suddenly her eyes grew wide and she began crying, dropping her pacifier and causing everyone to jump. Twilght immediately grabbed the foal and started rocking her. Shhhh. It\u2019s ok. What\u2019s wrong Rarity? The foal looked at Twilight with teary eyes and opened her mouth.</span></div></div>",

Twilight was the first to speak up, \"So.. Rarity, you're okay with being a baby again?

Me cuda wet me-sef wiw a fu-wal aw-di-wence!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis answer just added to the enigma of the situation. Twilight was puzzled, worrying that maybe the spell had some negative effect on Rarity's brain. Sure all those reasons fit Rarity to a tee, but it was still being a baby, something that hours ago she protested against. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's pondering was cut off with Rarity then speaking up again \"No-wa wha aw you Twi-wigh gonna do ab-owt me shwow! Dis is ya fawt afta aw-wal!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis answer took Twilight out of her trance. Perhaps this was Rarity. The real Rarity certainly would say that.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Rarity was tearing up and she briefly did the unimaginable. She pooped in her diaper. This was a <i>very</i> noticeable accident. As she made the accident, a loud farting sound echoed throughout the crystal-y room. What more, if this sound wasn't heard, the smell that filled the room certainly was. All of Rarity's friends and Sweetie Bloom covered their noses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Rarity launched into another full scale wail, \"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this wail was cut off by a certain pony's a response. This response accentuated the fact that Rarity was indeed a baby. The pony who made this response was none other than Pinkie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie covered her nose for a brief second until she heard Rarity's wails. She went right into action, speaking to Rarity as if she was one of the Cake Twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn warm tone, Pinkie enthusiastically said \"Ahhhh, looks like somepony wony made a stinky winky in her diaper wiaper. You must've had a lot of food-y woody, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about Pinkie's tone was... soothing. Rarity slowly stopped crying as she heard Pinkie say this. She eventually stopped at \"stinky winky in her diaper wiaper.\" The words themselves were embarrassing, but something about how they were said instinctively soothed Baby Rarity. Oddly enough, Rarity still wanted to cry, but her body would not allow it. She could hear Pinkie loud and clear and even heard the statement \"food-y woody.\" This line annoyed Rarity, but there was some truth to it. After all, she <i>did</i> have all those tubs of ice cream before coming over. This was just <i>great</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie continued with her commentary, meanwhile moving Rarity to the changing table. \"Don't worry orry Rarity, I'll have your flank-y wank-y all clean-y wean-y in jippy wippy.\" After finishing that statement, Pinkie had put Rarity on the changing table and gave a little \"boop\" to Rarity's nose before starting the changing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly enough, Pinkie used her hooves for the diaper changing and was quite skilled at it actually. Looks like all those Cake Twin Foalsitter gigs really paid off. In a matter of seconds, Rarity's dirty diaper was off and thrown into the nearby waste bucket. \"There we are! No more icky wicky diaper, right Rarity?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity was too much in astonishment by the mere fact that Pinkie, OF ALL THE PONIES, was the first to legitimately clean her bottom. Pinkie took Rarity's wide mouth to mean she was mesmerized. \"Ahh, no need to be surprised Rarity Warity, I'm your Auntie Pinkie Pie! The best diaper changer around. Speaking of which, your bottom wottom is in need of some wipe-y wipe wipes.\" In a flash, Pinkie wiped Rarity's flank clean and quickly moved on to powdering it. \"Okey Dokey Lokey, time for the new diap-y wiap-y. Don't worry Rarity, this is going to feel great!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity couldn't believe it. Pinkie was right. Pinkie put the new diaper on just right, not too tight and not loose. Unlike before, Rarity could <i>really</i> feel the comfy-ness of this diaper. Rarity didn't want to give Rarity a smile afterwards, but she simply couldn't resist. Afterwards, Rarity gave giggled with glee, smiling wide. What? She couldn't help it. This diaper just felt so much more comfy compared to the last one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie took this as a sign that Rarity enjoyed the entire changing. \"D'aaaaawww, wasn't that fun. Diaper changes with Pinkie Pie will be a blast!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the mane6 and Sweetie Belle just in shock. Based on the way Rarity and Pinkie were acting, one could hardly tell that Rarity actually used to be an adult hours earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash got out of her shock first. \"Okay, what was <b>that</b>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie walked up to her with Rarity cuddled in her chest, \"What do you mean silly? I just was giving little Rarity here a diaper change? What are ya? <i>jealous</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash was outraged, but tried to keep in her anger around Rarity, now that she was a baby. In an irritated tone, Rainbow responded \"No. I meant... How did you give Rarity a diaper change so easily? Isn't she your friend? Isn't that <b>awkward</b>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie chuckled \"Silly Rainbow Dash, It was really easy. I'm her friend after all. Friends give other friends things they'd never expect the other friend to need. Like, I had nooo idea this morning that Rarity here would need one of my patented Pinkie Pie diaper changes, but I'd love to give her one. Haha, I'd love to give all my friends my patented Pinkie Pie diaper change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn some level, Rainbow wanted to argue against this, but she knew doing so was pointless. Pinkie didn't seem to notice the awkward-ness of changing another friend's diaper and Rainbow didn't feel like explaining it to her. However, Rainbow absolutely would not let Pinkie get away with saying she was <i>jealous</i> of being diaper changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this was happening, Rarity was simply lost in the sensual delight of her diaper, which pressed up against her. She only paid attention vaguely, looking up at her adult friends with a gentle smile and hardly noticing the tension in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash brashly talked back to Pinkie. \"Get caught up in your fantasies about changing your friends' diapers, but don't forget that those are <b>just</b> fantasies. Don't tell me that I'm jealous. I'd <b>never</b> be jealous of diaper changes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie just giggled with a snort \"Haha, silly! Rarity turned into baby by accident. It's more possible than you think!\" After finishing her statement, she gave a playful wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that final note... </span></div></div>",

Fluttershy was the first to spot this; the rest were preoccupied on Rainbow and Pinkie's conversation. Fluttershy quickly told Twilight, who then tried to interject. However, Twilight didn't know when to but in. Rainbow and Pinkie's conversation just kept getting more out of hoof. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Rarity felt like her imagination could actually be brought out in full force through magic. She looked around the room, wondering what to do. She had all sorts of baby decoration ideas in her mental storage, but one strong idea suddenly hit her. Turn Rainbow into a baby. She giggled to herself and then began aiming at Rainbow. Rainbow and Pinkie were too distracted, but Twilight, AJ, Fluttershy, and Sweetie Belle saw what she was doing. The four of them collectively yelled \"RARITY! NO!\" by coincidence. This caused Rainbow to snap out of her argument and turn to the four. \"What's going on now-?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow started her question with a brash voice, but suddenly felt magic shoot her. Right then, she cut herself off, turning a 180 to Rarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth went wide opened once she noticed that Rarity was shooting her with a blue beam of magic. Next, she realized that she was being suspended in the air. In one quick huff she yelled \"WHAT IS GOING ON?!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately after, blue auras formed around her and spun rapidly. This exact same process happened to Rarity hours earlier. While Rarity casted the spell she giggled \"Hehe., Pinkee wa wight!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue auras formed a vortex around Rainbow. She couldn't see a thing. She couldn't hear a thing. Rainbow spoke out throughout this process, asking what was going on. The only sensation she could feel was a spiraling blue energy around her. Gradually, this sensation seemed to speed up. In actuality, Rainbow was simply regressing, which caused the blue vortex to feel stronger as her size changed. Rainbow didn't know this though and her raspy adult questions soon turned to childish pleas for help. Rainbow's voice had become high pitched, but she didn't notice a thing. And before she knew it, this blue vortex felt terrifying. Rainbow increasingly felt insecure. She wanted somepony anypony to be beside her. Her fear of alone-ness quickly caught up to her and she couldn't resist it anymore. She cried. These cries soon turned to wails and these wails then turned into high pitched screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, no one could hear what was happening. Even if they could, all of them, except Pinkie and Rarity, were flabbergasted to the point that they wouldn't hear Rainbow's earlier questions. They were stunned that one of Rarity's baby magic surges had such power and that Rarity could actually control these surges. All of sudden, Rarity was a force to be reckoned with, one that would have to be taught to not shoot her friends with aura beams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple minutes passed by and everypony on the outside could finally hear Rainbow's wails. They tried to call out to Rainbow, but their words didn't seem to reach her. Before they knew it, Rainbow started screaming in a high pitched voice. Once this happened, the blue vortex quickly dispersed and the new foal was lowered onto the carpet floor. What emerged was a tiny naked light blue foal with a rainbow mane and tail, screaming at the top of her lungs. Twilight, AJ, Fluttershy, and Sweetie Belle all opened their mouths in complete shock. Rarity could turn other ponies into babies with her magical surges? The thought was rather terrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of sudden, Rainbow, now more than ever, needed comfort. One pony in particular quickly came to support the terrified baby pegasus. That pony was none other than Fluttershy. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fluttershy quickly jumped into action, cradling the now 10 month old Rainbow Dash. Fluttershy then sang in a majestic voice \"Hush now, quiet now, ev-ery-thing will be al-right, hush now, quiet now, ev-ery thing is o-k...\" a couple times. Her singing soothed both Rainbow Dash and unintentionally Rarity, who was about to be in big trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash soon calmed down and her screams were reduced to a murmur. She could finally notice everypony staring right at her, most especially Fluttershy who was holding Rainbow in her front hooves. Rainbow's first instinct was to hug Fluttershy with quiet tears coming down her face. \"Dat wa scaw-y! Me don wan ta be awone anee-maw! Pwease don weab me!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy embraced Rainbow hug and the rest went \"awwwwww\" to Rainbow's behavior, except Rarity, who was a little jealous of Rainbow's attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy rubbed Rainbow's back with her right front hoof. \"There, there.. You're okay. I'm here and I won't let anything bad happen to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow asked  \"But but, da bwoo bo-tec wa con-swom me. Eee migh be bak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy gave a warm reassuring response, wiping the tears off of Rainbow's face \"Noo.. You have no need to fear. Those vortexes won't get our Rainbow Dash\" Fluttershy then adorably snuggled with Rainbow \"Our Rainbow Dash is brave and adventurous. She won't let any vortex scare her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis cheered Rainbow up and soon started giggling, the first time she showed an actually positive emotion while being a baby. \"Tanks Fwuttashy. Dah chee-wad me up. You wight! Me am bwabe an ah-wen-tuwous! Me da bes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy gently smiled. \"There's the Rainbow I know and love. I'm happy you're all better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow perked up, \"Me too!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy giggled after Rainbow's response, replying \"But in the mean time, you are going to need a diaper change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow's mood suddenly changed. She folded her front hooves giving an adorable \"No! Me a, bi-ga po-nwy. Me no need dypees.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight intersected \"Unfortunately, she's right Rainbow. You will need a diaper change for the time being. I'll quickly find out how long this spell will last, right after a certain someone apologizes for her rude behavior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's voice then became stern \"Rarity.\" and she walked closer to Rarity who was still in Pinkie's hooves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity fearfully responded in a high pitched voice \"Wes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight kept the tone of voice the same \"Why did you turn Rainbow Dash into a baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity had trouble spitting out the words \"Becas becas...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity suddenly burst into tears \"Becas me tout it wou-da be maw fun! Me jus got da powa an an *sniff* di-dent kno wha ta doo. Pinkee se-da Wai-bow migh be ah baby, so da wa da ow-wy ting me cud tink ob!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's facial expression soon changed to one of sympathy after seeing Rarity burst out in tears. The little baby knew what she did wrong, which was a good sign. As Rarity's new unofficial mother, Twilight had to make sure Rarity was being nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight levitated Rarity from Pinkie's into her own. Pinkie smiled and understood that this was a job for Mommy Twilight. Twilight rocked Rarity back in forth in hooves. \"It's alright Rarity. I forgive you.\" and wiped off Rarity's tears with her wing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity responded hesitantly \"Wa-wa-wee-wy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight smiled. \"Yes, really. But, you still have to apologize to Rainbow and you will not get desert tonight or the special cotton blanket I let you sleep with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity responded upset \"Bu-bu Twi-wigh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight expected this, but handled it like an adult. \"Not ut, uh. No butts. I'm being very generous by not giving you other punishments. It was an accident, but you can't let it happen again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ said under her breath \"A little two generous if you ask me...\" No one heard AJ's comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity felt defeated \"Okay Twi-wigh.. you wight...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight smiled gently, \"For now, you need to apologize to Rainbow.\" Twilight then carried Rarity over near the changing table where Fluttershy and Rainbow were. \"Now Rarity, what do you have to say to Rainbow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity timidly said \"Sowwy.\"  Twilight interjected \"For what?\" Rarity then finished her apology. \"Me sowwy Wai-bow dah me tur yo-wa inta ah baby. Me di-den mean ta huw-ta yo-wa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy, nudged Rainbow. \"What do you have to say Rainbow?\" Rainbow looked up, \"No-ting. She mean-y. She no mean it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy was appalled. She in essence had become Rainbow's unofficial mommy, similar to how Twilight had become Rarity's unofficial mommy. Fluttershy sternly stated \"Rainbow, Rarity is your friend and friends make mistakes. Good friends accept their friends' apologies and forgive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow spoke a little \"Bu-\" only to be cut off my Fluttershy who raised her voice, using the stare and saying \"Raaaainbow Dash..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of these techniques showed who had the power between Fluttershy and Rainbow. Fluttershy's techniques were actually so effective that Rainbow started to tear up \"You-you.. wight... me me *sniff* sorry.\" Rainbow had mentally connected Fluttershy with the protection from alone-ness. As a result, Rainbow was extremely afraid to lose Fluttershy's support. Rainbow had become a baby who was quick to obey Mommy Fluttershy's orders.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, the unofficial mommies, Twilight and Fluttershy, and their foals, Rarity and Rainbow respectively, smiled. For once in this jam backed day, there was a moment of calm-ness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or so passed by, AJ awoke them to reality. \"Um.. any y'all wanna find out how long Rainbow will stay a foal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unofficial mommies said together by coincidence \"Oh, right!\" Pinkie then raised her right front hoof \"Ooooo!! Me! Me! Me! I'll go get the book. I know which one it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight stated \"How would you-? Oh never mind, that sounds like a good idea. Fluttershy and I are a little preoccupied.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie smiled on her way out, briefly reminding Fluttershy \"Oh remember to give Rainbow a diaper change. You don't want her having a messy wessy now would you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow sarcastically said \"Yea.. wight.. tanks Pinkee.\" while Fluttershy authentically said \"Ahh, right. Thanks Pinkie Pie, I almost forgot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie smugly responded \"You both are welcome. Don't worry Rainbow, Auntie Pinkie will remind them about your diaper needs.\" In the end, Pinkie was right. The possibility of Rainbow being turned into a foal certainly existed and it certainly happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow was agitated. She forgot about the conversation that happened prior to her transformation. Why did she have to remind Fluttershy? Somewhere in Rainbow's mind, she thought she could get away without a diaper change. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Come now Rainbow\" Fluttershy said calmly \"It isn't so bad. You might actually like getting a diaper change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow was skeptical, but she didn't want to give Mommy Fluttershy a hard time. So, she went along with the diaper change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy laid Rainbow onto the soft white changing table. \"Good job Rainbow Dash. You're being so cooperative.\" If this was what Fluttershy diaper changes were like, filled with compliments, then Rainbow could get used to this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Fluttershy pulled out the baby powder. \"Now, I'm going to apply the baby powder. It might be scary, but remember Mommy Fluttershy is here and she'll protect you.\" Fluttershy gave light to moderate taps, which only slowed down the entire changing process.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Fluttershy was being over-cautious, Rainbow was actually enjoying herself. After all, this meant she'd have more time with Fluttershy who acted as her defense against alone-ness. Rainbow wanted to be with her new Mommy for an extend period of time, since times such as these were calm and soothing, direct contrasts to Rainbow's high energy job. Yet, at the same time, this calm-ness reminded her of times where she'd just rest on clouds. Except, now that resting wasn't being done alone and Rainbow really didn't have to do much to on her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rainbow was being powdered, she came to realize, being a baby rocks! Not only could she spent much of her time with Mommy Fluttershy, she had complete freedom to do whatever she pleased. She could sleep, eat, play, and go potty whenever she felt like it. Additionally, her baby status guaranteed that tons of ponies would feel like losing to her. She could win countless games for the rest of life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only negative, which was admittedly pretty big, was that she couldn't be a wonder-bolt in this state. Granted, she didn't feel \"ready\" yet. The blue vortex induced a traumatizing experience. And as a foal with a safe environment, her chances of returning to said environment were slim to none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she finished thinking about this, Fluttershy finally finished the powdering process. Rainbow Dash tuned back into reality in time to hear Fluttershy's question \"Did you enjoy the powdering? I know it can sometimes be slow and frustrating for foals who just want to play.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow smiled \"Yes! Me act-twy wubed da pwa-cess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy was ecstatic and surprised at the same time \"Really, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becas me get ta spen time wit yo-wa, me new mommy. Me aw-so wub da com-pwa-mens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy was pleasantly surprised to hear that. \"So, <i>I'm</i> your 'new mommy?' \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yus, or-wa me Mommy Fwuttashy or-wa jus me mommy. Me neba wan-ah aban-don yo-wa\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears of joy drifted down Fluttershy's face. She had found someone who would give her unconditional acceptance while still understanding what she says. This was an aspect Fluttershy kept hidden from others and she wasn't about to tell Rainbow Dash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Rainbow tilted her head to the left adorably asking \"Wha-why Mommy Fwuttashy cwying? Di me do sometin wong...\" Rainbow started to tear up, just thinking about this possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy quickly brushed away Rainbow's tears and reassured her everything was okay \"Don't cry Rainbow. Mommy was crying tears of joy at how kind you've become. Your concern for me shows you're the best baby I could ever ask for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow opened her mouth wide, giving an adorable face of surprise \"Wooooooooow. Me maw aw-some den me tout. Tanks fa da sup-wat mommy Fwuttashy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy chuckled in response. \"You're very welcome Rainbow. Now, let's get you finished into that new diaper, now shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow clapped her hooves together! \"Yay!!!\" Rainbow wanted to know what Rarity was gushing over after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Fluttershy took her time, gently lifting Rainbow's hind legs and flank and carefully sliding a new diaper underneath Rainbow's flank. This was followed by her gently lowering Rainbow's bottom on to the fluffy white diaper. Lastly, Fluttershy begun tapping the diaper in place, asking Rainbow when things were too tight or loose. She was trying to find the perfect fit for Rainbow. While this process took an incredible amount of time, Fluttershy ultimately finished the diaper changing giving Rainbow a diaper which fit just right, not too tight or loose, just like the diaper changing Pinkie gave to Rarity hours earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Fluttershy was finished, Rainbow, like Rarity, was mesmerized by her diaper. To Rainbow, it felt like a nice fluffy cloud covering her flank. Another nice twist was that it kept cool air from going traveling through her legs. For this reason, Rainbow would always feel like her flank was too cold while flying. Now, Rainbow could fly while having her bottom remain nice and cozy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Mommy Twilight read Baby Rarity a story about fashion. Sweetie Belle listened, watching her now 'younger sister' become fantasized by the book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was weird. Rarity and Rainbow both possessed adult and baby characteristics. They could understand complex words, but couldn't say them. They generally understood what the adults were saying, but were more interested in foal activities or foal iterations of the activities they used to perform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ just sat the side, trying not to get too involved. All of this foal stuff didn't make a lick of sense to her and she was hoping it would all boil over. With Rainbow now a baby, she lacked an athletic partner. There was also a pressing fear that the following state of things would become the new status quo. If that was the case, then she'd have to find some new way to bond with Rainbow and Rarity. (She honestly didn't believe Rarity could follow through with her plan)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, finally comes back and...</span></div></div>",

So.. that was something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie became ecstatic \"Ooooo, right. So Rainbow how was it? Did you like it? Wasn't it fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow nervously said \"Wew.. it was act-wy sorta fun.

Come here, it's okay!\" Pinkie then picked Rainbow up from the changing table, cuddling her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whose a good foal? You are! You are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow looked upset all of sudden, tearing up. She stretched her hooves to Fluttershy, but couldn't reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie knew what this sign meant and gleefully said \"Awwwww, you want mommy to hold you, don't you? Well, no need to fear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of sudden, Pinkie put Rainbow in Fluttershy's hooves. \"There you are! Are you all better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow's tears quickly dried up once she was in Fluttershy's hooves. She just gave a little nod \"Uh hu.. thanks Pinkie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem little one! If you need something just tell Aunt Pinkie Pie and she'll make that problem go all away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis warm moment between Pinkie and Rainbow was quickly cut off by AJ. \"So.. how long will Rainbow stay like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie cheerfully said \"That all depends on Rainbow. The spell book says Rainbow can be turned back with this simple spell, but that the spell won't wear off. If she choose to, she could stay a baby <i>forever</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ was relieved. \"That's fantastic! You heard her Twilight. So, read that spell and let's get this over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie looked annoyed. \"AJ, that's up to Rainbow to decide, not Twilight silly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right Pinkie, like Rainbow would really want to stay like this for long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow then spoke up, \"Wew, act-twy.. me am un-shaw wha ta do. Me wub mommy Fwuttashy an me don wan ta weab ha. Pwus, me ge ta sweep, eat, pway, an go potty wheneba me wants. Me aw-so gets ta win aw-wal da time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one but AJ was really surprised. They had seen the way she was acting and figured this would happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ wasn't ready to drop the issue though. \"What the? Come on Rainbow, don't be ridiculous. What about the Wonderbolts or competitions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow shyly responded \"Wew... me no fweel weady fa da Wonda-bowts or-wa compet-tons. Me wan Fwuttashy ta ca-wa fa me instead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ got frustrated with Rainbow's answer and turned to Twilight. \"Well? Come on Twilight. Hurry up and change her back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was paying attention to the conversation and got annoyed with AJ. \"AJ, she just said she doesn't want to. Didn't you hear her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what Twilight. She's just a foal right now. She ain't thinkin' clearly. We have to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ was cut off my Rainbow's crying. \"I'm-I'm jus a fo-wal. But but.. mommy Fwuttashy said...\" All of sudden she was wailing \"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy quickly comforted her, \"There there... Rainbow. It's okay. AJ is wrong. She's just being a mean-y right now.\" Luckily Fluttershy's words broke through and she stopped wailing \"Wa-wa-wee-wy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy gave a motherly smile \"Yes hun. Mommy is right and AJ is wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie then spoke up to AJ \"How dare you AJ? How could you say such a harsh thing to a baby friend? You'll hurt their feelings!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ rolled her eyes. \"Ya'll aren't thinkin' right. Rainbow doesn't actually want to be a baby. It's just the spell talking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie smiled \"You prepare to wager that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ was pretty confused \"Huh? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean.. are you prepared to show us that it is the spell talking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How in the world would I show that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.. how about you get turned into a baby from the spell Rarity used and we'll see if you're right. If you wanna stay a baby, then we'll turn you and everyone back. If you don't wanna stay a baby, then we'll just turn you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ was annoyed, but she wouldn't back down from this. \"Fine. How long do I have to stay a baby to you all this is just plum none sense?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie rubbed her chin real quick... \"Hmm.. how about... till tomorrow morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! No, that's ridiculous. Rarity and Rainbow haven't been babies for more than 4 hours. 4 hours is the most I'll do and if I want to turn back then you win and I'll keep quiet about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.. I can't wait to take care of you.\" AJ's plan just might work. Pinkie Pie and the others would make sure she enjoyed herself, which would make it easy to stay a baby. AJ of course was missing something, but would soon find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Twilight! Let her up! You heard her. Turn her into a baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight sighed. \"One second\" Twilight gave Rarity to Sweetie Belle. \"Sweetie, can you look after Rarity while I do this.\" Sweetie Belle was ecstatic! She had been patient all this time and finally got a chance to play with her 'younger sister.' \"Absolutely!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight calmly said \"Thank you.\" and looked to Rarity \"Now, be a good baby. I don't want to find out that you misbehaved.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity smiled \"Okay mommy Twilight. Me be gud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight kissed Rarity's forehead and walked up to the spell book. Twilight and Rarity's reading time clearly allowed them to bond more as mother and daughter and it was showing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, was not the time for that though. AJ's wager had to be fulfilled. Twilight knew AJ was wrong, but unlike Pinkie, she knew that the way to win the bet was to act motherly. Pinkie, on the other hoof, was just going to act motherly because she loved babies. This did raise the question, if she knew how to get AJ to not want to stay a baby then was she doing a disservice to Rarity and Rainbow by aiding their thinking in being a baby. Twilight had concluded that she was just being <i>friendly</i> and that if her friends made decisions off of that, then said decisions were authentically made. Of course, Twilight wasn't thinking straight with this. Sometimes being friendly does in fact lead ponies in unpleasant directions. Perhaps some where in her unconscious Twilight was enjoying being Rarity's mommy and didn't want the whole process to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo.. Twilight was quick to read the spell, forming a similar esque vortex around AJ. Twilight was confident that taking care of AJ would make AJ want to not be a foal and she was eager to get this wager done and over with. She wanted to return to her little Rarity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ had her eyes closed though, unlike Rainbow, and knew that the regression process probably wasn't enjoyable. Plus, Twilight was able to complete the transformation pretty quickly. The spell she used on Rarity was actually a youthinizing spell, which made the age regression take longer. However, this spell was a straight age regression one, which meant the process was going to be pretty quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ was hit with Twilight's magenta beam and then propelled into the air with magenta auras spinning rapidly around her. It was sorta like a rollercoaster and as soon as AJ felt the magenta aura, she started to regret this. She thought \"Augh... this is going to be an annoying day.\" Still, AJ kept her cool throughout the transformation, in a large part because she was closing her eyes and focusing on something else. That focus being how annoying the rest of the day would be. For one, she was hoping that she wouldn't cry. That would make this experience ten times more embarrassing. AJ's thoughts raced a little bit as she thought of all the things that could go wrong. Little did she notice that by thinking of these things and regressing, she was actually increasing the chance that she would cry in front of her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd.. that's exactly what happened. As the regression came to a close, AJ started to cry and like Rainbow, these cries quickly turned to wails. Luckily for her sake, she didn't start screaming. But... the transformation did end on her wailing which was really embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the transformation happened, things were pretty low key on the outside. After having to of their friends turned into babies by surprise and having this all be planned, all of them just went about their business. Everyone but Twilight and Pinkie were distracted. Fluttershy and Rainbow were just cuddling together, and Sweetie Belle and Rarity were just playing around with blocks, trying to make things look pretty. Twilight had her eyes closed concentrating on the spell and Pinkie had a big smile on her face, waiting to see baby AJ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they knew it, AJ's transformation was done and what formed was a little orange earth pony baby wailing at the top of her lungs. Pinkie quickly picked her up, cradling her carefully. Twilight looked concerned. AJ knew what was happening, so.. why was she crying? Did she actually turn into a baby mentally?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie motherly said \"There, there. Mommy Pinkie is here.\" and Twilight followed up, asking \"AJ, is everything alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When she realized that she was wailing, she had a brief pause followed by louder wailing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was becoming nervous \"Pinkie, what do we do? I didn't expect this to happen? We-we turned our friend into a baby and now she's wailing at the top of her lungs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie just giggled \"It's okay silly. I know what to do!\" Twilight was skeptical, but took a breather, waiting for Pinkie to do whatever she was planning to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Pinkie rocked baby AJ back and forth, slowly. There was a soothing rhythm to it, which caught AJ of guard. The rocking quickly calmed baby AJ down. AJ sorta wanted to cry, but her body was instinctively calmed down. AJ hated being a baby, but she had to admit that this was something she liked. As embarrassing as being rocked was, it prevented her from crying on the outside, which was a blessing. Since AJ was no longer wailing on the outside, she no longer was embarrassed and internally had no reason to cry. Now, AJ looked like she calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was impressed. \"How did you do that?\" Pinkie just gave an obvious response \"Silly Twilight, all babies calm down when you rock them back and forth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight just gave a deadpanned \"Oh.. that makes sense.\" Twilight then turned to the orange foal in Pinkie's hooves and asked \"Is everything alright AJ? Why were you crying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ shyly responded \"Wew.. I sorta got wost on aw-wal da negatib possibi-wities.\" AJ rolled her eyes after hearing her new voice, which was another annoying thing to add to the mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was relieved. AJ's response made sense and her eye rolling further confirmed that AJ hadn't regressed mentally. Twilight then gave an awkward response \"So.. how is being a baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ was annoyed \"It as fu-na as bein' at ah baw-bek-cu wit owt a-nee meat. No, scwatch dat, it worse.\" Twilight giggled a little bit at AJ's high pitched response. AJ saw it and sarcastically responded \"Yea.. waff it up, dat make me fweel betta.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was hesitant. \"I-I didn't mean it like that.\" AJ gave a sarcastic response \"Yeah... wight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie interjected, taking AJ's response literally. \"Yup AJ. Twilight was just having fun with her friend. Before you can play with her though, I'm going to need to give a certain some pony a diaper change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ was straight faced. \"Cud dis day get a-nee wowse.\" Pinkie chuckled \"I wouldn't say that if I were you, but it's already late. Things may have just gotten worse for you already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ could only say in response \"Wha? Wha you mean?\" Then AJ heard somepony and realized what Pinkie meant. Applebloom just entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ looked over to what used to be her younger sister, who happened to look at her at the same time. Applebloom responded \"AJ! YOU'RE A BABY TOO?!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ looked for a place to hide, but there was none. As Applebloom walked closer, AJ started to tear up. By the time Applebloom was right next to AJ, AJ was wailing yet again. Applebloom was even more confused now. \"What's going on? Why is my sister like this? and why is she acting this way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie giggled \"One second Applebloom. I just need to calm down little Applebloom here.\" Pinkie then rushed over, got a pacifier, and returned, plucking in AJ's mouth. AJ instantly calmed down after that. Yet, it was another case of AJ's body acting against her will. After it was in, AJ had an annoyed look on her face, while the adults spoke on her behalf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight opened up first. \"So, through a long twist of things, Rarity and Rainbow got turned into babies. Both wanted to stay this way and AJ thought that Rarity and Rainbow weren't themselves, that maybe the spells altered their minds somehow. So...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplebloom suddenly looked angry and asked \"So, you turned my sister into a baby, just to keep your baby fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked perplexed. \"No, we got into a bet that if in the next four hours she doesn't want to be a baby, then she has to drop that claim. If she wants to be a baby though, then we'll turn her, Rarity, and Rainbow back to normal. Why did you think we would turn AJ into a baby for fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplebloom looked a little stunned \"I'm I'm sorry, it's just.. seeing my sister like this made me a little scared something terrible happened. I-I can't believe all of this stuff happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie jumped in. \"I know, right? It's such a blast! You just came in time for AJ's diaper changing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplebloom was a little frustrated \"You're kidding, right? This stuff is a blast to you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, huh. Taking care of my friends is like two goods together, babysitting and friends, that's like double the fun and double the excitement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplebloom was a little taken off guard by that response \"I see.. well, I guess I could watch her diaper changing. I want to protect my big, I mean.. little sister as much as possible.\" AJ scowled from that response. When she turns back, she'll make Applebloom think twice before saying something so ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext thing AJ knew, all their eyes were on her for her diaper changing. This was super embarrassing. AJ wanted to cry, to shout out against this, but.. she was powerless. The pacifier prevented her from crying. So, all she could do was close here eyes and wait for this nightmare to end. Still, she could feel the diaper changing, which to her annoyance had a bit of a charm to it. So much so that she opened her eyes during it. Pinkie smirked at the sight; she knew what was up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ actually enjoyed the sensations, but the last thing she wanted was for her friends or her sister for that matter to know. Luckily the pacifier prevented her facial expressions from being very visible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie was quick as always, powdering and diaper taping at lightning speed. And once she was done, the diaper was on nice and comfy not too tight and not too loose, Pinkie's specialty. Like Rarity, AJ really liked the sensation of the diaper. Rarity was right, it was like a pillow on your flank. This meant AJ had 3 annoying secrets. She enjoyed being rocked, experiencing diaper changes, and wearing diapers. What was next...? Still, there was no way they could know, so her secrets were safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Pinkie removed the pacifier, giving away one of those secrets. AJ had a big smile on her face, which shocked Applebloom. Twilight and Pinkie weren't so surprised. I mean, so far Rarity and Rainbow enjoyed diaper changes, so the odds were pretty clear AJ might too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplebloom hesitantly asked \"AJ how-how could you? You.. enjoyed the diaper changing <i>and </i>wearing the diaper? What's gotten in to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ did the only thing she could do. Deny it. Though.. lying wasn't her specialty. \"Nuh uh. Me no wike diapa chan-ges or-wa wea-win diapas. Don be wa-dik-you-wous.\" AJ's facial expressions suggested she was saying a lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplebloom wasn't buying it. \"Oh yea? Well, then what do you do when I do this?\" Applebloom pressed AJ's butt down on the changing table, looking at AJ's expression. AJ didn't want to, but her facial expressions again gave away the truth. She naturally made a big wide smile to feeling the diaper press up against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplebloom had caught her \"Ha-HA! I knew it! You do like wearing diapers. Might I ask, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ's goose was cooked. She had to say something now. \"O-kay... you wa wight. Me no kno why.. It jus, jus feewls gud. Me hay-ta say it, bu it jus does..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplebloom's reaction was.. unexpected. She laughed her flank off. \"This is hilarious! Wait until people hear this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis embarrassment was enough to cause AJ to cry. \"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked at Applebloom sternly \"Applebloom.. that wasn't nice. You're sister is a baby for crying out loud, no pun intended. You shouldn't laugh at a baby like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ heard Twilight referring to her as a baby, which only made AJ's wails louder. Twilight facepalmed. What was she suppose to say. I mean.. AJ was a baby now. There's no way she could avoid that word challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Pinkie knew what to do. She rocked AJ back and forth, with a soothing rhythm, stopping AJ's wails quickly. \"It's okay AJ, mommy Pinkie is here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ was about to say \"thanks,\" until she heard Pinkie call herself \"mommy.\" AJ raised her high pitched southern baby voice \"Wha wa dat?! You not me mommy! Don say dat!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie managed to bounce that off pretty quickly. \"Sheesh tough crowd. Okey Dokey Lokey then. Does Aunt Pinkie work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ folded her chubby hooves. \"Me gess... tanks fa stoppin da...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem! That's what foal-sitters are for after all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ really hated to admit it, but Pinkie really was good at controlling baby's emotions. All of her techniques had worked on AJ so far. But AJ still knew, deep in core, her apple core, that she was <b>not</b> a baby. She was fighting her instincts and completely lost track of her initial reasons for being a baby. She was suppose to give in, if she wanted to win. Her resistance to giving in, just showed that her and likely her friends all had the mental control to not give in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ just asked \"Wha now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight thought out loud \"How about you take a nap? You seem exhausted from all this pampering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight had a point, one that AJ didn't like, but a correct one none the less. \"Kay.. me weady fa da cwib den.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie interjected \"Kay my little wittle friend.\" Meanwhile Twilight summoned another crib and tucked AJ inside. Pinkie then interjected again \"Sleep tight, don't let the bed bugs bite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, AJ got to bed quickly without even the need of a lullaby. The poor little foal sure must've been exhausted. </span></div></div>",

She could not remember a time where she had slept that good and woke up this refreshed. The orange foal yawned and rubbed her eyes. Muscle memory made her search for her iconic hat for a moment before she remembered where she was. Yawning again the orange foal finally opened her eyes, to see a grinning mass of pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBawww! She yelped in fright. Instantly a pacifier was in her mouth with Pinkie making a \u201cshhh\u201d gesture with her other hoof. A nod showed two other cribs where Rainbow and Rarity slept peacefully. Rarity had her pacifier back and Rainbow was sucking on a hoof. Applejack nodded showing she understood and Pinkie removed her hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood afternoon sleepy head. Pinkie said cheerily but softly to not wake the other foals. Enjoy you\u2019re nap? Mmhuh. Aj said nodding. Great! I guess you want to see Twilight now? Mumhum. Pinkie carefully picked the orange foal up and set her on her back. All right. All aboard the Pinkie express! Next stop Twilight! Applejack would never understand how it sounded like a real train leaving the station suddenly, but went with it. Pinkie threw in several jumps and bumps that made her passenger bounce and giggle slightly as she was thrown into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Meemge mummph! The foal almost went cross eyed trying to glare at the pacifier still stuck in her mouth. Poor Applejack was quickly introduced to two facts about foal: their poor coordination and week limbs. Applejack could not move her legs enough to get a good grip, and when she finally managed a passing grab her reduced strength meant it remained firmly lodged in place. Worse she found she could not just spit it out. She spent the reminder of the trip trying, and failing to remove the rubber nub wedged firmly in her mouth growing more frustrated and angry with each failure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally they reached the \u201cliving room\u201d where Twilight and Fluttershy were sitting and talking. It wasn\u2019t that long a trip, but it felt that way for AJ. Pinkie set her charge on the table and finally removed the pacifier. Applejack gasped like a drowning mare coming up for air and glared at the offending item. Dumb ting! She declared sounding more cute than threating. AWWW! Don\u2019t be upset little Appwejack. Pinkie cooed rubbing the foals head. Most foals love their paci\u2019s. Applejack batted at Pinkies hoof. Me no Foaw! All right Applejack. Twilight said taking control before the situation got out of control. Times up. What do you want to do? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAj just raised an eyebrow and gave Twilight a look. Soooooo, grow back up? Twilight said with a nervous chuckle. At the foals nod Twilight lit up her horn and the air filled with magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just have to put this. Does Twilight mess up the spell again? I mean it\u2019s not like she will mess up a spell twice in one day right?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The experience was altering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ hoovered above the ground and quickly couldn't see her friends. The vortex spun around her, oddly giving her mental strength, as opposed to what happened with Rainbow Dash. However, said mental strength came with a catch. As the vortex spun at super high speeds, AJ also felt the weight of responsibility press on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly her job which she often enjoyed seemed daunting. After actually sleeping like a baby, she couldn't go back. For this reason, silent tears came down her face as the spell finished up. (The diaper vanished away during the vortex)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce completed Twilight levitated AJ back onto the ground. The three of them though, Twilight, Fluttershy, and Pinkie were surprised by AJ's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ saw their faces and became agitated. \"Why are ya'll looking at me like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for AJ, Twilight spoke up first. \"Well.. AJ, were you crying just now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ looked annoyed. \"No! Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight levitated a mirror. As AJ looked at it, Twilight said \"It's just you look-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie interjected \"Super duper upset. Do you wish you were a baby again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ grinded her teeth. She did not want to talk about this, but.. her goose was cooked. She gave a sigh and came clean. \"Not completely. I dunno, it's just. Being turned back into an adult is just a bit daunting. I had one of the best night sleeps as a baby, that I've never had in years. After experiencin' that again, I want to experience that again, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie got the impression from this that AJ wanted to be a baby right away, so she asked the question \"Awww... does the wittle Applejack wan go back to sleep in her crib-y wibby?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ's gave a deadpanned response. \"I don't want to just be a baby again Pinkie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie then looked confused \"Then whatcha wanna do silly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ paused \"I... I don't know. Ya'll got any ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight rubbed her chin for a bit and responded \"So.. one idea is that every night you can come back to the castle, I'll turn you into a foal and then I can tuck you in your crib.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just for the crib?\" AJ asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.. why?\" Twilight posited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ spoke up.. \"Well.. I did, um.. admittedly enjoy myself a little bit. Maybe I could come back here normally to play with Rarity and Rainbow, sleep over, and return those days back to work, fresh as can be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer three friends just stared back in surprise. AJ was a little nervous by their reaction \"Um.. maybe that was a bit too much. Sorry ya'll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie spoke up \"No silly! We're all just happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ was skeptical \"Ya'll are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!! Absolutely!!!!! This means I can play with one of my favorite babies!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Favorite babies, excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww.. AJ, you just were so adorable as a baby. I can't help it. Your my friend and out of all of my baby friends, you needed the most comfort. That's just what Aunt Pinkie is here for!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ was just amazed and somewhat agitated Pinkie had the gaul to say all that. She didn't want to question it though and get into another run around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Twilight and Fluttershy spoke up. Twilight first. \"That's awesome!! I'm sure my Rarity would love to have you over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy then spoke up \"Same for my little Rainbow. She loves to play with you after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was weird about what they just said. The two were treating Rarity and Rainbow like their own foals. It was weird, but AJ again didn't want to question anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now? Shall we fast forward to baby dress show or shall we see how the night progresses? (If we fast forward, Rarity and Rainbow will carry out their lives as Twilight and Fluttershy's foals respectively. AJ will also be a baby for friend get togethers.)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This set up passed for a week, with nopony in Ponyville being filled in on the details. Everypony who already knew were told to keep it a secret for Rarity's new fashion line up. For this week, Twilight teleported Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash to Fluttershy's cottage when needed. Additionally, Twilight's magic allowed them to have a limitless supply of diapers for the little ones. (Which often included AJ. AJ refused to be in her friends company without being a baby.) The gang was beginning to accept their new lifestyle. The grown ups started to see themselves as the caretakers, or mothers in Fluttershy and Twilight's case. The little one's, even AJ, started to see themselves as babies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith AJ, she started to see herself as a baby who needed to help out on the farm a lot. The age she started to identify with was that of a 1 year old. She didn't even mind Applebloom calling herself the big sis. AJ was eagerly waiting for the farming off-season where she could play with her friends without distraction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a couple visits within the week, Applebloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo came over to care for AJ, Rarity, and Rainbow Dash respectively. They loved caring for the \"little ones,\" even if it didn't get them their cutie marks. Still, giving diaper changes was a little annoying for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach day moving forward was also a day to prepare for the big dress show and reveal. Aunt Fluttershy was helping Rarity with her designs. The dresses were enchanted though so that the wearer would turn into a baby. Once transformed, the new babies would have to have a diaper change. For that reason, each outfit came with several packs of diapers. For transforming back to normal, there would be a second outfit to do that. Rarity was determined that this approach would revolutionize Equestrian fashion, putting her at the center. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly enough, her aunts Fluttershy and Pinkie as well as her new mommy, Twilight, didn't even question it. They didn't want to make their lovely wittle unicorn dress maker upset. They saw it as a part of her wittle baby imagination and they didn't want to hurt it in anyway. They'd stand up for their little one, especially Twilight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the show, Rarity was planning on making this a big surprise. So, she made four distinct dresses for four distinct ponies. Rarity's plan was to persuade live audience members to wear these dresses. She would have these dresses out on display, each appealing to one of these four pony's preferences. Those ponies would be Fleur Dis Lee, Sapphire Shores, Amethyst Star from Ponyville, and Upper Crust from Canterlot. (Check mlp wiki for the designs of these ponies)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Rarity choose these ponies, because they each belonged to a distinct audience. Fleur Dis Lee was from the upper elite of Canterlot, Upper Crust was from the regular elite of Canterlot, Amethyst Star was from Ponyville, and Sapphire Shores was known all across Equestria. If each one enjoyed their baby experience, Rarity's new design approach would surely take center stage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdditionally, Rarity, Rainbow Dash, and AJ would all be in their own baby dresses for the event. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe event was held in the evening in the Ponyville town hall. Everything was decorated to appeal to the many audiences. Rarity, Rainbow Dash, and AJ were in their baby dresses, diapered, and hidden behind the curtains for their special entrance. They were teleported in of course to avoid giving away the secret. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Twilight, she would have to start the show and levitate the four dresses. If royalty were addressing the crowd, it would increase the significance. At least, that's what little Rarity thought. Plus, she thought her new mommy would do a great job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight peeked out of the curtain, looking at the full crowd. Being nervous, she took a deep breath and walked forward onto the fashion runway with the four dresses on manikins. Everypony gathered around confused. Where were the models?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight spoke up best she could. \"Greetings Fillies and Gentle-colts, Tonight's fashion show will be a little different. We'll need volunteers. These four dresses were picked out precisely to demonstrate the brilliance of Rarity's new style. Will there be any volunteers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dresses had a similar style to them. Sapphire Shores' dress was a white skirt dress with blue trim and little tiny sapphires covering it. Fleur Dis Lee's dress was a light blue skirt dress with purple trim and tiny purple gemstones covering it. Royal Ribbon's dress was a light purple skirt dress with light blue trim and tiny aquamarines covering it. Lastly, Amethyst Star's dress was a light cyan skirt dress with light pink trim and tiny pink gemstones covering it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first pony to volunteer was Sapphire Shores, spotting the wonderful designs, which appealed to her tastes. \"Oh my, that one dress over there is simply exquisite. Just the kind of outfit that shines for a star like me.\" She pointed to the very dress Rarity designed for her. Twilight had her wait though until three other volunteers came up. Volunteers had to wait on the end of the runway. Sapphire Shores was a little agitated, but she wouldn't argue with a princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFleur Dis Lee took Sapphire Shores' behavior as a sign that it was okay to also volunteer. After all, she already spotted a dress she liked. (which was the one Rarity made for her) \"I too like one of these dresses. I like this one though. It's my favorite color and style choice.\" She calmly stood on Shores' right side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew up was Royal Ribbon. She came to this fashion show primarily because Fancy Pants came and since Fleur Dis Lee, Fancy Pants' partner, volunteered, Royal Ribbon suddenly wanted to volunteer. She had already spotted a dress that she actually liked, but still wanted to know she could volunteer without hurting her reputation. \"I agree with these two fancy ponies. That dress right there looks gorgous.\" She played up her entrance standing on the left side of Sapphire Shores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmethyst Star was the last pony to volunteer. However, she was very nervous to since two high ranking ponies just did. Still, the cyan dress that Rarity made for her spoke to her on so many levels. She just had to wear it. \"Um, I agree too. This dress here looks great. C-could I model for this one? Rarity wouldn't mind, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight spoke \"Absolutely! Anyone who can wear the dress can volunteer.\" With that, Amethyst, the last volunteer stood to the right of Fleur Dis Lee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in line, Twilight seemed relaxed. The arguably hardest part now ended. Next up, the surprising. \"This is fantastic. Now, that the models have been decided, you for should come with me. But fiiirst, we need special effects in honor of this.\" Twilight then casted a spell, filling the room with a thick magenta smoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did the audience know what was about to happen. Under the cover of the smoke, Twilight plucked enchanted pacifiers into the volunteers' mouths that couldn't be easily removed. (blue for Sapphire, purple for Fleur, light blue for Royal, and pink for Amethyst) The volunteers were completely surprised, but they had little time to react! They tried to remove the pacifiers to no avail. While they struggled, Twilight levitated each one and magically poof-ed the dresses onto the volunteers. Magenta vortexes then engulfed each volunteer, causing them to regress. The smoke would be clear soon though, so Twilight rushed her and the regressing the volunteers behind the theater curtains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

The room is shut and magically made sound proof, so other audience members couldn't hear them. Then Twilight grabbed a walkie talkie, briefly turning it on. The other end of the walkie talkie was attached near a microphone. Twilight calmly spoke into it. \u201cLadies and Gentlecolts, this is Princess Twilight Sparkle speaking. Everything is fine. The smoke was part of the show for an invigorating performance! Once the volunteers finish putting on these dresses, we will come out to show you all.\u201d Afterwards, Twilight turned off the walkie talkie and put it in a high place so the little one\u2019s wouldn\u2019t accidentally turn it on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone\u2019s fear quickly vanished and they calmly waited for the volunteers as if this was perfectly normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe backstage room was magically redecorated to be baby themed, since that was the true theme. Several changing tables were available, each with their own set of baby lotions and diapers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity was happy to see Twilight come in. In a high pitched adorable voice, she screeched \"How di it go? Di ebawy-win wor-ka outa wight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight smiled at her little baby \"Yep. I was nervous, but everything went off smoothly.\" Twilight levitated the volunteer vortexes over a prepared playpen for the new baby volunteers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she snuggled her adorable baby unicorn. \"Mommy will make sure your show is special.\" The two cuddled for a bit, before Twilight went to the playpen too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the volunteers' vortexes were just finishing up. Twilight, Pinkie, and Fluttershy gathered around in their grown up garb waiting to introduce the first babies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first baby to finish was Sapphire Shores. She came out of the vortex all tear-y eyed, unable to speak. Pinkie picked up the little adorable Sapphire Shores, rocking her back and forth. \"It's okay, your foalsitter Pinkie Pie is here.\" This helped calm little Sapphire. Once her tears melted away, Pinkie removed her pacifier and placed her on a comfy changing table. \"How was your first time trying on Rarity's new dress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Sapphire was overwhelmed \"Wha-wha was da?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, it was nothing, just the baby effects of wearing Rarity's new dress. You're an adorable new baby now! Isn't that great?!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ba-baby e-fecs? Wha why does...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a great question. Let me get Rarity.\" Pinkie went away for a sec to get Rarity. First she cuddled the little Rarity and then cradled her as she walked back to little Sapphire. \"Here she is Sapphire. Ask away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire was astounded at what she saw. Rarity was a baby too already wearing a cozy diaper and blue skirt dress with white trim and tiny white gemstones. Little Sapphire had a hard time asking the question as she was so caught up in Rarity's garb \"Why-why-?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Rarity cut her off. \"Aw, Sa-fiya, me kno yo-wa wor-weed. Me di-den mean ta make ya so unhappy. Dis jus da onwy way ta con-bince yo-wa aw-wal ob me new dwess wine up.\" Sapphire just tilted her little head in confusion, so Rarity continued. \"Me find out dat bein a baby is fun. Diapas feewl wike piw-wows an naps aw so sootin.' So, me make dwess show ta show-case dat. You aw won ob da first bowenteers ob dis! An bes ob aw-wal, you can we-wa da oda dwess ta change bak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire was skeptical, but didn't know how to respond. So, Pinkie simply interjected and gave her patented diaper changing. She was quick as can be, tapping oddly comfortable baby powder on Sapphire's flank and following up with a super duper comfy diaper. The diaper fit snuggly around her little waist. Sapphire was mesmerized by Pinkie's changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith great enthusiasm, Little Sapphire screeched with enjoyment. \"Oh me go-sha!! You wa wigh!!! Dis is da bes!!! ME WUB DIAPAS! Warity! Yo-wa aw on da cuttin' edg of da nes dwess webowution! Me not on-wy wub dis dwess design, me wub dis diapa too. How do me wook?\" Pinkie showed a mirror. Little Sapphire no longer had any eyeliner, but she looked adorable. The dress and diaper made her stand out. Sapphire screech again \"Dis is da bes!!!! Tank you Warity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Rarity was ecstatic, hugging her client. \"Wanna pway wit me bwocks while we wait fa da oda bowenteers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Su-wa.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie smiled, putting the adorable foals in the playpen near the blocks. Three more ponies were lined up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Pinkie was giving Sapphire Shores a diaper change, Amethyst Star's vortex ended. She shyly looked at her new environment. \"Wha wa gowin on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Fluttershy's shift this time. Fluttershy hushed the little baby, picking her up and rocking her back and forth. \"There there, it's okay. No need to be scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmethyst spoke up \"Bu-bu.. me na scared. Me jus confuused. Wha happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy gently placed her on a changing table and then answered her question. \"You tried on one of Rarity's new dresses and thus turned into a baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fluttershy initiated a slow diaper changing, Amethyst spoke calmly \"Bu-bu why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fluttershy was powdering Amethyst's baby bottom, she said \"Aww, it's because Rarity found out how fun being a baby was and she wanted to spread the joy to other ponies. I helped her make dresses that turn ponies into foals, but don't worry we have second dresses to turn you all back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fluttershy finished the powdering, Amethyst asked \"well, can me hab dat se-cunt dwess den. Me no wanna be a baby again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you wait just a little bit longer? Rarity wants you to see what it's like before then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmethyst folded her chubby arms \"Fine den.. wet's see how comfy diapas aw...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you thank you thank you! You won't regret it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me wiw way-ta see den.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy started the last part of the diaper process, carefully with love applying a diaper and checking to see what tight-ness Amethyst liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all was said and done, Amethyst sat up with her being able to feel the diaper press up on her. It was... nice. Actually, it was <b>really</b> nice. The diaper change and the diaper. Amethyst nervously said \"T-tank you fa makin me way-ta. Me act-twy wike it, da change an da diapa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy cuddled her \"Aww, you're very welcome. Now here's a mirror to see your adorable self.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmethyst looked at her reflection with astonishment. She-she looked amazing. Soo cute!! With the dress and diaper, she looked innocent and cute enough to hug. As a matter of fact, Fluttershy quickly did just that. She couldn't help it. Little Amethyst just looked so adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Rainbow saw her new mommy hugging Amethyst and quickly became jealous, wailing at the top of her lungs. Fluttershy immediately flew over to Rainbow with little Amethyst in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmethyst was shocked to see what looked like Rainbow Dash as a.. BABY! Little Rainbow was wearing a light rainbow skirt dress with magenta trim and little magenta gems covering it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy picked up Little Rainbow, holding her in one hoof while Amethyst was held in the other. \u201cIs everything alright my sweety?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow wiped away her tears. \u201cNa-no! Me no wan mommy weabing me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh.. it\u2019s okay. I wasn\u2019t leaving you. I was just giving your friend her, Amethyst Star, some love. Don\u2019t you like your huggy wuggy\u2019s after diaper changes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an unhappy tone Little Rainbow said \u201cyeah\u2026\u201d She knew where Mommy Fluttershy was going with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, well I was just giving it to her. It\u2019d be unfair otherwise. You wouldn\u2019t want that though, would you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy softly said \u201cGood Baby!\u201d and nuzzled her foal\u2019s nose. \u201cNow I\u2019m going to put you two in the playpen for now. Both of you play nice now. It\u2019s what friends do!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle AJ looked a little unhappy though. She wanted to play too. Fluttershy saw Little AJ\u2019s face though and responded accordingly \u201cAwww, does Little AJ also wanna play?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ nodded \u201cmmmHmm..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww, come here little one. Of course you can play.\u201d Fluttershy shortly cuddled with Little AJ and then put her in the play pen with RD and Amethyst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle AJ wore a green skirt dress with red trim and ruby\u2019s covering it. Amethyst looked in amazement at the two most atheletic Ponyville ponies being babyfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nervously asked \u201cUm.. wha gotten in ta you twos..? Me wike dis, bu you two seem ta wub it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She quickly rubbed Rainbow\u2019s back and said \u201cMe no mean ta be mean. Me jus curwious. Tanks fa da info!\u201d Amethyst finally hugged Rainbow for extra measure. It was simply adorable. The two foals had to go so close to hug that they snuggled around each other, diapers and all touching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the heartfelt hug, Amethyst looked to Little AJ who said \u201cMe baby cus da wife is fun.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meanwhile, Twilight and Pinkie changed the last of the diapers, Twilight took Royal Ribbon and Pinkie took Fleur Dis Lee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth new babies had similar shocked reactions followed by quick happy acceptance. Royal Ribbon was at first upset, but quickly relaxed after royalty, ROYALTY, changed HER diaper. She was actually quick to accept this after that. If royalty was alright with this, then why shouldn\u2019t she? At least that\u2019s what she thought in her cute adorable state. The princess taking care of her was also an added bonus. Sprinkled onto this fact was her comfort of knowing she could change back at any moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Royal Ribbon smiled in glee at the diaper change, Twilight put her in the playpen with the rest of the babies. Royal Ribbon was at first insecure at being away from the Princess. However, her insecurity quickly went away as she saw little Rarity and Little Sapphire Shores. The three of them continued to talk about the luxuries of babydom, cheering up Royal Ribbon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Fleur Dis Lee.. she first panicked. Her time as a famous model seemed to be over. Pinkie quickly cheered up the little ball of white and pink though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwwwww, don\u2019t worry little one, you\u2019ll be aye ok!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFleur wiped her eyes and nervously said \u201cWa-wa-weawy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD\u2019awwwww, of course! Would I lie to you? Come on, I\u2019ll show you a mirror.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFleur covered her eyes in embarrassment. Then next thing she knew, Pinkie stopped walking and said \u201cHere we are little one.\u201d Fleur eventually opened her eyes. She couldn\u2019t help it. The curiosity was eating away at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused looking at her reflection. Her face then quickly changed to one of glee. She opened her mouth nice and wide, shouting \u201cME WUB IT!!!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie was ecstatic. \u201cAWESOME! I knew you would. Now it\u2019s time for a certain somepony\u2019s diaper wiaper change!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFleur\u2019s face quickly changed to one of shock. Luckily for her, Pinkie didn\u2019t waste anytime. She quickly rushed over to the changing table and used her patented diaper change. At lightning fast speeds, Pinkie finished the changing and showed Baby Fleur Dis Lee the mirror again. Fleur interjected before the mirror though. \u201cDa.. was\u2026 AWE-SOME! Bu-bu.. why me WUB IT?! Me nah a baby!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, that\u2019s fantastic. Thank you for the compliment. There\u2019s no need to panic though. Everypony likes a good diaper change.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFleur was skeptical \u201cWeawy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFleur was still skeptical, but her skepticism was quickly melted away by her reflection. With the diaper added to her flank, she looked waaaaay more adorable. Her concern about the diaper changes quickly went away and she was gleaming with all the amazing model possibilities posed by being a baby. Pinkie then told Fleur Dis Lee the bit about changing back, but it seemed Fleur Dis Lee didn't really care. The thought of changing back didn't even register with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie then put the last baby in the playpen. The three grown-ups, Pinkie, Twilight, and Fluttershy, then asked the little one\u2019s if any of them had to go potty. Quite a lot of them had to go actually. AJ, Sapphire Shores, Amethyst, and Fleur Dis Lee all had to go. None of them took their time though and stench odors quickly filled the baby room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie took care of Sapphire Shores and Fleur Dis Lee (Since Pinkie was so fast, she could take care of two diaper changes at once), Fluttershy took care of AJ, and Twilight took care of Amethyst. Each baby hugged their subsequent diaper changer and all the foals were quickly ready to head out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight turned on the walkie talkie, briefly to say that her, the volunteers, and the fashion designer would be out shortly. Then Twilight turned off the walkie talkie and the three grownups tucked the little one\u2019s into strollers. Rarity, Amethyst Star, and Royal Ribbon were all in one stroller pushed by Twilight, AJ and RD in another stroller pushed by Fluttershy, and Fleur Dis Lee and Sapphire Shore\u2019s in a third stroller pushed by Pinkie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey opened the door, got behind the curtains, and pulled back the curtains to finish the show!!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The three adults rolled out onto the designer runaway to a confused crowd. Hardly anypony knew what was going. Some audience members asked questions like \u201cWhat\u2019s with the strollers?\u201d or \u201cWhere are the volunteers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight, Pinkie, and Fluttershy didn\u2019t answer any of these questions. That wasn\u2019t what they planned after all. At this stage of the show, confusion was expected, as none of the babies could be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the three grownups got to the end of the runaway, Pinkie spoke up ecstatically \u201cSoooo\u2026 are you all confused? No need for that sillys, the volunteers and the designer are already here with us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat raised the level of confusion. But then Twilight levitated all the foals out of their strollers and poofed the strollers away. Each foal then stood up in a straight line on the runaway, with the grownups behind them, making sure each foal was alright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience was flabbergasted at the site of it. Many audience members asked \u201cNo way\u2026 they\u2019re they\u2019re babies?!\u201d or \u201cWhat is going on?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery shortly after they all were before the audience, Twilight levitated her little Rarity up as well as a microphone and Rarity spoke to the huge audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHewwo ebeypony, me name is Wawity. Many ob you pwob-wy con-foosed by dis, so wet me ek-spwain farst. A week ago, me akid-ent-awy got turned inta a baby. At farst, me wa scared, but it wa-ent becas me wa baby. Bein baby wa fun.

Me wanted to get boowenteers to twy it, before dey deny it. So me did an me pweased ta say, dat me wa WIGHT! Aw-wal me boowenteers, pwease tell da awd-ence wha you tink!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity\u2019s speech cleared the air, but there were still plenty of skeptical faces in the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Sapphire Shores was the first to speak up though, trying to help Rarity\u2019s cause. \u201cWawity is wight. Me wa weawy upset, but den me twy me farst diapa chan-gin in ye-was an me WUB IT! It so comfy! Wawity is on da cuttin\u2019 edge ob fas-on an me da-wa a-nee won ob yous ta say oda wise.

Dis is Wawity\u2019s idea an she gots ta be pwased fa it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany model ponies were quickly convinced by Sapphire Shores words. The models and fashion designers of the room were practically nodding their heads by the time Sapphire finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Ponyvillians were still skeptical. That\u2019s when Little Amethyst Star spoke up with Little AJ and Little RD to her sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe agwee wit Saf-fiya Soores! Me wa weawy con-foosed by aw-wal dis. Bu den Fwuttashy.. she-she change diapa an an\u2026 me wewised some-ting. Dis takes stwess ah-fa ob me. It take stwess ofa Wainbow an AJ.

Me wanna be baby an me not afwaid ob it!! Me WUB IT!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmethyst Star\u2019s speech convinced nearly every Ponyvillian and even some of the upper elite of Canterlot. Most of the crowd was now on Rarity\u2019s side. Still, not everyone was convinced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Little Fleur Dis Lee and Little Royal Ribbon spoke up next. Royal Ribbon was shy in front of the audience and slowly became confident. She spoke up first out of the two of them \u201cMe-me tinks dis is gwate. Me had me diapa change by PWINCESS TWI-WIGH. Tinks abowt it! Da pwincess ob fwendship wikes dis an she had da wiwing-ness ta comfort me aw becas me baby. Me tinks baby hood is da key to feewin wike me fah-wowin da pwincess.

Me wanna be won an me wan da cantawot ewite to fah-wow in me hoofsteps!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a resounding applause by the Canterlot elite for that speech, quickly followed by Little Fleur Dis Lee\u2019s speech. \u201cDah not aw-wal ob it!

ME WIW NAH GIB UP!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her speech, every audience member was stomping their hooves. Before the designer show finished, Pinkie spoke up again. \u201cDon\u2019t be fooled ponies. The fun is for everypony! I\u2019m not a baby, but I get to comfort my friends. I get to play with my friends. I feel like their caretaker and it\u2019s incredible! The feeling of amazing-ness isn\u2019t just for the babies, but it\u2019s for the adults who get to care for their baby friends!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hoof stomping increased after Pinkie\u2019s speech and the remainder of the evening was spent with ponies commenting on the clothing idea and the looks. Everypony was positive and all the babies felt wonderful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the show ended and folks left, Twilight wound up giving away quite a bit of dresses, diapers, and other baby supplies. They had a number of these saved up in the back, but the number of ponies requesting these items was more than they intended. Luckily, they brought just enough for everypony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmethyst Star, Fleur Dis Lee, Sapphire Shores, and Royal Robin all left the event as babies. Each had a designated friend who was caring for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime can only tell how much this designer show would rock back and forth the face of Equestria!!</span></div></div>",

The effects of her new clothing line were apparent through Ponyville and beyond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Ponyville, the number of strollers out and about increased exponentially. About a month since the designer show, a new daycare opened up. All new plethora\u2019s of ponies were choosing to be babies as a form of relaxation. Some ponies went beyond this though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayor Mare even stayed a baby on normal hours now, only changing back when she had to deliver speeches. Otherwise, she was doing her paperwork in the baby form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis baby working style actually became quite common and the number of caretakers in Ponyville as well as the rest of Equestria increased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn many other towns across Equestria, the same rules held true. In capital cities, the upper elite were defined by the quality of diapers and other possessions they wore. Social events were typically hosted by babies, who use to be adults of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEquestria truly transformed as a nation from this new clothing line up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, clothing surprises were an aspect of all this. Sometimes ponies would be surprised with baby transformation as a gift or a prank. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was another normal day of school. The sky was clear and the majestic sun was out. On her way to work, Miss Cheerilee spotted several strollers, many with her friends inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe talked with one of her friends who happened to stay a baby most of the time. That pony just so happened to be Amethyst Star, who was being cared for by a pink and white pony named Care Sweet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmethyst spoke up to her friend, Cheerilee, as she was nearby \"Hi Cheerawee, how it goin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh.. it's going alright Amethyst. How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Me wa wondwin' if ya eba want ta give dis baby ting a shot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheerilee laughed \"I'm good. I think it's a lovely idea, but I don't plan to get my <i>diaper</i> changed anytime soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, sut ya sef. Me an da odas aw gonna be habin a pwaydate wata. You stiw can come if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheerilee smiled \"I'll think about it. Thanks for the offer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her way to class, she pondered on it. Each passing day was making her less and less sure of her position to not even try it. The truth was.. she was scared of it. She knew she could handle class if need be as a baby. It's just the thought of a being so vulnerable that scared her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head right as she entered the classroom, trying to enter her zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her way to her desk, Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon stopped her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiamond had her usual cockiness to her, with Silver Spoon smirking behind her. \"Hi Miss Cheerilee, could I have a moment of your time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheerilee sighed, thinking \"what will it be this time?\" and said \"Of course girls. What do you need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiamond smiled \"No, no, no. You misunderstand. We wanted to give you this dress we made!\" Diamond Tiara then pulled out a gorgeous green skirt dress from her saddle bag. \"Me and Spoon are thinking about becoming dress makers and we wanted to show off our dress to class. With you wearing it, we'll finally get some recognition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheerilee was quite surprised by the dress. It looked amazing!! She wanted to say yes, but in a contained way. \"Why of course girls. That dress looks great! Thank you for making it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, <i>thank you</i> for wearing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheerilee wasn't thinking straight to go to the bathroom though. She simply put the dress on in a hurry in class. She then organized herself in front of a mirror. As the last fillies pulled into class, Cheerilee said \"Good morning class, today we're-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was then cut off as magenta winds started forming around her. She stopped her lecture, trying to see what was up. Before she knew it.. she was lifted into the air and the winds formed around a vortex. Before the vortex clouded her out, she yelled \"DIAMOND TIARA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew it and her students, the winds were spinning around her at super high speeds. Cheerilee eventually realized what was going on, but she was powerless to stop anything. She was tricked and now foal-hood would eventually hit. The thought of what would soon be happening scared the daylights out of her. Long before the transformation was complete, Cheerilee started to cry about her situation. By the time she approached babydom, she was wailing at the top of her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter roughly 7 minutes later, the vortex ended, leaving a baby purple pony wailing. \"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiamond Tiara and Silver Spoon had smug faces on as both of them moved to the front of class. Diamond Tiara plucked a green pacifier into Miss Cheerilee's mouth and spoke up to her fellow classmates. \"Listen up! Miss Cheerilee is a baby and there's nothing you all can do about it! Today, I'm the teacher and today's lesson is how amazing I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe CMC stood up out of their seats to face their former bullies. Applebloom spoke up first. \"No way! You can't just turn our teacher into a baby and demand you're the teacher!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiamond Tiara was frustrated that anyone dared to challenge her. \"Well too bad. I did, so sit down Applebloom! or ELSE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo spoke up \"Or else what?! You had to trick Cheerilee to get the upper hand. That won't work again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver Spoon looked concerned, but Diamond Tiara shot back \"or else... or else, I'll remove Cheerilee's pacifier and the baby girl will wail your ears off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Belle raised her voice back, squeaking a little \"How DARE you? You turned our teacher into a baby and now you're humiliating the baby!\" Before Diamond Tiara could give a rebuttal, Sweetie Belle levitated Baby Cheerilee into her hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiamond Tiara clenched her teeth in frustration \"RRRr must you three always ruin everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplebloom laughed \"Yup.\" and spoke up to her class \"So, I think we should cancel class today. Miss Cheerilee can't teach us as a baby after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheerilee covered her face after hearing that. All the kids were leaving and it was because she was too <i>young</i>. She had absolutely no control over anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the kids were leaving, the CMC approached Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon again. Applebloom asked \"Now where is the reverse dress?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's at my house and you'll NEVER get it. Miss Cheerilee isn't coming back. She's gone. The baby right there.. she isn't her.\" Diamond Tiara then stared Cheerilee down, saying \"she's just a <i>baby</i>, a weak baby, who will need a <i>diaper</i> by the way. I recommend you go get one or someone's gonna have an <i>accident</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom hearing that, Cheerilee wailed, letting go of the pacifier and making a racket for the CMC.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiamond Tiara and Silver Spoon then left, laughing at the predicament they put the CMC in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplebloom and Scootaloo angrily stared at Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon, while Sweetie Belle tried to calm their teacher. \"Guys.. this is the bigger problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheerilee, tried rocking her back and forth, singing \"Hush now quiet now.\" This all didn't put Cheerilee to sleep, but it at least calmed her down. Sweetie Belle's experience as a baby caretaker was showing. She had already taken care of Rarity for roughly a month at this point and she was plenty ready for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheerilee finally spoke up for the first time as a baby \"Tanks.. you tree... Me a-scwace. Me dunno anee-tang. If on-wy me di-dent put on dis dwess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplebloom and Scootaloo basically just watched. Sweetie Belle did most of the talking \"It's okay Cheerilee. Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon are devious. Besides, we can fix this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We-weawy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! I take care of my sister all the time. I'll have you in a diaper as fast as I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis only upset Cheerilee, making her tear up. Sweetie Belle quickly realized what she did and blushed \"Oh.. I-I didn't mean it like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you di!\" Cheerilee yelled with tears in her eyes \"Me am baby! Me am stupid baby an da own-wy ting fa me is diapas! Me wiw neba teach again!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Belle did the only thing she could think. She babied Cheerilee. The approach oddly worked with Rarity, so she did it here. \"Now, now, Cheerilee. Your foalsitters will take care of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But den dat means me am a baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An adorable one at that!\" Sweetie Belle then cuddled her teacher, calming her down. \"First things first. We need to get a diaper on you. Follow me girls. My house has tons of diapers in case my little sister has emergencies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplebloom and Scootaloo followed their friend confused, but confident Sweetie knew what she was doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheerilee was scared out of her mind, but had no choice but to follow</span></div></div>",

They got a few strange looks from the towns folk but nopony stopped them. Cheerilee clung to the young unicorns back like it was a liferaft in a storm, which it probably was to the former adult. The magenta foal was living her fears, suddenly thrust upon her in a mean and horriable way and then told she was stuck like this forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if she could never teach again? Teaching young fillies and colts was her life! Nopony would take a baby seriously! What would she do if she couldn't teach? What about her house! What about her? She couldn't even use the bathroom anymore let alone cook or buy groceries. Who would take care of her!? The mental effects only made her fears worse. She had the mental and emotional control of a foal, and she was one step away from completly loosing it! It was taking all her willpower, and basically mauling her pacifier which was given back to her, to keep from causing a scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crusaders cooed at their teacher through the entire way but it didn't help. True it didn't hurt either. Cheerilee responded to the soft voices calming her, but then she would realise she was acting like a foal and that would upset her again! A visious cycle. They finally made it to Sweetie's home again without incadent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh? I was expecting something to go wrong. Scootaloo said as they entered the house. Don't jinks us ya dodo! Applebloom hissed looking around nerviously. Allright the diapering supplies are in my room. Sweetie Bell said setting their teacher on the wooden floor. You two watch her. So saying the unicorn ran upstaires.Cheerliee whimpered looking at the suddenly giant sized house. It only reinforced how small and helpless she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAww! Its ok Miss. Cheerliee. Applebloom cooed nuzzling the foal. Just wait a moment and we'll go find Rarity and fix this here mess right up. That did cheer the foal up some. Mayby this will all work out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most immediate problem is getting a diaper on the foal before the second effect of the transformation occurs.

The pale filly suddenly bit her tongue to keep fro saying \"accident.\" Cheerilee knew what she was going to say though and started to sniffle. The crusaders sighed feeling for their teacher. Sweetie levitated a diaper out of the package and pushed the foal onto her back. It was a fancy thing, with frills around the leg and tail holes and colorful designs on the front. Sweetie grinned in embarrassment at the foals look. Rarity picked them. She said causing everpony to nod in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the shock of the other crusaders and Cheerilee Sweetie didn't do anything more than tape a diaper onto the magenta foal. Um, Sweetie Bell. Aren't their other steps? Applebloom asked. There are. Sweetie answered picking Cheerilee up. But if I'm right then it would be pointless to do anything else. Before anypony could ask what she meant a faint \"hissing\" sound was herd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheerilee's eyes went wide as she felt her flank warm up. She pressed her hooves into the front of the diaper, as if that could stop it. Sweetie gently moved her hooves away. Don't do that Miss Cheerilee. I'll change you when your done. So whats next? I say we break into that brats house and demand the reverse dress! Scootaloo said knocking her hooves together with a \"war face.\" Sweetie Bell shook her head. The plan was to see Twilight and Rarity. She countered. They made the spell remember. I'm sure they can fix this in half an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheerilee watched as her students argued back and fourth ignoring her feeling her heart sink lower and lower. They weren't even asking her what she wanted. Foals didn't get much say in what they did, they just went along with their caretakers. Here she was sitting in a wet diaper as her fate was argued over by her former students. That more than anything drove home just how helpless and how little control over her life she had now. As if the universe was confirming hr new status she suddenly felt her gut clench. With a pained cry she messed herself. Tears running down her face, helpless to stop. Foals didn't have control over those body functions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplebloom suddenly wrinkled her nose. Ah think the first thing we need ta do is give somepony a diaper change. Sweetie and Scootaloo looked at their teacher who gazed at them with teary helpless eyes. A dozen tricks ran through the unicorns mind on how to calm a foal down, but then she remembered Cheerilee didn't want this. Unlike Rarity Cheerilee was forced into this and treating her like a foal might make it worse. So wordlessly the filly set her teacher down and changed her diaper. Cheerilee just stared at the ceiling for the entire process, shivering at the touch of the wipes and sneezing when Sweetie applied powder. All done!~ Sweetie sang helping Cheerilee sit up, the old diaper vanishing in a puff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIncineration spell. Sweetie explained noticing the looks she was getting. Despite herself Cheerilee had to giggle, though it sounded more nervous than happy. Ok girls. Sweetie said cuddling the foal, again. Seriously now: what are we going to do to help  Miss Cheerilee?</span></div></div>",

Tears slowly swelled up. Spike clearly hit a fresh wound. Once they did, Twilight walked slowly to the table with her head down. \"I know... I was supposed to not let princess duties get in the way of my friends, but I did.\" Her tears started to fall even faster after that, so she buried her head on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh, I-I was just making a joke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's head shot off after that and she turned to Spike. \"Well, it's not funny Spike!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rapid change of emotions took Spike off guard and he merely said \"I-I'm sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting that reaction, Twilight went back to her pity, burying her head on the table. \"It's okay... it's not you're fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike didn't really know what to do, but he tried his best to comfort Twilight, patting her back. \"It's okay Twilight. Pinkie and the gang probably don't mind at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight just said back in a defeated tone \"Really...? Then why did she cry last night when I came back past midnight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.. uh... that was um, because...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave it Spike. I appreciate you trying to cheer me up, but it's hopeless. I can't go back in time nearly that far. What's done is done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But maybe you could fix it the other way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight raised her voice with inflection \"The other way? What is the other way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, going back in time doesn't really change your age does it? You'd still be a day older than your last birthday. Why don't you just change your age so you're not a day older?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's high brows raised with curiosity. \"That's.. an interesting idea, but I can't do an age spell. I already tried back when Trixie came back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But now you're an alicorn. I'm sure an age spell of merely one day shouldn't be too hard with all that magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's concerns were fading, but one issue still remained. \"But will Pinkie accept this? Maybe my other friends will, but she <b>really</b> had her sights set on yesterday,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... maybe, but... I'll go get her. I'll try to convince her for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight just rested her head on the table again. \"K.. tell me what she says when she comes back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike wasted no time after that response and headed straight to Sugar Cube Corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce there, he knocked and surprisingly Mrs. Cake responded instead of Pinke, which was out of the ordinary. \"Uh Mrs. Cake, have you seen Pinkie? I need to tell her something? It's urgent!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Cake was shy a bit \"Well, of course. She's upstairs taking her day off. Just be delicate. She's been crying all morning because of <i>last night</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing that Spike raced upstairs, opened Pinkie's door and yelled \"PINKIE!!! PINKIE!!! WHERE ARE YOU?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie was just laying on her stomach, back side up. Her head was in the Pillow and she just responded timidly \"Yes...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike raced up to her \"Pinkie! Twilight found a way to fix what happened with a spell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief pause of silence and then Pinkie jumped out of the bed with her normal glee \"Really? How?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike was again caught off guard by the rapid change of emotions \"Well.. um, Twilight is going to regress herself a day, so.. her birthday would actually be today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge smile grew on Pinkie's face. \"That. Is. AMAZING!!!! Where is Twilight now?!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's back at the castle, probably lying on her table. She's depressed and didn't think you'd accept it this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?! WELL WE NEED TO TURN THAT FROWN UPSIDE DOWN!!!\" PInkie quickly rushed to get her saddle bag with 'cheer um up' supplies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike just ran as fast as he could behind Pinkie. Within roughly 5 minutes they were barging into Twilight's castle room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie rushed over to comfort her friend. \"TWILIGHT! TURN THAT FROWN UPSIDE DOWN!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight just looked up, partly concerned \"Yes Pinke?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you so down silly? You found out how to make today your birthday, didn't ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I just\" Twilight wiped off her tears \"I thought you'd still be mad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie tilted her head \"Mad? I wasn't mad silly! I was sad. I was a bad friend to not help you at all! But now it's okie dokie lokie!! Today can be your birthday!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean... you're okay with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course silly willy! Why wouldn't I be?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight smiled \"I-I don't know, but thank you. Let me just prepare myself for this spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took roughly 5 minutes for Twilight to get ready. She said out load \"Okay, here goes nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight levitated in the air as a magenta vortex started to form around her. Very quickly she couldn't see Spike, Pinkie, or anything in the room. Within seconds there was a bright glare and poof of smoke! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething wasn't right though. Twilight could no longer sustain the levitation spell for some reason. It was like her magic suddenly got incredibly weak. So.. sure enough, she falls to the floor with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's revealed is a little lavender foal with a stub for a horn and tiny wings. Right after hitting the floor, Twilight did what any foal around her age. She cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike and Pinkie's reactions to the unexpected change were virtually the exact opposites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike rushed over to Twilight \"oh my gosh, Oh My Gosh, OH MY GOSH!!! WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU TWILIGHT?!!!!!!!!!!!!\" All this did was make Twilight cry louder. \"R-right..that probably doesn't make you feel better, but.. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie paused briefly followed by complete and utter glee \"AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!! Twilight you shouldn't have!! This is the best gift you've ever given me!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike just said \"huh.\" He was surpremely confused. Twilight continued wailing, that is until Pinkie picked her up and rocked her back and forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't cry Twilight. You're one of the best friends I could ask for. You try so hard to make things right that you become an adorable wittle baby. Well, Auntie Pinkie is gonna throw you the best birthday ever!! But first! Somebody needs a diapee wiapee!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie then went rummaging through her 'cheer um up' saddle bag. She found several diapers as well as baby lotions, wipes, and powders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait?! Why do you have all of that on you?!!\" Spike demanded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because this bag is for all my friends silly! and the Cake twins happen to be my friends and babies, haha\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Spike was too exhausted. \"Augh.. I'm gonna lay down for a bit. Please take good care of her. I have no idea what do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to worry Spike, Auntie PInkie's got this all handled.\" Spike just left. There was no point in trying to reason around this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight started to tear up after Spike left, but Pinkie was quick to comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D'aaaaawww, there there, Twilight. It's okay. Spike is just cranky wanky right now. But that doesn't mean you're adorable, silly!!\" Pinkie then nuzzled Twilight's nose and carefully laid her on the living room table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okie dokie lokie, let's get you in clean diaper wiaper!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie then proceeded with the diaper change, lifting up Twilight's flank, wiping it down, and powdering her up. \"You've been a good baby waby, now you're almost done!\" Pinkie then slid a diaper underneath and strapped it in place over her friend's flanks. \"There, there, all better!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Twilight started to speak up for the first time since she became a baby. \"Tanks Pinkie..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww... you can talk!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight blushed at that \"Yeeaa... so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just so aaaaaadoooorable!!\" Pinkie then picked up and cradled the little unicorn. \"Soo.. whatcha wanna do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight scowled and tried to get out what she wanted to say \"I-I.. me.. me wanna\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie cut her off. \"Okie dokie lokie, we'll find out about your age! Follow me!\" Pinkie was ignoring the last part instead of confronting it. Twilight was having so much difficultly with pronunciation, that she had no choice but to follow along with Pinkie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter going to a doctor, the two of them found out that Twilight was one day away from hitting the age 1.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie just thanked the doctor, preventing Twilight from getting even one word in. Outside of the doctor's office, Pinkie said \"Here that Twilight! We have plenty of time to prepare your <b>first</b> birthday!! C'mon, let's go let all of our friends know you're about to turn one!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does Pinkie go to first?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was super eager to tell everyone, but she first wanted to tell her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity yelled on the other end *Coming!* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she opened the door, she was delighted to see Pinkie. \"Pinkie! You're just the pony I wanted to see, so about that...\" Rarity stopped herself in mid sentence after first seeing the foal in Pinkie's hoof. Rarity paused a bit, looking somewhat concerned. \"Pinkie, I'm terribly sorry to cut my sentence short, but.. but is that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie giggled. \"You guessed it. This wittle bundle of joy is Twilight!\" After hearing that, Twilight looked away in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity couldn't say anything other than a loud \"WHAT?!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! Isn't it great!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity was astounded by Pinkie's behavior and quickly pulled her inside along with baby Twilight. \"Pinkie! Why in Equestria are you excited about this?!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie's enthusiasm deflated somewhat \"Wha-what do you mean? Isn't this great? Now we get to celebrate Twilight's age 1 birthday party. The doctor said she'll turn 1 tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity was livid after that response. \"Her age 1 birthday party! Is <b>that</b> why you're so happy?! So what about that! What about-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity was cut off by Twilight surprisingly. Twilight began to wail after Rarity said \"So what about that!\" It meant her whole transformation was for nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie immediately tried to comfort Twilight, rocking her back and forth. \"There, there Twilight, it's okay. She didn't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight gradually calmed down. Rarity protested \"What?! What did I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie sighed \"The whole reason she is a baby is because she wanted to make up us missing her birthday. She was gonna do it by one day, but her alicorn magic was more powerful than she thought. You just insulted the very reason she is like this, meanie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity paused and shortly tears formed \"Oh my.. I-I didn't know. Twilight\" Rarity then faced Twilight, \"I'm sorry, I-I didn't mean to insult that. I just want you as an adult is all and... that's all Darling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight stopped crying after Rarity's apology and even motioned to be hugged. Rarity was pleasantly surprised and the two had a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie became super ecstatic again. \"So does that mean you'll do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity raised an eye brow \"Do what Darling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Decorate Twilight's age 1 b-day of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\" Rarity blushed, \"Well, of course. Twilight is an incredible friend, why wouldn't I. But I must ask, how long will this last?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What last?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity glared at Pinkie \"This baby spell\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooooo, you mean that! Well... um, I think Twilight will have to grow up again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity was super concerned \"You're serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie said in a defeated tone \"yes...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity saw out of the corner of her eye Twilight on the verge of crying again. So.. Rarity did everything she could to avoid that. \"Don't be so pessimistic Darling! That's fabulous news! Mind you, this will be a big change to adjust to, but that means we'll have an adorable Twilight baby to care for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight briefly smiled. Rarity's approach luckily avoided a disaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie then raised her mouth. \"All righty then! That's super! Then in the mean time, I'll take Twilight to the Cakes for baby supplies.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, it lacked one crucial component, all of the guests were significantly older than Twilight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party took place in Twilight's castle ball area, but the whole floor was covered in protective carpeting for Twilight. Not only that, a plethora of baby toys were scattered across the floor. Changing tables were located near the walls, in case Twilight had an accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe theme of the party was rather strange. Everybody there was required to wear diapers. (Only mares attended this party mind you.) There were drinks and snacks before the cake, but these items weren't very normal. The only drinks available were milk or juice in baby bottles. The food was all mashed baby food. Rarity realized she went a bit overboard, but she wanted to do everything she could to make Twilight feel like the guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot of the guests crowded around Twilight, which made Twilight nervous to some extent. For these reason, others chatted among themselves until Twilight was free. Some even played with the baby toys to take up time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*frame to some ponies on the floor*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonBon stood over Lyra and Minutte with an annoyed look. \"Will you two stop that? You guys are acting like babies..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra and Minutte giggled and Lyra said \"Awww, come on BonBon, it's fun.This is the theme of the party, isn't it? We're just playing the act.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutte added \"Yea, come on BonBon, embrace the baby in you.\" The two of them just went back to playing with blocks, not waiting on BonBon's reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The-the baby in me? There is no baby in me! I'm an adult, what you two are supposed to be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two didn't respond and BonBon just sighed. \"Fine.. give me a block.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*frame to the drink and food table*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie was at one of the tables, drinking her fifth bottle. \"I dunno what Twilight was so sad about. This milk tastes great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity sternly looked at Pinkie \"Pinkie! Be mindful of others. Maybe Twilight will want some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie just joked it off \"But Rarity, I need my milky wilky too. Can't ya see this diaper?\" Pinkie lifted up her dress, to show the round white cushion around her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity took a deep breathe. \"Do you have to joke about this theme..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow butted in. \"OF COURSE SHE DOES! I can't believe we all have to wear these stupid outfits anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity kept quiet. It wasn't worth arguing in front of Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Frame to when Twilight's about to blow out the candle*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the 26 guests sat in high chairs like Twilight and sang at the same time \"Make A Wish, It's Your Birthday\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the time was ready to blow out the candles, Twilight concentrated on her wish \"I wish I was like all my friends.\" As Twilight blew out the 1 candle, her horn glowed and all the guests were relieved. They thought Twilight would turn back. Oh how they were wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this time, Twilight unknowingly shot a bright magenta bolt up to the disco ball. The spell had an interesting effect on the disco ball. It caused the disco ball to glow magenta, engulfing the whole room in a magenta hue. The light did not last long, but it's radiance hit every single guest for the 30 seconds it lasted. In those 30 seconds, the whole guest roster transformed into wittle 1 year olds. Oddly enough, each ponies' diaper fit their new forms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever spell Twilight cast, it sure accomplished her wish. She was no longer the only baby in the room in a high chair. She was just like all of her friends.</span></div></div>",

Pinkie was giggling and bouncing up and down in her high chair, sending puffs of powder and the sound of crinkling plastic with every bounce.  Even Rainbow Dash, who was so against this to begin with, was now giggling and smiling as she ate a slice of cake that was now bigger than her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm.\"  Twilight looked to her right to see a shell shocked Spike staring at the mass of now over 20 foals one of whom were older than a year.  \"I'm, I'm going to go get some help.\"  He muttered slowly edging to the door.  \"You, uh, you enjoy the cake.\" He said clearly trying not to freak out before he dashed out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight blinked, whimpered a bit more and looked back to her friends.  A bunch of happy giggling foals getting hyped up on sugar.  If Twilight didn't no better she would think they were real foals! A horrible thought entered her mind and she felt her heart sink.  \"Did I erase there minds too!\"  Twilight thought panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing around she finally turned to the closet pony to her, Pinkie Pie still happily bouncing up and down.  \"Pin-ke. Pin-ki?\"  Twilight asked after a bit the pink foal stopped bouncing and looked at Twilight with a confused head tilt.  Twilight gulped before asking. \"Pin-ke, are tu otay?\"  Twilight felt tears well up in her eyes.  \"Tu, tu still know tu big pony wite?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight didn't know if she really wanted to hear the response, but it proved that</span></div></div>",

Her bed and her pillow were suddenly too small for her, and her horn was stuck in the board behind her.  She pulled her horn out and rolled over, suddenly noticing a much longer and slender set of purple hooves protruding from her bed. Twilight\u2019s mouth fell open.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to me?\u201d Even her voice sounded strange. It was louder, but had a soft yet regal, melodic sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put  a hoof to mouth as she heard it, surprising at the new voice that came out of mouth. What had happened last night that could have cause this, and what had happened to her anyway? Twilight tried to think about the events of the previous night, but her memory was blurry. She had tried to read up on Alicorns, but little information existed about them, aside from historical notes about Celesita, Luna and Cadance. She had looked in some other books, then there was a gap in her memory and she went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had happened in that gap? She held her head. Think Twilight, think!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe racked her mind but nothing was coming back to her. Whatever had happened, she wasn\u2019t going to find the answer lying in bed, so she rolled out and landed on her hooves, immediately noticing something else strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that explained the uncomfortable feeling in her back. She stretched out her wings and noticed they were much longer, looking a lot like Celestia\u2019s only purple. Twilight gaver herself another look. Somehow her proportions had changed, her and hooves were all like Celestia, and a long, shimmering mane floated behind her. She checked her cutie mark. It was still a 5 pointed star, but the mark was bigger, again like Celestia\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight had to get to a mirror, that was he only way she could confirm this. Moving through her home felt strange, like it was too small for her. She started to understand how Celestia felt when she came to visit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raced to the bathroom and gasped when she saw a mirror. Her hypothesis was correct, somehow she had become an Alicorn like Celestia. Was this the result of a spell she cast? A side effect of some magical artefact? A dream? She pinched herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn\u2019t a dream.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She remembered trying to cast a spell, but not what or why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, she found herself in Canterlot Castle's throne room. It should have been familiar to her but something was off, actually several things. It was decorated differently to how Celestia did it and the throne in which she was sitting in was sized to Twilight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that's strange.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at it, she also notice her body was different, both her torso and legs were long and slimmer and she had long purple wings from each side of her body. It was as thought her proportions had shifted to match Celestia's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was trying to come to term's with these strange changes, when a small white unicorn with a pink mane cheerfully walked into throne room, the guards moving to let her through without question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Princess Twilight, are you ready to teach today's lesson?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight stared at both the abruptness of the question and this strange pony in front her.

As usual she got out of her bed, brushed her mane and did her regular morning routine. What wasn't usual was that she wanted to try something new.<br>\r\n She wanted to try a new spell. That wasn't too exciting, but was was that it was from a new book she got. The new book was titled Spells and Wonders. This book was rather thick but also had lots of pictures and diagrams describing the spells. <br>\r\n She looked through the book a couple of nights after she received it and was curious about one spell in particular. She saw that the book had various spells that could allow her to transform things and showed her new abilities she could do with her magic.<br>\r\n She was already rather skilled in magic but this book had spells she never saw before. One in particular was a weight spell. It was pretty simple and allowed her to change the weight of things. <br>\r\n Twilight wanted to see what the book meant. She flipped through pages of the spell and saw the diagrams. The pictures showed that the weight spell could change the gravity, mass and volume of things. So without too much hesitation, she decided to try the spell.<br>\r\n From previous experience, she learned that it was unwise to try new spells on herself, her friends, or animals. So she chose a simple rock. She got Spike to help her out with the spell.<br>\r\n She asked him to watch the rock and record any changes that took place. He agreed to help, being her assistant and all, and placed the rock on a scale for her. She started slow.<br>\r\n She first tried the gravity form of the spell. It worked and made the rock heavier. She then tried to reverse the process and it also worked. Twilight was excited that nothing went wrong. She now wanted to try something more advanced.<br>\r\n Next she went for the mass of the rock. It was very similar to the weight form but she noticed that the rock grew a little. That made her happy because it was expected. She shrank the rock back to normal and all was well.<br>\r\n Now she wanted to try the volume portion. She saw the rock grow but the scale didn't change. She was still happy. Now she wanted to move onto something more exciting. <br>\r\n She wanted to see if she could combine the forms. She first tried to make the rock small and heavy. It worked. After a short while of more tests, she was ready to try it on herself.<br>\r\n Spike knew that this could be dangerous, but seeing her previous success, he wasn't too worried. Twilight wasn't sure how her body would react but hit herself with the spell anyway. She was thrown back after she was hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

If I don't like the results, I can turn back.\"<br>\r\n Spike knew he couldn't stop her, but he didn't question any further. He saw that the spell worked and felt unusually comfortable, but he still couldn't ignore the possibility of danger. He replied, \"Well, um, let's try the rest of you.\"<br>\r\n Twilight responded pleasantly and was ready to hit herself again. This time she wanted to be sure she had something to catch her. So she set up and calculated where she would fall. She readied herself for another blast.<br>\r\n Another thing she did was set up a mirror in a way the the spell would reflect and hit her body. She shot another blast and hit herself. The impact was the same, but she didn't fly anywhere this time. She stayed put and waited for the spell dust to clear.  <br>\r\n Spike coughed and cleared the smoke like usual but he was surprised at the results. He laughed and ran away quickly as to not offend Twilight. Twilight couldn't see herself and wondered what was so funny.<br>\r\n She turned to look at the mirror and saw the spell did the same to her body as it did to her face. She was astounded and trotted around to take a full look at herself. She smiled but was a little worried now. She figured that there must be a catch to this and tried to quickly look in the book again.<br>\r\n She would have but she wasn't used to her new form nor weight. She galloped and plopped on the floor. The landing didn't hurt her for her body was much softer and thicker. She got up and tried again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The knocking grew louder and more insistent as the visitor grew more impatient. A glance at the doorknob showed it was unlocked. If they decided to come in, she'd be screwed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking quickly, she wracked her memory for a spell. There had to be one, she just needed a simple glamor, maybe some simple body modification, nothing she couldn't handle... A lightbulb lit up in her head. If she combined some basic mane, coat, and tail coloration spells with Starswirl's 63rd principle, nopony would be able to see through her disguise!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here goes nothing,\" She muttered as her horn ignited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a second, her entire body began to glow. Her coat began to darken, going from lavender to a deep, regal purple, while her mane and tail shrunk down, growing rougher and more unkempt in the process. She felt a tingle as her muzzle began to grow thicker and stockier, thick stubble appearing across her upper and lower jawline. Her body began to gurgle and quiver as her fat redistributed itself. Her ass began to shrink, while pounds moved into her belly, giving her a distinctly rounder, somewhat masculine figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the casual observer, Twilight was a stallion, albeit a massive, greasy fatty. But there were still hints of her true self leftover, so if she wanted to trick anypony who really knew her, she'd need a little something extra. With a flick of the horn, her cutie marks faded away, and a second later, a pair of hammers and horseshoes appeared upon her chunky flanks. Her coat darkened to grey, while her mane and tail turned into short-cropped military-style cuts. Now, even her closest friends shouldn't be able to tell the difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished not a moment too soon, as the door handle turned and Rainbow Dash barged in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Twili...\" She shouted, before trailing off as her eyes focused on the massive figure in the middle of the room. Twilight began to sweat, gazing into her friend's wide eyes for any hint of recognition. She found none, and breathed an internal sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-who are you?\" Rainbow stammered, her face turning beet red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm, uh,\" Twilight searched, her deep baritone voice taking her off-guard, \"A-Anvil! Twilight's cousin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow stared for a moment, her lip planted firmly between her teeth. Twilight noticed a trickle of blood leak down her chin, and hoped against hope that she hadn't somehow figured it out, and wasn't desperately holding in laughter.

She knew this spell very well. Many brilliant magicians had attempted it over the ages, and none of them had the willpower to cast the reversal.

She didn't want Twilight to end up like him, eating and farting for the rest of her days, but there was little she could do. Only the caster could reverse the spell, and right now, Twilight lacked the willpower to sit up, let alone cast a complicated spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flipped through the book, scanning the pages for something that might help, but nothing caught her attention as being particularly helpful. Nothing but weird, oftentimes sexual spells, relating to transformation, mental manipulation, growth, shrinking... But nothing that could help solve Twilight's current predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did have one idea... If she cast the spell on herself and became a slob, in appearance if not in mind, she might be able to convince Twilight to cast the spell and turn herself back.

The slob life might seem enticing to some, but Princess Celestia was confident she'd be able to resist long enough to help her favorite student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... It was risky. If she so much as considered becoming a slob, it could cause a cascade effect that would destroy her mind and leave her as a big, useless ball of dough, like just Twilight. Perhaps it would be better to give up, leave her once-student to her fate... It wasn't like Twilight had any objections.

Equestria would doubtless condemn her as a monster for leaving the once-hero to this state. But such scars healed with time. Someday, perhaps, Twilight would regain her old self, work off the weight, rebuild her reputation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight groaned, letting out a massive fart in Celestia's direction.

She managed to remember a spell to stop it just in time, but knew the results were only temporary.<br>\r\n Before knocking over the mirror, she shot at it again with her magic and hit herself. It tickled her and she stopped gaining weight. She managed to not break her floor and read through for some counter spells or cures.<br>\r\n She found out that there were two cures. Both had a pro and con. The first one was actually a spell. She could actually shoot herself again with the same spell, but she would have to run around for at least an hour before the effects would wear off. <br>\r\n She didn't want to do that because she couldn't in her current state. Fortunately there was another cure and that was to find some sapphire bluebells. She read that if she ate one, the effects would wear off in a couple of minutes. The problem was that those berries were extremely rare and could only be found in the Ever free forest.<br>\r\n Twilight also glanced over a third one, but the writing was smudged. \"I wonder what that could be she thought.\" She sat there and called Spike over to get some help. She knew she didn't have much time and she saw Spike come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

In a panic, she looked around, and saw strange digits separating out of her hooves. That's when she passed out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she woke up, she instinctively rose... to her hind legs... no, her only legs. \"What happened...\" She saw the strange black &amp; white effect was gone as she groggily groped her head with her hand... hand?! Quickly, she ran to the mirror, and saw herself. In the mirror stood what her books only said were legends, a human. This obviously resulted in loud screaming. She was furless, save her mane, which she guessed was now called 'hair' now, and she sported five fingers on each of her 'hands.' She saw she was dressed in 'clothes,' a violet tank top and jeans, and those odd things on her feet must be 'shoes' (Sandals to be exact). She was perplexed by the strange mounds on her chest for a moment. \"Why are they so big?\" but figured there had to be a reason humans had them. However, she did notice she did keep one aspect of her pony-ness. Looking at her toned rear, poking through her jeans, she was relieved to be greeted by her swishing tail, which nearly dragged the ground. \"Guess I'm not all 'hu-man.'

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One day, Twilight was cleaning out some of her mustier bookcases when a thick book written in ancient text fell on her head. \"What is this?\" she pondered. She poured through the book, amazed by the ancient spells she never heard of. Finally, she saw one that she had to try. It was a spell that'd let her visit other worlds. Every time it was cast, one could go to a new world, and it says masters can recall worlds they have journeyed to before with this spell. \"I wonder what kind of people I could meet!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to her mirror, as prescribed in the spell, and spoke the mystic words, \"Altera Quantus, String Parallaxium, Vortexus Creatio ex Nihilo!!\" A swirling vortex opened, and a strange new world was coming into view. She looked below, and read aloud, \"...and now for the stabilizing tome; 'Reflection be my Gate!!'\" She sees houses in a small suburb. \"Time for adventure, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the many weeks, Twilight visited many realms, and I won't bore you with all her exploits, as this is about one particular exploit, but here are some notable adventures. She:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Helped a mentally challenged fat man and a giant chicken make peace after years of fighting.<br>\r\n- Helped a backwoods teenage cephalopod get his GED.<br>\r\n- Attended a peace conference in space amongst thousands of species and helped stop a deadly threat to the cosmos when she learned her horn is the horn that can pierce the heavens!!<br>\r\n- Taught a surly booze-drinking robot from the future the true meaning of Kwanzaa, then helped his lobster friend get a three-course meal.<br>\r\n- Met a flying spaghetti monster.<br>\r\n- Helped a fellow wandered of space and time make the leap that will take him home.<br>\r\n- Convinced a deranged sentient computer program to give mankind a second chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, she cast the spell again, but was shocked when she saw in the mirror a girl that resembled her holding a creepy plush cat, causing her to stop before uttering the stabilizing tome. \"OMG... She looks just like me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl on the other side says, \"Something's wrong with my mirror, Panty!! I swear I'm seeing ponies!!\" She leans forward to examine the mirror, and Twilight does the same. Twilight lifts her hoof to the mirror as this girl puts her hand to it, when suddenly the image begins distorting, and a bright white light begins pouring out. Rays of light tear from the vortex in the mirror as both pony and girl scream, and then there is an explosion, and then, nothing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Twilight woke up, grasping her aching head as she rose, seeing with blurry vision her room was blasted to shambles, smoldering embers laying everywhere. \"Oh, my head.\" Twilight mutters as she stumbles about. It was then she realized, \"I'm on four hooves, so what am I holding my head with?\" She lowers the appendage, to see a hand on an arm adorned in a black sleeve capped with a frilly white cuff. \"Wha..\" Twilight gasped as she galloped around to find anything left that was intact and reflective in her room. Luckily, a shard of her mirror was stuck in the wall near eye level, large enough to give her a general view of her body. She gasped at the sight. Up top, she was almost a dead ringer for the girl she saw in the mirror, save for her horn, which was still affixed to her forehead, dressed in a frilly black dress with a white collar and blue ribbon around her neck, and a cobalt ribbon sash tied around her waist complimented by a large bow in the rear. In her violet and fuchsia hair, which now stretched now to her knees, there was a cobalt bow there as well. Her green eyes stared back in shock. However, starting from this humanoid form's hips she was still all pony, although she was now wearing cobalt and black stockings on her legs going up to her knees, and had another cobalt bow on her tail, however everything else about her pony half, including her cutie mark, was still the same. \"What happened... The stabilizing tome!! I was so surprised by how similar we looked I forgot to cast it!! But this... Why did this happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Twilight stood up and grabbed the pony, bringing her right to her face. \"Listen Twi, ah know the real you is locked away somewhere inside this thing! Yah'll have to fight it!\" Twilight merely laughed, but then began to think. \"Hmmm... There may be use for you.\" Applejack closed her eyes as a purple flame washed over her. However, it didn't seem to hurt her. In fact it felt.....relaxing. \"Equestria belongs to me.\" Twilight whispered \"Everything is mine!.....including you.\" The flames hypnoticly danced around Applejack as she slowly nodded. \"Of course Twi, Equestria's yers, my family's orchards yers, everything belongs to you.... our superior.\" As the flames dided down streaks of purple could be seen on Applejack. \"Now my slave\" Twilight said as her eyes returned to Canterlot, \"Let's make that the truth.\"</span></div></div>",

Like just crawling to the top of her bed out of her blankets was now a difficult task. Then as she finally made it out of her blanket she looked around and couldn't help but feel as if everything around her was somehow bigger. But that didn't make sense. Looking around she saw Spike's bed was empty. That was even more strange. She was always awake before him. Looking out her window she saw it was late afternoon. <i>'I should have been awake hours ago. Oh no now my studies will be late. Have to get downstairs and start. If I start now I may be able to finish by early tomorrow morning.'</i> she thought. Pulling the rest of her body out of the blanket she stepped off the bed...Or at least tried to. Twilight discovered that her bed was now what seemed like five feet off the ground. She hit the ground on her stomach with a very loud thud. Laying there in a daze she heard someone shout from downstairs. As the daze of the fall wore off she felt the pain from it. Twilight then had the overwhelming urge to just start wailing. Screwing her eyes shut she tried to block it out. Unfortunately the urge was too strong. Opening her mouth wide she took a deep (and partially painful) breath then cried at the top of her lungs.

Upon noticing this, she was appalled by what Spike did, he was supposed to help her, but here he was running away from here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she processed all that, she felt a burning sensation build up within her. A sensation of.. Rage. Of vengeance. Of destruction.  She wanted to make Spike and the others pay for what had happened to her, and she was developing a sick desire to destroy everything with a smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it developed, it slowly started to grow and fester into her mind while her conscious/morality was beginning to shrink faster and faster. Eventually, as the roof collapsed around her, so did her sanity as a wide grin formed across her face. \"Pathetic creatures!\" She shouted, cracking windows in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked out of the castle, she decided to demonstrate her power by lifting up the castle with her magic and she hurled into a mountain, obliterating it in the process and causing the remains to slide down the mountain and land in the city below. Twilight's grin grew even wider as she heard the destruction down below grow louder and louder. She made sure no pony was harmed, but the reason for that was so that she could have them watch in horror as she lay waste to their town.</span></div></div>",

I mean I'm in Princess Celestia's body. But how is this possible?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess?!\" The guard asked her \"Are you ill? I can fetch the royal physician at once-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>No!</b> Uh I mean that won't be necessary...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Princess-\" The guard looked towards the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still as dark as midnight outside. The moon had fallen, but the sun was yet to rise and everypony was waiting for her to start the day but she had no idea how! She considered getting Luna, after all if Celestia could raise the moon then surely Luna could raise the sun? But what if it was her fault she stuck in Celestia body? WHat if all this was because of her?! What would Luna do to her?!  Even if she didn't know how to raise the sun maybe the magic to do so was in Celestia's body. It was possible... she did technically have Celestia's cutie mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked at the horizon and concentrated, trying to imagine the sun soaring into the air. She concentrated and to her surprise  the sun quickly and easily rose! Wow Celestia must be extremely powerful! Twilight could never imagine lifting something so large with so little effort<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards looked relieved though still seemed puzzled at her bizarre behaviour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your majesty, forgive me for asking but do you need more rest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes that would be a good idea! Thank you everypony your princess is fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards still seemed puzzled and concerned. It must have been strange hearing Celestia's voice cracking the way Twilight did under stress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure there's nothing you need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure! Everypony please go!\" Twilight pushed the nerest with Celestias wing, breifly surpised she could actually push a pony using only her wings, espeically one as tall and well built as a guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're sure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I'll call if I need anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards reluctantly left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she was finally alone with her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did she get here? Was this her fault or someone elses? She didn't remember casting a spell like this, but she had had magical accidents before. Would Luna understand?  Twilight shuddered. She'd rather not risk it if she didn't have to. Maybe she could check the royal library, there had to be a book about this, hopefully with a spell that could fix things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she was here, where was Celestia? Presumably Celestia was in Twilight's body, but Twilight couldn't be sure of that. A part of her wanted to ask Celestia for help but how would she take it? Well she probably wouldn't banish Twilight... wait. Celestia used her own magic to send those letters, and it was a spell Twilight didn't know! And unlike raising the sun this wasn't magic that would be stored in her body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would she do if somepony needed Celestia? Would she have to fill in for her? Could she dream of doing such a thing? Would it be considered treasonous her to try? And yet what if some pony needed Celestia really badly? She couldn't let the kingdom fall into chaos!

I hope she doesn't think I'm a changeling or something! Twilight took a deep breath. No that would be ridiculous. Though if she checks my dreams she's going to figure me out. I just need to get through Celestia's morning duties well enough that I don't cause a disaster, then I can head to the royal library and try to find a way to fix this....

Spike or her friends could be in danger. Though maybe it was simply laying inert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould she really take that risk? If there was an imposter running loose in her body then she had to stop her! Then again, what if Twilight wasn\u2019t the only who had swapped bodies? She hadn\u2019t noticed any pony else acting odd, but she had been on her own much of the day.  It was worth a check. She checked with her royal guard, one of the ones who would watch over Celestia during appointments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh Princess, feeling any better?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little.\u201d Twilight smiled weakly. \u201cHas any ponyelse\u2026 not being feeling themselves?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean, your majesty?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know..  reporting that they might be under any strange magical effects.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard looked confused then shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, your majesty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNevermind.

I should head to Ponyville and check it out\u2026 but what if Canterlot needs me? But if Celestia is missing and an imposter is in my body then I need to deal with that right now!

The walls were adorned with pink and her bed was larger and softer. Next to her was\u2026. Shining Armour?! Twilight yelped jumped out of the bed. Why was he here and in the same bed?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer wings rose up in alarm, and that\u2019s when she noticed.. these weren\u2019t her wings! And her coat. Why was it pink?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sleep haze passed and the obvious hit her. She had somehow switched bodies with Princess Cadance! But how? Twilight didn\u2019t remember casting a spell like this. Then again she couldn\u2019t seem to remember last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining Armour rolled over, his eyes open. Twilight realised she must have woken him. He smiled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s with the noise sweetie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh\u2026\u201d Not knowing what was going on she wasn\u2019t sure how to explain it. And she certainly didn\u2019t want her brother rubbing yet another magical accident in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey before we get breakfast would you like to-\u201d Shining Armour\u2019s smile widened and his eyes narrowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight shuddered.

NO!</font> <font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">NO!\"</font><br>\r\n</b><br>\r\nShining\u2019s eyes widened and he clearly looked perturbed. Twilight realised her faux pas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry. It\u2019s just uhhhh\u2026.\u201d What was the standard excuse? \u201cI have\u2026 a headache. Yeah.\u201d Twilight clutched her head unconvincingly Sorry I didn\u2019t mean to yell, early morning jitters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Buck. How was she going to explain what happened now? Hmm maybe she wouldn\u2019t have to. If she just played along for a little bit she might be able to fix this without any pony being the wiser. That would be the best for everyone.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh so how about we get some breakfast? Breakfast sounds good, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat look\u2026 he was obviously disappointed and Twilight knew he had  hurt his feelings. How would she smooth this over?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry about before\u2026 I didn\u2019t mean to be rude, I just- I\u2019m not feeling myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, just a little tired. Maybe I\u2019ll feel better after breakfast. Lets go!\u201d Twilight punched her hoof forward and walked ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did I switch bodies with Cadance? I don\u2019t know any magic like that. Could this have been discord? But would he? Hmm maybe this is a dream. She pinched herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn\u2019t a dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she could find a spell to fix this in the Crystal Empire\u2019s library. She always thought more clearly after breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over her shoulder and noticed Shining Armour had barely moved. What was he doing? Wait, did his horn just glow? Why would he be using magic now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining Armour looked her up and down again. Well she wasn\u2019t a changeling\u2026 unless they had figured out a way to beat the detection spell. She was definitely acting oddly. Was she mad at him?  Had something happened? Maybe he could figure it out.</span></div></div>",

For the first time in a long time, everything was perfect. With the absence of trouble in the last few days, she was able to dust, wax, alphabatize the books, dust again, reorganize the books by color, and send fifteen letters to Celestia about her learning about alicorn magic...... and that was just today. \"Today is a rare day Twiley.\" she told herself \"Everything is in perfect order for the first time in forever! It's time to reward yourself.\" Twilight walked over to the cupboard and looked behind the frame of her and Celestia. It sat there, perfectly ripened and waiting for her mouth. Twilight grabbed the peach, eager to savor it's peachy-perfect taste. All she needed was a good book to curl up with and this day would certainly go down in her mind as the most..........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight stopped at the doorway.......<br>\r\nHer eyes opened wide........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBooks were strewn about everywhere........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDust and dirt coated all the bookcases......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sitting on a throne of torn pages was the culprit as he reached for Twilight's peach......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Twilight!\" Discord said through a mouth of peach, \"Or evening.... I don't care.\" Twilight watched in horror as Discord snapped his fingers, turned his mouth into a slingshot, and fired the peach pit right at a window, shattering it. \"Yes!\" Discord cheered as he fisted the air \"Right where I wanted it! Preatty good aim huh?\" Twilight tried not to say anything for fear of what would come out. \"I just came over here for a visit and found this place soooooo boring. I hope you don't mind my redecorating.\" <br>\r\nAt this, Twilight slowly let it out. \"How many times have I told you to not\" \"CUT!\" Discord said through a megaphone marked 'Director'. \"I know you can show more feeling than that! I just ruined your perfect day! Really let loose your unbrideled fury!\" Twilight simply pointed to the door \"Get out before I do.\" Discord facepalmed himself, \"Thats your problem! You just never let loose enough to cause any damage, at least not that I've seen. You need to have a little more chaotic personality like mine....... tell you what I'll do.\" Before he said another word, Discord sucked in air as a strange mist flowed from Twilight. Instead of flowing into his mouth, the mist flew into a jar he was holding. He then blew a brown mist that flowed into Twilight's mouth before she could close it. \"I've put your not so chaotic personality in this jar while you have a taste of my own. It might take a bit to work, but you just might like it.\"</span></div></div>",

Twilight Sparkle was in her home at the library, practicing a special spell she had been working with in her room. Suddenly, she saw a flash of green appear out of the corner of her eye from under the door, accompanied by a fiery sounding belch, and she recognized what it was instantly. Spike, her baby dragon assistant, had received another letter from Princess Celestia. She stopped her spell and opened the door to let Spike in. He was in the process of looking over the letter as Twilight walked over to join him. She looked over his shoulder at the letter. She felt this was unusual, since Princess Celestia never sent a letter to her out of the blue like this unless it was an emergency or something important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it say?\" Twilight asked her young assistant, \"I hope it's not bad news.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't seem like it, \" said Spike, as he read the letter out loud:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><div align=\"center\">\"Dear Twilight Sparkle,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo not worry. I have written to you because I would like for you to visit me at Canterlot. It's been a while since you have been here last, and I would like to catch up on old times and discuss what all you've been learning about magic and friendship. Perhaps you could show me that spell you were working on that you told me about in that letter you sent with your latest friendship report. I hope you will stop by soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay the sun's blessing be with you, my faithful student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSincerely,<br>\r\nPrincess Celestia\"</div></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight let out a sigh of relief. \"Whew! I'm glad it's nothing major to worry about. Besides, I can't wait to show her what I've been working on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That reminds me,\" said Spike, \"What WAS that spell you were working with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess it's no use hiding it from you, my number one assistant,\" Twilight responded, \"The spell I'm working with is able to...\"</span></div></div>",

I honestly can't help but wonder what Celestia was like when she was very little, so maybe I could be allowed to try it out on her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does sound interesting. I kind of want to see it for myself,\" Spike said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you would, Spike,\" said Twilight to her young assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA FEW DAYS LATER...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter traveling up to Canterlot and getting permission from the guards, Twilight made her way to Celestia's chambers. When she met up with the princess, they began to discus various matters, like some of Twilight's adventures that she didn't usually mention in her friendship reports, as well as some of what Celestia's royal duties had in store for her. Eventually, they got around to spells and magic that Twilight had been working with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, would you care to show me the new spell you have been working with?\" Celestia asked her student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, that one. Before I do that, though, may I ask you something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever missed being little?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, the princess thought it over. Come to think of it, she had been thinking about her fillyhood a lot lately ever since she reunited with her sister Luna. She remembered playing with her little sister in the days before they both had to take responsibility for controlling the sun and the moon, and she had missed such carefree times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess, somewhat. Why do you ask, my faithful student?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because this new spell has the ability to alter age. I used some test subjects before I got here and the results were, needless to say, rather successful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack and Big Macintosh could hardly believe what they saw. What was once their Granny Smith was now a cheerful and energetic young filly with a light caramel brown mane hopping around what was once their little sister Apple Bloom, now an elderly mare with a faded red mane, a bow in her hair, and, much to the former filly's dismay, a blank flank. And no one seemed to know what happened to them. After watching this scene, Applejack and Big Macintosh turned to look at each other, both of them still in shock. \"Big Mac?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want ya ta hit me right 'n th' face, as hard as ya can. No buckin', though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word, Big Mac slowly raised his front hoof in preparation for the strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's good to know. I suppose you could try it on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You used to use me as a test subject for a few of your spells, you remember that, Twilight. Needless to say, they were all minor spells, but I'm sure I can handle something like this, if I can still get back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, whatever you say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight and Celestia stood up and faced each other. Twilight charged the magical energy in her horn and concentrated on the spell. This will make her younger, thought Twilight, no need for her to be older.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready?\" Celestia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I am,\" said Twilight, before unleashing her magic upon the princess, regressing to the point where she became a...</span></div></div>",

Not only had she forgot to ask how young Celestia wanted to be, but she had concentrated too hard to conjure up the rejuvenating energy, and she feared it would be too much for the princess to handle. What she saw, however, had confirmed that fear. After getting knocked backward by the burst of energy, Celestia began to shrink and progressively descend in age, and it seemed to be out of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess, I'm so sorry! I must have used too much power!\" Twilight said before running up to her. At that point, Celestia had regressed until she was about Twilight's age, but she still had her magnificent multi-colored mane and her crown and jewelry were still managing to hold up a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia calmly spoke, her voice somewhat higher in pitch, \"It's alright, Twilight. It was most likely my fault. I was so excited by this spell that I forgot to tell how young I wanted to be. I'll just have to wait and accept what I become by the time the effects have stopped.\" By that point, she had regressed down to filly age, a little older than the Cutie Mark Crusaders, and her crown and jewelry had fallen off, as she looked up to Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No. NO, PRINCESS CELESTIA! Don't give into this! I know how to fix this. Please, just let me get the spell ready and I'll have you back to normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess said nothing, however, as she was now a baby foal with the inability to speak. Soon, her legs began to shake, and she found it hard to stand. Eventually, she couldn't hold herself up any longer and fell onto her belly. Twilight gasped at this. Usually, pony foals could stand up and walk not very long after birth. When Twilight saw Celestia fall down, she figured she had regressed down to a foal that had only just been born. Fortunately, the effects must have ended, since she had stopped regressing at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight levitated the baby princess into the air with her magic. She held out her hooves and managed to get a hold of Celestia. Twilight stared at Celestia and Celestia stared at her in return, and Twilight couldn't believe all this. Princess Celestia, her teacher, one of the rulers of the land, one of the most powerful magic users, and regent of the sun, was now nothing more than a tiny baby filly not even old enough to walk and currently being held by her student. Twilight brought her closer and hugged Celestia to her chest. She felt the urge to cry about this, but hopefully the spell had ended so that she would be able to try and get her back to normal then. But had the spell's effects finished?</span></div></div>",

The rainbow colored mane she had was shorter and not flowing, her legs were thin and lanky, and her wings and horn were tiny. \"Well,\" sighed Twilight, \"at least it didn't get any worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe set the foal down in front of her, and they both laid there staring at each other. Not too long after that, Celestia decided to stand up. She got up, but felt pretty weak in the legs as they shook and wobbled. She toppled over once onto her backside, but she got up again soon after, and slowly, surely, started to walk her way over to Twilight. In spite of what had occurred, Twilight found this to be adorable. When the baby princess made her way over to Twilight, she reached up as best as she could... and then licked Twilight on the nose. Twilight was startled by this action, but it felt good to her. Celestia backed up a little bit, and Twilight figured she should ask her and see how she reacts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Celestia was looking around the room, Twilight asked, \"Celestia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foal turned towards her direction. Twilight didn't know if it was her responding to her own name, or the fact that someone called to her, but she decided to delve a little further. But she started out lightly by asking, \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia nodded her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank goodness, can you speak?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight could ask about what to do about this, but first she wanted to see if Celestia remembered. So she asked, \"Do you remember who you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia thought it over, and...</span></div></div>",

Celestia just shrugged, but then she saw a little ball on the desk. She walked over and started playing with it.

Suddenly, as she was holding her, the baby princess vanished into thin air. Twilight was immediately alerted at this, and stood up and started to look around the room, when just then, she felt an odd sensation in her stomach. It felt like several extra pounds was added onto her at once, as her legs wobbled and she tried to regain her footing. And as soon as the feeling had started, it stopped, and she was able to stand up well enough. Twilight was beginning to question what happened when she suddenly looked down at herself and got her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly was now large and rounded and she could feel something inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight started to think over how this was possible. Surely it wasn't something she ate. Nothing could have automatically cause her to gain such weight all at once in a short amount of time. Besides, this didn't feel ANYTHING like a full stomach. At that point, she came to a conclusion that, quite frankly, creeped her out: \"I'm pregnant with Princess Celestia,\" Twilight said quietly to herself, with a look of horrific realization on her face. Before she had time to react, however, she suddenly became overwhelmed with fatigue. Quickly, she climbed up onto the princess' bed in order to rest her body. She looked down at her pregnant belly, knowing that one of the regal sisters was lurking in there, now a tiny foal awaiting birth. This is really getting weird, Twilight thought to herself.

A small voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Twilight Sparkle...\"</i> the voice said again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight felt this voice sounded... unique. Beautiful, but unique. It sounded like a filly that was just learning to speak, it was high pitched and youthful, but it also had a mystical aspect to it and it sounded mature and wise beyond its years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Twilight. It's me, Celestia. I'm telepathically communicating with you. I taught you how to do it once. Do you remember how?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yes,\"</i> said Twilight, now communicating telepathically with her teacher. <i>\"You ARE the foal that's inside me, aren't you?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cIndeed, I am,\u201d</i> Celestia responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cBut how are you communicating with me? Shouldn't you have lost your magic when you became a baby again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour regression spell DID take away most of my magic. However, I still have a little bit left, like the ability to communicate with you through telepathy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Princess Celestia, I\u2019m so sorry you had to wind up like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink nothing of it, my faithful student. It\u2019s very nice and comforting to be back in the safety of the womb and curled in a fetal position, although it does feel kind of cramped in here.\u201d</i> Soon afterwards, Twilight felt something against the side of her belly. She looked down and saw that the foal was kicking from inside the womb. She could even see the little hooves of Celestia pushing up against Twilight\u2019s exposed stomach from the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cCelestia, he he he, please stop it,\u201d</i> Twilight said, gently giggling at the unusual feeling of experiencing what an expectant mother feels like before rubbing her hoof against her belly and trying to feel around for the foal that was in there. She could hear giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cHe-he-hey-y-y! C-cut that out! It ti-tickles! He he he he!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m serious, we need to get you out soon and then restore you to normal. I-I\u2019ll even give birth to you, if I have to,\u201d</i> Twilight said, telepathically, although she couldn\u2019t believe she actually thought that last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No need to worry. We can still communicate while I'm in here. In fact, I want to tell a few secrets that I feel you should know, and I figure this is the perfect way, through telepathic secrecy. I've told most of these to no one else but my sister, and some of them SHE doesn't even know about. Since you are my personal student, as well as one of the only true friends I've ever had in a thousand years, I feel that I can share these with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why'd you wait for now to tell me? You could have telepathically communicated with me any time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but I felt like using this opportunity to get really close and personal to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine, but I didn't mean LITERALLY LIKE THIS! Not 'close and personal' as in 'inside my belly, tiny, helpless, and attached to an umbilical cord'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about all that, but try to feel at ease now.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight did so, and laid on her side as she looked over to her belly, which now held one of the princesses inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Twilight, I think it's time that I tell you this...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will one of her secrets be?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But over the years, especially during Luna's absence, I've grown to hate it with a passion, but I've kept my feelings inside me. I hate how everyone kisses up to me, I hate those mindless drones devoid of emotion known as 'guards', but most of all, I HATE how my reputation of being this powerful being that vanquished evil has affected everyone. Every time I want to do a social visit, I'm expected to allow EVERYONE to wait on me. Remember that party at the Cakes when I visited once?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you tricked the Cakes into overfilling your cup when they kept giving you refills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. All the ponies tend to be so overworked about me, thinking I should be treated like a god, but inside, I want to be looked at as being a normal, fun-loving pony who feels that everyone around me should just loosen up. That's why I enjoyed the Grand Galloping Gala that you and your friends attended, because they actually brought some life to that dull affair. But even after I've shown this aspect of me, you still see me as the same old 'Ms. High &amp; Mighty Princess Celestia' that has ruled since before Discord's reign of terror* and my sister becoming Nightmare Moon and all that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, I had not let this hatred consume me until one faithful day, when you were late with the friendship report. I was upset at you, but I was mostly upset with myself. While your obsessive compulsive behavior and your use of that spell were to blame, what was also a factor was the fear that seems to surround me. The fear that, if you didn't do something or did something incorrectly, that you would be punished immensely for it. But what you don't understand is that I'm not like that most of the time. When I heard that you were worried about being sent back to Magic Kindergarden for not turning the report in, that was the straw that broke this pony's back. I had not been showing it, but I have grown to hate myself IMMENSELY for causing others to worry about the 'wrath' that I would bring down upon them. My reputation had gotten too good for me. But I don't have to worry about it now. I'm safe inside you, without any royal duties or meetings or raising the sun or anything to deal with.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Twilight was telepathically listening to her teacher in the womb, she was thinking about how to respond to this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*</i><sub><i>I personally hate how people automatically assume that Discord was the former ruler of Equestria, since the writers had left it incredibly vague as to what they meant when he \"ruled Equestria in a state of unrest and unhappiness\", and he just comes off more as an incredibly powerful trickster and troublemaker rather than a vengeful former ruler. Plus, I can't picture Celestia and Luna as being \"usurpers\" at all, so the idea of him being the legitimate former ruler of Equestria is bullcrap. Personally, I think Celestia and Luna had always ruled, but they weren't able to stop Discord when he invaded Equestria until they had the Elements Of Harmony. Wanna argue with me about it? Here and now is NOT the place.</i></sub></span></div></div>",

Happiness that Celestia cared so much for her subjects. Sadness that Celestia was suffering. Guilt at having caused Celestia suffering. Bewilderment that Celestia hated being a princess. But one emotion became more and more prominent the more she thought about it, and it was that emotion that she gave voice to. <i>\"So, you're just going to run and hide from your duties? I'm disappointed in you, Princess.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She could almost feel Celestia blink inside her. <i>\"Huh?\"</i> the fetal Princess asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"You heard me.

Your disappearance is going to be noticed. You think how people react normally around you is bad? Just picture what people are going to do when they realize you're gone! Think of your sister! Think of the rest of Equestria! Your disappearance is going to cause a panic the likes of which the world's never seen before! And your first reaction to what's happened is, 'I'm glad I can hide away in my student'?! Which, by the way, is very creepy for me.

And what was more, as Celestia thought about it, the younger unicorn was right. She may have hated being a princess, but she was still someone that everypony looked up to. She was an inspiration to the common folk. She had certainly inspired Twilight, if what the unicorn had told her of her Cutie Mark was true. As Celestia thought about this, guilt welled up in her. Here she was, saying how much she hated being a princess, when the rest of Equestria looked to her as a leadership figure. She was needed. That much was plain. <i>\"Twilight...I'm sorry. You're completely right. I've hated my status, but my hatred has blinded me to the good things that I have in life. My sister, my wealth, my looks...and my beloved student. I burdened you with this secret, and you told me what a fool I've been.

I'm a terrible mentor!\"</i> The princess was tearing up from the guilt she felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight's expression softened as she heard the princess's reply, and she nuzzled the bulge in her stomach. <i>\"No, you're not, Princess. You've been a great mentor to me. I just wanted to remind you that as much as you might hate your job, someone has to do it. I'm certainly not capable of lifting the sun into the sky!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia chuckled a little, drying her tears as best she could in the unicorn's womb. <i>\"I should hope not! If you were capable of that, I'd have to keep you here in Canterlot so I could take a vacation now and then!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two laughed at the silliness of the idea, albeit for different reasons: Twilight at the idea of Celestia taking a vacation, Celestia at the idea of keeping Twilight away from her friends.

The sensation of a jumping fetus inside her was...uncomfortable for Twilight, and she very nearly lost her lunch. <i>\"Were we anypony else, we might have used the knowledge of this conversation to cause problems throughout Equestria. Be grateful that we sensed the magic from your de-aging spell, Twilight Sparkle.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"L-Luna?!\"</i> exclaimed Celestia. <i>\"How did you...?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"You are a kind-hearted pony, sister, thus you tend to ignore the darker aspects magic can be used for...such as eavesdropping. Admittedly, it's not as heinous as other things, but magical eavesdropping has been a study of ours. How else are we to ensure your safety if you're alone with some no-name stallion?\"</i> The telepathic voice of Princess Luna held a small degree of mirth at this, while Twilight blushed at the implications. As if some 'no-name stallion' would ever try something with Princess Celestia!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"Um...Princess Luna, how much did you overhear?\"</i> the young unicorn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"Enough to understand that until further notice, our sister will be...incapacitated. However, in the meantime, we will take over affairs here in Canterlot, as well as the rising of the sun.\"</i> Despite the confidence in her words, both Twilight and Celestia could tell there was some nervousness in the younger princess at the concept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"Luna, are you certain? I mean, I only took over the rising of the moon out of necessity.\"</i> Celestia appreciated the offer, deep in her heart, but she was worried that her sister might not be up to the task of raising both heavenly orbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"And you say that it is not a necessity in this case? Unless you plan on being restored later this afternoon, we believe this to be a matter of prudence.\"</i> Twilight idly noted that Luna's tone, while somewhat haughty, was nonetheless better than her visit to Ponyville's Nightmare Night not too long ago. Still there was a small hint of anxiety in the younger princess's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"Princess Luna, forgive me for asking, but...when was the last time you attended a social function here in Canterlot?\"</i> A few moment's silence was all the answer she needed. <i>\"Princess, I've seen you in passing only a few times during my visits here, but even the guards seem nervous around you. Do you really think that you can manage the social affairs here in Canterlot without some assistance?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"Twilight raises a good point, Luna. The nobles won't accept you stepping up to take charge with no explanation, even if you are a princess. You never were the most...sociable of ponies, even before you strayed into darkness. You've been even less so since your return.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two 'heard' Luna sigh. <i>\"We will explain that you are recovering from a misfired spell, that your student is helping in your recovery, and that until you've recovered, we will handle the affairs of Equestria. In the meantime, Twilight Sparkle, you should return to Ponyville, and keep as low a profile as you can. We do not want word of this situation getting out of hand.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight and Celestia considered this. Celestia knew that the nobles wouldn't press the issue too much with such an explanation. After all, Twilight was well-known, having saved Equestria from Discord's influence. The unicorn herself, however, had some misgivings. <i>\"There's no way I'm going to be able to keep this a secret from my friends. And how am I supposed to hide this in town?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"We would hope that someone as powerful in magic as you, Twilight Sparkle, would know a simple glamour spell,\"</i> Luna deadpanned. Twilight face-hoofed at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"Ah, right. Heh. Almost forgot my own talents. This whole situation's really taking it out of me. But that doesn't help in regard to my friends.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"I believe it will be safe to explain the situation to them. They are your fellow Elements of Harmony, after all. If you try to hide something like this from them, they would be most upset when they eventually found out. As you said, you won't be able to keep it a secret from them.\"</i> Celestia was being reassuring, but in truth, she wondered if the other five Elements would truly understand the situation at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Still, it seemed to reassure Twilight. <i>\"Alright, then...I guess we'll leave Canterlot in your hooves, Princess Luna. I'd better get back to Ponyville.\"</i> With that, she focused her magic, casting a glamour on herself to hide her current predicament. She then began making her way through Canterlot back to Ponyville, stopping only to pick up Spike, who she'd dropped off at her old library in Canterlot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Arriving back in Ponyville, Twilight made her way to the library as quickly as she could. She had deflected all of Spike's questions regarding her visit with Celestia, and it was beginning to get tiring. She got to the library and opened the door while declining, yet again, to answer. \"For the last time, Spike, I'd rather not say anything about -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Gotcha!\" said a brash voice that Twilight had enough time to register as Rainbow Dash's when said cyan pegasus fairly dragged her and Spike into the library, slamming the door behind them. Looking around, Twilight noticed all five of her pony friends were present. Rainbow was smirking, for some odd reason. \"So, what's so big that Princess LUNA sent us a message to meet you here, in secret, with nopony else around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For a moment, Twilight stared blankly. Then she sighed. <i>\"Your sister is evil, and I don't mean in the Nightmare Moon way.\"</i> Hearing Celestia's mental giggle, Twilight began speaking out loud. \"Are you asking for the specifics, or why Princess Luna sent it, rather than Princess Celestia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Both,\" came the collective reply, before Applejack added, \"Was a bit of a shock to see a black-sealed letter appear in front of mah face, Twilight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sighing, Twilight debated what the best way to approach this would be...</span></div></div>",

Is Wing Pox generally harmless to fillies and colts, but more dangerous to older mares and stallions?\" Seeing Rainbow nod, Twilight gave a nod of her own. \"In a unicorn my age, Horn Pox can be crippling, possibly even fatal.

Well, your assumption was correct. Ever since Luna came back, I have been thinking a lot about our fillyhood, long before we were given control over Equestria and the sun and the moon, when she and I used to play together, by ourselves and with our own little group of friends. We even went out on adventures and learned about friendship all the time. Whenever I get your friendship reports, I reminisce back to those wonderful times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, but I've always had this desire, especially when Luna was imprisoned those thousand years on the moon. I had awaited her return so when things got to normal, we could find a way to relieve those good old days. Sadly, we're the only ones left among our original group of friends.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to hear that, but how does this involve me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not only have I had fond memories lately, but I've also had dreams about Luna and I being little again, and there's even one where... you are our mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds unusual, but it's true. I did have a dream where you, my faithful student, were our mother. In it, Luna and I were just baby foals, and you would feed us, play with us, read to us, and you would even show us to your friends. I could imagine how each of them reacted to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I had no idea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I personally adored this dream. Perhaps if Luna joined us, then this dream could be reality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate to break this to you, Princess, but there are several factors you don't seem to realize. First and formost, who would rule the land, as well as the sun and the moon, while you two were little? Second, wouldn't this be against Luna's will? Third, I've never had any real experience looking after children, foalsitting or otherwise! Fourth, what about my own studies? It'll be hard when I have two fillies to look after. Fifth, how long do you intend to be in this state? And while I like this idea myself, I just don't know if it'll work out like you think it will.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything went silent, then. Twilight wondered what had happened with Celestia, so she used some see-through magic to see what was going on inside of her, which was what ponies in Equestria used instead of ultrasounds. Inside, Princess Celestia had closed her eyes and she was sucking on her right hoof. She appeared to be asleep, so Twilight turned off the spell and lightly poked at her stomach, as she telepathically heard the youthful-sounding voice of her mentor once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Uh... Wha? Oh, Twilight. Sorry about that. I was deep in thought over what to do about this, and I must have dozed off while doing so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And were you able to think of something?\"</i> Twilight responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was Celestia's response?</span></div></div>",

I mean, most of your magic is gone, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true, but maybe we could activate it through touching both of our horns together and combining our magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? But how will I know when my horn is touching yours? You're still inside of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on,\"</i> said Celestia, telepathically. At that moment, a patch of white light appeared on Twilight's belly, and it seemed to be coming from underneath her skin. <i>\"See that light?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's where my horn is. Touch it with yours, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"</i> said Twilight, telepathically. With a little effort, she was able to lower her horn onto the spot of light. It began to glow as well as she heard Celestia's telepathic voice again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Show us a reality of the dream where the unicorn, Twilight Sparkle, is the mother of Luna and I.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, things began to distort around them as the room turned into a smear of color and stretched out into the distance. Soon Twilight could feel herself being dragged towards it at lightning speed, and in a flash of light, Twilight woke up to find herself in a dark and empty room. She looked down and noticed her belly was now flat. Realizing what happened, Twilight quickly galloped around the room for a bit trying to find where Celestia was, before coming across an unusual sight. It was a white pony fetus, still in the womb, with a pink and green mane and tail and a small horn and wings. It was curled up, its eyes were closed, and it had an umbilical cord attached to it. The womb was floating in the air and glowing, so it created some light in the dark room. The fetus then opened its eyes and looked at Twilight, as the unicorn heard the same telepathic voice speak to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hello, Twilight. You can speak to me regularly here if you like. I myself cannot talk normally however, due to my motor functions not being developed enough yet, so I'll have to keep speaking to you like this.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.\" said Twilight. Not that she didn't like speaking telepathically, but it was kind of wearing on her. \"Is this you, Celestia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yes, it is.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you're so tiny.\" As Twilight quietly said this, she used her magic to bring the prenatal princess closer to her. She sat down and put her hooves around the floating fetus, as she stared in awe at it. She gently poked at Celestia's belly, and giggled as she saw her react a little bit to the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Just be careful with me now.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" said Twilight, and she looked across the room, \"but where are we? Aren't we supposed to be in an alternate reality?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"We are, but we're not in the actual reality itself. As I mentioned, we'll be observing it through a window that shows this new reality as it is happening.\"</i> As Celestia spoke this, a square, white area opened up nearby. It was incredibly bright, but an image was forming within. Twilight galloped over to this window and Celestia floated over by her, as they both looked into the window to see this new reality that had been formed from Celestia's dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do they see?</span></div></div>",

There were 2 adult pony doctors at Twilight's side preparing her for the delivery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is very shocking,\" said Twilight, \"and it does look like it would hurt.\" As she looked back and forth to her birth-giving self in the window and to the unborn royal fetus of Princess Celestia next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Celestia telepathically replied, \"<i>Relax, my faithful student. This is a natural procedure all mother ponies go through. It is a scene known as the Miracle of Birth.</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do notice how it is a sight to see, but how can I handle this myself?\" asked Twilight, with a surprised and worried tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both stopped and watched as they saw the birth-giving Twilight scream when the first princess foal began to come outside the womb. \"Calm down, Miss Twilight, the first baby foal is just making its way out,\" said the first doctor holding the horn of the emerging infant. The head started to emerge, and with one final push, out she came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the foal Celestia had been born, she began to cry. The second doctor cut the umbillical cord, and the first doctor gave the baby foal to the still birth-giving Twilight, placing Celestia right next to her. Celestia's crying stopped when she felt Twilight's warmth. \"It's a filly,\" the first doctor announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Twilights were at awe when the new born Celestia began to suck her right hoof. The Twilight in the window began to gently lick her new foal, as a way of affection. \"Miss Twilight, are you ready for the next child?\" asked the first doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am ready,\" replied Twilight, preparing to give birth to the second child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the second foal known as Luna began to emerge, the observing Princess Celestia and Twilight were in awe at the baby foal Celestia with her eyes still closed and her mouth sucking on her little hoof. The fetal Celestia began to say telepathically, \"<i>This is a magical moment indeed. I've never personally got much of a chance to see this for myself in over one thousand years!</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I notice why mothers are always so happy to see their newborns even if there is more than one,\" said Twilight, looking back and forth at the fetal princess next to her and the newly born princess in the dream world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Princess Celestia and Twilight stared as the second foal began to escape the womb of the other Twilight. While the first doctor got the second foal out, the second one cut the umbillical cord, and once that was over, they placed her by her sister. \"They're fraternal twin fillies,\" the first doctor told Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked down at the new born foals with tears in her eyes, \"They're so beautiful...\" Even though she was worn out from this procedure, she nuzzled both Celestia and Luna as they were lying by her side. The two newborn sisters began to snuggle up against Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>This is the most beautiful sight to all ponies when a newly born foal is brought into this world,</i>\" said Celestia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what is going to happen now that the babies have been born?\" asked Twilight<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>The miracle of parenthood, my young student. This is known as raising your child,</i>\" replied Princess Celestia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will hapen next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide on the next chapter...</span></div></div>",

They were able to stand not too terribly long after their birth, and they managed to take their first few wobbly steps then as well, but most of the time, they sat with their mother. Twilight had decided to name them Celestia and Luna, since she noticed their coat colorings had a day and night theme to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, Twilight had recovered enough from the labor and was allowed to leave the hospital with her new babies. Carrying Celestia and Luna in two special foal-carrying saddlebags, she got home, only to be greeted with a Pinkie Pie-sized surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SURPRISE!\" shouted Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, Rarity, Applejack, and Spike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noise startled both foals, and they began to cry. \"Oh no!\" said Twilight, trying to get the foals to calm down. When the two tiny fillies had stopped crying and were more relaxed, Twilight turned towards her friends and said, \"Everyone, I thank you for throwing me and my new babies a party, but you need to keep quiet. Remember, they were just born today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... um, we're sorry Twilight, but Pinkie Pie just wanted to make a good first impression,\" said Fluttershy, looking at the foals, who were shaken but feeling better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, everyone. You didnt mean to,\" said Twilight, as she took Celestia and Luna out of the sattlebags and placed them on the floor. \"And while you're all here, anyone wanna see them? Just be gentle, though, they are quite precious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOH OOH ME FIRST PLEASE! \"said Rainbow Dash, with puppy dog eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight sighed, \"Fine. Just be gentle.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rainbow Dash picked up Luna, the baby foal began to gurgle and drool a little, which looked so adorable to Rainbow Dash. Luna then began to giggle at Rainbow Dash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to be uncharacteristically enjoying this,\" Twilight said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, can't I have a soft spot for little foals and fillies?\" Rainbow Dash asked in response, \"I personally have always wanted to be an older sister, but my mom said that I wouldn't be a very good role model, for some reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Fluttershy was holding Celestia gently. Usually, she was shy around other ponies outside of close friends, but she seemed to have a soft spot for children, especially foals. Celestia began nuzzling up against Fluttershy's chest and sucking on her hoof as Fluttershy stroked her fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach one of them got turns at holding both of Twilight's new foals. As they were about to leave Twilight in peace with Spike, Celestia and Luna, Twilight told them they would be welcome to see them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two observers, Twilight and Fetal Celestia watched, they began to talk to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been thinking about this world,\" Twilight said, \"Like, if you two are now babies, who's ruling Equestria, and how did I wind up getting pregnant with you two? This is an alternate reality, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>It is, indeed, Twilight, but I'm sure we'll get some answers in due time,</i>\" said Celesta, telepathically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so what next?</span></div></div>",

By the end of the day, you will rule the kingdom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now there's a bad idea.\" Twilight muttered. \"Hush now Twilight.\" Celestia said to her. \"You'll do fine. Besides, all you truly need to do is lower and raise the sun and moon. Much of the ruling is done by the various ministers, you know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sister is right.\" Luna said. \"We will attempt to teach you as much as we can before we are reborn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill spread across Twilight. \"What will happen to you? When you're born again? Will you still be you? Or will you be foals in everything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only one way to find out.\" Luna said boldly before shedding her royal garments, throwing her crown and halter onto Celestia's bed. She kicked off her custom horseshoes  and approached Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then... let's get started then.\" Twilight said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer horn began to glow as she repeated the process that had got her into this situation. Again she placed a large amount of magic into the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a step back as Luna began to shrink, her mane lost its ethereal glow and became solid once more. Years melted away like ice on a hot summer day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Luna was the size of the CMC and then even smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crashed to the ground, her legs no longer strong enough to hold her. Twilight levitated Luna towards her and held her closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach began to expand even more than it already had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut so did she. Her legs became longer and her torso wider. Her face formed into a much sharper muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now she looked like princess Celestia had looked, only with purple coat and a mane that shimmered like earliest twilight. Only one thing was missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo wings erupted from her back, drops of blood dripping off of them. Strangely, they did not hurt in the slightest. Twilight gave them an experimental flutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it work?\" She asked out loud. \"I think so.\" Celestia said. \"It's a lot more crowded in here now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move over.\" Luna said through telepathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so tired all of a sudden.\" Twilight muttered. \"I'm going to lay down for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crashed rather unceremoniously onto Celestia's bed. A hoof strayed to her swollen stomach, feeling the light kicks of two Alicorn fillies, her daughters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, she fell asleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she thought about all this, she was getting really angry at Celestia for keeping this all from her. She didn't have to worry about talking back to her with any major consequences, now that Celestia was inside of Twilight and mostly powerless at this point, so she glared down at her belly. Celestia was inside and couldn't see it, bur she could feel the anger and the feeling of betrayal from her dear student and daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So you wouldn't consider me in the royal family just because I wasn't an alicorn? And then you gave me away to two random ponies that I THOUGHT were my parents? You just threw me out like I was GARBAGE?!!? You rejected me?!!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Twilight, that's not what I m-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I TRUSTED YOU, you miserable, insignificant foal! I HAD FAITH IN YOU! You taught me all about magic and about life and other things, and yet you didn't even have the guts to tell me THE TRUTH ABOUT WHO I AM?!!? Why did you never tell me this? Why did you lie to me?\"</i> Tears were streaming down Twilight's face, and she was clearly furious. From inside, Celestia was deeply hurt by this response from Twilight, and a few tears started to fill her eyes. She sniffled as she tried to communicate with her angry young mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Please, Twilight, if you'd just let me expla-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I HATE YOU!!! WHEN THIS IS THROUGH, I DON'T EVER WANT TO SEE OR HEAR FROM YOU AGAIN, YOU... YOU JERK!!!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was silent after that. And then, Twilight heard something. It sounded like crying, and it was. She heard Celestia crying, not like a normal baby, but quietly sobbing, and it was the most pitiful, heartbreaking sound she had ever heard. She had been angry up to then, but as she listened to this beautiful voice of the princess, her mother weeping, her anger subsided. It was now replaced with sadness and guilt, and she could feel tears welling up as she realized what she just did to her. It wasn't long before she broke down and began sobbing herself. She leaned forward and tried her best to hug onto her belly, and hopefully Celestia as well. Inside, Celestia was trying her best to hug at Twilight as she could feel her up against the uterus wall. Eventually, through sheer coincidence and luck, they managed to grab each other in a hug, in spite of the uterus that separated them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Mother! Mother, I'm sorry for getting angry at you and saying I hated you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm sorry for keeping all this from you in the first place!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they held onto each other as best as they could through a womb, Twilight thought about her teacher, and suddenly everything seemed to make sense as to why she would have been Twilight's mother. Not only from her high magic power, but also for the fact that all her life, Celestia treated her not only as a student, but as a mother as well. Soon, both Twilight and Celestia began thinking about memories of when they were together while they held each other at the same time. The silence was broken when Twilight heard Celestia telepathically say, <i>\"Twilight, I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I love you too, Mother...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they let go of each other and Twilight resumed her relaxed position. Celestia again broke the silence. <i>\"So, would you like to learn more about this?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight said...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I enjoyed playing with Luna, but sometimes I'd be called away on 'royal business', even when I was young. So, I came up with somepony to keep me entertained while I was seperated from her. Discord actually started out in my mind as an alicorn colt named Terra, as in earth. That's why he has a brown coat.\"</i> Celestia's mental voice had acquired a wistful tone as she thought about those lost days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Despite herself, Twilight smiled. <i>\"Well, we all had imaginary friends at some point, Princess. Hay, I used to have a pegasus friend named Surprise, to cheer me up when I got down in the dumps. Though, I sort of forgot about her after I became your student.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia chuckled. <i>\"Yes, well, as the years wore on, I entered my teenage years, and I was... well, pardon my language, but I was a bit of a slut. I flirted with every stallion I saw, and even a few mares. It got to the point where my parents confined me to my room to keep 'Molestia' from doing anything unbecoming of a princess.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight blushed. <i>\"You were seriously that flirtacious as a teenager?

There was a burst of magic, and when my vision cleared, I saw Terra in front of me, just as I pictured him. And oh, he was gorgeous!

I'm not sure. It's been a while. At any rate, since a strange pony appearing in the bedchambers of a princess would raise a lot of suspicion, he hid whenever somepony else came, or when I left. And for a while, it looked pretty good. We were steadily growing closer. Until that one event that doomed our relationship.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight was enthralled by the story. <i>\"What happened?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia sighed. <i>\"We'd gotten lax in our precautions regarding others coming to my room.

And Luna has always been a bit... loud.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"Oh, dear...\"</i> Twilight murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"Yes. My mother and father came running when she started shrieking, and Terra was summarily ejected from the castle. The only reason he wasn't thrown in the dungeon was because I pleaded with my parents for mercy on his behalf. Still, after he was gone, I realized I couldn't remember any of the details I'd used to think him up in the first place. It was as though once he became real, I'd forgotten how he came to be. That was probably the biggest sulking phase of my life.\"</i> Celestia sounded bitter. <i>\"Initially, I blamed Luna for disturbing us, but I realized later that it would have happened eventually.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight nodded. <i>\"So you lost your imaginary friend turned real. When did he become Discord?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia's voice grew somber. <i>\"I heard nothing of Terra for ten years. Not once did he try to reach me. Not once did he write to me. I was crushed during the first year, but with Luna's help, I began to move on. Then, ten years after he left my life, cotton candy clouds began popping up around the world.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"Sounds familiar,\"</i> deadpanned Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"Indeed,\"</i> agreed the princess. <i>\"Since Luna and I could manipulate the weather, we decided to lead a team of pegasi to investigate. Soon, though, we spotted other signs of chaos. Animals being altered, buildings turned into plywood cutouts...We eventually zeroed in on the source, and found a patchwork beast calling itself Discord. We attempted to reason with him, to get him to stop, but he told me that I couldn't sway his heart like I used to. It was then that I recognized his voice. Terra's loneliness and jealousy twisted him into becoming Discord. So, you see Twilight, I was at least partially responsible for one of the greatest threats to Equestria. I've never truly forgiven myself for it.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight was silent as she thought about what her mentor had told her.

It took a bit of effort not to do so physically as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"Well, 'siblings' may be slightly inaccurate.

I suppose the easiest way to explain it is that... well, there's a very good reason the six of you can bear the Elements of Harmony,\"</i> Celestia elaborated. <i>\"All of you are actually the living embodiments of the Elements themselves. The Elements were the ones who... impregnated your respective mothers, under the cover of each of your fathers. You were all connected before any of you were even born.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight reeled. This was... mind-blowing, to say the least. And yet... hadn't she felt it, that first night? That tingling sense of familiarity, the closeness that only family could normally provide? Twilight hadn't given it much thought afterwards, considering what had happened, but now she recalled that warmth that had flowed through her. <i>\"Siblings...\"</i> she murmured. <i>\"All of my friends... are actually my siblings?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"Not in the traditional sense. But yes, you are all related, thanks to the Elements.\"</i> Celestia gave off a feeling of sadness. <i>\"I'm sorry I never told you. I wasn't even sure myself what had happened until after you brought Luna back. When I studied those necklaces and the tiara, I realized that they were mere foci for the powers that lay dormant within you.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"So... what exactly does it mean to be a living embodiment of an Element?\"</i> Twilight asked, her shock fading into curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"It varies depending on the Element in question. You, Twilight, are the embodiment of Magic, and thus are adept at any spell, no matter how obscure or esoteric. In addition, your magical reserves will grow at an exponential rate as you grow older. Why, when you get old enough, you may well outstrip me in terms of raw power!\"</i> Celestia chuckled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight, on the other hoof, was blushing furiously. <i>\"But... but your the Princess of the Sun!

To be an embodiment of an Element of Harmony means you are not as restricted by mortal chains as other ponies. Neither you nor your friends will die of old age, or indeed of any natural cause. And if, Lauren forbid, you are slain by something, you will return, given enough time. In essence, the six of you are as immortal as my sister and myself.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight had thought she was shocked before. She was absolutely floored, now. Immortal? Her? And all of her friends, too? And... <i>\"Who's Lauren?\"</i> A part of her mind face-hoofed at the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"My mother,\"</i> Celestia replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight blinked repeatedly. <i>\"I... I don't think I've ever read about your mother, Princess.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"You wouldn't have,\"</i> Celestia replied. <i>\"Lauren Faust, aside from giving birth to Luna and myself, never did anything noteworthy in her time... officially. She erased all traces of herself from the Archives when she left this world.\"</i> Celestia sighed. <i>\"We're getting off topic. How do you feel about being immortal, Twilight?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight hesitated. How did she feel?</span></div></div>",

That is to say, you and your friends.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"So, we're not really one pony, we just each carry a fragment of a single pony within us,\"</i> Twilight mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"Yes, that's a more reasonable way to look at it,\"</i> agreed Celestia. <i>\"My earlier word choice was a bit off, I suppose.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"So, the fact that we each carry a fragment of Millennia is what allows us to use the Elements of Harmony so effectively, right? I mean, we carry fragments of her spirit, and the Elements are fragments of her power, right?\"</i> Twilight sounded enthusiastic about solving a puzzle that had bothered her for some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"Yes, exactly. But I admit, Twilight, there's a bit of risk involved in using the Elements.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight blinked. <i>\"What do you mean? What risk?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"The more often you use the Elements of Harmony, the more likely it is that memories of Millennia's will begin to surface in each of you. When her power and her spirit are reunited in their entirety, some side effects are expected.\"</i> Celestia paused to let Twilight absorb the information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight's eyes widened as she remembered something. <i>\"Wait! On our way to retrieve the Elements the first time, Rarity gave up part of her tail to replace a sea serpent's moustache! But when we used the Elements, her tail was restored!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia nodded. <i>\"Millennia was often hailed as a great healer. But she never truly healed anypony. Rather, she turned back time just a little bit in a small area to completely remove injuries. It was sort of cheating the 'past written in stone' concept we discussed earlier. She never did anything too drastic, however.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight nodded, then cocked her head. <i>\"But what exactly is the risk with using the Elements too often?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia sighed. <i>\"The more often the Elements are used, as I said before, the more likely Millennia's memories will surface. Use them too often, and... well, simply put, the confusion of your memories will drive each of you insane.\"</i></span></div></div>",

She had kept silent about her true motives behind developing the spell, however. <i>Maybe with this spell, I can be with her...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Twilight arrived at Canterlot, her first stop was her old library. She dropped Spike off there, and asked him to take a few books from here that the Ponyville library didn't have. In the meantime, she set off to find Princess Celestia. It didn't take her too long; the princess was currently relaxing in her bedchambers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah, Twilight! I'm glad you made it,\" Celestia said, rising to her forehooves from the cushion she'd been lying down on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm always ready to answer a summons, Princess,\" Twilight replied with a bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The alicorn chuckled. \"Twilight, there's no need to be so formal. Here, in this room, it's just you and me. We can speak freely about anything you wish to speak about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight managed to hide a blush at what she'd REALLY like to talk about, and coughed. \"Well, in your letter, you said you were interested in the spell I was developing, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Indeed, although you still haven't told me what it does,\" Celestia replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, it's...for lack of a better phrase, it's a gender-swapping spell. I can use it to change somepony from one gender to the other and back,\" Twilight explained. \"I've already tested it out, and it seems to work rather well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia's eyebrows rose clear up to the forelock of her mane. \"I see...and have you thought about the possible long-term consequences for keeping somepony as the other gender?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight nodded. \"I thought about the hormone imbalance that could result, so I came up with a solution. The spell not only changes the body, but the hormones currently in the body as well. Estrogen becomes testosterone, and vice versa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hm...it sounds like you've put some thought into this, my faithful student,\" Celestia mused. \"But why so much work on this one spell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, like I told Spike, I designed it for same-gender couples who want a kid, but don't want to adopt,\" Twilight explained. \"It's easily reversible, too. Though, I haven't learned what would happen if I used it on somepony who was pregnant. And I don't think I'd care to find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nor would I,\" Celestia agreed with a shiver. Then her features smoothed into a mask of perfect neutrality. \"Are you sure this has nothing to do with your crush on me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight's brain shut down at that, as she stared wide-eyed and open-mouthed at her mentor. Her jaw worked, but nothing came out. Inwardly, her thoughts were going a mile a minute. <i>Ohmigoshohmigoshohmigosh she knows I'm so stupid of course she knows she knows everything but why didn't she say anything -</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Seeing her student's dumbfounded expression, Celestia smiled. \"I've known for some time what your true feelings for me were. I never confronted you about them because, well, I was honestly flattered. Hardly anypony is brave enough to talk to me face to face, let alone wear their heart in the open around me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight blinked, and her jaw closed. \"You mean...you're not upset?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Twilight, why would I be upset?\" the alicorn asked, reaching over to draw Twilight into a hug. \"Like I said, I find it flattering that I can still draw romantic interest from somepony...even if said pony is my student.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight melted into the hug, and eagerly returned it. \"Well...in that case, you found me out, Princess. I did develop this spell for the two of us. It sounds a bit presumptuous, but...well, I've been head-over-hooves for you almost since becoming your student. I just...had this feeling, deep in my heart, that we would be together one day.\" She looked up into Celestia's eyes, which were...</span></div></div>",

When she snapped back into reality Celestia had a sly smile on her face. \"Twilight, don't you think it might be time to use your new spell on somepony? I have one pony in mind you know.\" Twilight was still in a slight daze but she caught on to what her teacher was implying. She looked up at the goddess princess. Though Twilight and her mentor have done 'things' before she has fantasized often about if the princess was a prince. Her mind trailed, and for once she thought of what it would be like if she was the dominate one, if she was a stallion.

And I'm quite anxious to find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight nodded, and stepped back. \"You might want to shield your eyes, Princess. This spell is kinda bright when I cast it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia smirked. \"Brighter than the sun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight blushed. \"Oh, right! Hehe...\" She closed her eyes, and let her magic begin to flow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia watched intently as the magic wrapped around her student, sort of like a cocoon. She was reminded briefly of the spell that had gifted Rarity with a pair of gossamer wings. Wings that had burned off when she'd flown too high. Still, that spell didn't take this long to cast. Celestia maintained her vigil, even though her student was completely obscured by her own magic. Suddenly, there was a brilliant flash of light, bright enough that the Princess was forced to close her eyes briefly. When she opened them again, she gasped at what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight had never been the best-looking unicorn mare. Oh, certainly, she was attractive, but in a bookish sort of way. She wasn't in the same league as Rarity or Sapphire Shores. But the unicorn stallion standing where Twilight had been was an absolutely perfect specimen. Broad shoulders were supported by lean, yet muscular legs. The mane and tail were shorter than they had been, yet no less out-of-place. He had grown in height a little, and his horn had lengthened. And his flanks! Celestia actually had to stop herself from drooling. His flanks were absolutely perfect! And the starburst cutie mark looked <i>very</i> tempting, placed on such firm cheeks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The stallion shook his head. \"Phew... I should have done a self-test a while ago. That was certainly different.\" He blinked, and coughed. \"And my voice has changed, too.\" Indeed it had. It had gone from the cheerful contralto to a soothing baritone. He smiled. \"Well, it seems to have worked.\" Looking up, he saw the Princess's eyes had glazed over slightly. \"Um, Princess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shaking herself, Celestia recovered her senses. \"Most impressive, my faithful student.\" She stood up, and motioned for him to follow. She led him to her bedchambers, and closed the door behind him. \"Now then, let me personally inspect the results...\"</span></div></div>",

Her tail knocked over a bookshel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didnt think i'd turn into a full sized dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight concentrated trying to make the spell stop, but either her magic wasn't working, or it wasn't smethin that ocudl be stopped when it got goign. Could she still use unicorn magic as a dragon? She didn't have time to worry about that, her body pushed agisnt the wall of the libary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike gawked at this but backed away, not doing what to do, but not wanting to be crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight? What should I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run! Get of the library while you still can!\" Spike did so, despite how strange his pony legs felt to him, he was surprised at how fast he could gallop. He turned to look behind, only to hear a crash as Twilight's head burst out of the library. She looked downa t the wreckage and looked like she might cry.<br>\r\n\"What am I going to do? I destroy the library! And all those books!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike nudged her, though Twilight had always been prone to getting lost in her own worries, and with her size and thick scales it was harder to get her to next. Spike tapped her several times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Twilight. Twilight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still lost in her own misery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how many bits this will cost...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreams filled the air, snapping Twilight back to reality. The sight of an enormous dragon bursting out of Ponyville library elected screas of terror. They clearly didn't reconise her, and presumbly thought she had attacked the library. She wanted to scream but she tried her hardest to reamain calm, looking down a the fleeing ponies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wait! I'm not going to-\" SHe was cut off as she let out a stream of fire., causing the ponies to scatter further \"Oh crap!\" She put a claw to her mouth. \"How did I do that? I really hope I can undo this spell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stamped out the small fire she created with her feet and concentrated again, trying to undo the spell. Nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight we should get out of here, they think you're attacking Ponyville.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was breathing heavily, but she tried to slow it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right.\" She thought about trying to teleport, but wasn't sure how her magic would work in this body. And if it went wrong, she could cause destruction oor land on a pony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked away from the library, as fast as she could walk with her strange body, while still watching her surrondings. At her size Spike still had to run to keep up with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I can send a letter to Celesti- Oh wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I have no idea how, if I even could. I have to get myself away from here then try to fix this spell again and if that doesn't work.. if that doesn't work-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep it together Twilight!

If any pony knows what I've turned into, it'll be Fluttershy.\" Twilight stated, feeling certain they would have this solved in no time. However, her attention was drawn to Spike as he started coughing.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You on the other hand should probably pay a visit to the clinic.\" She commented, concerned for her faithful assistant. He was usually immune to almost everything, being a dragon and all, So any cold should be taken seriously. Quietly nodding, he went uostairs to get his boots and scarf, as twilight headed over to her closet to get her own.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Puting winter clothing on with paw-like hands instead of magic was surprisingly easy, getting said clothes to fit correctly on a body that was a different shape however, was not. by the time she had managed to get dressed, get out the door, and tromp through the snow to Fluttershy's, it was past noon, and spike was long gone. It was convenient that it was the middle of winter, any other time of year, and Fluttershy's cottage would be full of animals. But, as it was, the only ones who hadn't either migrated, or gone into hibernation were her chickens, and Angel.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Knocking on the door, all twilight got in response was a muffled 'meep!' and barely audible call of 'be right there!'. It was a good three or four minutes before the door opened, and then only enough for her to peek out and squeak a shy \"hello?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hi fluttershy, I kind of need your help...\" was all Twilight got out before before, the door swung wide open, and Fluttershy lit up with a grin so wide Twilight could swear she heard a strange squeak sound when she made it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh my, I've never met a hedgehog so big before! and you talk, that's just amazing.\" It was like introducing her to spike all over again... \"Please come in!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before she even knew what was going on, she was sitting on Fluttershy's couch drinking tea and listening to how she was the first animal to come visit since winter started. Also, she seemed to have picked up the strangest little cough in the time it had taken to prepare the tea.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um, Fluttershy... I'm not a wild animal, it's me. Twilight. I was hoping you could help me find out what's going on.\" Twilight explained, slowly.

But that wasn't what held her attention, No, her attention was focused more on the fact that, while remaining on all fours unlike Twilight, Fluttershy had began to glow. By the time she had Stopped squeaking, not only had the glow disapeared, but so had the cough, and fluttershy with it. In her place was an alarmingly large yellow and orange wolf. The only familiar feature, her soft blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fluttershy?\" Twilight asked cautiously.<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" the wolf answered.<br>\r\n\"I just realized, whatever this is, it's contagious...

A trip to the Ponyville Hospital couldn't hurt, could it? After all, Twilight had said to go to the doctors before she left, and that was the whole reason he'd dug out his boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were interrupted though when he heard a thud behind him. Turning around, distracted, he didn't see the oversized yellow wolf sprint by heading for the hospital with something riding on it's back, he was too busy gawking at the Gryphon lying in a heap at the base of Owlowiscious now broken perch, the severed top still grasped in in his right talon. If that wasn't enough of a giveaway as to who the newly transformed gryphon's was, the barn owl-like beak and face were kind of a giveaway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrotting over and looking somewhat concerned, spike knelt down and asked. <br>\r\n\"Are you ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, landed on my right talon... Hard... Ow...\" That caught spike off guard, as he hadn't been aware of the transformation's mind affecting properties, and wasn't used to Owlowiscious actually talking. But that didn't matter right now. His friend was hurt. Had he actually been paying attention to anything besides the former owl, he might have noticed the fact that his entire body felt soft and fuzzy compared to normal, the extra weight on either side of his back, or maybe the gray hooves sticking out from under the dark purple fur on his legs. But, he didn't and Owlowiscious simply assumed he was a ponyville resident he hadn't met yet. After all, he rarely left the library during the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting Owlowiscious onto his back, he trotted out the door, spread his wings and took to the air heading for the hospital. He was almost a hundred feet into the air before re realized what he was doing and looked back. Purple feathered wings and a messy green horsehair tail just barely visible around the injured Gryphon greeted his sight. He was a pegasus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistracted by this realization Spike flew straight into the snowbank next to the door rather than landing in front of the hospital. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning as he pulled himself out, Owlowiscious electing to pack a bunch of snow around his hurt arm before doing the same, a familiar voice from behind them asked if they were alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, it's...</span></div></div>",

But I'll make certain that your life is little better than a day in Tartarus after this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With that, the Changeling queen withdrew a glowing green powder from nowhere, and sprinkled it over the unicorn. \"By the week's end, everypony you know and love will turn on you.

This will make certain of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Chuckling slightly, Chrysalis departed, sneaking back to her home far across the Equestrian border.</span></div></div>",

You've rarely been wrong in the past, and yet I refused to even consider the possibility that you were telling the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Celestia raised her head again, the ponies were all shocked to see her eyes brimming with tears. \"Can... can you ever forgive me, Twilight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight responded quickly, nuzzling the Princess. \"Of course I can,\" she said. \"You've been there for me ever since that fateful entrance exam.

The sheer intoxicating quality of the love she was getting quickly overrode that, and she continued to hold her teacher. At least, until Rarity coughed. \"Ahem. This is very touching, truly, but we can't exactly let Twilight roam around Canterlot like this, now can we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Breaking the embrace (and the flow of love, much to Twilight's dismay), Celestia nodded. \"You're quite right, Rarity. Given recent circumstances, Twilight's condition would only raise undue suspicion, and maybe even outright hostility.\" She frowned, putting a hoof to her chin. \"Still, while I'd normally insist she stay in Canterlot until I can find a way to reverse this change, I believe that would be counterproductive. I think it would be best if Twilight went with you all back to Ponyville, and conducted research there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And just how is she gonna do that, yer Highness?\" asked Applejack. \"Get back to Ponyville, ah mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia smiled wryly. \"She <i>is</i> a Changeling now, for better or for worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everypony looked at Twilight, who flushed slightly under the attention (or was it a sort of afterglow from absorbing Celestia's love?).

When it cleared, to everypony's shock, there stood a perfect physical copy of Celestia, down to the jewelry. The only difference was that one was staring at the other, who was staring at her hooves. \"Of course, I could be wrong,\" the second Celestia said, in a perfect copy of the Princess's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rainbow Dash began giggling. \"Oh, man.

Whilst her friends were lying down on their respective giant fluffy pillows, Twilight took close looks at her friends from time to time and began to change herself into her friends. Rainbow Dash and Applejack were secretly watching Twilight transform into close replica images of not only but themselves, but replica images of other ponies that they have seen before. Firstly starting off with Princess Luna, then moving onto Princess Cadance, then moving onto her own brother Shining Armor. While deemed impressive, both Applejack and Rainbow Dash grew curious of Twilight's new power and the instances of how and when she would actually use it instead of her actual entertainment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Applejack...\" Rainbow Dash leaned over to Applejack who was resting on her designated pillow, turning her head to face Rainbow Dash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Dash?\" Applejack whispered back to Rainbow Dash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This whole Changling stuff sounds fishy...\" Rainbow Dash whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd ya' mean?\" Applejack raised an eyebrow at her winged friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... she's taking it pretty well that's she's a Changling... and I don't trust Changlings...\" Rainbow Dash whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah' guess we've been on edge a little since th' weddin', but it's Twilight were talkin' about here, we need t'help her.\" Applejack replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if she had to do that love sucking thing on one of us...\" Rainbow Dash said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon now, ah' don't think Twilight would do such a thing.\" Applejack quickly re-assured Rainbow Dash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a loud thumping sound on the roof the V.I.P suite, Fluttershy jumped up in the air and landed back on her pillow scared of what was going on. Rainbow Dash and Applejack quickly got off their pillows and stood on the floor. Twilight slowly turned around and jumped off her pillow in mid-transformation, she had changed herself into a Royal Guard donning golden armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Rarity asked everyone in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno, sounds like it came from th' roof.\" Applejack looked up at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large stallion quickly ran into the V.I.P suite covered in bruises and scratch marks across his face, everyone looked at him and saw the damage done to his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to you?\" Rainbow Dash yelled out to the stallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They looked up &amp; saw the being that made the bone-chilling howl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's body was tall, muscular, and slender-like. It's eyes glowed a bright reddish-orange, as the creatures eyes gave off an angry look to them. Though the creature's  mouth also glowed a reddish-orange , showing off it's sharp teeth, capable of biting through any pony or Changeling. It's arms were both strong &amp; long, as the creature's clawed hand gripped tightly onto the post on the rooftop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight could see that this creature had 3 clawed fingers &amp; a clawed thumb on each hand, indicating it's some sentient type of creature with feral abilities, as the creature's pointed ears showed, confirming it was a wolf-like creature, as it's large lupine tail slowly moved from side to side. But what creeped out Fluttershy, Spike, &amp; maybe Pinkie Pie was that bits of the wolf creature's Arms &amp; legs had these glowing red-orange marks on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it stood up on the rooftop, the moon was full at the time, as it shone behind the wolf creature's body, giving it a very intimidating  look &amp; feel to him, all while showing it's fur color to be a menacing dark grey, as Twilight noticed these metal chains wrapped around his arms, like a dark accessory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrysalis looked at the wolf creature &amp; said, \"Are you friend or foe, beast?\" But just like that, the wolf creature did a powerful jump, as it pounced toward either Twilight or Chrysalis.</span></div></div>",

Anyway, Enjoy!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight!!\" Twilight's friends yelled, as the scary wolf creature landed right where Chrysalis &amp; Twilight where located at. However, both Twilight's friends and Chrysalis's bodyguards weren't sure which Changeling the wolf creature grabbed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, the wolf creature stood up on his hind legs and large wolf paw-like feet, as he towered an intimidating 7 feet tall over the ponies &amp; changeling bodyguards, while he held a Changeling with long blue hair by her throat in the wolf creature's left hand. \"Twilight?\" Spike asked, worried about Twilight if she was alright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, they saw the other Changeling get back up, indicating that Twilight was alright, and the Changeling that the wolf creature held was actually Chrysalis herself, meaning the wolf creature was one of the good guys, even if he looked like he could rip a pony's flesh apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when the Changeling bodyguards then ignored the Mane Six &amp; began to focus their attention on the one being that held their Queen in it's grasp; the wolf creature known as 'Fenrir, The Unbound Wolf'. Fenrir snarled at Chrysalis, as he held the Changeling Queen in his left clawed hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You..will regret your decision, beast.\" Chrysalis growled, as the skin on Fenrir's upper snout crinkled, snarling even louder at the captured Changeling Queen. But then, out of a feral impulse, Fenrir violently bit down on Chrysalis's left front leg, causing the Changeling Queen to scream from the pain Fenrir was inflicting on her, as Fenrir felt bits of Chrysalis's green blood on his canine teeth from biting on her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom hearing their queen's screams of pain, the Changeling bodyguards confirmed that Fenrir was very hostile, as they charged at Fenrir. But then, Fenrir's senses picked up the hollow clopping of the Changeling bodyguards' hooves, so he gave Chrysalis a nasty claw mark scar across her left eye, as Fenrir threw the Changeling Queen at a few of her bodyguards, knocking those few off their hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Fenrir leapt forward at the bodyguards, as his claws tore through the Changeling armor like it was paper. But when one of the bodyguards fired a blast of dark magical energy at Fenrir, but thanks to his inhuman reflexes, Fenrir noticed the bodyguard firing the energy blast, as the large wolf quickly dodged the attack, rushed at the Changeling bodyguard, and grabbed the Changeling with it's teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, even the Mane Six couldn't believe what just happened when they saw him dodged the bodyguard attack. But then, Fenrir bit down hard on the Changeling bodyguard's body, as it's spine cracked &amp; broke from Fenrir biting down hard, breaking the Changeling bodyguard's spine like a twig. However, Fenrir only broke the Changeling's lower back, meaning the changeling bodyguard was still alive but can no longer use his hind legs anymore due to the nerves in his lower body are severed from the rest of his body, surely a fate worse than death for a Changeling, as Fenrir tossed the unconscious Changeling bodyguard aside like a ragdoll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, only a few of the Changeling bodyguards survived, as they called for help from their brethren to distract Fenrir while they got Chrysalis to safety. Fenrir noticed Twilight reuniting with her friends, as the Changeling that was once a unicorn hugged her friends out of worry for them. Fenrir lightened up a bit, as the Unbound Wolf could see that this Changeling known as 'Twilight' wasn't evil like Chrysalis, but something else entirely.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Anyway, enjoy!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as most of the Mane Six hugged one another, Rainbow Dash began to regain consciousness, as she noticed Fenrir, who had some green Changeling blood on his claws. This caused the cyan Pegasus to literally jumped up onto her hooves, as she screamed, \"What the hay is that thing!?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom those words out of Rainbow Dash's mouth, it got both Fenrir's &amp; the Mane Six's attention. Twilight approached the terrified Rainbow Dash, as the former unicorn said, \"Easy there, Rainbow Dash. He's not going to harm us.\" \"Twilight! That..Thing tore those Changelings apart like they were nothing!\" Rainbow Dash yelled, as Twilight the Changeling firmly answered, \"He's not a monster, Dash. He could've killed us, but he didn't.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Rainbow Dash looked up Twilight, then looked at her friends, and realized that neither Twilight or her friends were injured, meaning that Fenrir wasn't an evil creature. \"Yeah, but why didn't he hurt us as well, sugar cube.\" Applejack asked, confused about why Fenrir spared them from ending up the same way as Chrysalis's changeling bodyguards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unexpectedly, the wolf creature known as 'Fenrir', spoke up in a growling feral tone in his voice and said, \"Hate. Bug. Ponies.\" Twilight &amp; her friends all gasped in unison, as they now realized that Fenrir could talk. Sure, it wasn't exactly perfect speech grammar, but it was enough for anyone to understand what he was basically saying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, as random as can be, Pinkie Pie looked at Fenrir and said, \"Wait a sec, Mr. Wolfy here can talk?\" Fenrir calmly nodded yes once, as Twilight understood what Fenrir was talking about as she asked, \"Bug Ponies? Wait, do you mean the Changelings?\" \"You. Say. So.\" Fenrir answered, as Rarity spoke up &amp; said, \"Wait a minute, darling. Twilight herself is a Changeling, but why aren't you attacking her as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Fenrir slowly walked toward Twilight &amp; her friends, as he only stood about 4 feet away from them, looked down at them, and answered, \"She. Smells.....Different.\" But then, both the Mane Six and Fenrir heard the loud shrieking sound of a hundred Changelings charging toward them at an aggressive speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenrir turned around to see a hundred Changelings charging toward him, Twilight, and her friends from a distance. Fenrir knew there was only one thing he could do to them; he had to fight the Changelings directly head-on. \"Ponies. Find. Hiding. Place. Now.\" Fenrir said, as he heard Twilight ask, \"But what about you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I. Fight. Changelings. Someone. Has. To.\" Fenrir sternly answered, but as he was about to charge off into the battle, Twilight stopped him as she asked, \"Wait..Who are you?\" \"I. Am. Fenrir.\" Fenrir replied, as he then sprinted off toward the attacking Changelings on all fours like a wolf. He charged toward the charging Changelings at 100 miles per hour, as both sides closed the distance further &amp; further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, Fenrir rammed into the group of Changelings, as about a dozen of them got knocked off their hollow hooves,and that was when the real battle began. The Changelings quickly turned around and focused their attention on Fenrir, as he clawed at 5 Changelings that charged at him, rendering them unconscious. Then, 10 Changelings lunged at Fenrir, attempting to pin down Fenrir. Unfortunately for them, Fenrir sensed them, as he back-flipped over them, then he quickly attacked the 10 Changelings from behind, slashing his claws at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Fenrir ripped a lamp pole from the ground &amp; used it like a weapon, as he screamed, \"RRROOOOAAAARRR!!!!!\" This caused the remaining Changeling forces(73 Changelings left) to attack Fenrir in all directions, as Fenrir swung his makeshift weapon at them, knocking a lot of them down &amp; delivering serious damage to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, from the Mane Six's perspective, they couldn't tell who was winning due to how much dust was picked up around the battlefield, making it hard to see the fighting between Fenrir &amp; the Changelings. But then, there was silence, there was no sign of life beyond the large dust cloud. But the question for the Mane Six was who won this battle? The Changelings? Or Fenrir?</span></div></div>",

But suddenly, a single Changeling flew out of the dust, as it charged toward Twilight and the Mane Six, hoping to bring harm to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a blunt metal object was thrown out of he dust cloud, as it hit the Changeling in the back of the head, knocking him out cold. Twilight &amp; the others got a closer look and noticed that the blunt metal object was actually the lantern of the lamp post. Then, they looked forward at the disappearing dust cloud and saw that Fenrir was still in one piece. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked toward the Mane Six, as he looked down at them &amp; said, \"Missed. Me?\" Rainbow Dash flew up to Fenrir's head height with her pegasus wings &amp; said , \"Fenrir, you were so AWESOME! Oh man, didn't you see those moves guys!?! He was all like 'ggrrrr' and 'Rooaarr' and 'hooyeah'!!\" As Rainbow Dash imitated the moves Fenrir used on the Changelings, Rarity noticed the pile of unconscious Changelings behind Fenrir, as she replied, \"Yes, it would seems he did put up a fight out of them, Rainbow Dash.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, Twilight noticed Fenrir's fresh scars he received from fighting the Changelings, as Twilight became worried &amp; asked, \"Are those...scars?\" Fenrir didn't exactly come out of that battle unscathed. Judging from Twilight's point of view, Fenrir had multiple fresh scars on his body. Fenrir had a nasty bite mark on his right bicep, caused by a Changeling that got lucky &amp; bit him from behind his arm, but it wasn't very nasty, just a minor wound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Fenrir also had several cuts on his body; 3 across his upper back, a large one at the abdomen, and a nasty cut that went from his left eyebrow, down across his left eye, and ends about half an inch away from his left eye. \"Took. Minor. Hits. From. Them.\" Fenrir answered, as he responded to Twilight's concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, Fenrir fell unconscious but alive, as Twilight and the Mane Six yelled, \"Fenrir!!\" They then got up to him and check if he was still alive. Thankfully, he still had a heartbeat.</span></div></div>",

You are already in trouble so you might as well start right.\"<br>\r\nTwilight was angry about making a deal with someone she hated so much but she figured that it was the only way to get her out of her situation. So she responded, \"Okay, what do you want?\"<br>\r\nChrysalis was relieved to find her plan working so easily so she said, \"If you can convince Princess Celestia to get me out of here then I will turn you back to yourself.\"<br>\r\nTwilight wasn't too pleased with this challenge because of the way Celestia treated her earlier. She didn't even think she could convince Celestia to get her out if the dungeon, especially if she was caught trying to escape. However this seemed like her only option. She responded, \" I would rather be a changeling but I want to ask you something.\"<br>\r\nChrysalis was confused at this response and replied, \" What isss it my darling?\" <br>\r\nTwilight responded, \"I might consider changing my mind but only if you (looks around) teach me how to use my powers as a changeling.

Twilight felt a little uneasy as the Changlings stood around her inspecting her body parts, she kept her eyes onto the Queen and waited for her response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I change you into one of my own kind? You are not worthy enough to be a Changling. It's merely a magical happening that you have transformed into my own kind, yet you look beautiful for a female Changling.\" The Queen spoke in a loud and bombastic voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did I even turn into a changling in the first place?\" Twilight asked the Queen, ignoring the snickering and laughter of the Changlings surrounding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tell me Twilight Sparkle.\" The Queen lowered her head closer to the new Changling looking deep into her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't know... I woke up... and then I found out I was turned into a Changling, all of my friends came in to help me but Princess Celestia took me away and put me in the Canterlot dungeons.\" Twilight explained to the Queen, the Changling Queen put her hoof on her chin and began to ponder on what the ex-pony had just said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that everything is not as it seems.\" The Changling Queen said, slowly walking up to Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what do you mean?\" Twilight raised her ears, she didn't understand what the Changling Queen was trying to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this Princess Celestia trust you?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Twilight replied. \"She trusts me with her heart and friendship, I have been her student since I was a little filly.\" She added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why did she throw you in the dungeons?\" The Changling Queen asked, giving a small smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't know... I didn't have time to explain...\" Twilight broke, she didn't know what to say. She still needed to keep a flowing conversation with the Queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe... certain aspects about your life is just a lie.\" The Changling Queen said, causing some of the Changlings that looked at Twilight to laugh and snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I d-don't understand...\" Twilight was stumped, how could such things come out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might have been a Changling from the beginning, but you weren't aware of your powers. What if the Princess knew about your real identity and she lead you on until the time was right.\" The Queen began to loudly speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't be... my parents raised me... and the Princess wouldn't never ever lie to me!\" Twilight protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you may know Twilight Sparkle, a Changling needs love to stay in their other forms to trick others. What if Celestia sent you to Ponyville to make friends to slowly suck off their love, knowing that your disguise would slowly fade away if you did not interact with other ponies.\" The Changling Queen looked down at Twilight, who was nearly about to burst into tears. \"And when the love is gone and your disguise had faded away, the Princess had no need for you and threw you away into the dungeons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight couldn't believe this, many ideas and voices in her head telling which side to pick. She couldn't understand why the Princess would lie to her and she couldn't understand why the Changling Queen couldn't have warned her earlier, she doesn't know who to choose after being told these dark secrets, she needed someone to help her regain her normal form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want my advice Twilight Sparkle, you could stay with me and both of us could pay both the Princesses a visit...\" The Changling Queen offered. \"Or... you could run away and forget about this whole mess and lose yourself in the world that betrayed you.\"</span></div></div>",

That part of her was telling her to try and strike down the Changeling Queen. She quashed that thought, however, owing to the fact that she was outnumbered by a wide margin. That left the options Chrysalis herself had presented: join with the Changelings, or turn her back and run from her troubles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Oh, she hated this. She hated what had happened. But she knew that on her own, her chances of survival were next to nil. Slowly, she answered. \"I... I'll stay with you... my Queen.\" By the Sun, forcing that out felt awful!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Queen appeared not to have noticed, however. \"Wonderful!\" She stepped down from the throne, inspecting her newest child. \"Hmm... a little scrawny, but reasonably fit. And...\" She trailed off, eyes wide as she beheld the second growth on Twilight's head. \"Well, well, well, things are more complicated than I thought.\" She tapped the crown-shaped horn with a hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight gasped at the contact. She hadn't been sure until now, but that second 'horn' was definitely attached. \"Um, yeah, I was going to ask about that...\" She paused, before adding, \"My Queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Inwardly, Chrysalis's mind was racing. <i>That powder shouldn't have turned her into a royal Changeling! She must have incredible magic potential for that to happen!</i> Outwardly, the Queen smiled. \"That second horn marks you as a royal Changeling. For all intents and practical purposes, you are just below me in rank, owing to my seniority. Should anything befall me, you will be the one to run the Hive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight gulped. \"I... I don't know if I could handle that. And... what do you mean, the 'Hive'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Changeling Queen lowered her head, until her main horn touched Twilight's. \"You haven't been connected to the Hive, my dear, so of course you wouldn't know.\" Her horn began to glow a sickly green. \"I warn you; this will feel a little odd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Suddenly, Twilight felt a jolt run through her body and mind. She cried out, although the feeling wasn't painful. She fell to the floor, gasping as she tried to make sense of the sensation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Or rather, sensation<b>s</b>. She could feel multiple things at the same time, and her vision seemed be be fractured as well. With a groan, she forced herself to focus on the image of her elder sister, and -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That thought derailed whatever else had been running through her mind. <i>Sister?! That Changeling isn't my sister! Why the hay did I just think that?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her turmoil was evident on her face, as the elder Changeling leaned down. \"Are you alright? It's a bit disorienting, when you're first connected to the Hive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I... I'm not sure. I can... <i>see</i> and <i>feel</i> so many things! And... and when I looked at you a second ago, I thought you were my sister! What gives?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Chrysalis smirked wryly. \"I'll answer the second question first. You see, when a royal Changeling is connected to the Hive for the first time, any existing royals become their sibling by the bond that is shared. It's just a fundamental rule of our kind, my dear. As for what you are feeling and seeing, those are what all of our subordinates are feeling and seeing. Our subordinates are all bound to us. We feel <i>everything</i> they feel.\" She let that sink in for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight's eyes widened at the implications. \"When Shining Armor and Cadence's spell washed through Canterlot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Chrysalis nodded. \"I felt not only the pain of my own body, but the pain each of my children felt as they were pushed out of the city. Some of my children weren't so lucky, being crushed against buildings and the like. Do you understand what it's like to be connected to somepony, and to have that pony die? It's almost unbearable. Now, picture that feeling multiplied many times over, along with multiple sensations of pain. That's what I had to endure with that spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight very nearly started crying. \"But... but my brother and Cadence didn't mean to kill any of your children!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Intentional or not, the damage was done!\" Chrysalis snarled. \"And now that you are connected to the Hive, you too will feel their pain. That should give you some incentive to keep them whole, should it not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight realized that she could not only feel the subordinate Changelings' sensations, but Chrysalis's as well. The Changeling Queen was angry at the deaths of her children. She was disappointed at having been denied her chance to feed her children forever. But most of all, she was thrilled for having a... successor?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight gulped. \"Look, I just agreed to this because I have a better shot at survival with you than on my own. I never agreed to be a... 'royal' Changeling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Chrysalis smiled sadly. \"I understand, my dear. Your own survival came first. But your body spoke for you in this case. And, I'll be honest, I'm actually rather happy about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight blinked. \"Huh? But, didn't I cause a lot of problems for you? Why would you be happy that I'm now just below you in Changeling hierarchy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Chrysalis chuckled. \"Haven't I made it clear? The well-being of the Hive is paramount. My own personal feelings are inconsequential. Though I won't deny, I find it a delicious irony that everything Celestia worked for will be undone by her student.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But... I...\" Twilight tried to protest, although a part of her was agreeing with the Changeling before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Come now, my dear, I took you in when Celestia cast you aside. What does that say to you, hmm?\" Chrysalis leaned down to whisper in Twilight's ear. \"How can you defend somepony who betrayed you so utterly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Another war raged within the former unicorn. How could she abandon Princess Celestia? And yet... how could she possibly defend her? What on Equestria was she supposed to do?</span></div></div>",

We will corrupt her thoughts and we will rule through her.\" Chrysalis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't she be suspicious?\" Twilight said. \"You sprung me from the dungeons, the security will be much tighter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All ready taken care of.\" Chrysalis said. \"I've send a few Changelings to replace you and that warden that was knocked out.

She was attempting to read a dull treatise on the difference between weather formed in Everfree and weather made by ponies, all in an effort to go to sleep. She'd set the sun two hours ago, but she was still restless. Her thoughts kept drifting back to her missing student. When had the Changelings gotten to her? And where was she now? Even the absolutely soporific text in front of her wasn't calming her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sighing, she put the book away, and laid on her back, staring at the ceiling. A tear fell from her eye. \"Oh, Twilight... my beloved student... I promise, I'll do everything in my power to find and release you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A knock at the door startled her, but she composed herself quickly. \"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The door opened, revealing a Royal Guard. \"I just wanted to inform you that the imposter who took Miss Sparkle's place has fallen asleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia's eyes narrowed. \"Good. Perhaps it will be more cooperative in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The guard hesitated, noticing the streak that the tear had left behind. \"Your Majesty? Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia considered lying, but decided honesty was best here. Beckoning the guard in, she shut the door behind him. \"No, I am not alright. I'm worried about my student.\" Her face fell. \"She... she tried to warn me. Tried to warn all of us of the Changeling Queen's intent. But we were too caught up in the glamour of the wedding to pay her any heed. I'm supposed to be better than that! Twilight's almost never been wrong about things like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The guard stepped forward. \"Your Majesty, do not blame yourself. The Changeling Queen fooled everypony. And recall that Miss Sparkle managed to prove herself right in the end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That just makes it worse!\" Celestia cried, startling the guard. \"I... I haven't even apologized to her for not believing her! And now, she's been taken by the very enemies she tried to warn me about!\" Her eyes watered, and she buried her face in her hooves. \"I'm a horrible mentor,\" she sobbed out. The guard stood nearby, looking extremely edgy about the way his ruler was now baring her soul to him. Surreptitiously, he slid a small metal band out of his armor into his hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a moment, Celestia drew in a ragged breath, and wiped her eyes with a hoof. \"My... my apologies for venting at you, my loyal guard. It's... been a trying couple of days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't mention it,\" the guard said, with a familiar <i>female</i> voice. Celestia looked up, just in time for the metal band the guard had thrown to latch onto her horn. Instantly, she felt her connection to the sun vanish. More than that, she couldn't use magic at all. A quick flash of magic caught her attention, and she saw an almost invisible barrier appear around her chambers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Seriously, don't mention it,\" the 'guard' said again, as green flames flickered around him. A moment later, the changeling that had impersonated Twilight Sparkle stood before her, a wicked grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You! But how?! That cell was secure, nopony could have escaped!\" Celestia was in shock. She'd just been duped by this imposter. Mentally, she made a note to devise a spell that could detect Changelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You don't give me nearly enough credit, Celestia,\" the Changeling said, chuckling cruelly. Her horn then glowed, and a few moments later, there was another burst of green flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When the flame cleared, there before Celestia's horrified eyes stood the Changeling Queen. Looking at the Princess of the Sun, she laughed. \"My, my, that went quicker than I would have thought!\" Glancing around, she grinned. \"And a soundproof barrier to boot! Excellent choices, my dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia reached with a hoof to try and remove the band around her horn. Unfortunately, it seemed to have adhered strongly to her horn. Giving up for the moment, she glared at the two Changelings. \"Why have you dared to return? And where have you taken my student?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Queen laughed long and hard. \"Oh, she still doesn't understand, does she, Twilight?\" she asked the other Changeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The other laughed as well. \"You'd think she'd be able to take a hint.\" Her laughter cut off abruptly as she stepped forward, glaring at Celestia with utter venom. \"Let me say it one more time: I am Twilight Sparkle. I was the one who hatched a baby dragon and caused him to age rapidly in a burst of uncontrolled magic. I was the one you took in as a student. And I was the one you let sleep in your own bedchambers for the first month of being your student, because I was so frightened, being away from my family and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia's eyes widened. Only she and Twilight had ever known that detail. Suddenly, the true impact of what she'd done hit her. <i>Oh, no...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Seeing her reaction, Twilight continued her verbal offensive. \"I have always done what you asked. I have served you faithfully for years! I considered you a second mother to me!\" She was now in Celestia's face, and the alicorn felt incredibly small, despite towering over the ex-unicorn. \"And this morning, when I needed you most, when I needed you to help me, what did you do? <i>You threw me into prison!</i> You ripped out my heart and stepped on it!\" She backed off a bit, trotting over to the Changeling Queen. \"Well, I guess it only proves that you should never trust your idols.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well said, sister,\" the Queen said with a chuckle. She looked at the shell-shocked Celestia. \"I really ought to thank you, Celestia. Your actions this morning have given me my greatest asset ever! You really shouldn't throw away your students so carelessly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia was having trouble comprehending everything. A massive storm of guilt raged within her. Yet, there was something she had to know, something that bugged her. \"Sister?\" she asked. Mentally, the rapidly diminishing rational part of her face-hooved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight smirked. \"Yes, sister. As it turns out, I'm a royal-type Changeling. When Chrysalis found that out, she connected me to the Hive. As such, I'm just below her in rank, owing to her seniority. Still, the bond now labels us as sisters. It's how royal Changelings work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I think that's enough explaning, Twilight,\" the Queen - Chrysalis - said. \"I believe it's time we got to work. Once Celestia is ours, we can turn to the rest of Equestria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia's eyes widened even more, and she finally found her resolve. Standing to her full height, she glared at both Changelings. \"You will never take Equestria! Not so long as I live!\" With that, she charged at Chrysalis, intent on skewering the Queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before she'd even made it halfway, she was flung back by a burst of magic from Twilight. \"Your continued existence can be easily corrected, <i>Princess</i>,\" she spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Now, now, Twilight, don't rough her up too much,\" Chrysalis chided. \"We need her alive, after all. The Equestrians would never accept us without her help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're a fool if you think I'd ever work for you,\" snapped Celestia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We'll see about that,\" Twilight retorted. \"Sister, I've been thinking: With her magic disabled, you don't need my help to corrupt her, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Chrysalis arched an eyebrow. \"I suppose not. What were you planning on doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight's grin was downright evil. \"I was planning...\"</span></div></div>",

She waited in horror to see what Twilight was going to do to her next.<br>\r\n Twilight, on the other hand, was obviously corrupted by evil from Chrysalis and not only that, it was powered by her own self-will. She was willing to take revenge on the princess and this was the perfect opportunity. However, she knew that after defeating Celestia that her friends would come and try to save her. They could never do this without her because there were six elements of harmony. However to attempt to eliminate the chance of a loop hole she decided upon bringing them to the scene for their defeat. <br>\r\n She said, \"I was planning on bringing my old friends into the fold. I want nothing getting in our way to equality.\" Chrysalis knew what to do and commanded another changeling, disguised as a guard, to get that task done. Meanwhile they would keep Celestia in her place.<br>\r\n After a short while, the mane six came in to a shock. They all gasped to see the great Princess Celsetia thrown down her throne and sitting there helpless. Twilight wasted no time as she continued with her plan. <br>\r\nShe said, \"Well nice of you to join before your last days of freedom.\"<br>\r\nApplejack  said, \"What in tarnation is going on here? <br>\r\nRarity said, \"Twilight is that you?<br>\r\nRainbowdash, Pinkiepie, and Fluttershy just stood there is the back still taking in everything that was happening.<br>\r\nTwilight responded, \"What do you think. I didn't think that it would come to this but I am afraid that our friendship is over.   <br>\r\nRainbowdash didn't believe her and said, \"Alright Twilight, we found you, but you can cut the act and tell us what is really going on.\" She smiled a short lived smile.<br>\r\nTwilight wasn't moved at all and said, \"This isn't a joke. I am through with you, all of you! I want you to suffer what you put me through.\"<br>\r\nPinkie pie stepped up and said, \"What are talking about?\" <br>\r\nTwilight responded, \"I thought you would respond this way. Let me put it short, you all aren't my friends. You were just using me to be able to get to Celestia. I tried to tell you about the changelings but none of you believed me until it was almost too late. I had to work my but off to convince you all to believe me. On top of that, you just now did the same thing and got me put into prison. Now you all are going to pay.\" She snorts.<br>\r\nFluttershy stepped up and said, \" Twilight, we will never let you down on purpose. We were distracted by the wedding and all that glamour. You know that we never meant to hurt you.<br>\r\nRainbowdash came up and said, \"Yeah, you can't throw away our friendship for that, especially after all we went through.<br>\r\nThis made Twilight angry<br>\r\nApplejack came in and said, \"Look we know that you are hurt and I want to say that we are all very sorry. <br>\r\nTwilight responded, \" A little late for that but I might consider accepting that when I am through with you all.\"<br>\r\nRarity said, \" Hold on. I know that we aren't perfect, neither are you but can you consider being more rational? <br>\r\nTwilight replied, \"No, now can you all stop talking. You are only prolonging what's yet to come.\"<br>\r\nFluttershy, in a last attempt to talk her out of it said, \" Before you take revenge I would like to um give you a reason to not do so. Forgive us please, if for nothing else, do it for Spike, in fact do it for your brother. He is the one you truly care about.<br>\r\nTwilight looked at the other three and said, \"What are your last words?\" Then she started thinking about what her decision would really bring. <br>\r\nPinkie pie said, \" I should be the one apologizing. You apologized to me when you didn't believe me about the parasprite crisis. I am so sorry for ever doubting you.\" <br>\r\nApplejack said, \" Yeah, um I may not be able to relate like that, but I just want to make things right. I am sorry Twi.\"<br>\r\nRarity said, \" Me too. Sorry Twilight.\"<br>\r\nRainbowdash was the last to respond and said, \" Yeah me three.

I was thrown away like a piece of paper hoped to rot in the dungeons... My parents didn't tell me that I was a Changling... my own flesh and blood didn't even tell me that I was a Changling right from the start... what use are they?! I wasted all of those years believing that everything in Equestria is magical... but I got nothing in return! You all turned on me when you all have the chance!\" Twilight furiously yelled out in front of her old friends, all them had their eyes wide open with mouths agape as the Changling charged up a green fiery magic spell that would surely hurt them for good.</span></div></div>",

Accepting the truth was bad enough for her but having to recover from her pain and suffering was seemingly more than enough. Chrysalis was happy because she managed to get Twilight to turn evil. Celestia was suffering the pain of letting this type of thing happen to her student.<br>\r\n Twilight shot a fireball at her friends and they all could do nothing but take the hit. However Twilight couldn't build enough magic to hit them all at once because she wasn't completely evil nor had she realized her full potential. The fireball rushed towards them all and hit one of them.<br>\r\n The fireball hit Pinkie pie in the face. She was alive but her fur was burned black. She rolled on the floor in a attempt to put the fire out. It worked, but this caused her friends to scramble. Twilight had to act fast if this plan was going to work because she knew that her friends were still a threat.<br>\r\n A threat they were alright. Before Chrysalis could see it, Rainbowdash flew into her and knocked her out. Twilight knew that her plan was messed up and she tried to quickly teleport away. This failed because she wasn't used to her new magic and on top of that, Applejack and Rarity both tackled her. They were not happy but they still wanted their friend back. <br>\r\n Fluttershy went over to Celestia, who was still suffering heart break, and tried her best to comfort her. Shortly the royal guards came because of all of the noise and yelling. They burst down the door and couldn't believe their eyes. Pinkie pie managed to get enough strength to move again. Twilight was still struggling to get from the grip of her two old friends. The guards reacted quickly and first went to care for the princess.<br>\r\nThe guards said, \"Are you alright? What's going on here? <br>\r\nCelestia told them, \"I am fine but take care of the others and you know what to do with the changelings.\"<br>\r\n The guards summoned more backup and they first went to take care of Pinkie pie. Applejack and Rarity let the guards cuff Twilight but they didn't take her away. More royal guards came and they cuffed Chrysalis and took her back to the dungeon. Twilight didn't understand why they didn't do the same with her but she knew that she was in trouble. She was not happy with this at all.<br>\r\n Celestia would normally put her in prison but she did not want to risk her escaping again with Chrysalis. She stood there with a stern look on her face.<br>\r\nShe said, \"I could say we have a lot to talk about but first I want you to settle things with your friends. If you don't I will surely have a proper punishment for you.\" <br>\r\n She sighed and trotted away, still depressed about what she did earlier. The guards went to the door and stood outside to protect against any more threats. Twilight was left with  her friends and nothing more. <br>\r\n She couldn't use any magic because the last attack burned her out and the cuffs prohibited such action. Her friends were all looking at her with dumbfounded expressions on their faces because they couldn't understand why Twilight would let herself turn evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

The Royal Guards surrounded Twilight as she struggled to break out of her captive bonds with only the eyes of her old friends to watch in despair as the pony they once known as Twilight. Rainbow Dash had stared at what was left of Twilight, not believing what had just happened. Fluttershy was comforting Pinkie Pie by wrapping her hooves around her in a hug to calm her down. Rarity and Applejack both looked at Twilight with tears in their eyes looking at the monster that was not meant to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards slowly backed away from Twilight so that her friends could speak to her and sort out what was going on once and for all, Applejack was the first one to walk up close to Twilight as she continued to struggle out of her cuffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twi...\" Applejack gulped, she was evidently scared at what the Changlings had done to Twilight, just seeing her act helpless after trying to destroy the Princess was enough to make the earth pony sniffle. \"Can we jus' talk?\" Applejack continued before giving another pause, yet Twilight was not listening to what her enemy had to say. \"We all jus' wanna talk to ya' nice and slow.\" Applejack kept her eyes fixed on Twilight, still trying to break from her bonds even though it was most likely that she wasn't able to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight stopped moving around and looked up at Applejack, filled to the brim with hate and disgust that she was still talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away!\" Twilight screamed, causing the guards to stay alert in case she was going to break out of her bonds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are ya' on th' bad side, Twi?\" Applejack asked, ignoring Twilight's screams and yells. \"They ain't no good, look what they did to ya'!\" Applejack kept on going with her questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to speak to you... I need to stay with my sister!\" Twilight shouted, looking away from Applejack and the rest of her old friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th' Changling Queen ain't no sister!\" Applejack argued back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My hive mind... I need to stay with the hive... I can't leave them alone...\" Twilight grumbled, two sides in her fighting, she really wanted to hurt all of the ponies in the room, her anger was letting her take it too far and tears began to fall from her eyes. \"You don't understand.. it's the pain... they're crying... I can feel it... they need me... my sister needs me...\" Twilight shouted in between her sobbing, Applejack turned her head back to Rarity and Rainbow Dash who were as confused as she was at what Twilight was trying to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity and Rainbow Dash took a few steps forward closer to Twilight and both stood besides Applejack to look down at what has become of Twilight Sparkle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight please... you were never like this... we love you so much and care for you... the Changlings are controlling you, this isn't you!\" Rarity spoke out, Twilight didn't want this talk either way, she wanted to escape and get back to her hive with her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate you... all of you... you left me to rot in the dungeons and I will never go back...

Twilight change her glare to her, she was burning inside from the rage, but calmed herself to speck \u201cWell there something I need to tell you first\u201d Twilight stop holding back and let the rage flow out <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019M NOT YOUR SISTER! I don\u2019t care if that how your people work; you people are bugs I mean that literally, you all think the same thing! No one is different, you have no emotions, no feeling, all just working for the Hive, I\u2019m not one of you, I may look like it but unlike you I think for myself, I have thoughts and feeling of my own! So take you butts but to your wasteland, and never, and never mess with me again, or your going to end up like the last guy who did, maybe you herd of him, his name is discord he over a 1000\u2019s of year old, mishmash of different animals and he currently made of pure stone.\u201d The queen was flabbergasted as her plan, the last hope for it died as her princess was threating to turn her to stone, Twilight match up to the queen  with her horn glowing. \u201cNow, kindly, get out and STRAY OUT!\u201d with that the queen was transported just out side the east boarder with noway back in. Her Friends were delighted to have Twilight back to normal, Twilight turned back to the princess and smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow lets get this sorted out Twilight\u201d Celestia started only to be stopped by Twilight.<br>\r\n\u201cWait Celestia, you see\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wanted to \"punish\" her but not really. Locking her in the dungeon might spur another hatred phase, a memory wipe is too much to deal with, she didn't deserve banishment or any stoning. In fact she didn't deserve to be punished at all. She may have hurt a pony but that was when she felt that there was no other way. Celestia didn't know what to do. Twlight continued begging for punishment.<br>\r\nTwilight bowed her head down and said, \"So what will it be. Whatever it is, I deserve it.\"<br>\r\nCelestia looked at Twilight. She already tried comforting her but Twilight still persists to want to be punished. She already cured her changeling curse. So there was nothing else to do. She had to do something to convince Twilight that everything was alright. She sarcastically said,\"Well I suppose proper punishment is needed to set things straight.\"<br>\r\nTwilight thought she was serious and she cried a little. She said, \"Just make it quick.\"<br>\r\nCelestia couldn't think of anything that could suppress Twilight's guilt. So she said, \"Would you come to breakfast with me? I believe that we need to talk privately there.\"<br>\r\nTwilight was surprised at this remark and she said, \"I can't I don't...\"<br>\r\nCelestia interrupted and said, \"If you don't then you will be put into the dungeon.\" She said that but she didn't really mean it at all.<br>\r\nTwilight just replied, \"Okay, okay I will go to breakfast and I will try my best to enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Celestia figured that Twilight's friends would be there to hopefully help Twilight to feel at least a little better. She walked away and Twilight followed her. They had got to breakfast right in time.<br>\r\nAs soon as they walked in, they were greeted by Pinkie pie when she said, \"Oh, boy! You guys almost missed it.\"<br>\r\n Twilight smiled upon seeing that her friend  was back to normal. She still had scars and bruises but she was okay. Celestia smiled as well because she always enjoyed a warm welcome especially from someone like Pinkie pie. They both walked in. <br>\r\n Celestia sat on her special seat which was in the middle where she could see every pony. She saw Twlight's friends filter in as well as the royal servants, subjects, guards, and lastly the servants which came in with the food. Twilight was a little nervous.<br>\r\n Twilight was nervous even though she really had no reason to be. She still couldn't shake off the feeling of guilt as her friends openly welcomed her into the room. She smiled because they didn't show any sign of holding anything from the events of the other day. She was comforted by this and thought, \"Maybe they did forgive me\" She took a seat and prepared for this occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now ture that they were to rule side by side but really Celestia was in charged, not that Luna minded this being because Luna was really comfortable around others still and got kind of scared talking to large amounts of Ponies, she was still rather confused about this new time she was in, and she didn\u2019t really like being a leader, she liked paint the star and other wonderful things beside she wasn\u2019t really cutout for leadership.<br>\r\nCelestia smiled as she just hatched an idea. \u201cTwilight I know your punishment, you will be put under the care of Luna for a short time, with part of power taking or control in this case as to punish you, teach Luna something and without power your be rather useless to any bugs that try to take you\u201d Twilight was keen on this, but it was still better than what she thought it was going to be, but a thought \u201cWait, but care?

When she felt like she made it to safety she stopped running and began walking. The Ever free forest wasn't too far away from where she was located and she smiled upon the thought of getting with Chrysalis.<br>\r\n She was paranoid with the fact that her friends may have followed her and could be attacked again at any moment. This made her feel nervous and constantly looking around for threats. She was protected by her changeling friends or guards she would call them now but she couldn't put her full trust in them. She walked further in the direction of the forest.<br>\r\n As she was walking, she heard some footsteps. She didn't stop to check out who or what was following her but she became even more nervous. Her changeling guards were not aware of anything. Their main focus was to get her to the queen. She heard some more footsteps.<br>\r\n This could no longer be ignored and she commanded one of her guards to go see if anything was following them. The guard flew away and she pushed on. This didn't change a thing and as far as she knew, the unknown was getting closer. She became uneasy with this feeling.<br>\r\n She became angry and finally stopped to check on things. There was nothing but silence as she looked around the area. She looked around some more and saw nothing. When she thought everything was clear she turned her head and saw a pony-like figure ahead. <br>\r\nShe yelled, \"Halt who goes there!\"<br>\r\nThis figure was unmoved by her words and approached her. Twilight yelled some more but it didn't change the figures actions. The figure got close and revealed itself as Luna.<br>\r\nLuna said, \"What is the meaning of this! I know why you are here!\"<br>\r\nTwilight wasn't scared and she said, \"So you heard the news. What of it! I am on my own now.\"<br>\r\nHer old friends then came up behind the princess but they didn't say a word.<br>\r\nTwilight looked at them all in disgust and said, \"Go away. You have no place here.\"<br>\r\nHer friends didn't back down. They were all too concerned with Twilight and her well being. Pinkie pie stepped up and said, \"So this is our last goodbye?\" She was still injured by Twilight's actions earlier.<br>\r\nTwilight just looked at them all. She was surprised that they didn't try to arrest her but she didn't want them there. She replied, \"You leave me no choice. If you don't get out of my way, then I will make you!\"<br>\r\nThe others were not moved and Luna said, \"Chrysalis has deceived you. If you continue your voyage, you will only find out that she will let you down as well.<br>\r\nRainbowdash said, \"Yeah she is probably just using you.\"<br>\r\nTwilight didn't listen and replied, \"How could she? This was my choice.\"<br>\r\nApplejack replied, \"Well that's true but think about it. She used Prince Charming without a doubt.\"<br>\r\nTwilight responded, \"Well duh, if I didn't know that then this would have never happened. You already forgot the very reason why I am mad at you!\"<br>\r\nFluttershy stepped up and said, \"Well we are just trying to get you to think.

She took one look at me and threw me into the dungeon, convinced I wasn't the real Twilight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luna thought she couldn't suffer any more shocks tonight. She was wrong. \"Thou... thou must be lying, Twilight Sparkle! Our sister would never imprison anypony without hearing them out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do I look like I'm lying?!\" Twilight replied through her tears. \"She betrayed me! After everything I've done in her service, when I needed her the most, she turned her back on me! I was only able to escape because the warden fell asleep!\" Twilight broke down sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The sight tugged hard at Luna's heart. She could recall feeling the same for a time. When the Nightmare had first possessed her, she'd mentally cried out for her sister to set her free. Instead, Celestia had banished both her and the Nightmare to the moon for 1000 years. That had hurt. Yet... the sting of that couldn't possibly compare to what Twilight felt. Luna moved forward, and wrapped Twilight in a hug, holding her close. \"Twilight Sparkle, we shall have a word with our sister about this. Mayhap we can convince her to rethink her position.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luna couldn't feel it, but Twilight felt the love Luna had for her fill her up. Through her sobs, buried in Luna's chest, she smiled. \"But Celestia didn't trust you with knowing about the Changelings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luna frowned. \"Be that as it may - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight interrupted. \"And she didn't tell you that your first and best friend from Nightmare Night had 'gone missing'. She didn't consider your feelings at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luna grimaced. \"Twilight, what art thou saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight looked up at Luna with a serious expression. \"I'm saying Celestia doesn't <i>trust</i> you. Tell me, how many court functions have you attended since you returned? How many ponies have come to you, asking for advice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luna opened her mouth to retort... and closed it. Finally, she admitted, \"None. To both questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight smiled sadly. \"Despite your eagerness to atone, the stigma of the Nightmare hangs over you like a cloud. Nopony will ever trust you completely. Not even Celestia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luna couldn't comprehend it. This was Celestia's own student, saying these things! What was she supposed to think?</span></div></div>",

Since she could feel that no pony loves her, her body has become very weak. She was barely to stand. If this continued, she could almost die. Twilight was able to move her head out of the water, already taking more than enough of a drink. Her breathing started to get heavy and she could tell that her vision was starting to blurry.

She could hear the sound of running water. \"Well, I need to take care of that, first.\" She slowly struggled to her hooves, and was worried that it took her five attempts to stand up straight. \"What the hay's wrong with me...?\" she wondered.

Coughing, she managed to pull her head out. \"Ugh... did not need to add 'drowning' to the list of ways I could potentially die out here,\" she choked out. After a moment, she carefully lowered her head, taking a nice, measured drink from the stream. When she was certain that her thirst had been quenched, she curled up next to the stream, pondering what was wrong with her. It was a few minutes later when her eyes widened in realization. \"Of course! Changelings feed on love! And...\" She trailed off. \"And I ran from anypony who could have possibly given me any.\" She sighed. \"So, I'm going to die of starvation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The weakness and fatigue of her body caught up to her, and she blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Unknown to Twilight, there was somepony nearby who was both unaware of what Changelings were, and was willing to lend a helping hoof to anypony in need.</span></div></div>",

This way she wouldn't have to steal love or impersonate somepony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's settled, Trixie shall teach you all there is to know about the business and tomorrow, you will star as her assistant!\" Trixie said with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them shook hooves on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We shall now begin our rehearsal.\" Trixie said.</span></div></div>",

She had been rehearsing with Trixie for less than an hour, and the showmare was gushing about her performance. Twilight blushed, still unused to being complimented for her magic. \"Really, Trixie, I'm not that special.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But you are, Twilight!\" Trixie exclaimed. \"It took me weeks of practice to get as confident with my magic on stage as you have in less than an hour!

So it was that Trixie found herself in the embrace of a distraught Changeling. \"Oh, Trixie! I've had a terrible couple of days!\" With that, everything came tumbling out; the fiasco at the rehearsal, crashing the wedding, the banishment of the Changelings, and waking up as one of Equestria's newest enemies. \"...And the worst part is, Princess Celestia didn't believe it was me! She threw me into the dungeon like I was some kind of criminal!\" Twilight continued to weep. \"Me, her own student...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trixie, while she hadn't expected the outpouring of emotion, had nonetheless listened intently. She stroked the ex-Unicorn's mane with a hoof as Twilight bared her soul. Still, that last bit of information caused her to blink. \"Wait, you're the Princess's student?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I was,\" Twilight choked out. \"A-anyway, another Changeling found me, and broke me out of the dungeon. He led me to the Queen, who told me that it was possible that I'd always been a Changeling... feeding on the love of my parents, and later my friends, using that to maintain my 'disguise' of a normal unicorn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trixie kept stroking the other's mane. \"Twilight, let Trixie ask you: Is there anything in your memory to suggest that that is in any way true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight paused. \"Well, no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And what, exactly, was the Princess's reaction when she saw you like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight frowned, then her eyes widened. \"She... she asked me, 'Where is she?' She thought I was a Changeling that took my own place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trixie smiled. \"There, you see? Some wicked magic has befallen you, Twilight, and Trixie for one will help you to get through this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight blinked. \"But why would you help me? I thought you hated me, Trixie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trixie's smiled gained a wan element, and she dropped her stage persona entirely. \"I did, for a time. But after losing many of my personal belongings due indirectly to my own tall tales, I realized that I had let my ego get the better of me.\" She waved a hoof around them, indicating their current surroundings. \"I spent a lot of time getting back on my feet. I had to call in some favors to get a new wagon. And I had time to think. I realized that blaming you for my own shortcomings would go nowhere, and that the next time I saw you, I would apologize.\" She grinned. \"I never suspected my apology would entail saving your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight returned the grin. \"Like you said, we're even, now.\" Suddenly, the world was briefly engulfed in a green light, causing both mares to blink rapidly. \"What... just happened?\" Twilight asked, when she could see again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trixie looked dumbfounded. \"L-look at yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight looked at her hoof, and gasped. Instead of the pock-marked black hooves she'd had before, her hoof was now whole, and a baby-blue color. The color was a dead ringer for the mare in front of her. \"Mirror! I need a mirror!\" Trixie obliged, magicking over a body-length mirror. Twilight stared at her reflection, which was a perfect copy of Trixie's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Didn't you mention that Changelings could... well, change their forms?\" Trixie asked, getting over her shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah...\" Twilight replied. \"I was thinking about you...\" She paused, then shifted her focus to a different image. The world flashed green again. When Twilight looked in the mirror this time, she nearly wept in relief. Her reflection was that of a lavender unicorn with a slate-blue mane with pink highlights. Her eyes were violet, and most importantly, her cutie mark was a magenta starburst with five white stars around it. \"YES! I look like myself again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trixie grinned. \"You know, this could work wonders for our routine together. If you could assume different forms, it could really make things wonderous! What else can you change into, Twilight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight paused to consider. \"You know, there's only one way to find out.\" She shared a knowing look with the showmare. \"Testing!\"</span></div></div>",

On the other, there was a bit of personal pride Twilight had in not asking for her mentor's help for most problems. Would her practicality or her pride win in this instance?</span></div></div>",

Just then she spots a squirrel up in the tree's branches making a similar cackle to the one she heard before. \"Ha ha, look at me yelin' at some varmint. Good thing Fluttershy ain't here to give me grief about it.\" Applejack laughs and mutters to herself. \"Now what about this here apple, it sure is strange. I wonder how it tastes?\" She said curiously. \"I may just have to try it!\" \"Then again I can't show it to Granny if I do.\" AJ contemplates as the autumn wind softy blows. \"I know I'll take a small bite and carry the rest back to the house after I finish this area.\" She says having made up her mind. As Applejack's teeth bit into the small fruit a mouthful of sweat juices filled her gullet. This had to be by far the tastiest apple she ever had! \"Ouuuwee that's good!\" She exclaimed with glee as she took another unplanned but instinctual bite. As she enjoyed the fruits of her labor the apple was executing it's effect unbeknownst to the small earth equine. Her once modest plot ebbed the swelled ever so slightly, her back legs contracted before stretching longer than they had been same could be said for her front legs. All four of her hooves receded before expanding in diameter even the apple she was very much enjoying seemingly shrunk in her hoof, her main and tail sunk in before blooming outward. And finally her head shrank before ballooning to a marginally greater size causing her beloved cowboy hat to look ever so off on her newly enlarged head! \" I really need to stop, I shouldn't eat this whole thang!\" AJ stated feeling very conflicted. \" Buck it, I'll save the next crazy colored apple I see and show that to the fam! This one's mine!\" She said greedily as she scarfed the remaining of the treat of an apple in her now larger mouth. \"Man that hit the spot! Well time to get back to it\"  AJ said as she gathered up her bucket and trotted to the cart. She stopped for a moment realizing just how easy it seemed to pick up and how light the over all bucket felt. \" Wow, guess I'm getting stronger than I thought!\" With that she placed the bucket in the cart and began to head to the next tree when another cackle could be heard if ever so slightly but between the loading and the rolling of the cart's wheels she didn't quite pick up on it. Either that or she didn't pay it any attention. She breezed threw the rest of her area of the orchard knocking most if not all the apples down in one buck, due to her larger frame and stronger leg muscles. On her eighth tree she did manage to buck all of the apples at once causing her to exclaim, \" Yehaw, I thought only Big Mac was capable of such a thing! I always thought he was pullin my leg when he told me he could do it! Hot dawg I can't wait to tell him that not only do I believe it can be done, but that I his sister can did it!\" As AJ relished in her accomplishment another slight change was taking place in her body, she diminished again before swelling even bigger! Still not enough to fuss over but she was indeed larger than moments before. \" Big Mac bes be ready for an apple buck-off here soon!\" She said excitedly as she continued on her route, she ended up finishing in record time thanks to her snack and headed back to the barn to turn in the harvest.

Apple Bloom smiled and stared up at her big sister for a moment and noticed something off about her as she responded with, \"No problem Applejack, I know better.\" Apple Bloom dawned a quizzical look at AJ after she finished speaking and held it for longer than the hard working honest country pony was comfortable with. \"What's the matter Apple Bloom, do I got something on my face?\" AJ asked truthfully. \"No?\" AB answered uncertain of what was off about her sister. \"Well then, do you have something else on your mind? AJ asked curious now. Apple Bloom looked her sister up and down scanning for answers. \"I don't know, you just seem different is all? \"Ha, different how? AJ responded playfully. When Apple Bloom's gaze returned and stopped on her sister's head again she caught what was bugging her. \"Oh it's your hat? Yeah your hat, that's definitely it!\" The filly stated confidently. \"Mai hat, what about it?\" AJ asked bewilderingly. \"Say Applejack when was the last time you washed your hat?\" AB questioned. \"Ah..., maybe three months ago why?\" \"That can't be right!\"Pondered AB. \"Where are you going with this Apple Bloom?\" Asked AJ. \"Because it shrank, he he.\"AB let out a soft chuckle with her revelation. \"Shrank, what in tarnation are you talking about?\" AJ questioned. \"Just look at it Applejack, either it shrank or you grew! He,he\"AB let out another chuckle at the absurdity of the idea. Applejack complied with the request and snatched the hat of her head. It did indeed look smaller in her enlarged hooves. \"Huh, I guess your right sugar cube. The odd thing is I haven't washed it recently and leather doesn't shrink as much after the initial time?\" AJ acknowledged, trailing off in thought. \"Yep, it's definitely smaller or maybe you ARE growing Applejack?\" AB joked. \"Ha, ha silly filly. You bes pray it's the former, you won't want me to stomp on ya with my giant hooves!\" AJ playfully expounded  slamming a mighty hove down in front of the filly with substantial force causing a loud clank. This took Apple Bloom by surprise and slightly frightened her. \"Yeah sure wouldn't want that, heh heh\" AB responded with nervous laughter as her imposing sister looked down on her. \"Aw Apple Bloom ah was only goofin, there's nothing to be afraid of. I would never hurt you?\" AJ apologetically reassured her sibling. \" I know Applejack, that was just some mighty fine actin.\" AB replied having calmed down considerably. \"Gee thanks Apple Bloom, no worries. Now what do you say we head back to the barn and wash up for super?\" AJ says sweetly. \"Sure thang Applejack I'd like that.\" AB said joyfully. As the pair make there way towards the barn Applejack has another growth spurt does Apple Bloom notice? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sisters make there way towards the barn, as they are closing in on the structure Applejack recedes in size again before spurting outwards in all directions. Apple Bloom who had had been staring aimlessly into the distance up to this point, caught the sight of orange hair expanding into her peripheral vision to her right. She then quickly turned her head to gaze fully upon her elder sibling and couldn't fathom what she was witnessing. It didn't last all to long and it wasn't by much but her sister had grown larger right in front of her very eyes! \"What the hey?\" AB blurted out without a second thought. \"Apple Bloom watch your mouth! You know Granny don't like such language!\" AJ scolded the filly surprised by her outburst. \"I'm sorry Applejack, it's just that you GREW! Iknow that sounds preposterous but it's true I jus seen it!\" Exclaimed the filly in disbelief as she continued to examine her sister. Apple Bloom thought to herself for a moment, (Man she's got to be almost as big as Big Mac, maybe even bigger!) she shuttered as she finished the thought. \"Apple Bloom are you still going on about that? Ah thought you were goofin before, but it sounds like you are starting to believe it yourself.\" AJ quizzically claimed.  \"I swear BIG sis I'm not making this up!\" AB protested as she stopped in her tracks causing Applejack to do the same. \" Can't you tell somethings off? Your legs are longer, your backside is wider, shoot even your head is bigger! It's really weird, ah mean look at me. Don't I look smaller than I did I few minutes ago?\" AB continued to reason to her sister trying to convince the over-sized pony to notice the change in herself. \"Ha, ha Apple Bloom I don't have a clue what has gotten into you but don't you think I'd realize ah was enlarging?\" AJ laughed the notion off and confidently declined. \"Maybe not Applejack, I mean it wasn't a huge spurt or nuthing. Perhaps since it's happening to you, you can't tell.\" AB purposed logically. \"Oh come now Apple Bloom what sense does that make, my whole form and balance would be thrown off if ah was bigger! \" AJ rationalized as Apple Bloom scanned Applejack again for any oddities. \"I don't know, would you say you've had a normal day then sis? Did you find anything strange out in the orchard, did you nick yourself on a tree, or perhaps pricked yourself with a strange bush?\" AB rattling off a series of questions trying to justify the phenomenon. \"Let's see here, I ate an apple. It was orange like me!\" AJ answered truthfully humoring her younger sibling for a moment. Just as Applejack made that revelation Apple Bloom noticed something odd about Applejack's cart attached to her back. \"That's it!\" AB blurted out excitedly. \"Wha the apple, naw it couldn't be. Sure was tasty though.\" AJ stated reminiscing on how delicious that apple had been salivating slightly. \"No your cart! See how it's risen higher than it had bee when you started?\" AB said deduct-fully like a expert sleuth. Applejack turned to look at her rig, it did feel like it was a bit raised not to mention tight. \"You see you haven't adjusted it to your new height, the front wheels are barely making contact with the ground!\" AB added sounding even more sure of herself. \"Maybe Big Mac fiddled with my rig to slow me down Apple Bloom you know how competitive he gets.\" AJ reasoned trying to stay calm with a dash of worry in her tone. \" I don't know Applejack sure doesn't sound like something Big Mac would do even with his competitive nature, he prefers a fair game to a rigged one.\" AB stated in a consulting tone. \"Ok, but adult ponies don't just grow Apple Bloom. I hit my peak growth spurt ages ago!\" AJ stated sounding more confused than anything. \"Welp apparently not  Applejack but don't worry, ah am here for you.\" AB said comfortingly. \"I know sugar cube, I have the best darn sister in all of Equestria.\" AJ said proudly full of warmth in her tone. \"Well we bes be continuing to the barn now wouldn't want Granny Smith to worry.\" AB stated responsibly. \"Yeah it's is about that time ain't it. Hey Apple Bloom, can you keep this whole growth thing between us?\" Applejack concurred whilst making a small request. \" I'll try but if you get any bigger I doubt the others won't notice.\" AB agreed as the thought of her older sister having difficulties exiting the barn filled her imagination. \"Sounds fair, in the meantime ah should probably consult Twilight she'll know what to do.\" AJ states while coming to terms with her situation. As the girls close in on the barn Granny Smith can be heard from the house hollering, \"Hurry up you two super almost ready. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  As the pair walk past the garden's gate towards the the front of the house Applejack turn to Apple Bloom and says,\" Go on now Apple Bloom, I'll meet cha in a minute!\" Said AJ sternly. \"Ok sis, oh and don't worry I'll wash up as well.\" AB states with a pleasant smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Applejack nods and makes her way towards the barns entrance as Apple Bloom happily trots up to the front door and proceeds inside. \"Where's Applejack? Ain't she witch you?\" Said the lime green old mare. \"Why yes Granny, she was. She's just stowing her gear and securing the harvest, that's all.\" AB answered truthfully. \"Oh ah see, that makes sense. Say you two were out there for quite some time, is everythin alright?\" Granny Smith inquired instinctively. \"Yeah, every things fine Granny.\" AB replied sounding slightly unsure. \"Ok then, go wash up now and I'll have your super ready by the time you get back.\" GS stated sounding ever so slightly unconvinced. \"Yes of course, be back it a minute!\" Said AB in a nervous tone. On the way to the wash room she shots her brother heading into the kitchen/dinning area. \"Hey ya Big Mac.\" She said quickly acknowledging her elder sibling. \"Eh yep.\" BM responded fondly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n At this moment Applejack crosses the threshold of there quaint home, \"Howdy y'all, owwee Granny what smells so dang good?\" AJ complimented enthusiastically. \"It's just simple stew Applejack, no need to make such a fuss.\" GS delivered flatly with sarcastic undertones. Granny Smith still had not laid eyes on her newly enlarged granddaughter so she had no reason to change here inflections however Big Mac wasn't so lucky since he had just entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n In his eyes there was absolutely no denying the fact his sister was nearly as tall as he was, seeing his sibling standing so near the doors frame. \"What's wrong Big Mac did I track something in?\" AJ questioned knowing all t well why her bother wore such an odd expression. \"Nope\" Big Mac said quickly still processing the information in front of him. \" Alright then I bes be heading to the wash room so we can get along with super.\" AJ said proudly as she hung her hat on the rack near the door marveling at how low it appeared to her now.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n As Applejack passed Big Mac by Granny was turning around to begin placing the food on the table, with her change of positing she was able to catch a glimpse of the two siblings side by side. It caught her of guard seeing the mare's back nearly level with the stallions. That can't be right she thought, Applejack has never been that tall. \"Mai eyes must be playin tricks on me in mai old age, ha ha Applejack looks huge!\" The old mare laughed to herself. Apple Bloom was just finishing up when Applejack arrived at the door. \"They didn't notice right? AB curiously whispered. \"Ah think Big Mac may be on to me, but I can have a bit of fun with that.\" AJ replied gleefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Having finished washing her hooves Applejack returns to the table and takes a seat across from Granny with Apple Bloom and Big Man on the sides. \"Thanks Granny for meal.\" AJ says gratefully. The other two siblings concurs the sentiment  and the family converses over the dinner about the days chores and each member fills the old mare in on they're individual progress. \"So, you say we're about three fourths done with the orchard now?\" GS inquires sounding impressed. \"Eh yep\" \"Bingo\" both BM and AJ reply confidently. \"Well now that's got to be a new apple family record you two, great job!\" GS states sounding positively overjoyed. The conversation carries on merrily for quite some time while Applejack begins to scramble for a second helping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"My yer sure are hungry today ain't cha!\" GS comments on Applejack's enthusiasm for the simple dish. \"Sure am, I worked up quite the appetite. Besides it's just so good with all my favorite fixins.\" AJ stated bluntly. \"Well go on eat yer fill sweetie, you sure earned it.\" GS said warmly. Big Mac couldn't believe his eyes he's never seen Applejack eat so much at super. He shot a glace over at his other sibling who was also staring on in disbelief. He turned again once more to face the hungry Applejack and continued to watch her nervously as she took another spoonful into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With all eyes in the room on her now seeing as the conversation had died down and they where full. As Applejack put the last spoonful of her second bowl in her mouth and it's tasty contents slid down her throat, it happened. Applejack's entire form shrank inward almost as if she were imploding before stretching and expanding in all directions. Her substantial stomach pushed against the hard wood of the table pushing it towards the elderly pony as her plot bloomed and covered more and more surface area of the floor. Her head swelled and rose higher and higher as she let out a deep satisfactory sigh. She also tilted her head back shutting her eyes with her front hooves placed firmly on the floor behind her in full stretch mode. Her legs thickened and slid further and further under the able as they elongated outwards, \"Man that really hit the spot, thanks Granny!\" She stated triumphantly. There was no contesting it now SHE WAS MASSIVE!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n All three of them stared in awe as they gazed upon the largest mare, NO the largest pony, Scratch that the largest equine they have ever laid eyes on. None of them new what to say, she had to be 13 feet high! It was insane that they're beloved Applejack was giant to say the least, what were they going to do? </span></div></div>",

You knew Apple Bloom? Granny Smith replied sounding slightly angry. \"Now don't go gettin mad at her Granny, I put her in this mess.\" AJ stated owning up to her mistake. \"I be mad at who ever I want to Missy, i'll deal with you in a minute and don't go thinking you can speak any kind of way just because your HUGE.\" GS snapped at the massive mare. \"Now Apple Bloom what's become of your sister and why is it you didn't care to tell nobody?\" Inquired the elder pony. Applejack kept her muzzle shut knowing better not to speak when Granny was this heated however in her silence she felt her flank beginning to spread wider on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She let out a small eek as she realized what was happening! As Apple Bloom continued to explained the situation to Granny Smith Applejack quickly got up nearly bumping into the ceiling now given those last few inches she had recently gained! Keeping her composure she bolted for the now seemingly impossible tiny door. \"Ah think I can manage to squeeze threw?\" She said not sounding thoroughly convinced. \"Now wait just one cotton pickin minute here big missy, Ah ain't finished with you!\" GS blurted out angrily as she watched the over-sized equine rush towards the front door. \"Sorry Granny, ah haven't got time to get chastised. Least not in here.\" AJ replied as she fiddled with they small doorknob as managed to get the entrance way open as she proceeded to get scrunch down as low as she possibly could in an attempt to crawl threw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't go changing the subject now AJ ah won't have disorder in mai house! GS demanded. \"Granny perhaps Applejack's right, it looks like she got even bigger! I purpose we continue this outside before BIG sis destroys our house!\"  AB desperately reasoned with her Grandmother as she watched curious anticipation at her sibling's escape attempt. \"Uhhgg, ah think I'm stuck ya'll.\" AJ stated as she struggled to get her plump plot threw the small opening. \"Oh ok, then you two but we WILL continue this! If you had just been straight with Granny you would not have put all of us in this predicament now would you?\" GS added in a very \"I told you so\" manner. \"Yeah ok Granny, hindsight's 20/20 and all but that isn't helping much at the moment. Ah feel like I'm trying get threw Winona's door.\" AJ snapped back with a fair amount of strain in her voice as creaking could be heard from around the door's frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Big Mac quick run out the back and help us pull from there!\"  AB commanded as she ran to assist her sister from behind. It was a little overwhelming being this close to AJ for her now as one half of her bottom was as big as her! \"Eeyup!\" responded BM as he headed swiftly out threw the back. GS frolicked as fast as she could over to AJ pressing up against the other impossibly huge backside half of AJ. \"It's like tryin to cram a ten pound cake into a four pound oven.\" GS stated sounding exhausted. \" Heh he, yeah ah just hope she doesn't poot.\" AB laughed as she made her own quip as she continued to throw her weight into the mare's humongous plot. \"Ah fail ta see how this is funny ya'll!\" AJ stated sounding more than a little annoyed as she was going through sufficient pain. Meanwhile Big Mac had appeared in front of her and having grabbed a rope attached to his plowing muzzle on the way, he couldn't wrap his head around the fact that his younger sibling's head was now larger than he was. \"Good thinkin bro, toss one end into my mouth and let's get this show on the road.\" AJ said relieved at her brothers quick wit. Having just now being close enough to realize this the stallion hesitated and froze in front of the giant mare. \"What's the matter Big guy? Come on now I have a plan. I'm still you little sister just bigger, you still trust me right?\" AJ stated innocently pleading for her brother's assistance. \"E-eeyup\" BM said timidly as he carefully tossed the rope into AJ's open muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He then turned away form the jumbo mare and began walking in that direction. \"That's it guys, keep it up\" AB stated triumphantly. Just then Granny Smith felt something else along with the slight progress, she could feel Applejack's backside expand all around her. \"Ahh no you don't, Applejack quit your growing!\" GS shouted as Applejack filled more and more of her vision. AB having felt it too began to worry. \"Ah Big Mac, is sis almost out?\" not being able to see around her elder sibling! \"Nnope\" Big Mac said after turning to survey the situation. All momentum had ceased as AJ desperately pushed forward with all her might with her limbs as the creaking of the frame grew louder. \" Alright Granny, Big Mac let's give Applejack one more great shove.\" AB stated not feeling yet deterred. \"Sounds good Apple Bloom, let's give it our Apple all.\" Eeyup\" BM rogered up from the other side of the immense pony with fatigue in his voice. \" Something's got to give, now Apple family on mia count. 1, 2, threeee!\" AB ordered as her whole family pushed and pulled in unison.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n With a deafening crack Applejack sprang forward with splendor as pieces of the frame came crashing down around her, Granny Smith, and Apple Bloom. GS and AB collapsed to the floor at Applejack massive hind hooves at the sudden removal of the wall that is Applejack's plot. Big Mac tumbled forward with a roll as the quick release of resistance from the door frame, much like a cork on a bottle. AJ is the cork and the bottle in the Apple residence. Big Mac turned to his enormous sibling who had rose to her feet and swayed her head in relief, she now stood an astounding 13 ft 11 in! \"Is everypony alright?\" AJ asked sounding genuinely concerned after dropping the rope from her muzzle. \"Yes' I think so.\" AB stated uncertainly. \"Yep, still kickin.\" GS stated. \"Eeyup!\" BM chimed in. \"Thank Celestia, ye-haw way to go Apple Bloom.\" AJ said gratefully.  </span></div></div>",

Besides if I had stopped yammering at ye you could have exited sooner!\" GS replied understandingly.

AJ arrives at the threshold of Twilight's castle a lot quicker but also with far to many nosy ponies goggling at her enlarged form. With fearful anticipation she laid a mighty knock upon the large entrance. After a moment she turned to begin her trek back not wanting to disturb her good friend so late, figuring that Twilight had to hear that because even she thought it was a little much. However before she could make a full stride the caste entryway creaked open. \"Hello.\" came a groggy male voice. \"Oh hey ya Spike, how you doing. Sorry to intrude so late, has Twilight already turned in for the night?\" AJ said nervously turning to face the dragon. \"Applejack,... is that you or am I still dreaming?\" Spike stated sleepily bewildered at the sight before him rubbing his eyes. \"Yeah, it is. Sorry there was no real way to break you in softly unfortunately with all of this.\" AJ said plainly while gesturing to her body. \"Jeez Applejack your BIG! Well hey, come get inside before you cause more of a commotion.\" Spike replied frankly \"Spike is everything alright, who was it at this hou...... r\" Came another puzzled voice as an Alicorn rounded the corner from atop the stairs. \"Heya Twilight, how are you this evening.\" AJ responded coyly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As Twilight descended the staircase she found herself astonished by Applejack's relative size, she was dwarfed by her even though she was still only halfway down the staircase! \"Applejack! What happened to you?\" Twilight said in a concerning tone. \"Oh this, I just thought I would try something new.\" Applejack replied jokingly \"Out with it already Applejack I know it isn't in your nature to be silly.\" Twilight said stating the facts and getting to the point. AJ drops the charade and explains the whole situation as well as all the facts she knows up to this point. \"So I was hopin you help.\" AJ finished the story up with a plea. \"So you ate a strange apple?\" Twilight asked plying detective trying to put all the pieces together. \"Yeah, that had to do it. So what do ya think Twilight do we got a shot.\" AJ asked tentatively. \"Well I think we could possibly work this out, I just don't know if we meed to enchant something edible or if I can cast a spell directly. Alright Applejack follow me let's go to the library and let me see what I can find. \"Sounds good Twilight, thank you.\" AJ said appreciatively as she followed Twilight into her study. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hmmm, these hexes just won't do.\" Twilight spoke definitively threw a mighty stack of books. \"Is everythin alright Twilight?\" AJ asked with trepidation in her voice. \"It's fine, don't worry Applejack. I CAN fix this, I just want to be absolutely sure these spells won't hurt you since I already ruled out enchantments for this case.\" Twilight responded calmly confident in her abilities. \"Oh alright, then.\" AJ replied sounding relieved. As time was passing Applejack felt her body changing once more. Her perspective shifted as she receded and bloomed out everything including Twilight seemingly shrank as her height rose, her eyes seeing much more as they settled on there new height. \"Ah, Twilight not to rush ya or nuttin but I'm still getting bigger!\" AJ stated in a slight panic. \"Oh I see, so you are!\" Twilight replied trying to keep her composure in the presence of her now 17 foot friend. \"Just a moment Applejack I do believe I've found a suitable spell.\" Twilight stated sternly \"That's great Twilight!\" AJ excitedly standing to her full height much to Twilight's surprise. \"I suppose I don't even need to ask if your ready then now do I?\" Twilight stated as she took her position in front of the extremely large mare. \"No siree.\" AJ said ready and willing as she braced herself. \"Alright here goes nothing\" Twilight said full of determination as her horn began glowing while taking aim. The Princess of friendship finally released the magic within her horn in a brilliant burst of light bound toward Applejack.</span></div></div>",

Twilight proudly held her stance as she witnesses the spell connect successfully. After a moment though she realizes that there is no change to AJ's stature. TS undeterred decides to simply up the ante and closes her eyes to focus as the beam emitting for her horn intensifies.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n AJ opens her eyes after several seconds after realizing herself she wasn't changing and saw a beam reflecting from her back down at Twilight unknown to her. After a second or so AJ noticed something odd about her friend. Twilight's body swelled up slightly before contracting upon itself. Twilight was shrinking! AJ blurted out in horror, \"Twilight cut it out yer shrinkin yourself\" in a desperate attempt to stop the Princess for Friendship from dwindling herself further! As the seconds with the reflected beam trained on it's new target Twilight's hooves took up less and less real estate upon her cobblestone floor. Despite AJ's plea Twilight continued to press on determined to restore the embodiment of honesty and replying with, \"It will be alright Applejack it only appears that way your vision is distorted by the spell, it's definitely working I can feel it!\" Said TS confidently in her voice only clearly a few octaves higher \"Ah bet you can seeing as your the one changing.\" AJ snidely remarked at TS's stubborn \"need\" to succeed as she continued to shrink in her hardheadedness. \"Alright Applejack we're nearly done here.\" TS said as she began to open her eyes as her spell winded down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The glow left AJ and subsequently faded off Twilight who only stood about 8 inches tall now. As Twilight came to her senses she finally noticed something had gone horribly wrong. Applejack was truly massive! She must have been the size of an elephant, or maybe even a medium sized Dragon! \"I so sorry Applejack, I just don't know what went wrong. I could have sworn I had this right.\" She pleaded to the hut sized Apple Farmer as she starred up at her in awe noticing something else off about the predicament. \"Don't worry your pretty LITTLE head bout Twi it's fine.\" AJ responded jovially with a smirk. Giving AJ a curious glace the reality of her situation began to dawn on her while responding, \"What's come over you Applejack? Your HUGE, isn't that more upsetting?\" TS stated sounding thoroughly confused and that's when she realized AJ's head hadn't hit her ceiling. \"Ha, ha Twilight your a real hoot. Ya don't see what's happened?\" AJ unable to suppress her amusement any further blurted out blissfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n This can't be right Applejack should be touching the ceiling by now, possibly even crouching slightly my ceiling is only about 20 feet high? Twilight contemplated and in a eureka moment it finally dawned on her, \"Unless you didn't grow, but rather I shrunk!\" TS gulped at her revelation as she truly surveilled her surrounding for the first with that thought in mind only to confirm just that. \"I'M TINY!\" TS exclaimed in a extremely high pitch that came off as little more than squeak at this point. \"Ha, ha Twilight knock it off your killin me!\" AJ continued to laugh until she reached the point of hysterics. \"It's NOT funny Applejack, what do you suppose we do now?\" TS replied angrily. \"Sorry Twi, it's just that it took you so long to figure it out what happened after ah tried warnin ya. Besides now evey time ya speak ya sound like one of Fluttershy's critters.\" AJ explained the humor in the event as best she could. \"Yeah real funny Apple GIANT, now let's try to figure this out.\" TS replied coldly not amused by this predicament. \"Jeez Twiny, I'm jus trin to lighten the mood.\" AJ responded sounding dejected. \"Huh, it is a little funny when you think about it and I'm sorry Applejack I just don't handle stress well. That's all.\" TS chuckled sightly realizing she shouldn't snap at AJ seeing as she's scared too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Aw It's Ok Twi, I shouldn't have laughed at your expense, maybe when this is all solved but not now. Ah jus couldn't help myself I suppose.\" AJ stated apologetically not wanting to deter her friends help. Once again a all to familiar feeling began stirring up within AJ as TS spoke, \"You said you heard a strange yet familiar cackle where you discovered the apple right?\" Applejack's body recoiled before bursting upward once again, \"No dag nabbit, not again!\" AJ pleaded to no avail as her head struck the ceiling forcefully, \"Ouch!\" AJ cried as she repositioned her expanding body as her flank ballooned in all directions and her hooves spread across the floor inching towards the tiny equine. \"Oh my!\" was all TS could muster seeing the colossal mare from her new perspective. It was one thing to watch Applejack get bigger at her normal height but quite another spectacle from a vantage point below the 1 foot mark. Stopping just shy of 24 feet AJ had a look of absolute worry and pain upon her face as she said, \"Twi do you think we could take this outside?\" \"S-sure of course!\" TS stammered more than a little spooked as she raised the hoof closest to AJ's museum pillar sized leg until it made contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n TS initiated the transport spell placing the pair just behind her castle and continued to think about the botched spell. \"That has to be it..........chaos magic. Discord!\" TS blurted out putting two and two together. \"Ya think, ah had a hunch but had forgotten all bout that, in all this hulla ba lu.\" AJ stated in an understanding manor. \"It has to be, I had the spell correct but due to the unpredictable nature of chaos magic it reflected off you and onto me!\" TS continued to make a case for her theory. \"Yup this DOES seem like something that schemin Draconequus would do.\" AJ stated sounding more than a little annoyed. \"It's settled then we should head for Fluttershy's cottage to see if we can summon him to reverse this.\" TS spoke in a commanding manor. \"Ah Twilight do you really want to go like that or would you rather restore yourself?\" AJ asked tentatively. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Applejack seemed to shrink before, though she checked her surroundings to make sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Twi, this time I ain't getting smaller, you're getting bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight breathed a sigh of relief as she grew back to what she assumed was her normal size (at least judging by her surroundings), but her eyes widened  as everything continued to shrink. Applejack raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twi I think you might want to stop that spell now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight concentrated, willing her spell to end, but it did not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terminate spell! Terminate spell! Why isn't this working?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno much about alicorn magic or unicorn magic or whatever yah cast, but maybe this chaos magic is to blame?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight kept trying to end the spell and with each failure she was breathing faster and faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My magic! This can't be happening!\" Twilight screamed. She was nearly half of Appeljack's size and growing by the second.. Applejack placed a hoof on her shoulder.<br>\r\n\"Calm down Twi, we've got through strange things than this, and I'm here with you. Breath in, breath out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was up to AJ's stomach now and hoped she wouldn't get much bigger. tried to do so, applying the breathing exercises she learn from Cadance. She was still breathing faster than normal and her mane was messy but she seemed calmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. Thank you. I'm sure DIscord can fix this. Everything is going to be just fine!\" She added with a nervous giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's nice having another giant mare to keep me company\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha....\" Twilight laughed nervously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let's get going to Fluttershys! But ah we need to be careful cause if we both just go stomping we'll spoke her good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I can teleport us most of the way there and then one of us can approach slowly and whipser to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok get ready\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's horn lit again and they found themselves in the everfree forest, what would be a minute or two away from Fluttershy's cottage if they were at their normal sizes, but only a few steps away at their current sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah think I should make the approach.\" Applejack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok but be careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack walked as quietly and softly towards the cottage as her giant size would allow. She bent down, lowering her voice to a near whisper, only for a familiar yellow shape to leap into the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEEEEEEEPPPPP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fluttershy calm ya horseshoes it's me Applejack! I'm just a bit bigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy flailed around in the air for a few seconds the stopped, giving Applejack another look over. She slowly landed on her snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Applejack? Sorry I didn't expect you to be so big. And you look different without your hat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it turns out Stretsons don't quite come in ma size. Unless Rarity is willing to sew a bunch of mine together or somethun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sorry. Though what brings you here? I'd like to help you but- EEEEEEPP!\" She leapt into the air again at the sight of Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried to cancel the magic that effected Applejack and I got hit with it to. I'm still me, I'm not going to go on a rampage or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy flew towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I was just surprised to see another giant pony. I mean one giant pony was surprising but I wasn't expecting two of them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight sighed again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither Fluttershy. Me niether. Anyway is Discord here? We think one of his apples might have done this and we're hoping he'll be able to fix Applejack<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once she had succesfully created an aura around herself the rear exit door of the castle creaked open to reveal a groggy pinkish lavander unicorn behind it. The lavander and light blue striped maned equine proceeded to step out oto the clearing as the magic that had formed around TS began to dissipate into a stream that was seemingly no longer interested in staying attached to her. The magical energy quickly reformed into a steady beam and redirected itself, bolting towards it's newly acquired target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Starlight, look out!\" AJ screamed as she watched the spell rush towards the understudy of friendship. The magic struck Starlight Glimmer completly enveloping the mare and after a couple of moments changes began. Her mane and tail retracked before pushing and filling out more and more, the pony's back and flank slumped downwad and inward and then procceded to rise and swell larger and larger. Her hooves simultaneously receded before spreading out across the clearing's gravel with her head dwindling before ballooning to a greater size. The magic then dissolved having fulfilled it's purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Well this is certainly new but Twilight might I ask, why have you decided to enlarge me?\" SG inquired nonchlantly with sleepiness in her tone. The 9 foot 2 inch pony was still trying to peice together the absurd situation confused by the sight, curious as to whether Applejack and herself were in fact that big or was Twilight just really tiny?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I wasn't..... It wasn't meant for you! You have impeccable timing, I was attempting to enlarge myself! Stated the little pony cleary frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, well then what happened? The spell shouldn't have done that.\" SG asked plainly still pretty tired but strangely calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Then in an irritated tone while in unison both the gaint and the tiny mares respond with, \"Chaos magic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I see that makes sense, tricky stuff.\" SG replied not missing a beat in a matter of fact manner. TS and AJ then calmed down and proceeded to clue SG into the dilemma they have been plagued with all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Jeez, Applejack that's quite the tale and Twilight I'm so sorry things have gotten this bad. But hey look on the bright side you've got me now and I'm certain the two of us can fix this!\" SG said confidetly to her teacher and aquaintance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I don't know Starlight, this chaos magic has been a real pain.\" \"Not to mention unpredictable.\" TS replied defeated before AJ added angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Come on now Twilight, you mean to tell me that a little enlargement enchantment has completely bested one of the greatest alicorns to ever walk equestria! I don't by it, it's chaos right? We just gotta approach this at a different angle that's all!\" SG stated triumphantly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Do you really think this is a good idea Starlight, I mean look at me!\" TS squeaked as she pleaded her case while gesturing to her 8 inch frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, in fact I think it's a great idea. We'll never know unless we try right? Beside if I'm wrong then we could just track down that Draconequuus.\" SG said firmly standing her ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well one thangs for sure ya'll should probably decide here soon, cause we've still got a growin pony over here!\" AJ panicly stated as she felt the sensation all over again. AJ's flank shrank ever so slightly then billowed out signifigantly afterward, her body dipped towards the ground then rose termendously, the counrty pony's head decreased in mass before bulging outward again. AJ's legs and hooves shortened and diminished then thickened, lengthened, and spread out in diameter. Her yellow mane and tail recoiled followed by blooming out again. This was SG's first time witnessing this and she was astonished by the show watching the simple ebodiment of honesty becoming 32 feet tall all at once was incredible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wow, your not kinding!\" SG stated dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Aww shucks, ah really am gettin tired of all this!\" AJ whined sounding completely frustrated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n SG looked down and gave her mentor a nod and said, \"What do you say Princess, wanna give it another whirl? There's no time like the present!\" SG still undetured almost as if she was more motivated than ever now, after seeing the effect on the huge mare first hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's going to be alright Applejack, Starlight's right if I focus on containment and direction of the magic while she performs the spell we may have a real shot!\" TS stated bluntly sounding more hopefull than she had been in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well ah supose ya have a point, granny always said two ponies are better than one!\" AJ concured sounding a little less upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"OK, it's settled then. Now who's first, Applesaurous, The Inredible Shrinking Alicorn, or Starlight The 9 ft Wonder?\" SG inquired enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Twilight looks up at AJ and states, \"It's up to you Big Gal, what do you want to do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey ya, Big Mac. Are you wrappin up too?\" AJ asked with a slight condescending tone. \"Ehh yep\" Big Mac nonchalantly replied. Applejack stared her bother up and down and couldn't help but notice that he seemed smaller overall. She chocked it up to euphoria caused by the boost in confidence from her one buck harvesting earlier. \"Hey Big Mac, guess wut?\" Said AJ smugly. \"Hmmm\" BM replied with a cocky tone not paying his sister much attention. \"I believe ya now about that one buck all apples yield.\" AJ stated competitively. \"Pshh\" BM responded lazily not sounding impressed but turning to finally face his sibling for the first time since this encounter stated. \"I believe you oh brother of mine because in the back there ah did it!\" AJ stated boisterously bragging about the event. As he gazed upon his sister something definitely seemed off about Applejack Big Mac thought, and it wasn't her pompous attitude she was always competitive. \"Shhsh\" BM muttered in disbelief. \"Oh, don't believe me do ya. Well frankly I'm glad!\" AJ replied brazen with overconfidence. \"Nope\" BM stated matter-of-factly. \"Is this here your last tree in your section?\" AJ asked sternly. \"Eh yep\" BM answered swiftly. \"Perfect, now stand back and I'll give you a demonstration even though ah already finished my share for the day.\" AJ said happily wearing a smug grin one her face. As applejack passed by Big Mac he figured out what was bothering him about his sister, she wasn't a whole lot shorter than him! \"eh\" He manged to mutter unsure of what his eyes where telling him. Applejack approached the tree and placed her front hove on it looking up ad counted 18 bushels out loud and proceeded to get in bucking position. She wound her back legs up and maintained a steady balance with her front legs, Applejack then closed her eyes to focus just before releasing her kick. She landed a devastating blow to the trunk causing a louder than normal crack and one by one all 18 bushels came down with tremendous thuds. Big Mac's eyes went wide he could not believe what he had just witnessed, he walked over to the plant to survey the haul with his mouth agape. \"Not to shabby eh?\" Applejack stated absolutely beaming. 'Eh yep\" Big Mac responded bewilderingly still trying to understand and slowly putting the pieces together. He stared up at the tree as he walked around seeing if maybe she missed one or two bushels, but no the were positively no more apples in this particular tree. As this was going on Applejack was growing again while she dusted herself off. Once he reached the front again he stopped to survey the spot where the impact occurred he made a starling discovery. There was some bark chipped off the tree in the spot Applejack kicked as well as slight cracking, Big Mac had never seen such a thing before. She really did some damage! He turned to look at his sister to bring it to her attention and gasped at what he saw in front of him, it was Applejack but she wasn't the same. \"Huhh?\" Was all he could muster as he stared in denial at his significantly larger sister. She wasn't taller that him but she sure was close to it, and there father's hat was definitely more snug it looked a little silly to be honest. \"What's the matter Big Mac, you look perplexed?\" AJ stated not quite noticing yet. \"Eh y-yep\" stammered BM sheepishly. \"Oh look at that there I did quite a number on this here poor tree. Be a dear and keep this our little secret. Can you do that for me Big Mac?\" AJ asked regretfully sprinkled with an ounce of shame. \"Eh yep\" BM responded dutifully as if rogering up to orders. \"Thanks a bunch \"Big\" Mac your a real sweetie pie.\" Applejack said nicely as she looked over at her brother and couldn't help but notice looked a lot smaller than normal. \"Eh yep\" replied Big Mac confused and more than a little weirded out by his sister sudden height increase, this would take some getting use to. Applejack and Big Mac began picking up the apples and putting them in the last bucket before loading them onto his cart. \" So Big Mac do you know what Granny's got planned for super?\" AJ asked innocently. Big Mac thought for a moment before responding with a simple, \"Nope\". The two headed back to the barn side by side raising to nearly the same height, Applejack had a bit of difficulty managing her cart due to it not being adjusted to her new size properly.  </span></div></div>",

Supper is nearly ready!\" Called the elderly pony with an apple pie on her flank as the duo approached the inner garden past the front gate. \"Yea it's us Granny, be there in a minute. Gotta drop our haul off in the barn k.\" AJ responded respectfully. This is when Big Mac turned to his sibling and motioned for her to head on inside ahead of him. \"Wha, Big Mac you wanna take care of mai wagon?\" AJ asked tentatively. \"Eeyup.\" BM replied sternly. \"Why that's mighty kind of ya Big Mac, thank you. Say this wouldn't have anything to do about that bucking earlier now would it?\" AJ gratefully responded while questioning Big Mac's motives. \"Nnope.\" Big Mac stated firmly trying not to divulge the true reason was being so helpful. \"Welp see ya inside then \"Big\" fella.\" AJ stated playfully with her muzzle displaying a smirk. A little taken aback Big Mac nodded and turned to face the barn as Applejack disconnected from her cart. The truth was Big Mac would rather put the carts away then face the awkwardness that was sure to follow Applejack's entrance to there home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Evenin ya'll\" AJ greeted her family fondly. Apple Bloom who had only just now seen her sister since the change looked over at the mare and responded, \"Howdy sis......?\" As Apple Bloom confusingly addressed Applejack not sure she was seeing things right Granny Smith said bluntly, \"Took ya long enough Applejack?\" \"Yea decided to get a little ahead and knock an extra row out on the orchard.\" AJ replied truthfully. \"Oh, OK then however Applejack don't go overworking yourself now\" GS stated sounding concerned. With Apple Bloom still holding a puzzled expression as Applejack made her way towards the washroom. \"What's a matter sugar cube?\" AJ inquired noticing just how small Apple Bloom seemed as she passed her by. \"Oh, nothin. Say where's Big Mac?\" AB snapping out of a daydream esk state before quickly changing the subject. \"Alright then\" AJ replied as she stepped into the washroom. Big Mac crossed they're home's threshold soon after wearing a concerned look upon his face. Apple Bloom rushed to confront Big Mac to discretely as possible to confirm her suspicions.\"Big Mac is does Applejack seem BIGGER to you? AB carefully asked her brother desperately trying to maintain her sanity. \"Eeyup!\" BM stated bluntly. \"What are you two on about now? I can hear you bickerin bout something!.\" GS asked sounding a little agitated by they're blatant secrecy. \"Nothing at all Granny, just planning a goof on Applejack.\" AB answered wittily not wanting to alarm the old mare. \" Now you know I love a good goof but be nice to Applejack, lord knows she works mighty hard around here.\" GS says wisely. With that Big Mac heads towards the washroom and passes Applejack on the way. Still a little put off/intimidated by her new size he keeps his focus straight ahead. Applejack notes the odd behavior of her brother who is normally confident if not a little pompous but she just shrugs it off and goes over to Apple Bloom to assist her in finishing setting the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After a moment Big Mac returns from the washroom and joins the girls and takes his seat across from Granny Smith. \"Apple Bloom states the following while staring down at her bowl of delicious smelling stew, \"Thanks for the grub Granny.\" \"Yes, thank you Granny. This looks great!\" AJ politely states. \"Eeyup.\" BM concurs gratefully. \"Aww, you young ins are quite welcome. Now dig in.\" GS responds sweetly appreciative of the acknowledgement. The supper goes smoothly with the family sharing funny musings about they're day, however Big Mac and Apple Bloom couldn't help hlp be concerned of they're siblings new developments. Especially Big Mac who had noticed the change after that last tree she bucked it was then that he heard Applejack begin to recall that very story to the lime green mare, \"Yeah Granny it sure was somethin, ya should have seen the look on Big Mac's face as he surveyed all 18 bushels on the ground.\" Applejack said gleefully as her body once again contracted and ballooned larger still if only a little bit polishing off her first bowl. Apple Bloom's eyes bugged out cartoonishly with her mouth agape before turning to glace at her brother in astonishment. \"Ha ha, now don't go gettin to BIG for your britches Applejack.\" GS jokingly sounding ironically oblivious to what just happened despite her on point word choice. \" I'll try not to Granny, but I'll need to show you sometime.\" AJ obliged also seemly not picking up on the oddly contradictory statement as she reached for another helping of stew. Big Mac returned a dumbfounded look at his little sister sharing in her disbelief as he was pretty certain that he had just become the second largest apple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Cautiously the pair remained silent during the rest of the meal not sure what to say or do, or even what to make of this whole ordeal but they new they had to do something! Applejack finished her second bowl and stood up to her even newer height, she was now Big Mac's height of 5ft 2in. \"Well night ya'll,I'm mighty tired from the days work. Thanks again Granny the meal was fantastic!\" Applejack said as she receded before ascending a little further into the air to the height of 5ft 9in! \"Goodnight sweetie!\" GS replied as she joined her grand kids in they're disbelief in the fact that Applejack now stood nearly 6 feet. \"Night.\" was all Apple Bloom could muster after what she just witnessed. \"Eeyup.\" BM said sounding both concerned and scared. Applejack wasn't sure why her family had just taken such a weird tonal shift in they're responses, she also didn't quite understand why the table looked so much lower than it had been. She shrugged it of though and just chocked it up to being weary and headed upstairs to her room for some much deserved rest.    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   At the crack of dawn a the familiar noise of a roosters call can be heard outside of Applejack's window as she quietly begins to stir in her sleep. \"Mornin already?\" The mare said sleepily as she turned on her mattress causing an audible creak in the oak foundation. \"Hey Applejack you up?\" came the voice of a filly from the other side of her room at her door. \"Yep I'm up Apple Bloom, thanks.\" Replied Applejack groggily. \"Are ya decent?\" Apple Bloom said in anxiously her voice full of trepidation. \"Naw Apple Bloom just fixin to step out of bed now, so give me a minute would ya.\" AJ protested. \"Yeah, OK sure just wanted to return your brush is all.\" said the filly timidly. Applejack aimed her eyes straight to the dresser where she kept her brush and confirmed it's absence. \"It's alright Apple Bloom just leave it in the washroom I'll get it there, really wish you would ask me to borrow it first though.\" AJ stated sounding slightly annoyed. \"Sorry, guess I thought you wouldn't mind. Anyway Granny's almost got breakfast ready so.....\" Apple Bloom genuinely responded. \"It's fine and yeah your right I wouldn't normally mind but ya see Rarity gave me it so.\" AJ blissfully reminisced. \"Ah, that makes sense. Alright see you downstairs!\" Apple Bloom said sheepishly. \"Alright, time to start the day then.\" Applejack said as her eyes darted around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Something felt off earlier when she was scanning for her favorite brush and now that she was beginning to rise out of bed those feelings only amplified. \"Just what the hey's going on here?\" She stated puzzled at the sight of her hind legs poking out from underneath her blanket and off the end of her bed frame. She looked back and noticed her pillow had also shifted clear to the headboard and as she moved her body her bed was squeaking the whole time! She brought her legs over to the side of the bed and finally rolled out and up out of it. Once she stood all the way up it hit her, \"This ain't right.\" She said with a hint of panic as she clearly noticed the field of vision change. \"THIS can't be right.\" Said the mare who had unknowingly gained 9 more inches in her sleep. Her eyes shot straight to the floor hoping against hope that she was standing on something that would elevate her vision to such a degree, even though that wouldn't explain why everything also looked smaller. When she spotted nothing but her orange hooves planted firmly on the wood floor her heart sank. \"This can't be happenin, I'M HUGE!\" She exclaimed realizing her plight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What am ah gonna do? I can't let the fam see me like this, they'll freak?\" AJ contemplated her options as calmly as possible. \"Ah know I'll go see Twilight she'll know what to do.\" AJ stated sounded relieved in the idea of consulting her good friend. \"OK Applejack you got a plan now, just play it cool you CAN do this\" She said psyching herself up to face her family before her departure. Applejack awkwardly managed to make her way downstairs despite the now seemly cramped passageways of her home. \"Shoot if this continues I'm going to need to stay in the barn.\"  She stated quietly to herself as her hooves touched down on the first floor landing. \"Mornin sleepyhead, get enough rest?\" Granny Smith said with glee. \"Pssffft\" Big Mac spit out some of his apple juice as his gaze met his sister's much larger form. \"You alright there Big Mac, he he.\" Applejack chuckled at her brothers fopaux. \"Eeyup\" BM said embarrassingly. \"Morning Granny, well yeah I did actually. Thank you\" Applejack replied politely as Apple Bloom turned and looked up from her plate of grits at her sibling. \"Yeah I say she did, I suppose it's true what they say a growing girl needs her rest.\" Apple Bloom said in a sassy tone. \"Silly Apple Bloom ah am a grown mare I don't need no more growing, I was just tired is all. Now go on and finish your breakfast.\" AJ said nervously not entirely convinced in her own words as she took a seat at the table. \"Ah don't know Applejack maybe your sister's on to something, your trotting does sound a bit heavy.\" GS responded tersely full of wisdom. \"Eeyup\" BM concurred \"Naw, I think I just put on some weight is all.\" AJ stated confidently as she began eating. \"Nnope\" BM rejected quickly. \"It's alright Applejack, we are here for you. You don't have to hide anything from us, we're family.\" AB affectionately reasoning with her older sister. The table went quiet as they continued to eat.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n After a few minutes of silence Applejack tried to break it and change the subject with,\"What do ya'll have planned for today?\" \"Well ah know what needs to be done, so I'll make sure Big Mac handles it but in the meantime ah need you to go find out what's causing this and if it can be cured.\" GS replied not having any of Applejack's distractions. \"OK Granny I'll do it, sorry for being so stubborn. Ah don't know what caused it unless it was that strange apple? It was so dang good though.\" AJ caved as she finished her meal and told the family about the details of the odd apple encounter. \"Well that certainly sounds like it could be something!\" AB said enthusiastically as she pondered the thought of such power she could wield if she found the unique fruit, after all she wouldn't mind being a little taller herself. It was then when Applejack felt something building up inside her, \"Uh-oh, I think it's happening ya'll.\" As she finished her statement her entire body recoiled inward before pushing outward again, her hind and front legs stretched ever so slightly, her stomach pressed into the table bit by bit, her mane and tail lowered and curled on the floor, her plot thickened and spread in diameter, and her muzzle elongated as her head grew bigger and bigger. She Quickly rose to her feet now standing roughly an impressive 7 foot 1! \"Alright then ya'll take take care now I bes be going before I can't make it out of here.\" She said timidly sounding more than a little scared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"See you later deary and don't worry I'll have Apple Bloom move your thing to the barn and have them ready for you when you return.\" GS said sweetly full of support. \"Bye Applejack, good luck!\" AB said lovingly \"Eeyup\" BM added sincerely. With that Applejack headed toward the door ready to start her journey, as she does so she turns to the hat rack where Bright Mac's hat rested and thinks about taking such an important item. In the end wisely deciding against it since it would just make her size stand out that much more. \"See you later ya'll, take care.\" AJ said as she ducked under the door frame and passed threw unsure if she would ever be able to get in again. Trying not to dwell on this fact to much the over-sized mare took the path threw her front gate and embarked on this new strange quest not sure where it might lead.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \"Man nothing beats a nice summer evening flight above town.\" Said a light blue rainbow maned Pegasus to herself blissfully. Rainbow Dash was enjoying a leisurely glide threw town on her way home from an intense day of pranking with Pinkie Pie. \"Man Mayor Mare really didn't expect that ink bottle to explode like that! Ha ha ha.\" RD burst out in uncontrollable laughter as she recalled the incident. After wiping the tears that had formed from her eyes off her face she noticed something strange below walking near the fountain. The town wasn't empty by any means but certainly the hustle and bustle from the day had calmed but amongst the sparing few townsfolk was her dear friend Applejack near that very fountain. However something was off about her and it wasn't the fact she was not sporting her trademark hat, it was her size. She looked larger not just taller either but bigger all around, but that couldn't be right. Could it, RD thought to herself as she made another pass at rubbing her eyes to see if her eyes were deceiving her as she stated, \"I'm just tired there is no way Applejack grew, right?\" After she finished she focused once more at the jumbo mare, and the unbelievable sight hadn't changed. Her good friend was still towering over the other citizens. RD decided to fly closer to get a better look but was hesitant to call out to her. As she got closer AJ's exaggerated form became more and more imposing the closer she got causing an unusual sense of dread and intimidation to sweep over her. Making it temporarily unable for her to speak to her enlarged friend.    <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Hey ya Applejack, going for an evening stroll.\" RD said as casually as she could muster in her current nervous state. RD waited timidly for her friends reply after finally stirring up the courage to address her friend as she landed. She indeed felt small standing alongside Applejack with her sight being level with AJ's bountiful flank, despite this she ultimately decided that AJ no matter what size was is no threat. \"Oh hey Rainbow Dash, yeah ah suppose I am, just on mah way to Twilight's.\" AJ responded in kind with a look of general unease.This snapped RD's irrational fear away and AJ's worries became apparent in that moment, telling RD that what she needed the comfort of a true true friend. \"So how was your day, anything interesting happen? RD asked the obvious still trying to keep the conversation casual and not directly addressing the nearly baby sized elephant question in the air. This approach only served to make the exchange more awkward than it already was causing AJ to get slightly annoyed, \"Gee ah don't know it was pretty normal all things considered besides the whole Orange apple that made me GIANT!\" Taken aback RD flinched slightly before mustering a witty but ill advised albeit under her breath retort, \"I don't know about giant Applejack, you are big for sure but I think you need a couple more feet for that status.\" With a tinge of unimpressed boasting in her tone. \"Are we really arguing semantics right now Rainbow Dash? Look at me I'm HUGE ah don't care if I don't technically classify as [giant] to you.\" AJ stated almost shouting and clearly angry even going as far to attempt air quotes with her hooves on the word giant. RD just stood there in awe in her friends presence as she watched with her mouth agape the enormous equine get off her front hooves for a second and making the ridiculous gesture highlighting the contrast between the ponies making it that much more evident.Making an audible gulp in realizing her mistake before continuing with, \"Gosh I'm sorry Applejack ok, you know tenderness isn't my specialty. That's Fluttershy's thing, please don't get angry with me!\" RD said more than a little spooked. AJ turned to notice the small group of ponies around town had stopped what they were doing and were looking their way and murmuring to themselves before looking back down at the clearly frightened RD. \"Aw sugar cube I'm not angry at you, ah am frustrated with this whole situation. Now can we continue this a little more near Twilight's place I don't want to draw any more attention.\" AJ said with reasoning and calmness in her voice. \"Y-yeah sure no problem Applejack, whatever you need. I'm here for you.\" RD replied honestly gathering her composure. \"Thanks Rainbow Dash you are always there for me and I appreciate that.\" AJ responded frankly full of affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The two girls continued to conversate as they approached the castle. AJ was a little tired of recapping the story up to this point but figured it would only continue as she encountered more of her friends, so there really was no point in complaining about it. \"So this apple is your only lead? Twilight is a great start but maybe we should tell Rarity as well.\" RD said reassuringly trying to throw as many idea's AJ's way as possible. \"Ha and what give her a heart attack in the process besides what is she going to do make me an enormous hat?\" AJ stated gleefully clearly enjoying her joke. \"Ha ha no, to do an investigation for you. She really loves that stuff!\" RD chuckling before adding confidently. \"Naw, let's keep it to the fam, you, an Twilight for now OK. I don't need everypony knowing about mah predicament.\"  \"Alright fair enough, but it sure would be cool to show you off to a small group of ponies. You could really put on a performance, especially if you get even BIGGER!\" \"Now Rainbow Dash you know darn well I don't want to be some spectacle and I sure as cow dung don't wanna get any bi......\" AJ sternly proclaimed before being cut off by the fear of that all to familiar feeling building within her. \"What's wrong Applejack?\" RD puzzled as she watched an incredible event unfold. AJ's entire body receded and shuttered inwards before releasing and rising and expanding in all directions once more. \"No, not again!\" AJ cried in terror as her four hooves spread in all directions covering more and more circumference individually as they spread across the ground while she maintained her balance. Her tail and mane lengthened brilliantly in the light as her back rose higher and higher, her noggin swelled larger in sync with the rest of her vast body. \"A-applejack...., are you alright?\" RD stammered with genuine concern as keeping her eyes glued on her greatly enlarged friend who had to be at least 8 foot 3 now! \"Yeah I'm fine Rainbow Dash, I just want this to end.\" AJ replied appreciatively but with a god amount of sadness in her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After a short pause RD comforted AJ with,\"Don't worry Applejack I'm sure Twilight can fix this!\" RD said full of confidence in those words. \"Ah sure hope so.\" AJ responded sounding a little more chipper. \"On a side note though it was pretty awesome to watch!\" RD stated enthusiastically. \"Watch it Rainbow Dash, that ain't helping!\" AJ said sounding a little annoyed but also a little happier that RD had managed to get her mind off it a bit. The pair eventually got to Twilight's castle's great doorway. \"What do you wanna do Big gal, you want me to handle the knocking so I can ease Twilight into all this?\" RD asked helpfully. \"Do ya think I'd cause that much of a ruckus?\" AJ answered tentatively. In the end Applejack decides to................  </span></div></div>",

I suppose you otta take care of the knocking an explaining.\" Applejack said nervously with her mind made up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No problem Applejack, I've got this!\" Rainbow Dash confidently stated as she put her hoof up to the door and gave it a substantial knock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Jeez Rainbow, and ya figure I'd be loud!\" AJ commented sounding quite displeased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Perhaps, but I need to be sure they heard it. It's a big place after all.\" RD stated trying to justify her actions. A couple of momments pass with no answer and RD prepares a second softer knocking. After administering the knock she let's out a sigh and turns to AJ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Whelp if they didn't hear that first set I doubt they're home. Thanks anyway sugar cube.\" AJ says definitively as the 8 foot+ mare turns to leave the premises joined by the rainbow maned wonder bolt . After taking only a few steps the pair hear a breaking of wooden seal followed by a slow creak. The pair turn to see a pinkish lavander colored mare with a purple and light blue swirled mane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Rainbow Dash, Applejack? What brings you two here? The pony at the threshold politely inquires trying to make sense of the sight in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Starlight, I'm so glad you answered we were just about to leave.\" RD enthusiastically states as she zooms back to the castle door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes well sorry to intrude at such an hour Starlight, but Twilight wouldn't happen to be home now would she?\" AJ asked tentatively fearing the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh it's not an intrusion at all Applejack I was simply catching up on my shows, however to answer the question no Twilight and Spike have left to Canterlot on official Princess bussiness I'm afraid.\" Starlight Glimmer delivered the news with tact but noticed the disappointment on AJ's face. Since AJ hadn't approached the mare yet she still wasn't fully aware of her situation by glancing but had a hunch something was off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ah see that's mighty unfortunate, well thank ya kindly for your time Starlight. Enjoy the rest of your evening.\" AJ said defeatedly as she turned to walk away once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hold on a second Applejack! Is there anything I can do for you, perhaps send a summons to the Princess?\" SG pleaded to her dejected acquaintance with a lingering curiosity in the back of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"She's right Applejack, you came all this way for help. I don't see why she can't try?\" RD reasoned with the enlarged farmhand once again stopping her in her tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs SG continued to stare at the orange mare the thing that had been bugging her finally clicked and she calmly asked. \"Say Applejack, how TALL are you? I've never asked so I don't really know but now I'm definitely curious.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ahh well ya see, funny you should ask that cuz.....\" AJ began to reply shyly as RD gleefully interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"She's like over 8 FEET tall or something, it's AWESOME!\" RD answered blissfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Eight feet! Yikes I figured you were taller but OMC!\" SG responded flabbergasted <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I know, it's nutz right!\" RD added gushing slightly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ah can't believe ya convinced me that you could ease anypony into anything! I must be a dang fool, ya haven't got a subtle bone in your body Rainbow Dash!\" AJ stated annoyed at her friends lack of tact.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's ok Applejack, I figure this is what you came for yes?\" SG asked to get the conversation back on track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes Starlight I'm afraid this an't stoppin either.\" AJ confessed with worry in her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I see, well do you know what caused it in the first place?\" SG aprehinsively inquired as the extra large mare approached her for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ goes over in detail of the events that transpired throughout the course of her day thus far as she felt a fimiliar build up of energy inside her gut. \"Ah shoot I guess it's that blasted time again!\" She exclaimed as the changes began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What is it Applejack? Are you O.....\" SG asked concernedly before she lost her words in awe as she witnessed a bewildering transformation of magic, the likes of which she had ever seen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of AJ's hooves shrank before expanding on the pavement until they were 9% larger, her back dipped before rising into the setting sun's horizon most of which could not be seen now threw the eyes of the mare thanks to AJ's expansion. Her flank receded before puffing out until it was more pronounced, her mane and tail unnaturally recoiled inward before lengthening outward again to match the rest of her body. Her head ebbed in on itself slightly before bursting out in an exaggerated motion until it too matched her now 9ft 5in body!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh my that looked painful, are you OK?\" SG asked timidly taken aback by the sheer size of the pony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah I'm fine, thanks for askin though.\" AJ answered dejectedly sounding a little more than just worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wow, that was amazing! I gotta record this somehow.\" RD squeed insensitively once again showing she did NOT read the situation correctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Rainbow Dash that is NOT appropriate, can't you tell she's hurting?\" SG snaps at RD scolding her for her outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Jeez sorry for trying to lighten the mood, besides can't she see the benefits to being huge? I know I would have a blast!\" RD states desperately reasoning that AJ souldn't be so gloomy about all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But that's just it Rainbow Dash she's NOT you and she's scared, understandably so. I would want to fix this asap if it were me.\" SG sagely advised deescalating the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Your absolutely right Starlight, I'm sorry Applejack. I shouldn't project my inferences onto you, you are your own mare.\" RD deduced remorsefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ah it's ok Rainbow, ah know you were jus tryin to cheer me up and ah appreciate that. Besides all your confounded jabber keeps my head straight believe it or not. Ha ha.\" AJ replied sounding ever so upbeat and joyful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well if that's all settled then, what do you say Mondo Mare want me to take a crack at it?\" SG confidently asked with a grin across her face.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Applejack your a genius!\" SG squeed loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well now, I don't know about that. Just a lucky guess, that's all.\" AJ humble as ever denies the notion as an extra obvious blush appears across her mussel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wow Applejack, real subtle. Can't tell your pleased with yourself at all.\" RD chimes in sarcastically referencing her large friends basful demeanor.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ha Hum, well in any case are you ready Applejack, to return to normal?\" SG chuckling at RD's observance then asking the enlarged mare to prepare for the reversal spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ready as I'll ever be puddin.\" AJ stated faithfully fixing her stance as she did, standing to her full height proudly for the first time since this all began. Hoping against hope that this will be the last time she will EVER be this big. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright then here goes nothing.\" SG states as her horn flared up with magic in a swirling pattern following the grooves concentrating at it's peak before producing a stream headed straight for AJ. Upon impact an agressive flash of lavender light blinded everypony momentarily before engulfing the 9 foot 5 mare in magic. The magical aura surrounding the immense pony turned a lighter shade of purple before changing entirely to yellow leaving AJ unaffected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yellow, that's not right.\" SG said quizzically as she watched the magic slowly flow around then off AJ's body and build up near the tip of her nose then transforming into a bolt like stream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh no, Rainbow Dash LOOK OUT!\" having cut of the spell at this point realizing something was definitely wrong SG desperately called out in vain noticing to late that the newly formed beam was already headed torwards the bystander. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Huh.\" was all the unaware rainbow maned equine could muster as the beam struck her hard in the side bringing her to the ground with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Rainbow ah you alright?\" AJ cried out concerned for her very good friend while SG gasped in shock. \"I'm so sorry Rainbow Dash, it all happened so fast.\" SG added sounding quite bothered by the event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ergg, oh man what was that? Y-yeah I think I'm OK, I do feel kinda funny though.\" The yellow magic hadn't enveloped RD like it had AJ it just evaporated as soon as it hit kind of like a firework against her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving stated this RD began to get to her feet but as she did her legs jolted and streched outwards, her wings spread out brilliantly wider and wider, her backside rose and distended signifigantly, her mane and tail elongated brilliantly as her head seeminly inflated. This was unlike AJ's ascension for RD clearly just grew outright without any recedence but why? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she got to her feet proper her back was above AJ's,  meaning she was even bigger than her once towering friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohmygosh, ohmygosh, ohmygosh THIS IS AWESOME!\" RD exclaimed cheerfully as she stamped the ground creating a minor tremor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Whelp that didn't work.\" SG said nonchalantly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Huh well at least I'm not the biggest anymore. Welcome to the \"Giant Mare Club\" party of two.\" AJ relievingly states with humor trying to stay optimistic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What do you think happened anyway Starlight? Didn't you cast a shrinking spell?\" RD asked candidly while checking herself out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's the thing, I did cast a mass reduction spell but somehow it reversed!\" SG answered sounding very perplexed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Maybe cause ah ate an apple and wasn't zapped by magic or nuttin.\" AJ said trying to offer an explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No, that wouldn't factor in. That is to say it's not a matter of how you got big, It's based on the principal of what can be done to your body now. You see normally magic can stack but in this odd case it reversed my spell and discharged it at Rainbow Dash.\" SG described to the best of her ability in her reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRD couldn't help herself lost in thought while admiring herself, \"Man this is so cool I bet I could knock some ponies off thier hooves or at the very least some critters over with the wind force of my landings!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Awe yeah, don't you think that would throw off your squad though, betta yet you don't supose your formation would be comprimised do ya?\" AJ interjected wisely<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I doubt you would be able to even perform ALL of your stunts like that, especially the percise ones.\" SG added bluntly cutting right to the point wanting to get the 9 Ft 9 In pegasus's head out of the clouds and back to reality with herself and AJ. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"OK I get it it's not all sunshine and rainbows, but do you think Twilight would have a better idea as to what we're dealing with?\" RD inquired sounding a little more concered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Not sure, but two heads are certainly better than one.\" SG stated sounding positive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Eeh-yep, I  agree so wha...... AH darn it NOT AGAIN!\" AJ concured before being interupted by another infuriating growth spurt. Her head deflated then dilated bigger and bigger, her legs withdrew slightly then extended outwards and upwards, her mane and tail both moved back before lengthening longer and fuller, her rear and back depleated and sunk down a little then mushroomed outwards and sprang upwards until she stood a proportional as well as whopping 10Ft 7In!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Aw shucks Applejack, you just couldn't let me be the BIGGER pony huh. Real mature, show off!\" RD jokingly scoffs at her humongous rival and dear friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Shoot Rainbow, it's not like I WANNA BE! Besides somepony's gotta keep ya in check.\" AJ replies quickly still irriatated but enjoing the company none the less, for at least she has another huge mare to embark on this journey with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Alright then ladies, what do you wanna try next?\" SG asked calmly glad in the fact the pair seemed to be in good spirits.</span></div></div>",

She kept walking and was about to turn back to the house when she saw something that made her stop in her tracks. Right in her path, was an apple tree unlike any other in the orchard. It's branches were gnarled and it's bark looked like it was put through a forest fire. Despite it's withered looking leaves, it bore apples that were strangely colored like her coat. One of these odd apples fell down right at her hooves, almost begging her to eat it. Applejack looked around, then picked it up. \"Shame to let this appple go to waste.\" Applejack bit into the orange colored beauty and tasted the sweet, juicy insides. It's thick skin made it troublesome to tear, but the taste was worth it.</span></div></div>",

It was Applebuck season again, and she had decided on getting a bit of an early start. She had taken a chunk out of the trees today, much to her pleasure. Still, she had learned last year that bucking the entire farm herself was impossible, and hard on herself and her friends. Hopefully, her friends would be available to help her out tomorrow. As she turned back to her house, she found herself stumbling a little in the low light of dusk. \"Hoo-eee. Maybe Ah overdid it a little...\" She managed to get a few more paces before her legs gave out beside one of the larger trees. \"Well, a little nap couldn't hurt...\" Curling up under the tree, she put her cowpony's hat over her eyes. She fell into a deep sleep in moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Meanwhile, an indigo-colored mass lurked in the trees of Everfree Forest. If it had eyes, it would have glared at the setting sun. As it was, it could only settle for imagining the glare. It was not happy. Not since last year's Summer Sun Celebration, where it had been banished from the foal Luna. Yes, this indigo cloud was all that was left of Nightmare Moon, a formless mass known simply as the Nightmare. Its hatred of Celestia and her ilk had only increased with its seperation from the younger Princess. It now wanted nothing more to do with her, save making her suffer for another 1000 years. Still, it couldn't do much as a formless indigo cloud. The Nightmare was in a bad situation, and it knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As it cast its gaze over Equestria, it spotted something. Focusing its gaze, it found itself looking at an apple plantation. And there, resting beneath one of the larger apple trees, was an orange-colored earth pony with a cowpony hat and a trio of apples for a cutie mark. The Nightmare would have grinned were it able. It recognized the bearer of the Element of Honesty, and now she was vulnerable. It flew silently over to the apple plantation, poised to strike.</span></div></div>",

After all, she would end up being not only much bigger and stronger, but she'd also be a male! Her own brother, no less! That is a certain recipe for a freak-out, especially if she has to spend some time in her brother's body while Twilight seaches for a counter-spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo; should Applejack swap bodies with one of her siblings?</span></div></div>",

Twilight was too annoyed that she wasn't focusing on her mind. The poor alicorn lost every shred of her past life, leaving nothing more than a 1 year old baby by the end of the changing. The baby Twilight saw Pinkie as her caretaker, but not her mother. Strangely enough, the concept of mommy never came up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the changing, Pinkie gave Twilight a rhasberry, tickling the little one. \"Sooo.. whatcha think Twilight? Does Pinkie do a good changing or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's reaction was rather odd. She just giggled. Pinkie couldn't seem to pick up anything yet. \"I'll take that as a YES! Sooo.. whatcha wanna do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight just said in a high pitched voice \"Pway!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie became a little surprised by this, but rolled with it. \"Uuuuh.. okie dokie lokie, whatcha wanna play with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight just said \"Pinkie!!\" After which, she levitated Pinkie and started making the pink pony dance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie's confusion started hitting super high levels and she said in mid dance \"Uh.. Twilight.. what are you doing? Can you let Auntie Pinkie down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's response was merely a giggle followed by more dancing. This really started to concern Pinkie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kay, Twilight, you can stop now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight just giggled some more from Pinkie's request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie then tried to force a laugh \"Haha, this is fun, right? Haha, can you stop now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight didn't seem to notice Pinkie's request at all that time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis agitated Pinkie a little bit. \"TWILIGHT PLEASE STOP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie's sudden loud yell scared the daylights out of Twilight, making her stop. There was then a pause in the room followed by a sudden loud wail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie's expression quickly turned to concern. \"Uhhh.. it's alright silly\" She tried dancing on her own, but it did nothing. So, she tried making silly faces, but that did nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Pinkie was in panic mode. \"Uh, uh.. does Twilight want to try my.. my magic cupcakes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis calmed Twilight somewhat, quieting her down a bit. Pinkie was happy to see Twilight's reaction, but it was still far from perfect. So, Pinkie took drastic measures and acted as though Twilight was a baby. Maybe this was all an act she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww.. that a girl. There there, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings silly. I- I just wasn't interesting in dancing that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's tears then dried up, but the little one was still whimpering. So, Pinkie went a step further. She held Twilight in her hooves, rocking her back and forth. This almost instantly stopped Twilight's whimpering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, see. You're ok. I gotta say Twilight, you can pull off the baby act more than I thought you could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight just tilted her head \"Wha act?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie's eye brows shot up. \"Twilight.. you know what an act is... right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight timidly shook her head horizontally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie was on the edge of hysteria \"Ha-how old are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight said \"wun\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie paused, thinking to herself \"OH MY GOSH! OH MY GOSH! OH MY GOSH! WHAT DO I DO?!!!!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight seemed scared \"P-pinkie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie shook her head, getting out of her mental panic. \"Yes.. little one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ya-you kay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie merely played up an act. \"Awww, of course I am. Why wouldn't I be? I just was so surprised that you're one. You've grown up so fast haven't you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight just giggled to that, signalling to Pinkie that she was in the clear. Pinkie then jumped in, \"Come with me little one, we.. I mean, I have friends coming over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight just showed a grumpy face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww.. it's okay Twilight, you're still my best friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat relieved Twilight a little bit, but she was still upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door bell then rung. \"Come on Twilight! This will be fun!\" Pinkie was trying to lighten up the mood anyway possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie then put baby Twilight in a baby carrier saddle bag and went to the door.</span></div></div>",

Pinkie cut in \"Haha, isn't she a charmer.\" Pinkie then closed the door and stuck a pacifier in Twilight's mouth to distract her. She put Twilight in a high chair and turned to her friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said in a quietly with panic \"girls.. Twilight is actually a baby. What do I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRD couldn't resist shouting at this point \"What do mean she's actually a baby?!\" The rest of the girls then turned to Twilight, seeing that she was still distracted. Rarity spoke up \"Rainbow! Be quiet! Can't you tell we're trying to not attract attention?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie just cut in at this point. \"By a baby, I mean she is actually a baby. She doesn't seem to remember who I am, she thinks shes one, and her past memories seem to be gone gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a great silence that came over all of them. Surprisingly Fluttershy was the one to break the silence. \"Ha-how did this happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie answered rather panicked. \"I don't know. She just wanted to test a spell on me and this wound up happening. I don't know what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity got in a word now. \"Well first things first. She needs to learn some manners.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of them just turned at Rarity with a glare. AJ butt in \"Uhh.. Rarity, she meant how to fix this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity fired back \"Well, AJ.. she still needs to learn some manners.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow was getting agitated \"Manners smanners! She's a baby! Her manners are fine for a baby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Rainbow. Baby girls are supposed to be sweet and kind. She's just rude. I mean, seriously.. how can you allow that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie sighed \"You're right... She's angry at you all, because she thinks I'm being taken away from her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my..\" Fluttershy responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.. I see.. \" Rarity cut in \"Well, we can fix that. Pinkie, why don't you leave for a bit. Tell Spike what happened and we'll try to befriend her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Pinkie questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely Darling. This just must be done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Pinkie was gone and the four of them were left with a baby Twilight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good goin' Rarity..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, this should be easy peesy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of them walked up to Twilight, who quickly noticed Pinkie was missing. Twilight quickly removed her pacifier and started yelling at them in a high pitched voice. \"Pinkie me fwend! Gib Pinkie bak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow had it. \"Listen Twilight. You're not a baby! Snap out of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's eye glands slowly teared up in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great Sugarcube! Look what ya did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy quickly came to Twilight, trying to comfort her. \"It's okay little one. She didn't mean that, she-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight angrily cut in \"No! YOU MEANIES!!\" After that her horn started to charge up. This happened within seconds and the room was quickly filled with a flash of bright light,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens to the four of them?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The house was filled with light, so much so that Pinkie and others could see from the outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the house, four more ponies just regressed to the humble adorable age of 1. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity spoke after the light was fading, asking a question before she could see clearly \"Ah you gaws aw-wight?\" Rarity quickly noticed her voice, covering her mouth. Shortly afterwards she saw her fellow friends, also reduced to infancy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did what any 1 year old would do in a frightened situation. She wailed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friends quickly realized after her wail and shortly thereafter Fluttershy joined her. Meanwhile, Twilight just kept an angry scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ and Rainbow looked around at there situation, trying to remain calm. AJ tried calming her friends \"It kay.. caaalm dooown\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ's comment put Rainbow over the edge. \"Wha you mean caaaalm dooown?! Dis notin ta wamane caaalm unda!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me jus twyin ta wamane wesonabwle!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dah nah wight! We babies an it aw HER fawt!\" Rainbow pointed to Twilight, who couldn't make out what RD was saying. Rainbow continued though \"So we meanies Twi-wight! Huh?! No! YOU MEANIE!\"Rainbow didn't get any response though, which triggered massive emotions. Rainbow was a cross between sadness and anger, a full on 1 year old emotion spree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WEW!\" *sniff* \"MEANIE GE HURT!!\" *sniff* Rainbow then started shaking Twilight's high chair, by moving the legs. From an outsider's perspective, it looked like she was going to tip Twilight over! AJ felt powerless to stop her, but at the same angry at Twilight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, AJ lost it. \"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight quickly became scared from the skakyness of the high chair and wailed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was amassed in loud wails and it was at this point that Pinkie came back. What she saw before her was all five of her closest friends as babies, crying at the top of their lungs, except for Rainbow who was angry shaking Twilight's high chair with tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie did the best thing she could think of. She yelled at the top of her lungs \"WHAT IS GOING ON?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all heard Pinkie's loud booming voice and turned around. Twilight and the others kept crying, but Rainbow insisted on telling Pinkie what happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PINKIE! PINKIE! TWI-WIGHT! SHE MEANIE! TUR US INTA BABIES!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie was angry with Twilight, but she was even more angry with Rainbow. Twilight was mentally a baby, but Rainbow didn't have such an excuse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie picked up the baby blue Pegasus \"SO?! WHY WERE YOU SHAKING HER HIGH CHAIR?!! YOU COULD'VE SERIOUSLY INJURED HER! WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie's words hit like a train. Rainbow's anger slowly faded into sadness. \"Sa-sa-so... *sniff* so... *sniff* WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie just sighed. What was she thinking... In the span of 5 seconds, she tried to correct her error, by plucking all the babies with pacifiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room finally was quiet for once. \"Now listen everypony, Pinkie is here and I'm gonna take care of you cuties. But, be nice.\"  Pinkie then placed carried them upstairs to the twin room, two at a time. First she took Rarity and Fluttershy, then AJ and RD, and lastly Twilight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were all in the room, Pinkie expertly changed her tone. \"Okie dokie lokie then. Who wants to be the first to get their diapee wiapee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to that AJ, RD, Rarity, and Fluttershy had tears form around their eyelids. \"It's okay silly willies. I won't bite. How about you first Rainbow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow's tears increased after hearing that. Pinkie just gave a motherly smile. \"Awww, there there. Come with me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie then laid Rainbow on the changing table and performed a speedy comfy diaper changing. She wiped down Rainbow's flank with a nice cool wipe, followed up with powder, and finally slide a diaper underneath for the final part. \"Time to strap you in you cute wittle pegasus you!\" Pinkie then completed the process, putting Rainbow on the smooth floor. \"Kay, now you go play now, while I get everypony elses diapee wiapees on.\" Rainbow didn't play though. She just watched. She understandably wasn't in the mood to play with baby toys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie then went to Rarity and placed her on the table. However, Pinkie changed it up a bit and removed Rarity's pacifier. \"How are you doing Rarity Warity?\" The conversation was meant to distract Rarity's attention from the diaper changing. Interestingly, it worked flawlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dowin?! Me dowin terwibwy!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh.. go on\" Pinkie said while wiping down Rarity's butt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha is de-wa to go fwom?! Aw you wisanin ta me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie powdered Rarity's flank before saying \"Rarity, it's okay. This isn't gonna last long, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears slowly formed in Rarity's eyelids. \"Wa-weawy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie then finished the diaper changing and hugged Rarity tightly. \"Yes Rarity. All you can do now is just sit back and play till this gets all solved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kay.. me gess you wight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie just nodded and then placed her and Twilight on the ground. \"Twilight meet Rarity, I think you two might like each other. There's baby toys all around for you to play with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two had a pause of silence before Rarity spoke up \"me sowwy abowt earwia..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked up in surprise \"weawy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight spoke up. \"No, me sowwy. Wet jus pway.\" The two of them played with blocks and the rest was peachy clean. Rarity was trying to just let live for the time being. Meanwhile, Rainbow just scowled, thinking \"how can she apologize? she did nothing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up was Fluttershy. Pinkie took out Fluttershy's pacifier too and responded playfully, \"Hey Fluttershy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy just said \"Hey...\" She was more concentrated on the diaper changing then the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter wiping and powdering her down, Pinkie asked \"are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pinkie strapped in the diaper, Fluttershy said \"Me no kno.. me na too scared. me  fee wike norm-al, actwy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Fluttershy was all strapped down. \"Okay wittle one. Well, don't you worry. We'll get you back to grown up age in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy timidly responded \"Kay...\" Then Pinkie placed her near Twilight and Rarity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-can me pway wit you two...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked into Fluttershy and saw a scared y cat. \"Yes! Me wub ya company. You seem nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy blushed \"tank you Twi-wight.. me name is Fwuttashy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice ya mee ya Fwuttashy!\" Twilight then responded with a hug. The two smiled and joined in on the castle building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie then picked up AJ and laid her on the changing table. \"You alright there AJ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ didn't focus on Pinkie, but rather the diaper she was about to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, I see, you're worried about the diaper change huh?\" AJ just nodded timidly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem silly, I'll give you a fast one then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that Pinkie sped through the diaper changing. She was so fast, AJ was very surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Pinkie pulled out AJ's pacifier and joined in the fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-can I pway wit yaw?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was beginning to warm up to the newcomers. (Perhaps because they were her same age and acting kindly.) \"Yes! Come pway wit us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only one who wasn't playing now was Rainbow Dash. She was still scowling at her friends and sucking on her pacifier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie just laid near her. \"Hey, Rainbow, ya wanna play?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow took out her pacifier at this point \"No!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, come on. You'll like it. You know you will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Sta pit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooo, somepony is grumpy wumpy\" Pinkie then gave Rainbow a rhasberry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis got her laughing real quickly and she quickly said \"Fi-na! Fi-na! Me pway, jus sta tickwin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie just giggled and showed Rainbow a miniature 'whack-a-mole\" game. Rainbow looked at the game confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hit the little rascals with ya hoof silly! I just have to turn it on of course\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow rolled her eyes and waited for Pinkie to press a button. After pressing it, the game lit on with music playing. It sounded like an arcade game to some degree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow was overwhelmed with excitement, but she tried to keep it in. Of course, Pinkie could tell. Babies were very easy to read for her, especially her friends as babies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds Rainbow was immersed in the game. Little did anypony know though that Rainbow started to mentally regress during this game. Something about the game just clicked with her babylike state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the sixth game, Rainbow was saying \"A-gan, A-gan pweease.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie giggled, \"Rainbow, haha, I'm surprised. You are being super duper open! I'm glad you're not embarrassed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow tilted her head, trying to sound out the word \"Em-em-ba-wessed? Wha da dat mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie's eyebrows shot up. \"Awww, come on silly. You know what embarrassed means.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow started to tearing up \"No.. me no kno.. why dat fu-funny\" *sniff*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie just stopped and asked Rainbow two quick questions. \"Rainbow, who am I and what age you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow was confused. \"Uh.. you Pinkie, me cawtaka an me is.. uh... wun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity, AJ, and Fluttershy heard Rainbow's response as well. Within seconds they started wailing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie played it cool. \"Awww.. looks like three little babies want their foody patudee\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pinkie carried the three of her scared baby friends down to the kitchen area, putting them each in their own high chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn those frowns upside down!\" Pinkie's fake smile quickly faded and only a sigh remained in its place. So, she plucked pacifiers in each of their mouths, forcing them to listen to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okie dokie lokies. Rainbow may be a baby waby now, but she'll be back! Don't you worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears quickly formed around each of their eyelids. Pinkie tried containing the tears, but none of her attempts worked. To the contrary, they only fed her friends' fears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after countless failed attempts, Pinkie burst out in tears, much like she did for the Cake Twins. Her tears somehow managed to calm her friends. Their eyelids soon tried up and the three of them took out their pacifiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It kay.. darwing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wight... me bein' wadicawos\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy just nodded timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie soon recognized this and her tears faded as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tha-thanks girls.. You all sure are troopers...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Pinkie spoke up, AJ's tummy growled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three other girls looked at her and Pinkie suddenly got back to her enthusiastic self. \"Awwwwww.. does somepony need her food-y patoody?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ tried to quiet her tummy, with her hooves, but it was obviously hopeless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds, Pinkie brought out three bowls of applesauce. \"Food time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity spoke up though \"Bu-bu wha abowt Twi-wight and Rainbow\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, they're probably just having fun upstairs! No need to bother their friendship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity supposed, or at least, that's all she could do. Because.. within seconds her mouth was being stuffed with applesauce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie spoon fed all of them, one at a time, from AJ, Rarity, Flutters, and then back to Flutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Rarity and Flutters were full pretty quickly and didn't finish their bowls. AJ had more than enough room though and soon Rarity and Flutters were just watching AJ get fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maw! Maw!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wowzers, you sure are a hungry baby waby, aren't ya?! No problemo!\" Pinkie then pulled out another two bowls. Little did Pinkie know, that AJ was undergoing the process of mental regression with each spoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter those, AJ said \"Me stiw hungrwy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo... Pinkie pulled out another bowl to Rarity and Flutters dismay. Pinkie was pulling out the first spoon when they all heard \"Tanks Cawtaka!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie kept feeding her, but asked \"Um.. what did you call me silly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me say cawtaka! cawtaka!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie paused \"Um.. AJ, how old are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ tilted her little adorable head. \"wun, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of silence passed through the room. It was broken by Rarity surprisingly. \"YOU GATTA JO-KIN!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe burst noise frightened the daylights out of AJ, who wound up hitting her bowl. Her bowl flung into the air, landing face side down on Rarity's little head. Rarity then burst into wails, followed by AJ, followed by Fluttershy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie sighed and did the same old same old. She put pacifiers in their mouths, not before removing the bowl from Rarity's head of course. She then did her best act yet. \"Awwww, it's okay. Accident-ies happen!\" She then proceeded to carry all of them upstairs to the twin room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dropped AJ and Flutters off at the room, with a kiss on the foreheads and went off to the bathroom with Rarity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere shall we follow?</span></div></div>",

The white foal looked ready to swallow her pacifier with how hard she was nursing on it. She felt the applesauce as it oozed down her face and back, ruining her precious mane. The fact that she had witnessed two of her friends turn into real babies didn\u2019t help her emotional state and continued to whimper and cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAww. Its ok wittle Warity. Pinkie cooed forcing a smile onto her face. It\u2019s just a little mess. Let Auntie Pinkie clean it right up. So saying the party pony ripped the diaper off and sat Rarity in the warm water. Rarity squeaked and cried harder. Here she was being bathed by one of her best friends. Its ok Rarity. Pinkie soothed just let me handle it. It will all be over soon and you will be all nice and clean again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie knew what she was doing and Rarity found herself calming down. Much to her shame she also realized she was enjoying it. Pinkie was soft and gentle with the cloth and when she started to shampoo her mane. It somewhat felt like a spa trip to the unicorn. Seeing this Pinkie risked removing the pacifier, and sighed in relief when the foal stayed quiet. Even Pinkie had limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere we go! Pinkie said drying Rarity off. All nice and pretty! Pwetty. The foal cooed. Me wook pwetty. Pwetty pony pwincess. She giggled causing a pit to form in Pinkies stomach. Rarity. How old are you? Wun! She answered proudly causing Pinkies mind to halt for a moment. \u201cOh no! Now its only me and Flutters left! I like foals and I love my friends but not even I can take care of five foals by myself!\u201d Pinkie thought panicking. Me make pwetty! Rarity declared some of Mrs. Cake\u2019s beauty supplies hovering in her magical grip. Pinkies eyes shrunk to pinpricks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later a mascara and lipstick covered Pinkie plopped Rarity down with the rest of the foals. Rarity hadn\u2019t been happy until her make over was over. Somehow the alabaster foal had managed to get a hold-of some cloths during the makeover. She now wore a pink and gold onesie with frills along the waste making it look like a dress along with a matching pair of hoof socks. The design was eerily similar to her gala dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPwetty! Rarity cooed again before she was distracted by a toy and crawled over to play. Pinkie wiped the makeup off her face with a blank expression, closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and counted to ten. Ok Pinkie. Just a bit longer. Once they calm down you can go get Spike and we can reverse this. She told herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly her eyes shot open. Fluttershy! Pinkie looked around before zeroing in on the yellow foal holding a tea party with Twilight and some stuffed animals. <br>\r\nFluttershy? Pinkie asked cautiously walking over. The Pegasus foal looked up at her. Fluttershy. Are you allright? How old are you?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was supposed to bake 5 dozen cupcakes for them by 3 but she forgot due to her urge to play with the twins, Pound Cake and Pumpkin Cake. They were so cute, she forgot the time. When she looked up at the clock, it was already 2 PM. Squealing, she dashed down to the kitchen, gathering all her necessary supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Oh no, oh no, oh no! If I don't make these cupcakes soon, Mr. and Mrs. Cake are gonna be super-duper-looper mad at me! But I couldn't have left the babies without a playmate! Oh no! Gotta hurry!\" She stuttered all of this, gathering the cupcake ingredients as fast as she could. Little did she know was when she was to grab flour, she grabbed some baby powder.Dousing the mix with this, she finished 5 bowls in half an hour. Evening the bowls into cupcake tins, she then shoved them in the oven for 15 minutes; plenty of time to make them perfect and play more with the twins. She then smiled, singing a tune as she hopped back up the stairs to their room.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     After 20 minutes, Pinkie Pie had finished decorating all the cupcakes and let them out to cool. Pleased with herself, she took one out and shoved it in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"A viktowy kupehkake fo mee!\" she said with as mouth full of cupcake. Swallowing the chewed up \"goodness\", she felt a weird drowsiness overtake her. It felt as if it were a child-like drowsiness. Yawning, Pinkie bounced over to the couch, then lying down, smiling as her eyes drooped shut. \"Snug as a... bug...\" She then let out a wild snore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     In her head...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Pinkie felt as if she were in a dark room full of emptiness. A void of which she cannot escape. It had the eeriest feeling to it. It also felt oddly... soothing... and... peaceful... almost as if she could let everything go... exactly what happened. <i>Who... am I?</i> she thought. A voice suddenly appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"You are Pinkie Pie... a foal...\" Pinkie Pie couldn't help but believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"I am Pinkie Pie... a foal...\" She said with a drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"You have always been a foal... ever since you were born... 5 months ago...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I have always been foal... ever since was born... 5 months go...\" The voice made her start to talk strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Your friends are your aunties... Applejack is your mommy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Friends are aunties... Applejack mommy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Such a sweet little foal... you'll grow up to be just like your relatives... your mommy, Big Macintosh, Granny Smith... part of the Apple family...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     She couldn't even talk anymore. She could only babble. What also happened was that she became a foal just by those words. She soon woke up to hear a knock on the door. Who entered was...</span></div></div>",

His wife sighed. \"Dear, I know your worried, but when has Pinkie ever let us down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stallion sighed. \"Your right, I just still get nervious.\" Entering the building the couple were immedatly assaulted by the scent of freshbaked cupcakes all laid out on the counter. \"See.\" Mrs. Cake siad a little smugly. \"I guess I owe you five bits.\" Her husband mumered. The mare giggled before frowning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like ones missing.\" She said pointing to the gap in the row of baked goods. Her husband chuckled. \"Well, what did you expect honey bun? We left Pinkie alone with sweets. I think we can let Pinkie have one cupcake though, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare nodded. \"I guess. She does do a good job.

Pin-kie. Pumpkin said happily hugging the foal with her brother making the pink filly giggle happily. The blue mare almsot fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie for her part was looking at the strange mare. Her new friends knew her, this was their mommy. But she also knew her but how? She vaguely remebered voices and somethng about her own mommy and family, but they were already fading from her baby brain. Somethign about apples. She knew this mare so well but how did she know her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes suddenly lit up when she realised the answer. The mare was<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Under most circumstances, especially when baking, Pinkie was a happy-go-lucky mare that always knew how to laugh. Tonight however, Pinkie made no giggling, no singing, no laughing, just dead-serious concentration, for tonight had to be perfect. This was no ordinary baking spree of hers, if she succeeded then she would party like never before, but until then she was serious. \"My pastries and desserts are always so good\" Pinkie thought to herself \"No matter what I do however, I always find somepony who doesn't like what I give them. 'To much sugar' one says, 'Not enough strawberries' another says. Well, soon that won't be a problem.\" Pinkie always had wanted to make the perfect dessert for parties, however no normal baking recipes ever did the trick. She began to poke around some spell books Twilight had, hoping to find something that could help her. When suddenly, she had found it! A recipe for a potion that (If the book was to be believed) would be able to adjust it's taste to anything's liking! All Pinkie would have to do would be to but it into cake batter and POW: a party treat any and everypony could enjoy. Many of the ingredients were actually common supplies found in any full-stocked kitchen, which Pinkie had access to. She climbed the large cauldron as the heater underneath started to kick in. She climbed to the top, ready to add the final and most difficult ingredient to find. A liquefied mix of a \"Want it, Need it\" spell and a transformation spell were quite hard to come across, but Pinkie being Pinkie, she had found a way. She knew she had to work fast, she had already poured the batter into the mix and the heater would soon start baking. Staring at the edge of her creaky perch and into the vat, she began to quickly pour the contents of the bottle into it. Pinkie could smell the spell's mixing in with the batter and was half tempted to lean closer and smell deeper, so she did. As she inhale deeply, she realized her work was finished. Pinkie took a deep breath as she realized what she had accomplished. As her pink hair poofed into it's usual curly form, Pinkie began to squeal with delight. <b>\"OhdearCelestia,Ididit!Ireallydidit!Theperfecttreatforpartiesandit'sm ineforthemakingandbaking!Imean,notthatmytreatswern'tperfectbeforebutthesewil lblowthemoutofthewater!\"</b> Pinkie was so happy and just bouncing around from her success that she didn't notice that the platform she was dancing on was breaking from her movement. In fact, she was partying so much she barely had time to reacting from falling. \"Woopise-doodle\" was all she had time to say before she fell hooves-first into the vat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, Pinkie opened her eyes and looked around. All she could see was the pink fruit of her labor all around her. Looking up, Pinkie saw the top of the vat and began to swim for it. No use! The batter was hardining and she could barely move. Believing she was done for, Pinkie opened her mouth so the delicous cake would be inside her. It tasted like cotton candy, her favorite.</span></div></div>",

As she bit down on the magic-infused cake, she felt as if she was swimming right through it. Eventually, she managed to leap out of the cauldron as she licked the cake batter off her snout. After a minute however, she didn't seem to have gotten it all off as she could taste it wherever she licked her face. Pulling a mirror out of nowhere (because Pinkie Pie) she looked at herself and noticed something odd. Her pink fur had a white sheen to it and licking it, she found it was frosting! She also found that the more she licked the frosting the more there was. It was almost like her body was making it by itself. Looking at her hoof, Pinkie saw that what was normally the hoof seemed like chocolate! Suddenly, realization hit her like a ton of bricks. \"Oh dear Celestia\" Pinkie mumbled to herself \"I...am....a living cake-pony.\" Looking back at her hoof, Pinkie decided to experiment with how deep her transformation was. With one quick motion, Pinkie bit her whole hoof off. If she was a normal pony, she'd be screaming in pain like a banshee. Instead however, not only did she not feel pain, but her hoof instantly grew back. Munching on the hoof, Pinkie could taste the caramel-tasting chocolate and a what used to be blood turned into a thick strawberry filling she loved to put in doughnuts. \"This is so super-splendiferificly-AMAZING! I taste so perfect! Hmmmm, I wonder if the point of this cake mix is still used? Well, only one way to find out for sure:\"</span></div></div>",

Fluttershy noticed a small yellow stain on the towel in between Dash's legs.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Aw, did you have an accident?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash just smiled at her and continued to suck on the pacifier. Fluttershy undid the pins on the towel and tossed it into a trash can. She got the wipes, powder and diapers off of the bed. She wiped Dash thoroughly and placed a fresh diaper under her. She then applied a little baby powder and pulled the diaper in between her legs and secured the tapes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, all done,\" she said to Dash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash giggled and wiggled around in her new garment, her foalish mind enjoying the new sensation. Fluttershy felt awfully weird treating her friend like this. Rainbow Dash would be so embarrassed if she knew how she was acting, and Fluttershy wanted to get her better as soon as possible. But she was kind of cute acting like this. Fluttershy would help her make the best of the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you hungry Dashie?\" She asked. Dash looked up at her with happy eyes, understanding the prospect of food, and nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets get you something to eat,\" Fluttershy said as she helped Dash stand up. Dash could hardly walk straight, she waddled from side to side like a little foal. Fluttershy flew above her and guided her out of the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now careful, not too far to the left, don't hurt yourself, ok past the table,\" Fluttershy tried to direct Rainbow down the hall to keep her from bumping into anything. Dash just giggled at how silly her mommy was being. They finally reached the stairs to the living room. Dash put one hoof out to go down the stairs but immediately slipped and almost tumbled down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep!\" Fluttershy gasped as she grabbed Dash by the shoulders to steady her. \"Maybe I'll just carry you down the stairs, ok?\" she asked Dash. Rainbow smiled and babbled a bit. Fluttershy scooped Rainbow up in her front legs and flew down the stairs with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, you're, ugh, a teasny bit, oof, heavy Dashie,\" she said as she struggled to carry Rainbow down the stairs. Rainbow stared up at her with happy bright eyes full of love for her mommy. Fluttershy finally set her down in a kitchen chair with arms. She didn't have a highchair, there probably wasn't any in Equestria that could fit Rainbow Dash anyway, so she'd have to improvise. Fluttershy took a towel and wrapped it around Dash's waist and then tied it off around the back of the chair so she wouldn't fall out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arms up Dashie,\" She said to Rainbow and she held her arms up in the air in front of her. Rainbow Dash copied her mommy and Fluttershy slid the chair up to the kitchen table until it was just an inch away from Dash's belly. With the arms on the chair under the table, Rainbow Dash was secure as if she was in a high chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now sit tight Dashie, momma will be back in a second,\" Fluttershy said as she flew upstairs. She retrieved the bottle, bib and rattle from the bed and flew back downstairs where Dash was still waving her arms in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here Dashie, play with this while I get some food ready,\" Fluttershy said and she handed Dash the rattle and tied the bib around her neck. Dash shook the rattle with a fascinated look on her face. Fluttershy flew got some milk from the fridge and put it in a pan. She put the pan on the stove over low heat to heat it up a little. She then took some carrots, apples, pears, peas and ground them up separately in a food processor. Dash had adult teeth, but Fluttershy didn't want to risk having her choke. She was careful to try and keep the foods separate from each other in order to keep the flavors from mixing and becoming bad tastes. She eventually had four little bowls of mashed up food to feed Dash. She didn't know which ones she'd like but she had plenty to try. Fluttershy brought the food over to the table where Dash was sliding the rattle across the table and watching it bounce along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Rainbow Dash, how about some nice carrots?\" asked Fluttershy as she held up a spoonful of mashed carrots. Dash dropped the rattle and held her mouth open. She fed Dash the carrots, apples, pears and peas. Rainbow ate happily, food falling out of her mouth every so often which would always illicit a giggle from her and Fluttershy. Dash polished off all four bowls of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you must have really been hungry,\" Fluttershy said. She cleaned up Dash's face with a wash cloth then headed over to the stove to get the milk. It was just the right temperature. She filled the bottle up and screwed on the nipple. She flew over to Dash with the bottle who was eagerly awaiting it. Dash held her arms up and reached for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, ah, baba, baba,\" she said. Fluttershy smiled and held the bottle to her lips. Rainbow grabbed it and immediately began to suckle. As she drank Fluttershy undid the towle behind her and slid the chair back. She then picked up Rainbow with her bottle and flew over to the couch with her in hoof. She sat on the couch cradling Rainbow as she drank. Fluttershy ran her hoof through Rainbow's mane and stroked her belly. Rainbow drank happily making cute little sucking sounds and muffled content vocalizations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so cute,\" said Fluttershy down to her baby. Fluttershy loved taking care of her, but she knew that if Rainbow stayed like this, she could never fly and pursue her dreams again. Fluttershy was going to get help soon, as soon as she found a way to either get someone to go for help or take Rainbow to help without anypony seeing her. When Rainbow had finished she continued to suckle on the bottle for more. Fluttershy took it out of her mouth and Rainbow still made the suckling motion with her lips. Fluttershy placed the pacifier back in her mouth and Rainbow sucked happily staring back up at her mother. Fluttershy stared back eyes full of love when...</span></div></div>",

AJ walked in to see Rainbow Dash on the couch wearing a diaper and sucking on a pacifier. Her jaw dropped at the sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hay? Rainbow? Rainbow what's goin on?\" AJ asked, stepping closer to Rainbow. Rainbow looked up at her and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aunty,\" Dash said, \"Aunty AppwelJawck!\" She reached her arms out to hug her. Applejack reflexively returned the hug, feeling a mix of joy at holding her friend and fear for what had happened to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha... what are we gonna do 'shy?\" Applejack asked as Rainbow held onto her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Fluttershy replied, \"I can't leave her alone, she's completely helpless.

Applejack got up and patted Rainbow on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now just sit tight Rainbow,\" AJ said, \"I'll be back with Twilight in a few minutes and we'll get you all fixed up OK?\" Rainbow Dash just stared up at her smiling behind her pacifier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya know, yer perdy darn cute like this Dashie,\" said AJ. Then a foul sent filled the air. Applejack and Fluttershy recoiled in disgust, knowing that Rainbow was the source of the smell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not that cute,\" Applejack said with a hoof over her nose. \"Ah'm off to get Twi, you best tend to her Fluttershy. I'll be back in a jiffy,\" and with that, AJ left to get help. Fluttershy stared at Rainbow who was starting to notice the mess she made. The feeling was not comfortable and Rainbow began to tear up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Changie, diapie changie!\" she said to Fluttershy. Upon seeing Dash upset, Fluttershy's disgust disappeared and her motherly instincts kicked in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, did you make a messy little Dashie?\" She said. Rainbow nodded, still teary eyed. \"Then lets get you all cleaned up,\" Fluttershy responded warmly. She picked Rainbow up off the couch and carried her upstairs to the bedroom. Fluttershy laid a large towel out on the bed and set Rainbow down on it. She then got the Foalz diaper pack, baby wipes, diaper rash cream and baby powder ready. Fluttershy hesitated a bit before undoing the diaper, but then she saw Dash's teary eyes and discomfort and all doubt went away. She undid the dirty diaper and slipped it out from under Rainbow, careful not to get any mess on her beautiful rainbow tail. She wadded up the diaper and threw it in the trash bin. She then wiped Dash thoroughly making sure that she was completely clean. Rainbow relished the feeling of being cleansed by her mother, her anxiety lifting away with each wipe. Fluttershy then applied a little diaper rash cream to help keep Rainbow comfortable. She then slid a fresh diaper under Rainbow's bottom and dusted her with a little baby powder. Finally she slid the diaper in between her legs and secured the tapes. Fluttershy then quickly ran to the bathroom to wash her hooves off, then she returned to Rainbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, all better,\" she said. Rainbow padded her new diaper with her front hooves, making in crinkle. \"You were such a good girl Dashie, lets go back downstairs and you can play with some more toys.\" Fluttershy picked up the now elated Rainbow Dash. She recognized the word \"toys\" and knew that it meant fun for her. Fluttershy flew her downstairs and set her on the living room floor. She got Rainbow's rattle, a stuffed bunny and a couple of building blocks she had around for when she foal sat. Rainbow giggle with joy at the toys, grabbing the stuffed bunny and cuddling it agains her chest. Fluttershy beamed at her cuteness. She didn't want to get too used to this though, because Rainbow Dash needed her old life back. She couldn't stay a baby forever. But while she was, Fluttershy could enjoy it.There was a knock at the door and Fluttershy rushed to it and opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank goodness you're back,\" she said.

So... what's the problem?\" Twilight asked Fluttershy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you please come inside and I'll show you...\" Fluttershy moved out of the way allowing Twilight and Applejack to enter Fluttershy's cottage, they both heard strange gurgling sounds and squeals of joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you foal-sitting Fluttershy?\" Twilight asked Fluttershy as she walked into the cottage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... yes... and no...\" Fluttershy couldn't make up her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight walked through the cottage to hear the gurgling and the giggling had gotten louder as she moved closer to the living room couch, she slowly turned herself and circled around the couch to see a patch of blue fur in front of the couch. Twilight moved out of the way to get a better look and she found the source of the gurgling and the giggling. Rainbow Dash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor little foal was sitting down in front of the couch tightly holding the teddy bear she was given. She had pacifier in her mouth and she started to suckle it loudly. Twilight's mouth dropped wide open and her pupils shrinked to the size of peas, her ears drooped downwards and her tail was up in the air. Twilight couldn't help but start to laugh at the sight before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bwa-bwa...\" Rainbow Dash turned to see a purple unicorn standing behind her, for some reason she did not know the unicorn was laughing pretty hard. Rainbow Dash started to join in on the fun and crawl over to the purple unicorn. However Twilight moved back when Rainbow Dash tried to get near.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow Dash is so adorable!\" Twilight giggled out loud. She trotted over to the overgrown foal and patted her on the head which seemed to cause Rainbow Dash to smile. She loved the attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Twi' is there a way of fixin' Rainbow Dash? Ah'm guessin' there is some magic spell or a potion or somethin' that'll work on her.\" Applejack trotted up next to the unicorn and asked her about the many possibilities to fix Rainbow Dash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Applejack, I'll go back to the library and bring back a couple of spell books. But we first need to know how this happened to Rainbow Dash, she didn't turn into this in just a few seconds that's for sure.\" Twilight said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It slowly started to glow a bright purple and it started to peel itself off without causing any pain to Rainbow Dash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bandage levitated into the air and floating above Rainbow Dash, the adult-foal stopped laughing for a moment and saw a purple glowing object right above her slowly levitating towards the purple pony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh...\" Rainbow Dash blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash was on her backside, but she found it very hard get back up.

She may be an adult, but she could still hurt herself by strangling herself in the bandages because of her injury. Maybe you could use something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing her mistake, Twilight decided to use the teddy bear she saw Dash snuggling with earlier. She dangled the bear in front of Rainbow, swirling it around and rubbing it against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll past feelings of sadness dissappeared as Dash started babbling and squealing with glee once more.

She watched as Rainbow Dash zoomed across the sky, collecting a few of the scattered clouds in her wake, she circled pulling them tighter until they were one huge cloud.<br>\r\nTwilight knew from her studies of weather patterns that this accumulation of water vapor causes friction and can create a storm cloud. Rainbow Dash knew this too as she formed a bigger storm cloud. It was entirely in her control as she soared higher, leaving the cloud at a reasonable altitude. She pushed herself higher into the troposphere. Twilight bit her lip, her stomach dropping at the sight of her friend so high up beyond the clouds. From extensive study, Twilight knew that the higher one goes into the atmosphere, the thinner and colder the air gets. However, she also knew that pegasi were adapted to flying at high altitudes. Just how high, no pony knew.<br>\r\nTwilight saw her friend hesitate for a split second before changing direction and plummeting towards the ground. Twilight felt her heart start to beat faster as Rainbow Dash gained speed; on the threshold of a Sonic Rainboom she hit the storm cloud waiting in her wake. The result was spectacular.<br>\r\nRainbow lightning shot from the cloud in all directions. It was absolutely marvelous and blinding. Streaks of red, yellow, orange, blue, green and purple danced across the sky in what Twilight assumed was a five-mile radius. It was spectacular and she watched with her mouth agape. It took only seconds to realize that the mare responsible for the beautiful light show was nowhere to be seen. Panic crept into the young alicorn as she searched the sky for her friend. She couldn\u2019t see anything.<br>\r\nShakily, still not used to her new wings, Twilight Sparkle took to the air to look for her friend. \u201cNo, no, no, no, no\u2026\u201d Twilight murmured to herself as she scanned the sky and ground.<br>\r\nSuddenly, below her was a speck of blue and rainbow clashing against the green grass of an open field. She bolted towards the ground. Getting close enough to teleport she appeared at Rainbow\u2019s side.<br>\r\nThe sight before her was one she will forever wish to get out of her mind. Rainbow laid on the ground. A dark red pool beneath her, her head was gashed and dripping blood. Her legs were badly broken and her wings\u2026Twilight couldn\u2019t look at them without wanting to vomit. Her mind went into overdrive. She had to get Rainbow Dash to the hospital. But her training grounds were a good few miles away from Ponyville. Twilight had to think fast.</span></div></div>",

Toast made out of chocolate bars with hot chocolate syrup spread over them, there was fudge on top of ice cream sundaes. there was much more, each not befitting of a princess but Rainbow didn't care as her mouth was  watering looking at the food, she tried to hold her self back but couldn't.

Waking up to one when you know for a fact you've never owned one in your life, doubly so. Waking up to that, on your day off... you get the idea. So as you can probably imagine Rainbow Dash was more than a little hesitant to get out of bed. Instead opting to swat the offending device into the wall with a hoof, where it was now lodged and while muffled, no less annoying. Grumbling, she finally dragged herself out from beneath the covers.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Finally opening her eyes, the first thing she she noticed, was that her mane was in desperate need of being brushed, as one tangled yellow lock was dangling in front of her eye. It was actually kind of funny, it was messy enough to pass for pinkie's usual style. Blinking a few times to clear her vision, the second thing she noticed was that this was not her cloud-house. Sure it was built out of clouds, and there was enough Wonderbolt-ish stuff lying around, but the architecture was all wrong. That much was made clear when the door that should have been the washroom, instead led to a hallway.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"About time you got up. Straighten your mane and get your suit on, Soarin wants to try the new maneuver this morning.\" An all too familiar voice called out. Immediately, Dash was alert. Spitfire had just told her to put on <i>her uniform</i> so she could go flying with her and Soarin? This could mean only one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Best. Dream. Ever.\" She whispered to herself, caught up in the moment, and hardly moving, much to Spitfire's annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Come <i>on</i> Surprise, quit dawdling and get ready!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Both froze, before Sweetie Bell broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEEEWWW! Rarity! Did you just pee on me?!? The foals\u2019 eyes widened as she realized what she had done and tears begain to well up in her eyes as new foolish emotions started to take hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBu, bu. Me no fweel it! She protested despite the puddle growing aorudn the two ponies. Sweetie Bell gimiced. Yeah you made quite a mess. She commented causing Rarity to start crying. Me sowy! Me no mena taaawaaaahhhhh!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe formerly younger sister jumped shocked. Um, um. It ok Rarity. Don\u2019t cry. The filly cooed but the foal was upset and only cried harder. Uh, well come one rarity let\u2019s get you cleaned up. Don\u2019t cry Rarity, I\u2019ll take care of you big sis. Sweetie Bell said cheerfully, trying to ignore the fact that said \u201cbig\u201d sister had just peed on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity for her part just cried some more, upset and embarrassed. She wanted to stop crying, but she was just so upset she found that she could only cry, to let the world know how upset she was. And the inability to stop crying made her more upset, which made her cry some more which continued the cycle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Bell grimaced but carried on running a small bath for the both of them to clean the mess up, then drying them off. There we go, all nice and clean, No need to cry Rarity. Sweetie Bell said. Rarity sniffed and whined a bit but was no longer crying now that she was clean and knew that her sister wasn\u2019t mad at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, now you stay here. Sweetie Bell said running out of the bathroom leaving Rarity confused. Several minutes later the filly returned with several objects hovering in her magic grip. I knew mom hadn\u2019t throw them away! She said happily as Raritys\u2019 eyes winded in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Bell was carrying an old \u201cSilly Filly\u201d brand diaper, along with some powder, wet wipes, rash cream, foal powder, a bottle, a purple pacifier, a purple onesie, and some toys. Sweetie Bells\u2019 old foal supplies that their parents had kept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foal immediately shook her head. Nu! Nu dipee! Me no foaw! Nooo! Sweetie Bell gave an unamused look. Now come on Rarity, please cooperate and let me diaper you. The filly pleaded picking her sister up. No! Rarity squirmed and fought as she was placed on her back and Sweetie Bell tried to slip the garment under her rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity! Sweetie Bell said her voice hard. The foal froze. Rarity, I know this is embarrassing but you just peed all over us a minute ago and didn\u2019t feel it. I already have a puddle to clean up and I don\u2019t want to look after a bigger mess so please wear this just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity whimpered but didn\u2019t move as Sweetie bell slid the diaper under her, dusted her with powder, and taped it shut. There we go! Sweetie Bell sang picking the newly diapered foal up. That wasn\u2019t so bad. Rarity didn't reaspns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now what Rarity? Sweetie Bell asked trying ot get a response.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rarity was working late, which was not an uncommon occurrence. She'd found a remarkable gem earlier, and she had been struck with a flash of inspiration. She'd gone through numerous designs, and was now assembling the dress. It was a slimmer piece, white with silver on the edges and strings of angular green gems running down the back. The focal point of the design was to be the gem that had inspired it, set into a broach. Rarity lifted the gem into the air with her magic, and as she held it in place over the dress, it positively gleamed in the moonlight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the piece now complete, Rarity lifted it from the dress form. She preferred having other ponies model her clothes so that she could get a more objective look, but she didn't want to wait until morning, and she doubted anyone was awake at this late hour. Except maybe Pinkie, but this shade of green would clash horribly on her. So Rarity put the dress on herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, Rarity changed. Where a mare had been moments before, a filly now stood, blinking in surprise. The dress had changed wit her, and in good news, it fit perfectly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question now was, how did Rarity feel about all this?</span></div></div>",

The crowd simply began to disperse, leaving Twilight to wonder what was going on. \"If I had to guess, I think they are accepting this.\" Rarity sighed with relief, thankful the ponies didn't break out the ropes and torches. \"I have to admit darlings, I didn't think I would have gotten through this. Although I fear I am now too big for my home.\" Spike, having shook himself from his dreamy state looked to Rarity. \"Well.....\" he said \"I remember hearing that there is a vacant cave not too far from town, want to go check it out?\" Rarity held out a hand to carry Spike with, \"Lead the way Spikey.\"</span></div></div>",

Rarity gasped, inspecting her strange surrondings. Apparently she was in a cave, though their was something strangely elegent about the shape of this save, , and it was decoarted with an elbarate pattern of gems. All around her were gems, though they were smaller than she would expect. She removed her hoof from her head, realing as she noticed itwas a claw., and her leg was certainly not that of a pony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to me?!\" She shrieked. Even her vice was different. Louder, deeper, yet still maintinag a certain lady like quality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paced around frantically, before noticing the clear, reflective surfaces reflected the image of a great white dragon! Rarity whirled round to face the beast, before the horrible realization dawned on her. She was the beast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could this happened to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her reflection again. She was a large adult dragon, though it was difficult to ascertain her size her, though thinner and slenderer than she was expect one to be, with a gem like array of blue spikes and well sized white wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm as dragons go, I don't look half bad. What am I saying? I must get to Twilight and have her fix me at once!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crawled out the cave, briefly blinded by the sunlight and took to the air, lifting herself with her powerful wings. She was surprised how smooth her take off was, it took a while to raise her new bulk but she was unexpectedly comfortable in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange... apparently I know how to fly. Maybe its from the last time I had wings or maybe its something about being a dragon.\" Lifting herself higher into the sky allowed her to get a wider view of the landscape. this area felt somewhat familiar to her and she had an idea what direction Ponyville might lie, stil unsure if this was a memory or buried dragon instinct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hope my friends still recognize me....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she reached Ponyville.</span></div></div>",

She didn't know where she was, but the room she was in was much larger and grander, richly furnished with the finest money could buy. She stared in admiration before asking herself the obvious question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere am I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNopony was around to answer her. She cautiously stepped out of bed, noticing something else was off, but unable to put her hoof on it. She left through the marvelously crafted double doors and found herself in the palace doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow in Equestria did I get here?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity slowly walked through the hall, looking around in the hopes something could giver her a clue about how she got here. As she turned a corridor she crashed into two armored pegasi. Realizing her mistake she quickly stood, noticing that for some reason she was taller than they were. She placed a hoof to her mouth and her cheeks reddened. Oh no, am I in trouble?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her further surprise the guards looked extremely flustered, and immediately prostrated themselves before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cE-e-excuse me your majesty!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity pulled her head back and stared blankly ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour majesty? Their must be some mistake?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards shivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what mistake could we have made Princess Rarity? W-w-we didn't mean to crash into you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPRINCESS?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey backed away and gaped at her, though still remained bent down and shivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity's mouth shivered, no words coming out at it, until she shut it and spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm no Princess! I'm flattered you could mistake me for one but really the idea is absurd....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-but your majesty\u201d The guard pointed at Rairty's side. She looked down and saw that somehow she had grown a pair of large feathery wings, much like Celestia's. And on a second glance, her body was larger yet slimmer, becoming closer in shape to Celestia's. She stretched them out and inspected them <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is magnificent! But I have no idea how it could have happened..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have always been our Princess, your majesty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity tilted her head, noticing now she had a longer neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? What happened to Celestia and Luna?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards looked at each other blankly then Rarity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho? We have never heard of those ponies, your majesty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can this be? I thought everypony knew of Celestia and Luna! How else does the sun rise and set?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked at her like she was crazy, but also seemed afraid to even think it. Do they think I am an \"off with their heads\" kind of princess?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey rise on there own, your majesty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey cautiously nodded, unsure what to make of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh never mind, carry on.\u201d Rarity gestured for them to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe-we're not in trouble?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not, though you really should watch where you walk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey lowered their heads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Princess Rarity!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity walked past them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrinces Rarity? That does has a certain ring to it...\u201d She smiled to herself then looked serious. \u201cBut I should really fine out where the real Princesses went and how I wound up here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe headed downstairs and went through the hall. A chef pony stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh miss rarity, your breakfast is ready. Souffl\u00e9 and truffles.\u201d He held up a luxuriously decorated plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my. That does look good.\u201d Well maybe I can enjoy this a little longer....</span></div></div>",

While she was not one to be greedy, she was proud of the haul she was making. While taking a detour to their usual gem hunting field, the magic that led Rarity to gems suddenly had her going off in the direction of this rocky outcropping. While this place strangely wasn't on the map Spike took from Twilight, this place was rich with gemstones. However, while Rarity was proud of finding this place, Spike couldn't help but feel nervous. It was bad enough this place wasn't on one of the maps owned by one of Equestria's smartest magic users, but there was an unusual feeling about this place. Sure the gems here were the tastiest looking ones he ever saw, but it just didn't feel right. Spike's fears would have been for nothing if he wasn't so deep in thought that he didn't see where he was going. As it was Spike found himself tripping on something as Rarity ran to him with a worried look. \"Oh my dear Spikey-Wikey, are you..... oh my.\" Rarity stopped as she looked at what Spike had tripped on. Sticking out of the ground was the rounded edge of what appeared to be a white crystal. Using her magic to pull it out however, it appeared that the gem also had black splotches in it's coloring. As Rarity examined the beautiful crystal, it began to glow as if reacting to her presence.  </span></div></div>",

It was the same black and white crystal from before. It seemed almost as if it was glowing even brighter then before and the black splotches moved around. \"I'm certainly planning on this being used for something special..... maybe if Applejack needs another dress.\" Rarity kept staring at the gem as it glowed brighter and the splotches moved faster. \"Well, what pony in their right mind wouldn't want this strange.....and........beautiful. Suddenly, the glow from the crystal exited it ans the orb it created entered her body. \"Oh my..\" Rarity said as she felt her body begin to change.</span></div></div>",

The pain kept growing as it neared her horn, then stopped as she felt something poke out. Then the pain went to a lower area near the stomach as she felt herself becoming filled with something. As the pain lessened, Rarity could also feel herself getting heavier as something of hers kept brushing against the floor. Rarity looked back to her tail, worried if it was next, but it didn't seem to change. She did however notice her fur looked different. It had kept it's white look, however, now she was adorned with black splotches. \"Just like the crystal\" she thought as she walked towards a mirror. Now it was time for her eyes to widen as she saw what she had become. On her head now stood two horns instead of one, equal length and style. Looking under herself, she found why she was feeling heavier. As if they was always there, two udders were across her stomach. \"Oh my\" she said in horror \"I've become..... A COW-PONY!!\" Turing towards Twilight, she knelt down as much as her milk-filled udders would let her. \"Darling, she whined what happened to me?!\"</span></div></div>",

She expected Twilight to use some kind of magic, but felt something else. Rarity could feel both the milk being drained from her and the pain dimming down. Under normal circumstances, she would be \"udderly\" mortified at even the simple thought of this sort of thing happening to her. But maybe her cow body was getting to her, because this not only felt relieving, but natural as well. It took a while, but soon Rarity could feel that her udders were empty. (For now at least.) Realizing it as well, Twilight stood up and smiled as Rarity did too. \"Darling\" Rarity inquired \"If you don't mind me asking, how was it?\" Licking a drop of milk from her lips, Twilight said \"Wonderful......... </span></div></div>",

Rarity realized this wouldn't be an easy deal, and she had to work fast. \"Come to me my dear, come and drink of what your mistress has to offer.\" Twilight kept trying to resist, but something about Rarity's voice forced her to look at the cow-pony as she spoke.

Twilight couldn't focus as all she could think about was kneeling beside her mistress's udders and drinking her fill. \"That's it Twilight darling.\" Rarity spoke, keeping eye contact with Twilight \"Just drink and let me take care of everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight could taste the delicious cream flowing into her mouth as she continued to look up at her mistress. She couldn't remember why she was resisting this, and certainly didn't want to. As she drank, her thoughts were becoming muddled and became a little worried. The more she drank however, the more she realized that that was what Raricow was doing for her, taking away the trouble of thinking for herself. \"That's it my dear\" Twilight heard as the spirals came closer to her \"Just drink and lose yourself. Drink and obey.....drink and obey....drink...and....obey.\" Twilight relaxed as she realized those words were her new life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity smiled as Twilight fell under the spell of her milk and her hypnosis. In her mind the old Rarity was dead, now she was a perfect blend of cow and pony. She was now (Pause for effect)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>RARICOW</b></span>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her new slave however, Rarity noticed something different about Twilight's body<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She could no longer control herself and just went with everything that was going on. Rarity was having fun with her new \"pet\" and gently stroked her mane. However, she wasn't ready for what was about to happen next.<br>\r\n Rarity looked at Twilight for a moment and soon saw what was happening. Two horns started to sprout upon Twilight's head. It looked rather gross as they broke through the skin of the old unicorn. She then noticed a strange round mass of flesh form on Twilight's underside.<br>\r\n It was getting bigger and bigger until it hit the floor. Four teats then formed on the mass and it was now an udder. Rarity was thrilled that this was happening. Having the princess as her slave...what an accomplishment and she barely had to do a thing. She smiled as she watched Twilight. The udder was very large and Rarity knew that it was full of milk like hers was. She saw the Twilight's fur started to get spots. Twilight looked very much like a cow now.<br>\r\n Rarity focused on her new slave as she kept drinking her milk. Soon Twilight got full. She wanted more but knew that she couldn't drink another drop. Rarity looked at her and said,\"Is my new pet all full now?\" <br>\r\nTwilight replied, \"Yes mistress. She was in pain and started to shake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

I know I'm not worthy to ask you of such a thing, but can I change my name as well?\" Once again, Raricow looked to her slave and smiled. \"Your name had already channged my dear Twicow, now relax as your mistress takes your pain away.\"<br>\r\nAs Twicow felt Raricow begin to milk her, she felt a sence of pride. Her mistress believed she was important enough to have her name changed to fit her new life<br>\r\nRaricow had a feeling her own milk was delicous, but the taste of Twicow couldn't compare.

She nearly collapsed asleep, Fluttershy managing to catch her and awaken her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, sorry if this sounds rude, Applejack, but why did you wake us up at six in the morning just to see an apple?\" questioned Fluttershy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just an apple?\" laughed Applejack. \"This is no ordinary apple, this is the biggest one grown in Equestria ever! Granny Smith is taking photos and everyone else is going to be there! Even Princess Celestia and Luna!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity opened her eyes wide in shock. \"Princess Celestia? But I never got to do my hair or put on a dress or bring her a gi-\" she exclaimed, before being cut off by Applejack. \"Calm down! Just use your magic horn to fix your hair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity cocked her head. \"Why did I never think of that?\" She immediately fixed her hair with magic. Although worried about the dress, she managed to catch up to Applejack, Fluttershy running alongside her. They reached the grand apple unveiling only minutes later, where Celestia gave a speech to announce the ceremony. Rainbow Dash, already bored, walked up to Rarity and Fluttershy. \"Hey, guys. Did Applejack trail you here as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy nodded, although she jumped and tripped over when Pinkie Pie bounced up to her from behind and squealed in excitement. Rainbow Dash, Applejack and Rarity simply glared at her, as if to say, \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie helped Fluttershy up. The latter quickly noticed someone was missing. \"Where's Twilight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she's watching the speech.\" said Rainbow, begrudgingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after, whenever the speech was over, Twilight and Spike met the others. As they talked (Twilight, Applejack and Pinkie seemingly the only impressed of the group), the Cutie Mark Crusaders walked up to them, holding a basket full of  apples and offered them. Everyone took one and ate at it happily. Hours later, the show was over and everyone had returned home.</span></div></div>",

Or will it do more...? Either way, let's begin, shall we?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was late afternoon when Fluttershy, the timid yellow pegasus finally finished her daily chores for the day. While they were never too much from the animal caretaker to handle, they were a task all by her lonesome. The ate up her day like nothing else could and often kept her from spending as much time as she would like with her friends, especially Rainbow Dash as the two had finally started to connect as friends again. Regardless, she had made a promise to her dear friend, Twilight Sparkle to assist her today with spell of some type. While she was not sure why or for purpose, she attend to keep her word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy made her way to the Ponyville Library with no delay, duely noting that on her way back she should pay a visit to her friend, Rarity, afterwards and schedule their weekly spa day. And to perhaps drop by Sugarcube Corner and pick up something sweet for later that night. Alas, that would have to wait until after this was was taken care of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnocking on the door with her hoof, Fluttershy mumbled to herself, \"Oh, dear... I hope I haven't kept her waiting too long...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door was none other any Spike, the baby dragon. He greeted  with toothy grin, \"Hey, Fluttershy! I'm guessing you're here to help Twilight with whatever it is she's been up to for the past few days. I'm guessing it's a spell, but I don't really know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose so...\" Fluttershy replied shy, \"I'm not sure why she asked me to come here, myself. And through a letter no less...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes you, me, and the rest of Ponyville,\" Spike sighed. He stepped aside to allow her in and pointed to the stairwell. \"Twilight's upstairs in the main library. You can go ahead and head up top and I'll bring you two some lemonade, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Fluttershy entered the building, \"Okay then... Thank you very much the gesture. I would love some lemonade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another, but a rather cheerful smile, Spike scampered off to the kitchen. Looking around, Fluttershy could tell that Twilight must have been truly caught up in whatever it was for quite some time. The place was still, for the most part, clean, but there was something to be desired in this with dust that covered over most fo the shelves. While a little nervous, she decided to go up stairs. After going up the second floor of the building, she considered if she should really have come. Let alone why Twilight asked her to bring...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Choice time. A lock of hair hair will show that she'll be changed only in terms her gender where as a Griffon feather, a symbol of change, will show that much more that just her gender will be altered...

His scales seemed to be absorbed by the skin underneath, and the spines on the top of his head grew out into a short mane, as did his tail. Finally, as if to punctuate the transformation, his turned to that of a pony with a semi-loud pop. Spike shook his head and looked into small pond to find everything about him but his color had changed. His coat was a dark purple, similar to that of Twilights. His mane was short, and lime green. He experimented with his stretched muscles and found upon looking back that he had wings. He attempted to flap them, but they were too undeveloped to hover for more than a few seconds, let alone fly. Spike frowned and thought he should ask Rarity for a snack to cheer him up about being taunted by fate, and suddenly realized his teeth were far too weak to bite through gemstones. His jaw dropped to the ground before yelling in anguish at such misfortune. He walked back to the library and thought for a moment. What if Twilight didn't recognize him? Nopony would believe some random colt claiming to be a baby dragon! Well, one pony would, but Spike thought that might be a bit risky...</span></div></div>",

Twilight had sent him to Zecora's hut for some special herbs to use for one of her spells, and since she was too busy to do it herself, Spike was called up. Not that he was unhappy with it, of course. He would do anything to please Twilight, and this was a task he could do himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were about to change, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike stopped when he sensed something was...wrong. He couldn't describe it, but he felt a change in the atmosphere, like something bad was going to happen. Then the dragon tensed up when he felt a presence behind him. Slowly, he turned to face it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a unicorn standing several feet behind him. She was a faded blue, having a dark green mane that hung from her neck, her horn was pale and almost translucent, and her cutie mark showed some kind of reptile-like beast Spike couldn't describe. The unicorn grinned an evil grin, her teeth sharpened and almost cat-like. Spike felt a sense of fear, but he didn't know what was going to happen. Then the unicorn spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you. You're the dragon that always lived with those ponies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, that's true. But what's the problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the problem? HA! It should be obvious. You are supposed to be a dragon! A naturally-born killer! Made to kill ponies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can't be like that! You can't just force me to kill ponies! That's cruel and inhumane!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't think of it as forcing. I'm merely going to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn's horn glowed white, and Spike immediatly collapsed to the ground, his body convulsing uncontrollably. He felt no pain, but he could feel himself changing. He saw with horror that his vibrant purple scales were darkening, becoming charcoal black. He felt his teeth enlarging, serrated edges forming, becoming almost shark-like. His claws, tiny and barely visible, sprouted out and became curved and sharp. His tail elongated, the limb whipping the ground as if it were alive.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike soon blacked out, the last thing he saw being his body growing bigger...</span></div></div>",

Twilight entered, using her magic to levitate a rather large package in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Twilight!\" Spike called out. \"What's in that package?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A mirror,\" said Twilight, as she carefully placed the package on the floor. \"Princess Celestia suspects this mirror is magical and she wants me to verify it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds interesting,\" said Spike. With permission from Twilight, he opened up the package to reveal the mirror. It was a beautiful thing; the frame was adorned with silver and gold and the glass...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a look, Twilight,\" said Spike. \"The glass of the mirror almost looks like the surface of a quiet lake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight walked over to look in the mirror together with Spike. The moment they both looked into the mirror, it's magic activated. Spike and Twilight were first put in a trance by the mirror. Then, the glass of the mirror shone bright and the souls of both Twilight and Spike were sucked into the mirror. They were quickly spat out again though, exept for one detail: Twilight's soul flew into Spike's body and Spike's soul flew into Twilight's body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith it's magic exausted for now, the mirror once more went inert, causing it's victims to come out of the trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is the first to regain their bearings?</span></div></div>",

For one thing he was not in his basket, but a bed, In a strange, enormous yet vaguely familiar room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened? Did Twilight drag me in here? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hoped out of bed, to inspect his strange surroundings, landing on his feet. At least he was expecting  feet, but looking down he noticed he was on four hooves!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick glance of his his body, revealed he had somehow turned into a pony! A young stallion, not quite fully grown, with a purple body and a green mane. He felt  it in his hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah I never had hair before\u2026 except for my stache.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike wondered how this change had happened, but he wasn\u2019t too bothered. Twilight had probably been messing with a spell and brought him here. Now he had a chance to impress Rarity!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, something was strange about this room. It looked like one of the rooms to Twilight\u2019s castle, but was much too big, bigger than Twilight\u2019s bedroom! Even the doorframe was huge, much larger than any pony would ever need, even Celestia. He hadn\u2019t shrunk had he? Spiek\u2019s furntiure and belongings seemed approite to his size. Ah well, Twilight would be sure to explain what ever strange had happened, and if not, they\u2019d find out together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into the hall, it too was much larger, as was everything else! Maybe he really had shrunk. He raced for Twilight\u2019s room hoping to find an answer. His new legs felt strange, but he had no trouble galloping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwilight! Twlight!\u201d Spike shouted, as he raced along the long hall. Twilight\u2019s room was almost in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike\u2019s shouting had clearly awoken her, and he could hear her stirring. It sounded louder than he would expect\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm\u2026. What is it Helping Hooves?\u201d Twilight\u2019s tone was the same, but her voice sounded different<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not Helping Hooves I\u2019m-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he drew closer, he could see, an enormous purple shape lifting itself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhhh!\u201d Spike jumped as the shape turned to face him. \u201cTwilight\u2026 you\u2019re a dragon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight grimaced. Even as a dragon, she still had the same facial expressions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell of course I am, you didn\u2019t wake me for this, did you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you cast some kind of spell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight tilted her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? I\u2019ve always been a dragon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo you\u2019re a pony and I\u2019m the dragon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this some kind of dream you had? We\u2019ve always been like this, come on Helping Hooves, lets get some breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you call me that? My name is Spike!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever, maybe you\u2019ll feel better after some breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight walked out of her room, as though everything was completely ordinary. She headed for the kitchen, manoeuvring around Spike as though she had done it a hundred times before.. How could she be so casual about this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut- But.\u201d Spike didn\u2019t know what to say. Had something happened to her mind?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some effort, he pushed back Twilight\u2019s enormous curtains and gasped at what he saw. Ponyville was much larger, yet still resembled the backwater town he knew. Yet instead of the ponies he expected to see walking and flying around, their were dragons!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this a dream? An alternate reality? A really crazy spell mishap?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what did Rarity look like in this strange reality?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe he\u2019d find out after breakfast</span></div></div>",

I can't get at them at the moment.

Spreading it over the Princess, she laughed quietly. \"For all the love your subjects give you, by the end of this week, they will betray you. You will feel what it's like to be run out of your rightful kingdom. And you will have no choice but to turn to me for help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With that, Chrysalis, the Changeling Queen, slipped out of the window, and scurried off into the night, doing everything in her power to avoid detection.</span></div></div>",

Her whole body felt she'd gone three round wih an ursa, without using magic. She finally managed to crawl out of her plush bed and practically fell on the floor. Muttering an expletive so ancient no even Luna knew its meaning, she stretched her body with several loud cracks and shuffled to her full-length mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was'nt prepared for what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the mirror, in contrast to her usual radiance and appearent youth, was a very old looking alicorn. The usually bright colors of her mane were pale and faded, the mane itself, usually flowing in an unseen etheral breeze, hung limply around her wrinkled face, her coat was pale grey instead of brilliant alabaster and her magenta eyes had lost their vaugely mischevious glint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this...?\" Celestia noticed her voice was now rough and hoarse. When she finally worked up the willpower to pry her gaze from the mirror, she gasped when she saw the clock, she was supposed to raise the sun a half hour ago! Ignoring the pain from her protesting joints, she stiffly mad her way to her balcony and began the ritual she had maintained for several millenia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching out with the unique spell she inherited from her mother so long ago, Celestia touched the sun she had known so long and nudged it over the horizon, its life-giving warmth washed over her land. Celestia released the spell she held and slumped to the floor, 'I don't remember raising the sun being so difficult...' she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took about ten minutes for Celestia's strength to return so she could stand up, which she struggled to do. She nearly had a heart attack when there was an urgent knocking at her door. \"Enter\" she called, her door opened and her sister Luna stepped in, closing the door behind her. \"Sister, are you alright? You were late... with the...\" Luna's voice trailed off as she saw her dear sister in her current state. \"Hello Lulu.\" Celestia said with a weak smile. \"Celestia... what has hppened to you?\"</span></div></div>",

Wonderful! I've only know her for one day and I already feel so much love for her. I'll do anything to make her happy, and there's so many things the two of us could do, like reading a book to her.

Her attention  soon turned to her sister as Celestia ran towards her and say, \"Oh my goodness Luna, are you alright my little one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia soon was right next to her and was checking her for any scratches or bruises. Luna wondered why Celestia was treating her like a new born filly. That's when she realized how big her sister was compared to her self. Luna was the size of a new born filly. Trying to swallow back her remaining tears, she tried to talk to Celestia, but all that came out was, \"Apababada (Baby Talk).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna realized her body must have regressed to that of a baby filly. She saw that she was in a diaper even. Celestia then picked Luna up in her mouth and place her on the bed. \"GUARD!\" Celestia yelled in the old royal voice, scaring Luna a bit as she ducked down on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard soon came in and said \"Yes your majesty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I had told you specifically to watch over my daughter as I prepared the crib, not to guard the door outside my room. My daughter could have been seriously injured,\" Celestia scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Colt shivered in his armor with no answer to respond with. \"You're dismissed. You may go now. your 'duty' is done here. I expect better of you next time. Dusty, you may bring the crib in,\" Celestia says and soon a crib with a moon on it was dragged into Celestia's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna had never seen this side of Celestia before. If she was putting on an act, she was playing the mother part quite well. But why did Celestia call her 'daughter'. Luna knew they were sisters. Why would Celestia go and say that, unless, it may be part of an act and Celestia has some sort of plans for Luna to 'fit in' with modern day ponies. Luna didn't realize that while she was thinking over all of this she had peed soaked her diaper and started to feel the warmth on her tush. She felt a little embarrassed by the fact she had no control over her bladder and Celestia says, \"Looks like some one needs a diaper change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Celestia know that it was Luna or was Luna the only one aware of her situation?</span></div></div>",

Fluttershy was the kindest pony in all of town, she takes care animals for a living which many she should have more of an idea of taking care of baby then DJ, and Fluttershy would make better motherly figure then DJ.

She been to tear up and cling on to DJ's mane. <br>\r\n\"Look my best gal, I just leaving you with her for just a little while, I'll be back soon\" DJ said calming down Octavia, it seem to work. It was still very early in the day, so early you could still see the moon, on the way to fluttershy's DJ notice how amazing the moon and starts look to night, she thought Luna must put so much work into the night sky. She stood at the door of the wooden cottage built into a tree, she knocked at the door and wait, she could see the highest window still had lights coming from it meaning that she must be up. the door open with a mare standing there half asleep with a bunny on back looking somewhat mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm....hello...what can I do for you?\" The yellow mare asked in her shy way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you see I kinda....well....did this to my roommate\" Said DJ turn to her side in order to show octavia, fluttershy  knew who that was, see as octavia was pretty well know as one of the only non-unicorn musicians.<br>\r\n\"Oh my....what do you want me to do?\" Ask fluttershy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you to take care of her a little bit and....show me how to take care of a child\" DJ said, getting the feeling that today is gonna be a very long day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I can do that\" Said fluttershy, leading them in, before fluttershy took Octavia off her hands, she show DJ how to take care of a baby like how to fed them, burp them, calm them down and such.

Once Octavia calmed down, the usually shy pony flew to a nursery used when babysitting the Cakes' twins. A changing table had been the first place Fluttershy went to. As soon as the foal saw the diaper about to be placed on her, she freaked out, \"No! N-no diapie!\" Fluttershy sighed. What would she do with this little one?!

Octavia reluctantly nodded as DJ went into the other room to get the drink. Octavia look at the words on the page, but some weird happen, she didn't understand any of it...she couldn't read even the most simple words now. The dam was now broken and tears were flowing out now.

As Octavia drank down the milk she couldn't helped but be bored by the story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This story is boring!\" Octavia shout much like a toddler. DJ look down at her and had an idea she got up and head to her room, she came back holding a book, a picture book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that book?\" Ask Octavia <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its a story book, one my mother would read to me\" DJ said sitting back down and start to read the book out loud, showing Octavia each picture in the book.

She tried to dodge it, but it was to fast and unpredictable, soon hitting her on the side. She felt strange, but it seemed that nothing had happened to her. She just decided to shake it off and go to sleep, it was pretty late. But as she slept, the affects of the bolt started to take affect.</span></div></div>",

Vinyl wasn't really thinking about Octavia's needs and how this music would interrupt her practicing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl then levitated the remote and sat in her music sofa. (The sofa she'd sit in just to hear music blast through her ears) \"Alright Time Break, show me what ya GOT!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl turned on her stereo and the room was quickly filled with a loud DJ mix. Vinyl's mane flicked back while the music was blasting air and magic over Vinyl. Little did Vinyl know about the magic though, because her eyes were closed so she could just take in the music. She had a huge smile on her face, while she slowly regressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe regression sped up or slowed down depending on the current tempo. To a non-DJ, the tempo was pretty fast, but it was relatively slow for a DJ. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Octavia could only feel its vibrations on the house \"Oh brother.. Vinyl, why can't you be more proper?...\" She thought to herself though, \"It's not worth it. You can't here it Octavia. You know what happens with Vinyl and her music.\" Octavia sighed and went back to her music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl had regressed only 2 years before the tempo jumped up to even faster speeds. Within 10 seconds of the tempo change, Vinyl had already lost 1 year. The song stayed on this tempo and her years quickly vanished. As the song went on, something changed about the atmosphere. The room underwent a massive change, essentially becoming a baby room. The carpet was now soft to a touch, the room became a soft shade of blue and white, and the sofa turned to a shade of pink. A playpen with all sorts of toys, such as blocks, formed in the corner. Nearby, a stroller formed, with a blue baby bag, which contained bottles, pacifiers, and other baby necessities. A changing table with stacked diapers and baby supplies even formed near the stereo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the room transformed, so did Vinyl. 2 minutes into the fast tempo, she was already younger than the CMC. She was only a couple years away from being at the ripe age of 1. All these transformations happened without Vinyl's knowledge. She was still entranced by the sound of the music. The tempo then changed to something softer as song was finishing up, and Vinyl slowly regressed to the age of the Twin Cakes. Right before the song finished, magic hit Vinyl and a fresh diaper formed around her flank. Once the diaper was on little Vinyl and Vinyl was the age as the Twins, the music stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl opened her eyes after the song and was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The stereo clocked on by itself, but the music it played was softer lighter. It almost sounded like a lullaby, something meant to sooth younger ponies. That also seemed to knock Vinyl out of her trance. Her eyes winded, her pupils shrunk, and her head whipped around the room. What in Cewestia's name happened! She squeaked and covered her mouth. Me voice. Me no sound wike tat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally looked at herself, specifically her blank flank covered by a diaper. No! No! Tis no wight! With a shaking hoof she prodded the diaper as if to confirm her suspicion. When it didn't disappear in a puff of smoke Vinyl panicked. No! Tis no wight! Me no foaw! Tis must be a twick! Abuh ga! Her quickly deteriorating speech only added to her mounting panic. All Vinyl could really focus on was an overwhelming desire to get away and she hopped off the sofa. Unfortunately the small step for an adult was a bit further for a foal. The fall didn't hurt, the carpet was really soft, but the sock finally pushed Vinyl over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOctavia had long ago tuned out Vinyl's racket and lost herself in her music. The grey mare had a smile on her face as she moved her bow across her beloved instrument loosing herself in its notes. The grey earth mare had entered a state of Zen and didn't know that Vinyl's music had stopped. She did hear when a foals loud wail cut through the house shattering the peace like a hammer through glass. Octavia screeched her bow sliding across her cello creating a sound that would be compared to a sick cat screeching. Vinyl! Octavia yelled dropping her gear and running to her friends room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl! The white foal stopped crying when she heard her friends voice. Octavia stood in the door way her face slowly morphing from panic to a flat blank look. The grey mare looked around the room slowly her face unreadable before her eyes fell onto her teary eyes regressed friend. The music continued to play.</span></div></div>",

Vinyl started to cry softly her own fear only multiplying upon seeing Octavia start to panic. Octavia heard the crying and walked over to the blue mane foal. Gently she picked the crying foal up. Vinyl. Is that really you? She asked her mind still having a hard time accepting this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white foal looked at her with teary dark eyes and nodded. Oh. My. Celestia! Vinyl what happened?! Octavia shrieked clutching her friend to her barrel. Vinyl tried to explain but all that came out was babble and half formed words. \"Oh no! I/she can't talk!\" Both thought at the same time. Oh, dear. This is not good. Octavia was \"this\" close to loosing it. Suddenly finding your friend/roommate turned into a foal with a fully stocked nursery was not something she had expected to see. \"I'm not ready to be a mother!\" Octavia thought her head already filling with how this could go wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl though knew she had to do something and beat on her friends chest with a hoof. It caused about as much damage as getting hit with styrofoam but it got Octavia to look at her. Ta mooo-ik! Vinyl said pointing to the stereo which continued to play the soothing melody. Octavia blinked clearly confused. Mooo-ik! Vinyl said again pointing widely. \"Moo-ik\" Octavia repeated. Moo-ik? Moo, mu, music! We need to turn off the music! Vinyl nodded widely. The grey mare set her friend down and charged to the stereo. Vinyl held her breath as Octavia reached out a hoof and hit the stop button.

She wasn't really thinking about her friend and in the last second before the magic hit Vinyl, Octavia called out \"VIIIIINYL!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magic energy flowed into the nearest living thing and after a 10 seconds of entering Vinyl, the little baby room was filled with a farting sound followed by a drizzle. Vinyl's first diaper as a newly-regressed foal was ruined. After the noises, there was a brief pause of silence. Shortly after, Vinyl burst out into a loud wail. \"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOctavia looked nervous and peeked from the side of the sofa. The wave of magic was gone, but what she feared would happen, did happen. Vinyl had an accident. She would have to change her own roommate's <i>diaper</i>. The word \"improper\" didn't even begin to describe this situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOctavia mustered up the courage and approached her crying diapered roommate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl didn't even notice Octavia. She was too focused on her messy situation. In her mind, she harshly criticized herself \"How could you do this Vinyl?! You're a nopony! You're a nothing! Octavia will not help you. No one will. You're a waste of space and no one should waste their time with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOctavia slowly walked up to Vinyl, partly not to scare Vinyl and partly to keep her distance. Something happened though in her slow walk to Vinyl. She came up with an idea, something that just might sooth Vinyl. Octavia sang notes \"Fa Re Laaaaaaaa Mi Dooooooo..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOctavia continued to sing, but it had little effect. One other idea hit her. She soon approached Vinyl, preparing to do something more soothing. Before she could do anything, she smelled the intense stench originating from Vinyl's diaper. Octavia tried with all her will to ignore the smell, saying to herself \"It's ok. It's ok. Vinyl's a friend. She will know something had to be done.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter mentally rehearsing herself, Octavia said in a firm motherly tone \"There, there, Vinyl. It's Ok. Octavia is here.\" Vinyl merely wailed a little softer after hearing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then picked up Vinyl, saying in her mind \"ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew!\" Once Vinyl was snuggly in her front hooves, Octavia rocked her back and forth. She would've sung something, but her mind was lost on what to sing. She wasn't exactly skilled at winging music, especially when she was nervous like right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl looked up at Octavia with her adorable eyes and said \"Aaktaabiiaa.. tanks... me owwa won.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOctavia forced a fake smile \"It's nothing. Now, let's get you... situated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl nodded and Octavia carried her over to the changing table. The changing had begun for the first one at least. Octavia knew the process, just doing <i>diaper change</i> on her roommate was still uncomfortable to the nth degree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe first pulled out some baby powder and wipes and said \"let's see how that diaper of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOctavia undid the diaper straps and quickly threw the dirty diaper into a waste-pin. She sighed. Things were worse than she thought. At least, the worst of <i>this</i> changing was behind her. For the rest of the changing, Octavia handled herself much better. In no time at all, She then lifted up Vinyl's chubby hind legs and wiped her flank clean. Lastly, she applied baby powder to Vinyl's behind and slid a fresh new diaper in place. Octavia strapped the new diaper in place and everything was back to a calm state. Hopefully, it would last long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Vinyl's changing was done, Octavia stated \"I guess I'll be acting as your temporary mother. I'm sorry if I panicked earlier. I just don't know what to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl Scratch...</span></div></div>",

On one hoof having Octavia as her \"mommy\" for however long this lasted just screamed awkward on so many levels. \"She's probably thinking about how \"improper\" this entire situation is.\" Vinyl though a little amused as she looked at the grey mare. On the other, she really didn't have much choice. She had just had her diaper changed for Celestia's sake! She needed somepony to look after her and Octavia was probably the pony she trusted most for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOctavia for her part was tying to keep a smile on her face. Her \"mommy!\" Octavia what were you thinking?!She thought, scolding herself mentally.Do you even know how, well \"improper\" does not even come close to describing this! You just offered to take care of her until this corrects itself. You have never even taken care of someponies else's foal let alone your own! This means more diaper changes! \"Ewewewew! eeeeeeewwwwwwww! I don't know if I can survive many more of those!  Why in the darkest corners of my mind did I even humor the idea of having a foal of my own?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOctavia was brought out of her spiraling thoughts when Vinyl hugged her. The foal had crawled over to the end of the table and wrapped her tiny hooves as far around her friend as they could. Oway. Vinyl said soft. She spoke slowly forcing the words out to the best of her ability. Tank eu Octie. Tu da bestist. \"Oh now I remember.\" Octavia thought as she returned the awkward hug. The two just held that position for several moments basking in the first true moment of piece in what seemed like an eternity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes this mean you'll start calling me mommy? Octavia asked playfully. Yes it was strange for her to make a joke but she needed a laugh. Vinyl broke the hug shaking her head \"no\" but she did giggle. Good. Octavia's smile fell. Now Vinyl I will try to treat you as an adult as much as possible, but no promises. You need certain things now and I would really like if you didn't fight me to hard. Octavia said seriously. The foal nodded sadly. As much as she hated it things would change for her. She wouldn't fight, but that didn't mean she wouldn't argue against certain things. Like the cloths. There was no way Octavia was putting a foal dress on her! Vinyl sighed and poked her second diaper with a frown already dreading the future. Octavia noticed. Well I have to change you so I think I got the worse end of the deal. The mare argued back. Vinyl agreed with a giggled. Yeth! Tu got...bad...pawt. Octavia sighed to brace herself for the future and picked her charge up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens to disrupt the moment of calm?</span></div></div>",

Octavia said after a minute of thought.<br>\r\nVinyl nodded happy they at least had a plan now. Ok then. Octavia said forcing a smile. Lets go see the princess. Vinyl clapped. Yay! Then what Octavia said registered. We? Yes we. Ou-swde? Vinyl asked her voice nervous. Yes outside. Octavia said with a sigh bringing her over to the stroller. Waa?! No! Vinyl yelled starting to squirm. Octavia groaned. So much for \"not fighting me.\" The musician though. Listen Vinyl. I. Am. Not. Leaving. You. Alone. Octavia said emphasizing each word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI refuse to leave you without supervision so you are coming with me. The two glared at one another their wills fighting. Octavia won. Its either the stroller where I can out the top down and cover you with a blanket. Or my back where everypony can see you. The threat worked and Vinyl deflated like a balloon. Otay. She said her lip quivering. Octavia felt something stab her heart. \"Oh dang it. Not the sad foal look!\" Look I'm sorry Vinyl. Octavia said sincerely rocking her slightly in an attempt to cheer her up. But I can't leave you alone. You understand right? The foal sniffed and nodded. Octavia bit her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTell you what after we finish with Twilight I'll take you for ice-cream. Vinyl perked up. Wih spwinles? Rainbow sprinkles. Octavia promised. Vinyl smiled and Octavia pat herself on the back. Soon Vinyl was placed in the stroller and the strapped in. The foal twisted some, but found the strap too tight to do much more than move her upper body and kick. Tis es dumb. She said crossing her forelegs and pouting. Octavia bit back a \"daww.\" Well its certainly better than letting everypony see you. The mare said tucking a blanket around her charge and pulling the cover down hiding Vinyl from view. Vinyl would never admit it, but she did feel comfy like this and a small sigh escaped her. Seeing her change settle down Octavia opened the diaper bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow lets see here. Diaper, whips, powder, bottles, formula, a pacifier, some toys? Octavia's voice became more confused as she continued to find more and more items that made up a very well stocked diaper bad. The grey mare pulled out a rattle and both stared at it. Well whoever made this spell was certainly through. Octavia commented putting the toy back. Neither pony knew how to feel about that. That done Octavia approached the stereo like it was a snake ready to strike. Vinyl managed to wiggle her head around to watch. Octavia approached, and hit the button that would eject the CD. They flinched, and when nothing happened they both gave long sighs of relief. Holding it like a bomb Octavia carefully placed the CD in the bag. She didn't know what to expect and the relief was palatable when it didn't blow up or send them into an alternate universe. Well, time to go. Octavia said more to get herself going more than anything. Vinyl, her forward vision blocked by the screen, whimpered and sunk into the seat praying that nothing would happen. It's ok Vinyl. Octavia soothed slinging the bag on. I'm sure Twilight will know something.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had some vague plan of grabbing Vinyl as she ran but it didn't matter. Octavia had gotten three step when the magic was finally released. Vinyl cried out if fear as the burst of magic hit the grey mare and she began to shrink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike Vinyl the changes were not slow but fast as if the magic wanted to hurry the process up. Octavia opened her mouth in a silent scream as her body twitched with the magic. A diaper appeared on her flank before her cutie mark vanished. The rest of her body soon changed to match her new wear becoming smaller and chubbier as her body took on the big headed, chubby limb look of a foal. She got smaller and smaller as time went on quickly dropping from a mare, to a teenager, to a filly, and then a toddler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she dropped bellow two years her iconic bowtie popped into her hair, becoming an oversized hair bow. Finally after less than a minute the magic vanished leaving a grey foal around the same age as Vinyl or the Cake Twins if a bit older. Octavia looked at her tiny chubby hooves in shock before looking own at her own blank, diaper covered, flank. Octavia looked up at Vinyl her eyes a mixture of fear and disbelieve. Octavia's eyes suddenly began to water and she began to wail. WAAAAAAAAAAA!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a good set of lungs and the noise penetrated the entire house. The shock of seeing her friend regress along with hearing her cry also pushed Vinyl's emotions over the edge, again. Both foals wailed at the top of their lungs expressing their fear in the only way they could. The noise was deafening echoing thought the house and exiting onto the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is quite possible someone heard them crying. The question is who hears something and goes to check?</span></div></div>",

Vinyl saw a sort of flash in Octavia\u2019s eyes before her entire expression softened. To Vinyl\u2019s almost overwhelming shock Octavia smiled at her, a soft gently smile more tender and caring than any expression Vinyl had ever seen on her friend. What\u2019s wrong sweetie? Octavia asked walking over to a shocked Vinyl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOctie it\u2019s me! Can\u2019t you see something wrong!?\u201d Oocttaa iii caaaa uuuu agable! Vinyl\u2019s heart sunk lower as only foalish babbly left her mouth and she started to cry harder. Hello to you two wittle winle! Octavia cooed picking her up. No, no. Don\u2019t cry sweetie. Mommies here. Shhhhh. Octavia started to rock the foal and hum a lullaby, gently rubbing Vinyl\u2019s back as she did. Despite herself Vinyl started to calm down, her new body reacting to Octavia\u2019s efforts to calm her and her cries softened. Vinyl suddenly jerked when she felt something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA faint hissing sound reached her ears and she looked down to see a growing stain on her diaper. \u201cI\u2019m wetting myself!\u201d She screamed in her head shocked that she didn\u2019t even feel such an action. A moment later Vinyl felt her stomach churn. \u201cOh no! Please! Celestia! Luna! Anypony not that!\u201d Vinyl\u2019s prayers went unanswered and her first diaper of her new found foal hood was ruined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAWW was that it? Octavia cooed giving a motherly smile. Did my little pony just need to make a big stinky? Well, let mommy change that smelly dydee.  Vinly had reached the breaking point and went past it. Not only had she been turned into a foal, she had messed herself like one, in her friends arms, who apparently thought she was her mother!  She continued to cry and squirm as she was laid on the changing table. Now hold still. Mommy can\u2019t work with you squirming. Vinyl felt the strap slide across her chubby tummy, restricting her movement as her first diaper change in over two decades commenced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere we go. Octavia said cheerily picking the foal back up when she finished. You are just fussy today. I think somepony needs a nap. Vinyl continued to squirm and babble, trying to explain what had happened or at least escape. She did not want to listen to that accursed sound anymore! Who knew what it would do?! She was a foal though, and was powerless as Octavia swaddled her and set her in the crib. Vinyl kicked her legs, the only movement she could make wrapped in her fleece cocoon, as she was set into the crib her eyes pleading with Octavia. The grey mare just smiled, popped a pacifier in her mouth, and kissed her on the head. Now you get some nice sleep while mommy practices. Vinyl felt her hope wither as she watched Octavia walk to the door. Suddenly the mare stopped, confused, and changed course to the stereo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t remember putting this on. Octavia mused finally noticing the song now that her foal had been tended to. \u201cTime skip?\u201d Never hear of her. Vinyl dared to hope as Octavia mused over the accursed, magic music that had caused all this.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You're one of if not the best DJ in all of Equestria.\" Grabbing the last book she wanted, Vinyl said \"You of all ponies know that even the mighty need a little help now and then.\" After all the checking out was finished, Vinyl grabbed the books, waved good-bye, and left for home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[End of flashback]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl looked out the window to see Luna's moon was well into the night sky. \"Ahhhhrg\" she screamed in frustration. she grabbed the closest book and was about to throw it when she saw somthing.

It read, <br>\r\n\"Rainbowdash don't forget to bring the gem of mystery back in the box.

Derpy replied, \"Just one last letter for ya bow.\" Rainbowdash looked into her box and said, \"Thanks your the best Derp.\" Derpy said her good bye and flew off back to the other mail ponies. <br>\r\nShe checked out of her job and went home to take her daily nap. When it was about midday she woke up and saw that her pouch was glowing. She looked into the pouch and saw the strange crystal begin to float. She looked around and the crystal flew at her. There was a bright flash and shortly nothing. She was scared but quickly calmed down. The crystal fell to the floor and laid there powerless.<br>\r\nShe looked at it in curiosity.

But deep down, he can't help but be a little jealous of his little sister.  Jealous for rising to the status of alicornhood, gaining immortality, and power beyond his wildest dreams.  Although his sister becoming an alicorn, or the godlike power she gained made his green with envy, it was her immortality was what made him jealous.  Jealous that she would remain youthful for millennia, while he would grow old and die.  But that led to a completely different and stronger emotion that took hold of him: sadness.  He was reminded of how his wife would remain young for generations, while he would grow old and die.  But he knew what he was getting into when he married Cadance, how their marriage wouldn't last forever and he promised to make her years with him the best years of her life, since his chances of gaining immortality were slim.  His thoughts are interrupted when one of the castle servants comes by and says, \"Sir, your wife asked me to come look for you, she expecting you to return to your bed chambers and she wants to tell you something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining smiles and says, \"I'm coming.  I'm just getting a little fresh air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaves the balcony and trots towards his and Cadance's chambers.  He arrives and sees his wife, Cadance, laying on their bed, still awake. (Author's note: Don't worry, this isn't clop) He closes the door, walks over to their bed and lays down with her.  Cadance turns her head and stares at him lovingly.  She says, \"Hey, Shiny.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckles at her nickname for him and reaches out and and strokes her mane with a hoof.  He says, \"Hey Cadance.  So what is it you wanted to tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asks, \"Do you know what tomorrow is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Shining says, \"I don't know, Thursday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe says, \"Well yes, but no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking some more, he says, \"The day one of your aunts come to visit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling a little, she says, \"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile thinking, one horrifying idea comes to his mind.  He says, while paled, \"I didn't forget our first wedding anniversary, did I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe says, \"No!  That's not for another 3 months, silly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a sigh of relief, he says, \"Okay, you got me, what's tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing out loud, she says, \"You silly colt!  It's your birthday, tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActing surprised, he says, \"Really?  I guess it slipped my mind.  Thanks for remembering, sweetheart, but you don't have to do anything for me, I'm just turning 22, it's no big deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at him with such love and compassion, she says, \"You're my husband, Shining.  That makes all your birthdays special to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnuggling closer to him and placing her head under his chin, and nuzzling his neck, she says, \"And tomorrow morning, you'll get the best present you could ever ask for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling down at his beautiful wife, he says, \"Cadance, I already have everything I could ever ask for.  I have an amazing family, an adorable little sister, a majestic home, and best of all.\"  He strokes her pink coat of fur on her back, and says, \"I have the most beautiful wife a stallion could ever ask for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGazing into her lover's eyes, she says, \"Then you're in for quite a surprise tomorrow morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling her closer, he says, \"I'll believe that when I see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe falls asleep quickly, and Cadance sneaks out of bed to prepare the gift.  She looks back at her sleeping husband, and whispers, \"You'll love tomorrow morning, Shining.\"  She then exits the room and walks down the hall.</span></div></div>",

Then he thinks, 'Wait, did she just say we?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then opens his eyes more clearly, and sees Twilight standing by Cadance.  He exclaims, \"Twily! I didn't expect you to be here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight says, \"Why wouldn't I be here for my B.B.B.F.F.?  It's your birthday, for crying out loud!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadance says, \"Twilight came here to help me with your gift.

He puts on a confused face when suddenly he notices something on his back that takes his breath away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining Armor notices what looks like tufts of feathers on each side of his back but the shock makes him move a new set of muscles he never had before and a pair of white wings spring from his back.  With a slightly open mouth, he touches one of the wings with his hoof and retracts it a little when he feels real soft feathers.  He then looked back at his forehead to check if he still has his horn, and sure enough, it's still there.  He can only stare at what he sees; he has wings!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe mutters, \"How did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe feels someone rub his neck and say, \"Happy birthday, Shining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks behind him to see Cadance rubbing her head into his neck and smiling at him.  He tries to ask, \"I'm a\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight says, \"An alicorn? Yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought comes to his mind and he asks, \"Does this mean I'm also\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadance finishes, \"Immortal? Of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSining Armor turns his attention back to the mirror and continues to stare at his body.  He studies his wings and how majestic they look.  He is still having trouble processing his body.  He's now an alicorn.  Just last night, he was thinking about how slim his chances were of becoming ascended and gaining wings.  Yet here he is, turned from a mortal unicorn into an immortal alicorn, the very image of a god or goddess, the most powerful and awe-inspiring pony in the history of Equestria, all in the length of a single night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that thought, he tries concentrating his magic and found that it has become more powerful.  He stands there with his eyes closed, feeling the power of a god flow through him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight asks, \"So, what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining turns around with his still confused expression and asks, \"One Question.  How did this happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadance and Twilight smile at each other and Cadance says, \"We were thinking you were going to say that!  Well, it all started a little after you fell asleep\u2026\"</span></div></div>",

It's to set the tone for how Sunset Shimmer is feeling and goes along with the phrase from the last choice, \"she needs some fun in her life.\" )<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about 11 o'clock on Saturday. Spring break had just arrived, which meant Sunset Shimmer and her friends had a full week of break ahead of them. Sunset Shimmer had already made plans to spend at least half of her break in Equestria. There was a fair level of apprehension to the trip though. This would be the first time in years that Sunset spent nights in Equestria, in her pony body. She wanted to catch up with Celestia, Twilight, and all of Twilight's friends. Still, she was nervous. What would Celestia be like, or Twilight even. She had some idea for Twilight, but she and her only had one visit and the rest had been through book text. She also didn't know what would Twilight's friends be like, how similar they'd be to her own friends. She also know why she had to rely on just Twilight's friends. She didn't really have any other friends to meet, since she avoided friendship last time she was in Equestria. Lastly, was her parents. Facing them would be difficult. It was just about as stress inducing as meeting Celestia again. At least for Celestia, she had a pen pal that constantly reassured her about Celestia. She had nothing like that for her parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for her human friends, the humane5 didn't mind their friend being gone. In fact, they encouraged it. Her friends, especially Rarity, knew how important such a visit could be for Sunset and wouldn't let their friend back out on such an opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset Shimmer was just finishing up on her last entry in the magical book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dear Princess Twilight,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't wait to see you, Celestia, and all you're friends. I'm already packed. So, all I have to do is lend this book to Fluttershy for my trip and head through the portal. I should be coming through the portal in about 30 to 40 minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the way, thank you for letting me do come back to Equestria. It means a lot to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour friend,<br>\r\nSunset Shimmer</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(The portal only worked because the book was in both universes. So, the book would have to stay in the human universe for Sunset to easily come back.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Sunset finished, she closed the book and held onto it closely. This was a habit of hers ever sense she started using the book again. If it was in use, as opposed to being a past relic, she wanted to keep it as protected as possible. She walked downstairs at brisk pace to find Fluttershy caring for an animal friend in the living room. After Sunset had made friends with the humane5, she ended up staying at Fluttershy's, instead of that rundown apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset approached Fluttershy somewhat softly, but still made enough sound to make her presence known. Sunset was nervous leaving her friend for the weekend, so she decided to spit the words out fast and get the anxiety over with. In a moderate talking voice she said \"Hey Fluttershy, I'm off to Twilight's. Here is my book. I know you will, but please keep it safe while I'm gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy was a little overwhelmed by her friends assertive fast response. Still, Fluttershy quickly smiled and nodded, petting Angel to reassure him that everything was OK. Fluttershy knew Sunset was stressed and this was just the form her stress took. She tried to mimic Sunset's speed of conversation to get it over with for Sunset's sake, but a part of her still pushed back, trying to give a calm slower response \"Don't worry Sunset. I'll keep it safe. Tell Twilight that I and the rest of said \"hi\" and have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset smiled confidently and responded again in her fast talking voice \"You bet! Thanks again. I'll make sure to tell you and everyone else, all about it when I come back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than a minute, Sunset was out the door, walking at a steady pace to the nearest bus stop. She was focused on her task, getting to the bus stop. Normally, she was aware of her reactions to Fluttershy, but this morning not one thought went through her head about how she reacted to Fluttershy. She was too stressed, to think about such things. The weather was nice, sunny with mild breeze, but Sunset paid it little attention. Within roughly 8 minutes Sunset arrived at the bus stop down the cul-de-sac, several minutes early. Sunset then started thinking about Equestria. Her mind became lost on what would happen in Equestria. It was exciting and nerve racking at the same time, or what Pinkie would call \"nervous-cited.\" Time quickly flew by without Sunset noticing, and the bus arrived. Sunset was quick to notice the large vehicle pull up near her and broke out of thought. She paid the small bus fine and sat at one of the nearby seats. The bus was practically empty; none of her classmates would be on at such an early hour. After all spring break came just yesterday and most students wanted to sleep-in. Sunset began thinking again about Equestria, and before she knew it, 15 minutes had passed and she was at her stop. If it wasn't for the bus driver announcing their stop, Sunset might've missed it in her daze. She thanked the man for doing so and headed off, internally criticizing herself for almost missing the stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the portal was just nearby and she had plenty of time to spare, Sunset walked at a brisk pace, trying to focus again on the task at hand. Besides, thinking about what might happen was stressing her out. She planned out this morning perfectly and had more thought out plans for her trip than the average teenager. Sunset knew she was on top of things and she didn't want to make any more mistakes by thinking too much. Within 2-3 minutes she had arrived at Canterlot High and the statue. She approached the portal side, pressing her hand against it to only feel the moderately hot stone. She was ahead of her schedule. She had a sigh of relief and leaned on a side of the statue, touching the statue every so often, until she felt her fingers go through. Sunset thought again about her Equestria trip, considering her earliness a decent excuse to continue thinking about it again. Roughly four minutes passed and her thinking was topped cold, literally. Her finger had tapped on the stone and instead of her feeling a hot stone surface, it went through and she could feel a cold pass over her finger. She quickly pulled her finger out, hoping Twilight didn't see anything. It was time to leave. Before stepping through, she looked around for any humans who might see her. None, not one was in sight. Sunset took a deep breath and traveled through the portal.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sunset emerged through the portal, to find Twilight and Spike right nearby with what looked to be a pony version of Pinkie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was the first to greet Sunset, quickly followed by Pinkie and then Spike. Twilight was obviously nervous. This was the first time Twilight was meeting with Sunset Shimmer in person either. However, it was plainly obvious that Twilight had a different way of showing it. Some spectators might say that Twilight handled her stress worse, having her nervous emotions blatantly obvious. Pinkie could even tell that Twilight was more stressed than usual and so she tried to quickly butt into the conversation. Their other friends would have been there, but work was in the way. Spike wanted Twilight to relax, but on some level he could tell that he had little control over what would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight quickly said with a loud voice, almost like she rehearsed it. Perhaps she did or perhaps she just saw Sunset's hoof come through slightly.\"Hi Sunset Shimmer, how was your-?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie jumped in, greeting herself and finishing Twilight's sentence. \"Hi Sunset Shimmer, how was your trip?\" Twilight looked a little frustrated. Pinkie was taking more of an initiative than her and it was a little annoying. Spike just jumped in afterwards saying quieter \"Hi Sunset\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe simultaneous responses took Sunset very by surprise. She knew this trip would be full of energy, but she wasn't expecting a greeting that fast. Sunset spoke up, not taking the needed deep breath, \"Good, I'm really happy to be here. I just don't know where to start.\" Sunset was hoping for a second afterwards to catch her thoughts, but sure enough, Pinkie quickly butted in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's awesome!! No need to worry about your trip, I know tons of things to do, like going to Sugar Cube Corner and having you taste our delicious treats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight quickly followed behind, \"Pinkie, could I show Sunset Shimmerto  her room first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww.. but Twilight... We can do that at any time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, if this were the human Pinkie, Sunset would've chuckled, but she was concerned that such a thing would be in poor taste. So, she spoke up \"I'm open to whatever you three feel like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was annoyed by this answer, but guessed that Sunset was doing this out of gesture. So, Twilight, despite her insistence to butt in, let Pinkie take control of the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie was delighted to hear Sunset's response. She could tell that Sunset was nervous, but at least she was open enough to follow along. Still, Pinkie could see that Sunset wasn't particularly relaxed, which meant her age regression plan was a go. When Pinkie heard that Sunset was coming into town, she thought of all sorts of ways to cheer her up. And in a somewhat normal Pinkie fashion, she came up with an odd solution, this time being age regression. To Pinkie, it was the best way possible. She just had to use her special ingredients and cook up a delicious cupcake. Still, Pinkie knew Twilight would pester her, so she had to split Twilight and Spike from Sunset somehow. \"Ah HA!\" she thought. She knew how to split them up. She quickly spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's awesome! I can take you to the Sugar Cube Corner Then! In the meantime, Twilight and Spike can set up your belongings in the castle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset hesitated, but quickly said \"Sounds fun,\" to not hurt Pinkie's feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's facial expression showed she was clearly surprised, but she nonetheless said \"Alright. That sounds good\" and her and Spike were off with Sunset's saddle bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset could tell that she said the wrong thing, judging by Twilight's facial expression. However, she had no way of fixing the situation. She mentally criticized herself, but at the same time, she tried to be easy on herself, since she had no idea how to act. She quickly said in a nervous fashion, \"Cool, Well, I'll see you both soon.\" Sunset was quickly pulled by her right hoof immediately after saying that. Pinkie was ecstatic, running in a quick pace, subtly pressuring Sunset to do the same to keep up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, Pinkie had everything under control. Her on the spot ideas guaranteed her success. Still, faith was on her side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie rushed outside of Twilight's castle and Sunset just ran with her, hardly having time to pay attention to the scenery. The same thing happened outside, as Pinkie ran passed all sorts of ponies. Despite the high speed aspect of it, Pinkie still had time to say \"hi\" to every pony they passed. Sunset wished she could blend in, but just accepted her fate that she was running through town, avoiding tons of possible friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they knew it, they were at Sugar Cube Corner and the door was locked. Pinkie didn't know if the Cakes would be gone for their catering gig, but the door being locked, confirmed it. Fate most certainly was on Pinkie's side. With the door locked, the Cake Twins were probably napping. Pinkie smiled \"Here we are! Sugar Cube Corner! The doors locked but I have a key, but be quiet, the Cake Twins are probably taking naps in their cribs as we speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset Shimmer smiled. Pinkie was certainly like her Pinkie back home, yelling in excitement, but then saying to be quiet. The name, the cakes, was also familiar to her. The bakery back in the human world had two bakers of the same name and they had two twin babies as well. Sunset was beginning to feel a little comfortable with her surroundings, but she wanted to still stay on her hooves, in case something unexpected happened. She followed Pinkie inside, asking at a slightly quiet talking voice, \"What are we going to do here with the babies napping?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset's question, made Pinkie chuckle, since it gave her the idea that Sunset would soon be a baby like them and possibly napping as well. Pinkie then said gleefully \"I have this cupcake I want to make for you. It's just sooo good. You have to try it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset was a little taken back by Pinkie's chuckling. Did she say something off? Anyways she just said \"Sounds nice. Thank you Pinkie\" and watched as Pinkie used all manner of ingredients, some particular one's she was unfamiliar with. Normally, back in Equestria, she would've talked to Pinkie, while she cooked, but Sunset had been running around for so long that she preferred the silence to talking. As Pinkie was finishing up, she noticed Sunset was tired and said \"You can sit at the table over there Sunset. You're cupcake shall be done soonerific.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset sighed and said \"Thank you. I sure could use some kind of rest about now.\" Pinkie said under her breath afterwards \"don't worry, you'll get some...\" Sunset Shimmer didn't hear a word. She was too exhausted to focus on subtle stimuli. The amount of surprises that awaited her on the other side made her feel like this break would be hectic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie then put the cupcake in the oven and baked it for 5 minutes. This ingredient was special. It didn't need a lot of time, especially since Pinkie baked only one. She conveniently didn't have enough ingredients to make more than one cupcake. While Pinkie waited, she just watched the oven, and Sunset Shimmer just zoned out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed quickly and the oven dinged completion. Then Pinkie cheered, \"Your cupcake is just about ready! Just need to put on some frosting.\" Pinkie covered it in orange frosting that matched Sunset's coat with star sprinkles. Pinkie came over with the cupcake and laid it on the table. \"Here it is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset Shimmer realized almost immediately that this was a planned cupcake. Seeing it so distinctly designed really made her feel like she was in the company of friends. She passionately said \"Thank you Pinkie! This looks great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww, shucks, it's nothing. It's what friends do after all.\" Sunset felt the warmth radiate off of Pinkie and gave a happy smile, before she ate the cupcake in one bite. It was too small not to eat it in one bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taste was breath takingly delicious, but Sunset still had her eyes open after eating it. She then noticed something <i>odd </i> was happening. The world around her was getting.. bigger! Everything, the chair she was in, the table, Pinkie, the distance to the stairs. She tried containing herself. It mostly worked, but one could easily tell she was breathing heavy. She didn't know what was happening and she didn't want to immediately assume it was Pinkie's doing. Maybe she just was getting lightheaded. Her reasons didn't make much sense, seeing as she was panicking mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sunset silently panicked, her body underwent extreme changes. In a mere two minutes, she would go from a 16 year old pony to a nine month old foal. As the transformation was 75% done, Sunset's panic increased, resulting in quiet tears fall from her face. After all, her world was getting increasingly bigger with no seeming explanation. It hurt Pinkie to watch, but in her mind she had to. Not until Sunset hit the age of nine months could Pinkie say something. If she interrupted, the transformation may have stopped completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith 3 months left to go, Sunset's cries started to sound louder, until she finally hit the ripe of age of 9 months. At that point, she was wailing. \"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie knew once this happened, the transformation was complete. She quickly picked up Sunset and rocked her in her hooves after Sunset started wailing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, there, Sunny Wunny, it's okay. I'm here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie's calm words and soothing rocking broke Sunset's wails. Sunset immediately looked up at Pinkie to see what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie smiled \"See? I told you it's okay. No need to fear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset was still curious what was going on, as she was only looking at Pinkie. Her voice was high pitched and she struggled to form words. Her dialogue sounded completely opposite to her response to Fluttershy an hour earlier. \"Wha gooo-win on-\" Sunset Shimmer quickly cut herself as soon as she realized something was off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie answered her question. \"I turned you into a baby.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pinkie's words stunned Sunset. She thought to herself \"what? what is going on?!\" Sunset was filled with rage inside, but at the same time fear, and a desire to stay friends with Pinkie. All of her motives came crashing down and she didn't know how to control all the emotion. Like many babies at her age, her emotions consumed her and caused her to do the one thing many babies do, cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset Shimmer wailed even louder this time \"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!&amp; #34;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was bad. Sunset's wails would wake up the Twins. So, Pinkie made a quick decision. She plucked a pacifier into Sunset's mouth. Sunset's wails instantly stopped, because she couldn't control her mouth. She instinctively sucked on it against her own will. Though she wouldn't want to admit, there WAS something pleasing about the pacifier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sucked on it Pinkie explained her plan. \"Now listen Sunny Wunny, I did this for your own good. From the stories, I've been told, you seem all stressed wessed. You even acted it when you got here. So, I decided if you did act that way, I'd turn you into a foal. You need to remember that lighthearted fun again. That pure fun that you experience at a young age. Besides, don't worry.. You'll remain you, you'll just have a couple foal tendencies, like enjoying pacifiers, hehe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset didn't know what to do. In the long run that is. She was forced into a predicament that she couldn't resolve in the present. She'd just have to wait for Twilight or some other pony to come by and notice her. This foal-hood wouldn't last long. The best she could do at the moment was make the most out of her situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, she tried showing Pinkie that she wanted the pacifier removed. Pinkie saw it as a great sign and gladly removed it. Sunset said \"Kay... me wiw twy ta hab fun wike dis. Pwease, be gent-wle\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay! That's the spirit Sunset! Now, I can feed you, play games with you, read you a bedtime story, or tuck you in bed. But fiiiirst, somebody needs a <b>diaper change</b>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset mentally groaned after hearing \"diaper change.\" She kept on a seemly happy face, though Pinkie could tell Sunset was faking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, don't worry, this will be super duper comfy!\" Pinkie then laid Sunset Shimmer and pulled out a diaper along with some baby powder. She lifted Sunset's hind hooves into the air and applied a thorough coat of baby powder. Then she slid a fresh diaper underneath and strapped it in place. \"Ta Da! Little Sunset is all set. hehe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset really <b>really</b> didn't want to admit, but the changing was actually comfy. Perhaps this is what Pinkie meant by \"foal tendencies.\" Or... was it possible that Sunset Shimmer actually would've liked that change regardless of the foal tendencies.</span></div></div>",

She didn't know what to do. Luckily, her tummy answered for her. It growled loudly soon after Pinkie's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie giggled, and in a motherly tone said \"D'aaaaawww, looks like baby waby is hungry wungry. Don't worry. We've got plenty of baby food around here. I actually went and picked some more earlier this morning in case you wound up as a foal. Hehe. come with me.\" Pinkie's end statement was sort of silly, seeing as Sunset Shimmer was in her hooves and couldn't really move anywhere on her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Sunset could respond, Pinkie plopped her into a high chair. \"One second Sunset. I just need to do something.\" Pinkie quickly went out of sight. Sunset was scared. What else was this pony planning?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mystery of where Pinkie went was quickly answered after Sunset heard the door lock. In her mind she panicked, \"Noooo!! Now what am I gonna do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie was soon right back within view, towering over baby Sunset. She could tell that Sunset was worried. \"Awww, don't worry Sunset. I know you want to spend time with other ponies. It won't last long. I just can't have any one disturbing you or the other babies. There's all sorts of stuff you need before you see them, such as lunch, the diaper change soon after lunch, and a bundle of joy. Right now, you're all saddy waddy. We need to turn that frown upside down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset was beginning to think this was checkmate. Pinkie won. There was no way she'd see Twilight and the others any time soon. All she could do now is hold onto her adult-ness, to not be swayed by any of these baby activities, She was <b>not</b> going to stay a baby for this entire trip. A scary thought just reared over Sunset's head. \"How long did Pinkie want to keep her like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in a somewhat timid voice, Sunset bravely asked \"Pii-pinkie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie jokingly responded back \"Ye-yea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me was wondwin how wong ya wan ta keep me wike dis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie smiled \"Only until I can tell you're not stressed. When that happens though, I'm open to still taking care of you.  And don't worry, you won't have to stay in Equestria forever. Twilight might be willing to hand you over to your human friends can take care of you. I'm sure the other Pinkie will give you bundles of joy just like me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset realized the inherent paradox of that statement, In order for Pinkie to let her change back, she needed to show she wasn't \"stressed.\" In other words, she'd have to show she was enjoying herself. However, enjoying herself as a foal would make her more tempted to stay a foal. The only way out was pretending she was happy. But even that seemed like a stretch. Pinkie seemed to read her every emotions. It was bad enough that she could when Sunset was a mare, but as a foal, she instinctively let out her emotions more than she wanted. As Sunset thought about this, her emotions were already showing on the outside. While she didn't realize it, she was quietly crying. Currently, she was stressed and it like most of her emotions took a form in the outside world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Sunset was busy thinking up a storm, Pinkie came over and picked her up. \"There there... Remember. It's okay. You're foalsitter Pinkie Pie is here.\" Pinkie then rocked Sunset slowly, causing her to get a bit drowsy. Sunset then shifted her focus back to the outside world to prevent herself from falling asleep. The last thing she wanted was a baby dream. There was a scary catch to this. Pinkie could use sleep as a weapon now, stopping Sunset's thought processes either by making her go to sleep or by making her focus on the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset drowsily said, \"Pwease.. stoo-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie cut her off. \"Right! Stock you up with a baby bottle. Don't worry, I'll just take a pre-filled bottle for you.\" That wasn't what Sunset wanted to say, but couldn't really do much. At least Pinkie stopped rocking her back and forth to get the baby bottle. She could finally focus on her internal world again. This was brief though, because in less than a minute, a bottle of formula was shoved into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the pacifier, Sunset just instinctively started sucking on the bottle, against her own will. The milk was formula was surprisingly warm and it's taste was delicious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, soon after Sunset started drinking her formula, there was a knock on the door. Then Pinkie and Sunset heard Twilight speak up, \"Hey Pinkie, Sunset? Are you too home. Pinkie didn't move an inch, trying to be as quiet as possible. Sunset on the other hand, desperately wanted to speak up. In her mind, she kept telling herself \"SPEAK UP!\" Despite the self-talk, Sunset's body wouldn't stop sucking on the bottle. This is exactly what Pinkie would've wanted. She won again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight waited about a minute and then the two of them heard her say something to Spike \"Come on Spike. Apparently, they're not here. Augh, Pinkie... where did you two go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset yelled mentally \"NO! TWILIGHT! PLEASE! COME BACK!\" It was no use. She still had another half of the bottle to go through till she was finished. So, she just let it happen and tried to make the most of it. She wasn't thinking of the impact this would have. She just was tired of being stressed out and enjoying these foal activities was an escape from that. As Sunset continued to suck on the bottle, a little smile formed on the sides of her mouth. She truly was just letting formula pass through her and letting her enjoyment take over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie saw this and smiled. This was exactly what she thought would happen. Sooner or later those scary wary stress-y wess-y thoughts had to make way for joy. Sooner or later Sunset's frown would, as it had, turn upside town. Pinkie gently rocked the new baby side by side, expressing her joy somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie's success just kept on coming and there still so much more foal activities for Sunset to try out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing the bottle and being burped, Sunset...</span></div></div>",

This acquaintance was a Pink unicorn with navy blue eyes and a white mane and tail. Her name was Youthenizer and her cutie mark displayed a red heart with two light pink hearts. (Chassy was a pegasus) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Chassy asking Youthenizer leave, she stayed at the insistence of Chassy's parents. Chassy's parents were only in for a couple of days to talk about their vacation, but they tended to get off topic a lot. To be fair, it was mostly Chassy's mom. Chassy's Dad simply followed along most times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, that precise thing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after Youthenizer joined the conversation, Chassy's mom asked her. \"Sooo.. Youthenizer, what is your cutie mark supposed to represent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, well, it's supposed to represent my love of youth. Ya see, I just lose it with kids. They're so gosh darn adorable I just can't contain myself. Lucky me also gets to work as a caretaker for young ones big and small, from kids just entering school to wittle babies new to the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a tremendous career! Don't you agree Chassy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChassy just sighed. \"Yes mom..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChassy's mom then got a horrifying idea! \"Hmm.. ya know, while we're on the subject of little ones, do you want to see our little Chassy's baby pictures?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChassy and Youthenizer practially responded at the same time, saying \"WHAT?!!\" Chassy meant this in a negative sense, while Youthenizer meant this in an ecstatically positive sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChassy's mom just said \"Yup\" ignoring all of Chassy's pleas. They went up to Chassy's room and Chassy's Mom pulled out a box in Chassy's closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe box read \"Chassy's Baby Photos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of that evening the two \"d'awwwed\" over Chassy's pictures. Chassy and her dad soon went downstairs to get some piece and quiet. Chassy was still horrified at just the thought of Youthenizer seeing all of her most humiliating baby pictures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYouthenizer wound up staying for her parents whole trip and little did Chassy know Youthenizer was allowed to keep some of her baby pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a month later Chassy would experience Youthenizer's humiliating plans for her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A month after the unpleasant parent visit, Chassy's birthday finally arrived. She had been waiting weeks for this. It was supposed to be her break from all the ridiculous annoying failures in her life. Even though she was still looking for her cutie mark, her birthday had always been the one day she could escape everybody's pity. Normally, she simply received warm support and she was anticipating that this year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly for her sake, she was going to be getting far more than warm support this year. In the weeks following Chassy's birthday, Youthenizer was talking with Chassy's other friends and acquaintances, convincing them that this year Chassy's birthday should be a \"Surprise Re-First Birthday.\" In other words, this year, for a surprise, Chassy would be turned into a 1 year old with the same mentality of her current self. Youthenizer convinced everypony that this would for the best, by arguing \"Chassy would have so much more time to explore her passions without facing ridicule.\" Not only was Chassy's friends persuaded. Chassy's mom was also persuaded, rather easily compared to Chassy's friends. Chassy's mom would allow Youthenizer to take care of her daughter, as long as Chassy was able to explore her passions and that Chassy's mom could come visit. By the time of Chassy's birthday, everyone but Chassy had agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChassy found something odd about this year. Her party was going to start at noon, which was abnormally early for such an event. Sure enough, her friends set up Chassy's home with the typical party decorations by that hour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy 12:10, everypony had arrived and one of Chassy's close friends suggested \"So, Chassy, we have a special surprise for you this year. But first you need to get in your birthday girl chair and close your eyes.\" Chassy gave a confused face but followed after everypony's nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly closed her eyes and soon heard from everypony \"Are you ready? One, Two, Three\" After three, Chassy was knocked out. Her friends magically put her to sleep on three. Then with the combined magic of everypony, Chassy was transformed into an adorable baby version of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body became chubby, her wings turned to feathered stubs, her eyes to round dark red dots with a smaller white dot in each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friends were swept with cuteness at Chassy's adorable new form. Some ponies even lost all focus on the cute sleeping baby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Chassy's slumber though, her new life was being situated. Her friends transformed her belongings into that of baby belongings. Youthenizer's belongings were moved from her roommate's home to Chassy's. The party decorations were switched out with ones fitting to Chassy's new age. Last and most importantly, Chassy was dressed up. Youthenizer changed Chassy into a comfy white diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Chassy's friends got Chassy into an adorable high chair in about the same place. They each got into the same positions and gently yelled \"surprise!,\" waking up little Chassy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChassy slowly opened her eyes, becoming increasingly more confused. Once her eyes were completely open, she silently scanned the room. She made the following mental notes: Everyone looks bigger, the room is decorated for a baby birthday, my flank feels funny... The reality quickly hit her. 'I'm a BABY!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChassy immediately started wailing \"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverypony was quick to comfort her. Youthenizer rocked Chassy back in forth in her hooves and the rest of Chassy's many friends comforted her with kind words, such as \"there, there\" and \"it'll be okay sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis strangely soothed Chassy and she quickly asked \"Wha happen...\" cutting herself off once she heard her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYouthenizer explained \"It's okay Chassy. We all just turned this into a surprise re-first birthday. You're one again! Isn't that great?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis only caused Chassy to tear up again. All of her friends tried to calm her again, glaring at Youthenizer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chassy sighed sadly and buried her face into the cloud. The beige Pegasus wiped her red eyes and flicked her tail. Another dud. She muttered sadly looking at her blank flank. Despite being a full grown mare Chassy had yet to find her Cutie Mark, a fact she took great pains to hide from the world. It went without saying that this was a source of extreme shame and confusion for her. Because of this she had tried numerous jobs and hobbies hopping one would \u201cspeak to her\u201d and finally show her what her special talent was. However as the years passed and she came no closer to finding her talent her spirits started to sink despite the unwavering support of her parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed again running through a list of jobs she could try tomorrow having recently quit her current one in the weather factory, again. Maybe it\u2019s me. She muttered looking herself over. I\u2019m colored more like a unicorn than a Pegasus. Maybe I was born wrong? <br>\r\nWith a sad groan she looked up to the night sky. She suddenly gasped when she was a flash of light streak across the sky. A shooting star? She muttered remembering the old pony tail about wishing upon a star. She snorted. Wishing on a star like a little filly? Get real Chassy. But still. Can\u2019t get any worse. She muttered looking up. She thought about all her past carriers and hobbies, how each one had turned out and what she knew now. If I could try it again, I bet I could find my talent. She muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk then: \u201cI wish I had a chance to start over and find my special talent but with the knowledge I have now.\u201d Nothing happened. Of course it didn\u2019t. She sighed opening her wings and flying back to her parents\u2019 house and her room. Yes she still lived with her parents, though she paid her own bills, it was another source of shame to her. Maybe I am just a blank flank filly. She muttered. Chassy suddenly became very tired during the trip, struggling to stay aloft and simply collapsed into her bed sound asleep once she made it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room lit up with a soft silver light as she slept and a glow started to surround her. This is Equestria, and every story has a grain of truth to them, like the legend of Nightmare Moon. While wishing on a normal star doesn\u2019t do anything, wishing on a falling star is another matter. Some power had heard her wish and would grant it. Unfortunately Cassy had wished to \u201cstart over\u201d and \u201cfind her special talent.\u201d Chassy meant starting over from the beginning of her frantic job search, trying everything one more time so she can truly see what would work for her. She never said that though, and her wish to \u201cstart over\u201d would be granted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChassy was levitated into the air and began to change. Her body became small and chubby, her wings tiny feathered stubs, and her eyes rounded becoming huge orbs compared to her now tiny head. A diaper appeared on her flank, and was soon covered by a princess themed sleeper. The room also changed with its occupant. The bed morphed into a crib with several stuffed animals, a little mirrored play set hanging on the side, and even a mobile. Her dresser shrunk the top morphing into a fully stocked changing table with the cloths changing into onesies and sleepers. Other changes happened to the d\u00e9cor and wallpaper finishing the change from a mares room to a foals. When the light faded a foal no more than a year old slept peacefully in her nursery, nursing a pacifier and cuddling her teddy in a deep dreamless sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Well she got her wish. How does the family react the next morning?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Better than her old one anyway. Even the sun seemed brighter. As she woke up though she began to notice that something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rubbery item was in her mouth, that she couldn\u2019t remove. Something was also hovering above her head and there was something wrapped around her waist. Something that felt like a, a.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes snapped open. A diaper! Chassy finally got a good look at her room and herself noticing that changes that had happened last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be happening!\u201d She thought holding her bear in a vice grip and almost inhaling her pacifier in her panic. \u201cThis is just some strange dream! Princess Luna, this isn\u2019t funny! I want to wake up now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment though the pegasus heard a hissing sound and began to feel her diaper warm up. She squealed in shock realizing what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a dream! I\u2019m a baby again! But how, my wish! But I didn\u2019t mean this!\u201d She thought then she began to cry. Softly at first before escalating to a loud foal cry as she dropped her pacifier wailing like a upset foal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean this! I don\u2019t want to be a baby!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a moment later the door burst open and her mother was scooping her up. Chassey was stunned. She couldn\u2019t remember her mother ever looking so, young. Looks like her parents were also regressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shhh. Its ok sweetie. Don\u2019t cry. Shhh. Her mother said bouncing her gently and patting her back. Despite everything Chassey finds herself calming down, more so when her mother gives her pacifier back. Nursing the rubber toy helped calm her down, much to her surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere we go, nice and calm. The mother mare said patting her daughters back. After a moment the pegasus mare held her daughter at arm\u2019s length and asked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a typical summer sunday in Ponyville, the sun was out with hardly a cloud in the sky. Twilight was shopping at \"Rich's Barnyard Bargains,\" the biggest story for grocery needs. Spike would normally occupancy her, but he had scheduled for weeks that this would be his comic binge day, to catch back up. Starlight was out with her friend Trixie for the evening. Of course, both of them still had plenty of time to write something on the grocery list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Twilight was getting the last of the items, such as toiletries, a thought hit her as she saw Mrs. Cake shopping for groceries again. 'Am I basically Spike and Starlight's mom? Nah, I don't do every mom oriented thing. I mean I just go grocery shopping, set up dinner, advice them on when to go to bed, keep them scheduled most of the time, comfort them when they're feeling.. bad...' Twilight took a moment to do the breathing exercise Cadence taught her a while back. 'It's okay Twilight, you choose to do this stuff. I'm sure they wouldn't mind helping out if I asked.' Twilight paused. 'Wait that's exactly what my mom did..\" Twilight sighed, feeling as if her friendship duties had for the longest time made her essentially a mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was down in the dumps, something hit the corner of her eye, she stopped, causing the groceries in her grocery saddle to clatter a little. She saw a sign talking about a new brand of bath soap. On the cover it read that it wasn't just soap, but a softener as well, making a ponies coat quote \"as soft as a foals.\" The only negative was that on the back it said in tiny print that \"Do not heat water with any of the following spells when using it' and provided a list of perhaps six spells. It was hard to make out, but Twilight wanted to try something new. This could make her feel less old (even though her problem had more to do with her responsibilities, not her coat.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWit that item, there was nothing more she needed and she proceeded to check out. The lines were surprisingly empty for a sunday afternoon. Perhaps, ponies were just out and about. The weather was great after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pony proceeded through her items with a fast pace, putting everything in shopping bags with a levitation spell. The total was roughly fifty bits, a little bit more than normal. The new bath soap costed a little bit more than normal. Twilight thanked the individual colt and proceeded home, which was not far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked through rather crowded streets, staying focused on her castle just a ways a way. Within roughly 8 minutes she got the big shiny door, opening and closing it. \"Spike! Starlight I'm home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one called back. \"Oh dear, Starlight's not back yet? I hope she can make it for dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight efficiently started putting things away. Roughly 30 minutes later, everything was set and she went to the kitchen to set up some hay burgers. She knew how her friends/children liked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was done with that, she set up the table. The time was roughly 7:00 at this point. \"Gee, should I call Spike down? I thought Starlight would be here by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SPIKE! DINNER IS READY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike was a little annoyed \"I'LL BE DOWN LATER! I'M AT A GREAT PART RIGHT NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight motherly rolled her eyes. \"K! PLEASE COME DOWN AT SOME POINT THOUGH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike didn't hear her and so Twilight just figured he'd do so anyway. She then went to the living room and picked up one of the books she got that day on the history of YakYakistan. She wanted to read up on Equestria's new allies as a gesture of kindness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours went by where she was immersed in the books pages, only to be taken out of it by the sound of the front door opening and closing. \"I'm home!\" Starlight yelled \"Anypony still awake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight quickly folded her current page and rushed to the door, calling \"Yes! One sec!\" In seconds Twilight was up at the front with eager questions \"So, how was your evening? Wanna talk it over with dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight looked at Twilight confused \"Dinner? Um, Twilight it's 10:05, I had dinner out tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, sorry about that. I was a little immersed in my book.\" Twilight blushed. \"Well, I'll go ahead put the hay burgers away and then we can talk, how's that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight smiled with exhaustion. \"Thanks Twilight, but can we hold off until tomorrow. I'm pretty tired. I was thinking about just taking a nice bath or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked a little saddened, but tried to keep her cool. \"Oh, well, that sounds okay. I bought some new soap by the way, it's also coat softener. Try it out and tell me what you think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight perked up \"Oo, good thinking, Twilight. I could use something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight smiled \"Glad you liked it. I know you're more into spa treatments than I am though, so don't use all of it. I'll probably stay up a bit longer. Reading this great book.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight smirked \"What's this one on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YakYakistan history!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight chuckled \"Of course, well we can talk about that tomorrow too. Night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Night!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Starlight went to the bathroom, Twilight checked in on Spike to find the little dragon fast asleep with comics spread out on his bed. Twilight smiled. \"I keep telling him not to read comics on his bed. Oh well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight did the usual, laying out a towel for later and turning on the water on hot. She went to the bathroom as it was getting ready. \"Ahh, tonight was a good night..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWent she was finished, the bath water was up to a moderate level, but it was annoyingly cold. \"Augh, not this again..\" Twilight then charged up her horn and used a heat spell on the water. She then saw the bath soap Twilight was mentioning on the side in it's bright pink bottle and squirted a little bit into the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water quickly acquired a pinkish hue and Starlight calmly sank in. \"Ooo.. this is nice. Twilight has good taste...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Starlight sank into a calm laying position, with her head resting on a warm towel to the right end. Thoughts passed through her head at slow pace, as the subtle age regression started taking effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight didn't notice, but her height was gradually slipping away along with any sign of age on her face. Her thoughts drifted back and forth between her couple friends, wondering what would come in the future. As these thoughts passed through her head 5 minutes in, she was recognizably a filly, same as the CMC. Her head and the towel slid further down, causing the water to completely cover her chin. At around this time new thoughts passed through of anxiety and whether she'd be able to find any new friends. Sweat and visible signs of fear were apparent on her face. After another two and half minutes of these thoughts, she was considerably smaller than the CMC, roughly a toddler. Head and towel drifted even further into the water, sinking down until her nose was just above the water. In the pinkish water one could see a closed smile on her face. Her thoughts had changed a second time, now focusing on how fun, nice, and great all of her friends. Within thirty seconds, her nose sunk into the water, causing her to squirm from lack of breath. She then opened her eyes and gasped at the top. She was just barely able to touch the bottom of the tub on her hind legs. Her thoughts then brought on an enormous well of anxiety as to whether her friends really liked her. For some reason, she couldn't stop thinking about her friends. As she lost more and more height, she couldn't touch the bottom anymore and started struggling to not drown. \"Ahhhh! halp *pant* Somepone halp me! *pant*\" Her voice was high pitched and was riddled with a baby accent. Twilight could faintly hear something and got up from her chair to check, walking at a moderate pace down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Starlight struggled to get composure, she regressed down to a one year old foal and her thoughts drifted to an anxiety that she had no friends. From struggling to drown and those depressing thoughts, she yelled at the top of her lungs \"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was just seeing the bathroom door down the hall as she heard wails from an infant. She didn't know what it was, but for some reason panic set in. She ran as fast as she could to the door, opening it briskly to see her student in pink water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STARLIGHT!\" Twilight quickly levitated her out of the water to find that her student was nothing more than a 1 year old. \"STARLIGHT!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's yell woke up Starlight from her drowned induced coma. She faintly opened her eyes to see an enormous Twilight. She nervously looked down at her body only to see a chubby body of a foal. Tears quickly came out of her eye sockets and she started wailing at the top of her lungs. Fortunately for Spike, his bathroom was far down the hall and couldn't hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight quickly levitated a towel and dried her baby student/child, shushing her calmly \"Shh shhh.. it's okay Starlight. I'm here.\" Starlight briefly got a grip only to start wailing yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later, she was dry, Twilight wrapped her in the towel and started cradling her. \"It's okay Starlight. I'm here.\" Starlight got a grip again and prevented from wailing again, but she still had tears in her eyes and was noticably frightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a high pitched scared baby voice, she asked \"Wha-wha ha-pen ta me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight took a deep breath. \"I don't know why, but you turned into a baby.\" This illicited more tears. \"It's okay, it's okay Starlight. Remember, I'm here. I won't let anything bad happen to you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat calmed her down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight cradled her some more. \"There, there..\" and then something caught the corner of her eye, it was the new soap. Instantly, a flashback hit her about the warning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I think I know what happened.\"</span></div></div>",

You won't be staying like this forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, Twilight didn't know how to calm her feelings. The only tool she could think to use was soothing words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then went to a linen closet, bullet out a soft white silk cloth and then a bobby pin. Following afterward, she laid the little on the bathroom mat and methodically folded the cloth straps over, tightening them with the bobby pin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight giggled at how adorable Starlight was and, perhaps without putting too much thought into it, showed Starlight to the bathroom mirror. \"What do you think Starlight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight stared with silent curiosity at her image. Her mane was still styled the same, her eyes were beady with a purplish color. The makeshift diaper actually looked pretty cute. A faint smile formed on the edge of her lips. \"Tanks Twi-wite..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight motherly smiled and tried to stay more considerate \"Would you like to sleep with me tonight though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight gave a befuddled facial expression followed by small acceptance. \"Me gess dat fa da bess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Starlight, we'll resolve this.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The morning saw Twilight waking up first. The alicorn smiled down at the sleeping Starlight who was sucking on her hoof as she slept. Twilight resisted the urge to squeal at the cute scene. Come on Starlight time to wake up. Twilight said gently shaking her friend. Starlight woke with an adorable yawn and smiled up at Twilight, before realizing her hoof was in her mouth and quickly removing it blushing madly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight giggled. Good morning little Star. The alicorn cooed nuzzling Starlight. Mouwing mommy. Starlight said happily. Twilight resisted the urge to sigh in relief. Apparently Starlight had recovered from her breakdown last night. Then Twilight remembered her experience\u2019s babysitting the Cake Twins and her own niece and frowned. Starlight. Are you\u2026.wet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorns\u2019 eyes widened but after a moment she sighed and shook her head. No mommy. Me no wet. Twilight sighed as well. Do you need to go potty? Starlight again shook her head no. Twilight frowned wondering if she should press the issue or not. It was decided for her when Spike yelled. Come on Twilight breakfast is ready!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk Starlight here\u2019s the plan. Twilight said getting out of bed and levitating Starlight onto her back. We are going to have a nice breakfast and then mommy is going to look for a cure. Starlight frowned. Can\u2019t we wook now? Twilight shook her head. A good breakfast well help us all. I Pinkie Promises I will clear my schedule and look into making you a big pony again as soon as we have eaten. Ok? Twilight made the motions sealing her fate. Me guess. Starlight said morosely. She wanted to be big soon. Besides, you can handle being mommies cute foal for another few hours right? Twilight asked bringing Starlight around to tickle her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHa hahaha! Mommy stup! Twilight smiled but found herself worried. She had noticed how easily she had slipped into the role of \u201cmother.\u201d A part of her was starting to like it. Starlight was also enjoying the attention and found it so easy to call the alicorn \u201cmommy\u201d and a traterous part of her mind was asking if she really wanted to grow up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twos antics were brought to a halt when they saw Spike. The drake had a wide eyes look. Twilight? Why does that foal look like Starlight? The alicorn didn\u2019t answer right away. Instead she magiced up a high chair for Starlight, strapped the foal in, tided a bib around her neck and placed a pancake in front of her. Now can you feed yourself? Starlight rolled her eyes. Tes mommy. She said slightly annoyed. She wasn\u2019t that helpless. Ok little star. You eat and I\u2019m going to talk with Spike. Starlight nodded and then remembered that foals didn\u2019t have good control of their magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight gave a brief rundown of what happened, the soap regressing Starlight and acting like her mother to keep her calm. So after breakfast I\u2019m going to examine the soap and find out why it regressed her. Twilight finished. Spike was still for a few moments before shrugging. Ok. Twilight blinked. Ok? She parroted. Yeah! Ok. Spike said filling up his plate with gem pancakes. Your, taking this well Spike. Twilight commented earning a shrug. I mean this isn\u2019t world ending, and you know what happened. Starlight is calm and with your super awesome alicorn magic I bet you can have her back to normal by tonight. So why worry. Twilight blushed at the praise but hugged the drake. Thanks Spike. No problem Twilight. The moment was interrupted by a crash and the pair turned to find a sheepishly grinning Starlight covered in pancake bits and syrup with her plate on the floor. Apparently Starlight had given up on her magic and had tried to use her hooves. Twilight sighed. Ok. New plan. Breakfast, then a bath, and then research.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought suddenly struck Twilight. If she was researching then she wouldn\u2019t be watching Starlight? Twilight was not going to leave the regressed unicorn alone in case she had another breakdown. She supposed she could ask Spike, but the drake had little experience foalsitting. He was responsible though and could play \u201cbig brother\u201d for a day. Also Starlight would be comfortable near him. She could also ask one of her friends. At the very least Pinkie would be bouncing off the walls at the thought of another playmate for the twins. But how would Starlight react? She was worried about how all her friends would react if they found out she was a foal and she might not have gotten over that fear. However a part of Twilight balked at the very idea of being separated from her \u201clittle star\u201d for any length of time. She could watch Starlight but then she wouldn\u2019t be able to devote herself entirely to finding a cure meaning Starlight could be stuck like this for a while. A part of Twilight wondered if that would be a bad thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight bit her lip wondering what to do.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She quickly levitated Starlight so that she was hoovering near her and asked. \"Good girl! Now, Starlight, what do you think about having Spike give you a bath?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike immediately objected \"WHAT?! I DIDN'-\" Twilight cut him off with her hoof to his mouth, whispering in his ear \"You'll get every day off for the next week if you agree to this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Spike smirked and whispered back \"allow me seven days to move around as I please and we have a deal.\" Twilight sighed and nodded. This was all hypothetical though and Starlight might not have agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight's response was one of quiet gradual concern, with her facial expression showing slight concern that only mounted as she saw Twilight and Spike whispering about her. About a minute after Twilight's response, Starlight was closing her eyes tight with gradual tears flowing out. \"No mommy! Pwease! No!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was again surprised by Starlight's rather massive emotional expression. Against her better judgement, Twilight then cradled Starlight in hooves to sooth her, ignoring the syrup over her. \"There, there, Star, I won't make you do anything you don't want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike gave Twilight a grin and Twilight gave an even meaner grin back, causing Spike to drop it. Starlight peaked behind her hooves, still in a fearful pose \"We-weawy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes really Starlight. I'm for all intensive purposes your mommy. I don't want you to be sad. I <i>love</i> you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight then wiped away her own tears with a couple sniffles. \"Ta-tanks mommy. Me <i>wub</i> you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight then poked the little one's nose. \"How about we get you cleaned up then my wittle bundle of love?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight smiled back. \"Gud id-ea mommy!\" Starlight still wanted to be a mare, but it didn't seem that way from the outside. In fact, her behavior maybe suggested that she wanted to <i>stay</i> this way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill this be reflected more during bath time?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Ok, this one is for the bronies out there or anyone else into the new My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic show. I noticed others have done stuff like voring &amp; weight gain, but nothing related to transformation. I mean, come on, imagine how much we could do with this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasically saying, this involves any of the MLP:FiM cast playing around with or getting exposed to transformation magic. It can expand to more elaborate storylines if you want, but transformation is the main priority with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTransformations:<br>\r\nAge (AR/AP)<br>\r\nTG<br>\r\nAnimal TF<br>\r\nSize (Shrink/ Grow)<br>\r\nAppearance<br>\r\nInanimate<br>\r\nExpansion<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot of other transformations can be used, but there are a few rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo killing off characters. (This is NOT gonna be another \"Cupcakes\".)<br>\r\nNo sex or vore (Mild shipping is okay, but don't let that be the focus)<br>\r\nPut effort in describing what's going on, unless you're giving more options. I want for you to be able to describe events like an actual story!<br>\r\nKeep to the rating, people! It has to be E or 13+. Nothing above that! I expect most of the content to be E, but you can go to 13+ levels if you so desire. <br>\r\nI hope you don't mind, but I'll be editing some chapters. Nothing major, mainly formatting, spelling and grammar and that stuff to make it a little easier to read. Oh, and if anything is major, it's because something that is written just feels incorrect and doesn't make much sense to me. Remember, <b>READABILITY IS KEY.</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, anything goes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDIT: My gosh, this has become bigger than I expected it would. However, to all those adding to this story, I have one thing to say: <b>USE PROPER GRAMMAR, SPELLING, AND PUNCTUATION!</b> Seriously, I expect these to be readable, and I don't want to have to edit through ALL of these chapters. I can't stress that enough, people.</td>",
