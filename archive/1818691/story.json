My name is <b>Alan Davies</b> and I attend <b>Dograb College</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince you're reading this interactive story, I take it that you're interested in learning about the strange events that frequently take place in the little island town of <b>Dograb</b>. But first, I would like to tell you a little about myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've lived in Dograb for my entire life. My dad, <b>Robert Davies</b>, worked as a construction worker, while my mother, <b>Anne Davies</b>, stayed at home all day. I was a single child, but I did have relatives living outside the town. At the age of eighteen, I was currently in my second year in college, where I studied various subjects including <i>English</i>, <i>Drama studies </i> and <i>Media studies</i>. I was an average student, I wasn't perfect but at least I was doing well in my classes. I had fair hair, blue eyes and an average build. I had a girlfriend, <b>Rebecca </b> who, unlike me, did not attend college, but instead worked in a local restaurant as a waitress. She was the same age as me, she had long black hair and brown eyes. Sure, she was a bit on the <i>Gothic</i> side, and she was a little bit overweight, almost the same weight as myself, but she was beautiful to me nonetheless, at least for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, I was pretty much your average student at Dograb college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand however, nothing was average at Dograb college. What would appear strange to you would be an average day in the island town of Dograb. Even the UK government denied the existence of the town, and with good reason. Many strange and mysterious things happened here, particularly to the college students, and I was no exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut since this is an interactive story, I guess it's entirely up to you which of these stories you would like to follow. The residents of Dograb have endured many transformations, both positive and negative, but mostly end in humiliation. I don't know what you'd prefer, but I guarantee you that there's something for everyone here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what type of story interests you the most?</span></div></div>",

In most of them however, I was one of the unfortunate few to endure such a drastic change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't even count how many females I've actually swapped bodies with during my time in Dograb college! None of them however did not pass without any form of humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Hayley Watkins</b>, one of the brightest girls in the college, had recently broken up with her boyfriend, <b>Matt Fitzpatrick</b>, and just one week later, he already had another girlfriend. Later she was invited to a three-night long house party, along with some of her closest friends, including myself. She was a bright girl, eighteen years of age, with long, dark blonde hair and dark eyes. She was slightly chunkier than most girls in college, and she was not as outgoing as her closest friend, the very tall and slim <b>Rachael Ellis</b>, but she had a reputation of turning into a party animal after just a few drinks. As predicted, she was drunk during the first night of the party, but then again, so was I. When we both woke up the following morning however, I was horrified to find that we had somehow swapped bodies!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn another occasion, before coming to college, one of my best friends, <b>Jordan Andrews</b>, broke up with a girl named <b>Emily Stone</b>, who left an impression for everyone to remember her by. Living alone since kicking Jordan out of her flat, the psycho ex-girlfriend had sought an opportunity to get him back for dumping her. Even in a new lesbian relationship with <b>Rhian Moon</b>, she was obsessed with revenge. Despite this however, although I hardly saw her since I went to college, I still spoke to her online, she was still friendly to me, and I was still friendly to her. This would soon change however, when one morning I woke up to find myself in her body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Dograb college however, it was not only the students that I had the misfortune to swap bodies with. Our thirty seven year old Drama teacher, <b>Zoe Huffman</b>, was of no exception. With brunette hair and hazel eyes, despite her age, she was very beautiful and attractive, looking more like a twenty year old tart! One of her best features were her ridiculously wide hips and thick thighs. She was single, but she lived with her eight year old son, <b>Jack Doyle</b>. Despite her childish, hyperactive behaviour, almost the entire college fancied her, but I was one of the few who did not. One day however, during the final lesson of the week, something occurred, causing me to swap bodies with my hot, crazy teacher!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt may be small and very public, but during the Summer, <b>Dograb Beach</b> was always a pleasant spot to visit, hosting various events including live performances and swimsuit competitions. On this particular occasion however, I was the victim of a far more humiliating turn of events. One day at the beach with my girlfriend, Rebecca, I dosed off, but when I woke up, I found myself trapped in the body of a five year old girl named, <b>Katie Andrews</b>, somewhere on the beach. To make matters worse, I quickly found out that I was trapped in the body of the youngest sister of two of my best friends, Jordan and <b>Jessica Andrews</b>. I needed to find my old body as quickly as possible, before my true identity was discovered by either Jessica, Jordan or his girlfriend, Kelly Walcott. But how was I able to avoid their detection long enough to search?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's it for now, but don't worry, there's plenty more where they came from!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what's it going to be?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a long night, but fun nonetheless. <b>Samuel Rivers</b> was throwing a three night long house warming party to celebrate moving into his own home, and I was one of the first to be invited to the party. And by the time the party began, Samuel was hosting over thirty guests, including myself, <b>Rachael Ellis</b>, <b>Sarah Gibbs</b>, <b>Jordan Andrews</b> and even my girlfriend, Rebecca Keane. The first night of the party was the most fun that I've ever had, and it was also a showing of things to come for the rest of the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarly in the night however, Rebecca had to leave, stating that she had to be at work in the morning and that she would not come back to the party until the following afternoon. And so after giving me a kiss goodnight, she left the house, leaving me to continue drinking and having fun at the party. The term <i>\"When the cat's away, the mice can play\"</i> could not be more accurate, because as I drunk more and more, I started to feel a connection with a girl from my English class, <b>Hayley Watkins</b>, but because I was so drunk I couldn't tell whether she felt the same way about me or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever this was later confirmed after a discussion with my mates. \"Dude,\" Jordan explained to me, \"Hayley is so flirting with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" <b>Matthew Miles</b> exclaimed, \"You should ask her out! She's a total hottie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't do that,\" I said, \"I've already got a girlfriend! If she found me with her, she'd kill me! And besides, Hayley just got dumped didn't she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, that's right, Hayley was dumped only a week ago, and the worse thing was that just a couple of days later her ex-boyfriend had already got another girlfriend! The poor girl must be heart broken!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought then came to my mind. \"That's most probably why she's here. Trying to drink her problems away. Could you imagine what it would be like if her ex-boyfriend was at this party?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Jordan said, \"Lucky Sam didn't send him an invitation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I still think that you should go for her,\" Matt continued, \"I mean you've been closer to her tonight than you've been with Rebecca! You both really like each other. I can tell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI considered Matt's suggestion for a brief moment, only to make a decision. \"Maybe. Let's have a few more drinks and let fate take its course.\" And with that said, we all gulped down another can of beer, and indeed Hayley and I drew ever closer the more drinks we had. Late at night we even found ourselves cuddling with each other on the sofa!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater into the night everyone at the party fell asleep. It had been a long and fun night for everyone, particularly for Hayley and myself. However what we both did not expect was that the night was over, but the party was just about to begin, as we were about to find out in the following morning.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I was the first at the party to wake up the following morning with a throbbing headache. However as I woke up I felt noticeably different. It felt as a lot of my weight had been lost, or more specifically shifted to different parts of my body overnight. Confused by this, I picked my head up and, without thinking, brushed away the long, dark blonde hair from my face. However as I sat in a vertical position, I was slightly rocked by a heavy thrust from my chest. I looked down to see something that horrified me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not my body. What should have been a black t-shirt, socks and a pair of jeans had been replaced by a silk-laced strap floral mini dress and a pair of broken high-heels. But it was far more shocking what was underneath the dress. I peeked under the dress to see a pair of large breasts being pressed by a pink bra. I put my hand over my left breast and I gently squeezed it, realizing that they were indeed real and strangely familiar. With increasing alarm, I climbed back to my feet, only to fall back down from the lack of balance that I had with this new body. I tried to get back up, succeeding the second time around, only to realize how short I had become. Suddenly I felt a cool breeze between my legs. I looked down again, with my view slightly obstructed by my breasts, and pulled my dress over my new wide hips to find a pair of pink panties. I rubbed against it with my finger, only to realize that the most manliest part of my old body was now gone. Now panicking, I tried my best to tug my dress back over my panties, only to discover that it only covered the panties and nothing else more, being unable to cover anything below the top of my new thighs. Dreading that this was not my body, I looked around the house, silently trying not to wake anybody else up, and noticed a mirror hanging on the wall in the bathroom. And so without hesitation I entered the bathroom and closed the door behind me. I looked into the mirror, only to drop my jaw in horror at the reflection of Hayley Watkins staring back at me. At that point, I realized that I was no longer in my body, and somehow, someway, I was now in the body of Hayley Watkins!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was gobsmacked. I simply stood at the reflection, assuring myself that this was merely a dream, or some sort of hallucination from the amount that I drunk the night before. I still felt a little tipsy, although there was a doubt in the back of my mind telling me that this was no illusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I came to a realization. If I was now in the body of Hayley Watkins, maybe Hayley Watkins was now in my own body! I knew that she had to be somewhere in the house, in my old body, and I was sure that she would react the same as me. But maybe if I woke her up before anyone else, we could try and remember what happened last night between us, before anyone could find out about this transformation.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Silently I crept out of the bathroom and investigated the house. Every movement that I made was uncomfortable. Every time I lifted my leg to walk I felt my dress would lift higher. It was too cold to be sneaking around in such little clothing. I didn't even have any shoes on my feet, I had to walk bare foot on the cold floor. This was not to mention the unbearable weight on my chest swinging and jiggling upon every movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI crept into the living room, where I saw my old body sleeping on the sofa. I slowly moved towards it and tapped it on the shoulder in an attempt to wake it up. I shook it slightly and whispered in its ear. \"Wake up,\" I whispered, cringing at the sound of my new feminine voice, until finally I noticed the eyes beginning to open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hayley?\" I asked as my old body began to move, \"Hayley, is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, my old body answered me in a deep voice. \"Yeah. Why? What?\" The eyes widened as they glared upon me. Hayley then jumped to a vertical base, realizing that she was now in my old body. I could only imagine what she was thinking at that very moment. She looked down at her new body, rubbing her flat chest in disbelief. She then turned and faced you. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" I replied, still uncomfortable with my new voice, \"But somehow, overnight, we must have swapped bodies!\"</span></div></div>",

I stepped back and watched in horror as she unzipped the jeans and stretched them open to peek at my bits. I cringed as I noticed a smile develop on her new face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRetaining her focus on me, Hayley spoke. \"Wow, this is great!\" I was gobsmacked at this remark, which followed a loud burp. I could tell that she was still drunk from the night before, but still I could not believe what I was hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly lost balance and stumbled forwards, trying to balance herself with my shoulder. I was slightly stunned by the amount of weight placed on my new shoulders. I developed a look of disgust on my face. \"Hayley, listen to me,\" I said, cringing at the sound of Hayley's feminine voice come from my lips. \"This is serious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley hiccuped and replied as she slowly advanced closer to me with an overwhelming presence. \"I know,\" she said as she attempted to comfort me, \"But this could be fun.\" The breath of my old body was overwhelming, but so was Hayley's size as she suddenly wrapped her thick arms around me and embraced me in a somewhat comforting hug in an attempt to calm me down. Although I was slightly relaxed in the arms of my old body, with my busty chest pressing against my old flat chest, feeling a tingling sensation in my new nipples, I was still distraught by the current situation. I was still unable to grasp the reality of what had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hayley, I really don't like this,\" I cried, disturbed by the tone that my feminine voice had taken, as if I was starting to plead to her, \"I don't want to be you! This is too awkward!\" It seemed like the more Hayley embraced me, the more girl-like I was becoming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Hayley asked as she started to release her grip of me, no longer pressing her flat chest against my breasts, \"I like being you. Why don't you like being me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did not want to upset her, especially while she possessed my old body. In my body, she was taller, heavier, stronger and quicker than me. If I somehow made her upset, Hayley would have no problem exposing our secret to everyone at the party. I briefly considered what to say to her. \"Because...because I don't...like being a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley laughed to herself. \"Don't be silly Al, you'll get used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Hayley released me from her grip, slightly rocking me off my balance, and smiled at the obvious expression upon my face.</span></div></div>",

It was awkward looking at my old body in such a peculiar manner. I also noticed the facial expressions that she was making. I could tell what she had in mind and what she intended to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on babe,\" Hayley said seductively, \"Let's have a little fun like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was disgusted by her behaviour. \"What?\" I gasped, \"You can't be serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm serious,\" Hayley replied as she approached me. Her body language was clear. I became paranoid as she raised her arms in an attempt to embrace me once again. \"While everyone is asleep, let's have a little...experiment.\" I noticed a bottle of beer in her left hand. She took a long swig of the bottle as I stepped back, pressing my back against the wall like a cornered animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to avoid her advances. \"No way! I mean...not like this! I mean...what about Rebecca?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about her baby. She's not around. What she doesn't know can't hurt her, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Hayley! Not like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? Live a little, honey!\" At this point, I felt helpless with Hayley's muscular arms wrapped around my waist, pressing my waist towards her own. Her chest started to press against my breasts as I pressed my hands against her huge shoulders, poorly trying to free myself. Our faces were now a few inches away from each other. I could smell the breath of my old body. Helplessly I looked into the crystal blue eyes of my old body. It was as if Hayley was caught in a trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew what Hayley had on her mind, but I did not know how to react. It was very strange being in the body of a female, and it was wrong having this kind of attention from a male, especially when that male was my old body, despite how flattering it was. My girlfriend may not be as attractive as Hayley, and I would not have minded if she and I got together some day, but I couldn't risk being caught by my girlfriend like this. Hayley was out of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hayley anticipated my reaction, admiring me pleasantly in her arms, I could feel her grip tighten, pressing our bodies ever closer.</span></div></div>",

After several seconds we released our lips, slowly opened our eyes and looked at each other, showing great desire in each other's eyes. At that moment I realized how amazing this would be. So after a brief silence of staring into each other's eyes passionately, she handed me her bottle of beer as she headed towards the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing the entire bottle in a single gulp, I placed the bottle aside and followed Hayley into the bathroom, locking the door behind us. Without noticing our surroundings, Hayley rushed towards me and kissed me again. The hands of my old body rubbed all around my new body. I never realized how soft my old hands were, not to mention how vigorous and natural it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe continued to snog until Hayley backed away and sat on the toilet seat. Instinctively I removed the straps of my dress from my soft shoulders and wiggled my body as the mini dress slipped down to my ankles, revealing a tight pink bra and panties. I felt a cool breeze fly through my smooth, exposed skin, but I did not notice, I was in the heat of the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow in my underwear, I dropped to my knees in a suggestive position in front of Hayley's open legs. I noticed Hayley removing her shirt without any hesitation. A smile developed on my face. At this point, I knew that there was no going back. I may end up having regrets about what I was going to do, but at this point, I really did not care, and neither did Hayley, who started to unzip her jeans, revealing a pair of black boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling as if there was nothing to lose, Hayley and I began secretly making sweet, passionate love in the bathroom. It was the most anticipated and satisfying moment in my life, as strange as it sounds, considering that our roles had been reversed.</span></div></div>",

Even smashed, we both realized what would happen if our passionate intimacy was exposed, especially if both Rebecca Keane and Matt Fitzpatrick found out about our affair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a second knock on the door. At that point, we both returned to a dignified stance. I maintained my composure, and so did Hayley. As she pulled up and zipped her jeans back in place, I struggled to slip back into my mini dress, struggling to figure out how to pull the straps over my shoulders without undoing my pink bra. Before any of us could answer the door however, one of us had to hide from sight. Hayley volunteered as she sneaked behind the shower curtains and crouched in the corner of the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly I crept the door open. I peeked my head out and looked into the face of the person who had been knocking on the bathroom door.</span></div></div>",

Behind the door was the insensitive, aggressive asshole who broke up with Hayley Watkins, whose body I currently possessed. I answered the door, with Hayley's body, and looked into his eyes, dreading the dispute that I was about to face. To make matters worse, my old body, currently possessed by the real Hayley Watkins, was hiding in the shower. If Matthew found her in the shower there was no telling what he would do. After all, there were rumors that Matthew punched one of his old girlfriends in the face. I was absolutely terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo my surprise however, he was not angry. Instead, he whispered through the door. \"Hayley,\" he whispered, \"I'm sorry. I've been a jerk. I want you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" That was all I could say. This massive tool broke up with Hayley, and within one week, he had himself a new girlfriend. He broke Hayley's heart. And now, there he was, pleading for Hayley to come back to him. I had no idea how the real Hayley would respond, but if I were her, which I currently was, I would refuse his offer and slam the door into his nose. I was tempted to do so, if Matthew was not so big and tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Hayley,\" Matthew continued, silently trying to sneak the door even further, \"I want you back in my life. I want to feel your soft, smooth body once again!\" He started to sound desperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were starting to take a turn for the worse.</span></div></div>",

I did something that I never thought that I'd ever have to do in my life, but at this point, there was very little else I could possibly do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI screamed. Unfortunately however, it was a weak scream, I would be lucky to wake anyone with such a feeble squeal. Until that moment, I had never felt the need to scream in my life.

Trying my best not to wake anyone else up, I caught up to Hayley, who was trying to put my shoes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hayley,\" I whispered, clearly disgusted at her behaviour, \"You can't be serious.

Noticing this, I had no choice but to run towards the door before it could shut, leaving me stuck in the flat, unable to open the door without help. This was the last thing that I wanted, so I dashed to the door, slightly tumbling from the lack of balance that I now possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the door could shut, I managed to squeeze past, my breasts harshly scraping the frame, just before the door slammed shut, but as I attempted to step forward however, something was pulling me back. I turned around, only to notice something terrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned around and saw that the mini dress that I was wearing was caught in the heavy door! Although I managed to squeeze past the door, unfortunately my dress did not do the same. I tried to pull it, but it was stuck tight. I couldn't even arrange myself to pull the massive door open, and even if I could, considering my current stature, it would hardly make any difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow humiliating.

As I desperately tried to pull myself free, I looked out to the street, noticing Hayley strutting across the pavement, without a care in the world. She turned around and noticed me stuck in the door, unable to move, and I could hear her laugh hysterically. I was furious.

I simply folded my arms and went into a pout, much to her enjoyment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Alan,\" she said in an attempt to comfort me, \"Need a little help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could tell from the tone of her voice that she was being sarcastic. I did not reply, but I was desperate for some help, and I was far more willing for Hayley to help me than someone else who was yet to discover our body swap. Unfortunately for me however, Hayley had a slightly different idea to free me than I did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was horrified when I felt Hayley tightly grip my arm with his cold hands. \"What are you doing?\" I screeched, but despite my refusal, Hayley continued to pull my arm in an attempt to free me. From the moment she grabbed my arm, I knew that, considering the weak fabric of the mini dress, this was going to end in catastrophe, but at that point, there was no reasoning with Hayley. She was determined to free me this way, instead of simply opening the door for me. She continued to pull until, finally, the inevitable happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hayley pulled me from the door, the mini dress ripped from me, revealing a pink bra and a pair of frilly panties. There was a sudden chilling breeze as I realized what Hayley had done to me. There I stood, wearing nothing more than a pair of underwear, out in the open, with Hayley looking down at me with a big grin on her face. Almost instinctively, I threw my hands over my body, in a feeble attempt to cover myself. Thanks to Hayley, things had officially got worse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho could blame me for panicking? I was just stripped down to my underwear, ripping my mini dress into pieces, and now there I was, locked outside a flat full of my peers. I was so embarrassed that I could cry, and I did. Tears trickled down my cheeks as I was embraced by a pair of thick arms. As Hayley hugged my tightly, in an attempt to comfort me while trying to hide her laughter, all I could do was cry.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My objective was now clear. I had to find Hayley, who was fast asleep somewhere in the house in my old body, before I could be spotted by anyone else in Hayley's body. So with this goal in mind, I tried my best to sneak out of the bathroom, opening the door just enough for me to squeeze out of the room. I felt my breasts rub against the wood of the door, a disturbingly arousing feeling. However as I crept down the corridor, hoping that nobody else had woken up yet, I jumped in fright as I felt a hand grab my left shoulder. I turned around to see Rachael Ellis, who was a close friend of Hayley's. I was both horrified, because I had just been spotted, and intimidated by the size difference between her and myself. Rachael was just about five foot and ten inches tall, and while I would have looked down at Rachael in my old body, it was terrifying to be looking up to her face from this five foot and six inch perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter Hayley,\" Rachael chuckles quietly, trying not to wake anybody else up, \"Did I scare you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first I thought that she was addressing Hayley Watkins, but then I realized that she was in fact speaking to me, believing that I was her close friend. And so, unwilling to blow my cover, I replied to her. \"No,\" I said, disturbed by the sound of Hayley's voice coming out of my mouth, \"You just caught me off guard, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right,\" Rachael laughed, before looking down at my chest, \"Is it cold here? Or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, I followed her line of sight and looked down at my chest, noticing that my nipples were hard and erect. Embarrassed, I quickly and, almost instinctively, wrapped my arm around my breasts, still aroused by the odd sensation, to cover my hardened nipples from sight, much to the delight of the tall girl staring down at me. As she continued to giggle, all I could do was blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of my silly position, Rachael continued speaking to who she presumed to be her closest friend. \"How come you're up so early though Hun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to think of a reason and quickly. \"I was just...\" I struggled to answer, \"I just...I just had to go...to the bathroom.\" I slightly cringed at the thought of having to go to the bathroom like this, although it was also surprisingly arousing at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael, now rolling her eyes away from my chest, smiled at me. \"Well, I was just wondering. I was about to pop out for a bit and I was wondering if you wanted to tag along me. We'd be back by the afternoon. Fancy coming with me then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was caught in a tough predicament. I was being offered the chance to spend the day with Rachael Ellis, one of the hottest girls in Dograb college. I knew that the real Hayley would have been comfortable with hanging around with her all by herself, but it would be very awkward trying to impersonate someone's close friend. It would also put my secret in jeopardy. What if Rachael found out that I was not actually Hayley?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that I had to give Rachael and answer, I thought about it briefly, trying my best to ignore the tingling sensation of my hardened nipples against my smooth arm, until I came out with an answer.</span></div></div>",

I may have swapped bodies, but that was no excuse to go out in nothing but pajamas, even if they weren't mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down upon my new body and I gulped nervously. I knew that it was going to feel really uncomfortable changing like this. I peeked down my top and saw the breasts dangling down my chest. I tried to undo the buttons of the top, but the more I did so, the more my breasts felt released. I could even feel my nipples growing erect as I did so, a tingling sensation that I found disturbingly arousing. Finally I took the top off and dropped it on the bed, and there I stood, feeling a cool breeze slightly tickle my new breasts. It felt so uncomfortable, and yet it felt so good at the same time. I clutched at them both one final time before resuming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bent over, slightly falling off-balance by the weight of my breasts, and grabbed my pajama bottoms. After sitting on the bed I pulled the bottoms from beneath me, revealing two smooth legs and a pair of pink frilly knickers. Wriggling the bottoms from my feet, I rubbed my hands down my soft thighs. The more I undressed the more aroused I became. This was distracting me from the task at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow wearing nothing but a pair of knickers, I searched through the wardrobe in search of suitable clothes to wear. From the wardrobe I pulled out a pair of jeans, a black t-shirt and a pair of converse shoes. I quickly got into the clothes, but as I went to admire myself in the bedroom mirror I noticed my erect nipples, clearly visible, under the shirt. At that moment I realized that I should have put on a bra. But as I turned to face the bedroom clock I realized that it wouldn't be long until college started, and so there was no time to learn how to put a bra on. With no time to lose, I swiftly rushed out of the bedroom and down the staircase, without noticing the rest of the interior of Emily's home. Nervously I approached the front door, hoping that I wouldn't be spotted, but then I remembered that Emily did not live with her family. This gave me a brief moment of relief before stepping outdoors for the first time in this new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI used the keys from Emily's bedroom to open the front door. I stepped outside and locked the door behind me. As I slipped the keys into my pocket I took the time to scan my surroundings. I did not recognize this part of Dograb. It was just one row of houses along a single street. But as I looked down the street I noticed a bus stop. Maybe I could catch the bus to college. And so without hesitation I jogged down the pavement, disturbed by the constant jiggling of my breasts, until I reached the bus stop.</span></div></div>",

I dug into my jeans pocket and I was fortunate enough to dig out just enough spare change to take me to the college. So I handed the change to the driver, who handed a bus ticket back to me. I stuffed the ticket into my pocket and sat in the closest seat, ignoring the constant stares from the passengers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat uncomfortably in the bus, still discontent with the sudden transformation. All I could do was look down at my chest to see a pair of breasts stuffed in a black shirt. It was difficult to resist shuffling them back into position without becoming more and more aroused, causing my nipples to harden even further. It was bad enough to be stuck in this body, but I quickly began to regret not putting on a bra as more passengers entered the bus, glaring at my chest whenever they had the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith my arm wrapped over my chest in humiliation, the bus arrived at my destination. I quickly scurried off the bus and found myself staring at the building where I may run into Emily Stone, who will be no doubt parading about in my body. I let out a sigh before making my way into the building, trying my best to ignore the students entering and exiting the building in a regular fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the building, I received a few glares from my peers, all of which were curious as to why I have my arm wrapped around my chest.

She was about the same height as me, at least from my new perspective and ridiculously thin and flat, presumably smaller than my current form. Although I remembered seeing her around last year, we never got to talk to each other. From the expression on her face and the sound of her voice, I assumed that she was a nice girl. At this point, I was unaware of her relationship with Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" I quickly thought to myself until I answered her question. \"I just thought that I'd pop in for a bit. I'm sorry, but do I know you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl giggled and replied. \"Don't be silly. It's me, Rhian! What's wrong with you? Don't you recognize me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was in a peculiar position. For some odd reason this girl was highly interested in me. Maybe she was close friends with Emily, or maybe she was just generally friendly. She spoke very quickly, but before I could reply, she interrupted me again.</span></div></div>",

Jordan was screwed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck.\" I cursed as I began to walk through the room. I was becoming agitated. This feeling of helplessness, being weak and pitiful and without anybody around was so frustrated. This was besides the fact that I felt my chest jiggling as I walked around the room. I looked down on my chest as I wanted to tear them off and give them away to someone else. What was the use of being a girl? And then it hit me all of a sudden. It just hit me in the face. I began laughing as I saw the mistake I made. I heard Emily laughing for the first time. I never heard her laughing with Jordan. She should do it more often. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat down on the bed as I realized I should change my thinking. Instead of thinking like a guy I should think like a girl. Not using violence, but using my smarts. What could I do from here to make sure Emily wouldn't hit Jordan? At least for the time being then. There were two possibilities; if I could prevent Jordan from going to college today Emily couldn't meet him. The other possibility would be if I could prevent Emily from going to college to meet Jordan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrossing my legs I thought about it further. One of these possibilities should be enough, but what to go for? Both possibilities would have consequences. I just wasn't sure what those would be.</span></div></div>",

I was in Drama class, rehearsing a romantic scene of a play for my exam. I felt confident with my acting that afternoon, but my partner, <b>Bryony Evans</b>, wasn't feeling too comfortable. Her arms were wrapped around me, she puckered her lips and slowly approached my face. But before any contact was made, she released me and stepped away. \"I can't do this,\" she screamed, \"I can't do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was puzzled by this turn of events, but then our teacher, the attractive thirty seven year old Zoe Huffman, came in between us. She was wearing a red, floral, skimpy mini dress and a pair of high-heels, but nothing much else. \"Wait a minute Bryony,\" she said while the class watched on, \"Let me show you how it's done.\" With this said, Zoe approached me and wrapped her arms around me. I started to sweat as she looked into my eyes seductively. I knew that she was acting, but it was a pleasure nonetheless. Then she puckered her lips. I puckered my lips, and we closely approached each other until our lips connected. It felt awkward kissing the teacher, but at that point, we both closed our eyes and something happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith my eyes closed, I felt dizzy. The kiss was long and passionate, and I heard the rest of the class cheering me on. Finally we released our lip lock, but when I opened my eyes I realized that something terrible had happened. I looked up to see my own face, looking down upon me, with a shocked expression. I realized that my arms were wrapped around what I presumed to be my body. I withdrew my arms, only to look in horror to see that my usual manly arms were now slim and smooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a step back in fright. I lowered my arms down my waist, realizing that they it was much more wider than I remembered. My hands then worked their way up to my chest, only to find two cloth-covered protrusions coming out of my chest. I looked down to see that this was truly not my body. I tilted my head back up to face what used to be my body, who was equally shocked at this event. I presumed that somehow, someway, Zoe and I must have switched bodies!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that the class was awaiting something to happen, I rushed out of the room, struggling to rush in high-heels. Zoe Huffman, who was now stuck in my body, followed me out of the room and slammed the door shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicking, I screamed at Zoe, shuddering at the sound of my new feminine voice. \"What the heck just happened!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe, amazed by her transformation, answered me. \"I don't know. This is really freaky!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how,\" I continued, tugging on the mini dress that rode high above my new thighs, \"But somehow we must have switched bodies!\"</span></div></div>",

Beverly switched the engine off and turned to face me. She noticed me looking in the mirror and said \"Don't worry Zoey, you look fine!\" But at this point, my looks were the least of my worries. We both stepped out of the car and locked it. Beverly then made her way to the front door of the Old Duff bar while I struggled to put Zoe's high-heels back on my feet. Impatiently Beverly yelled at me. \"Come on Zoe!\" But I was going as fast I could, despite being unwilling for a night out in the bar. Finally I had the high-heels, but I continued struggling to move with them on. I cautiously approached the bar where Beverly awaited me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeverly stepped into the bar first. I followed as she held the heavy door open for me. I stepped in and I was shocked at how busy it was.

At that point, Beverly announced that she needed to go to the toilet and left to do so. Everyone else then left the table for their own things, leaving me alone with my thoughts that were rapidly drowned by the loud noises of the crowd.

It was the perfect day to go to the beach with my girlfriend and just unwind and relax. It was one of those few occasions where nothing strange or humiliating would occur to ruin my life. At least I thought it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beach was a bit more crowded than usual. I didn't notice anyone from college roaming amongst the crowds, but to be honest, I couldn't care less. Resting upon a dry towel over the warm sand, wearing a pair of sunglasses over my eyes, laying under the cool shade of the parasol, with my girlfriend cuddling by my side, nothing felt more comfortable. Ignoring the constant racket of the crowd, it wasn't long before I dosed off and fell dead asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up about an hour later to find that nothing was the same as I remembered. Something was odd. Without thinking, I wiped the long blonde hair from my face and pulled a pair of sunglasses from my eyes, noticing that my previous black shades had been replaced by a pair of plastic glasses with pink rims. As I placed the glasses aside, I noticed how short and smooth my arm had become. Looking at both hands in confusion, my eyes followed my arms down until I discovered something that absolutely terrified me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at my unfamiliar body, I was horrified by the sight of a yellow one-piece swimsuit. Inspecting my new body further, I was terrified to find that the most manliest part of my male body was gone. Petrified, I stood up, slightly stumbling from the sudden shift in weight. I looked around, and there was no sign of my girlfriend anywhere. In her place however, I found a girl that I recognized from college. Unfortunately however, from my new point of view, she looked like a giant! When she sat up, I was terrified that, even in a sitting position, she was still even taller than me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive girl was Jessica Andrews, the sixteen year old sister of one of my best friends, Jordan, wearing her own one-piece swimsuit and a pair of matching sunglasses. She removed her sunglasses and looked down at me with concern. \"Katie,\" she said, completely ignorant to my current situation, \"What's the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when it hit me. I noticed my reflection in her sunglasses, horrified by what I saw. Somehow, someway, I had transformed into Katie Andrews, the five year old sister of Jordan and Jessica. Disgusted by this conclusion, I felt a lump in my throat, much to the concern of the looming Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that she anticipated some sort of reply, I looked up to her looming face and, unwilling to hear the sound of my new voice, I simply nodded with an attempted grin. In reply, Jessica smiled back at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was horrible. There I was, trapped in the body of Katie Andrews, somewhere in the beach, in the presence of her older sister, with no idea where my girlfriend could be, and with no knowledge on the fate of the real Katie, who was now somewhere on the beach, parading about in my old body. How could things get any worse?</span></div></div>",

She was even bigger than I could have ever imagined. She bent down and started packing everything up. With everything at hand, she looked down at me again. \"Well,\" she said, \"I think it's about time we found your big brother and got you back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" The shrill, screeching sound of Katie's girly voice ringed out of my mouth, to my disgust. My sudden reaction however, was not enough to gain a reply from the massive woman who, in response, tightly grabbed my wrist and dragged me across the beach. I tried to resist, but it was no use, her grip was far too tight, and her strength was overwhelming. In the end, I gave in, and continued to follow Jessica through the sea of people until we reached the concrete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what's wrong with you today,\" Jessica added as you unwillingly followed her towards Jordan's car, \"But there's no need to behave that way young lady!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, I noticed Jordan Andrews, once one of my best friends, open the back door of his car. There, Jordan bent down and picked me up, as if I were a stuffed doll, and threw me into the back of his car, as Jessica followed behind me. The door was slammed shut. I tried to open the opposite door, but to my disappointment, Jordan had already installed child locks on the car. I was stuck. With a massive Jessica looming over me, there was no chance of escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the front passenger seat, another familiar voice popped out. \"Hello Katie,\" said Kelly Walcott, Jordan's red-haired girlfriend, \"Did you enjoy your day at the beach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Jessica interrupted. \"Sorry Kelly,\" she said, looking down at me with a stern look upon her face, \"But she was starting to play up when I told her that we were leaving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then,\" Kelly's expression suddenly changed, \"Somebody's been a naughty girl, have they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kelly turned back around, Jordan entered the car and started the engine. As the car moved forward, the beach had already disappeared out of sight. At that point, I lost hope. If there was even a glimmer of hope to at least find out what happened to the real Katie in my old body, it had disappeared along with my view of the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was I to do now? There was no way I'd be able to find my old body on my own. I had to find help, and at this point, it seemed that I only had three options. But who could I trust the most? I didn't think that Jessica would even believe me, let alone help me, and neither would Kelly. And Jordan was never really open minded, so it may be difficult trying to convince him too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the car pulled up in front of Jordan and Jessica's house, the back door swung open.</span></div></div>",

And don't forget, I'm not the only one unfortunate enough to find myself in such bizarre scenarios.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDograb college had a lot of pretty and attractive students, but perhaps the hottest of them all had to be the nineteen year old <b>Alexandra Hughes</b>. The sexy brunette had completely tanned skin, and of all the students from college, no one singled out <b>Bethany Singer</b> more than her. Eighteen years old and incredibly overweight, perhaps the biggest girl in the entire town, Bethany dropped out of college last year because of her inability to cope with constant bullying, particularly from Alexandra. Bethany had always been jealous of how attractive and popular she was, and she knew it, however one thing that she was incapable of doing was maintaining a lasting relationship with someone, something that Bethany shared with her lesbian girlfriend, <b>Samantha Fry</b>. Usually whenever Alexandra had intercourse with a guy, she'd move on to the next. Despite Bethany's sexuality, Alexandra always envied her ability to maintain a three year relationship. Regardless of this, Alexandra was also well known in college for having a modeling career for the local fashion magazine. She was never reluctant in delivering the goods. She was a regular in the night club scene and she certainly knew how to party hard. Despite all of this however, Alexandra was always very self conscious about her weight and figure. Only recently she managed to reach her target size, and her worst fear was something happening to ruin her perfect body. She would even be terrified by the mere thought of two women having intercourse with one another! Alexandra and Bethany were nothing like each other, complete opposites, but the resulting body swap shook everything up for both ladies!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Casey Gunn</b> was a long time crush of mine since we both met over four years ago in school. I always had a crush on her, but never mustered the courage to ask her out. She was the girl of my dreams, unknown to my current girlfriend Rebecca Keane, but I always wondered whether she thought the same about me. She had long, blonde hair, blue eyes and a gorgeous figure. She was one of the prettiest girls that you could possibly meet. Despite this however, she was also a waitress in the same restaurant as Rebecca, and since meeting each other, the two had an immediate disliking toward one another that would often take turns for the worse, exchanging names to each other and even turning violent! The hatred between the two was always awkward for me, but it was hard to imagine that Rebecca envied Casey because of her looks, while Casey envied Rebecca for holding a relationship for over six months. One fateful day at the restaurant however, the two somehow swapped bodies with each other, shaking everything up between the two girls!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what's it going to be?</span></div></div>",

I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too honey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBethany and Samantha blew kisses to each other over the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about that I pop over in the morning and we can spend the entire day with each other,\" Samantha said in an effort to comfort her lover, \"Just you and me. I'll make you feel much better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. That will be nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. I have to go now. I'll see you tomorrow. Goodnight babe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight sweetie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBethany hung up the phone and hid it away. After finishing her crisps, she threw the packet in the bin and made her way to bed. As she laid in her bed however, she could hear the voice of Alexandra in her head, but she hardly took any notice, believing it to be just a dream. As she closed her eyes and went to sleep, something happened. She thought that it was all a dream, however she was in for a surprise when she woke up the following morning.</span></div></div>",

She was suddenly awoken by the loud shriek of an alarm clock beside her. \"That's funny,\" she thought to herself, \"I don't remember buying an alarm clock.\" Confused by this, she rolled even further onto her chest, but strangely, her face was sunk into her pillow, something that, because of her bulbous belly, she was unable to do for some time. As she twitched and turned, she finally developed the energy to lift her suddenly thin arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed her hands against the bed, lifting herself up surprisingly easily, peeking her head from the blanket. She looked up and immediately noticed the unfamiliar colour of the bedroom. She then looked down at her body, and she was horrified to find that her chubby torso had disappeared. In shock, she flew up to a seated position, flinging the blanket away. With a clearer view, she realized that somehow, someway, she was fit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter briefly rubbing her soft hand down her curvaceous frame, she leaped out of bed and stood up, slightly off balance by the sudden loss of weight and boost in height. As the sunlight from the window shined upon her new body, she was rather delighted by what she saw. She didn't care how, but she was delighted to be in such a tanned, glamorous form, but then, looking down her delicious booty, she noticed a familiar tattoo on her lower back. At that moment, she panicked and rushed to the nearest mirror, hanging on the bedroom door, and at that point, she was disgusted by what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her disgust, she saw a reflection of Alexandra Hughes in the mirror. Her long, straight brunette hair, her chocolate brown eyes, her tanned skin and her perfect figure, it was a splitting image of Alexandra. She even had the tattoo on her lower back. The sight left a bitter sweet taste in her mouth. Bethany certainly wouldn't have minded suddenly waking up with the perfect figure, but she was horrified that she had to wake up in the body of her worst enemy. She was tempted to ring her girlfriend, Samantha Fry, and tell her what happened to her, but then again, what was the rush?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBethany had suddenly woke up in the body of her worst enemy. There she stood, gazing at her reflection, standing in a pair of sexy underwear, in Alexandra's body. This was the perfect opportunity to totally ruin her enemy's entire life. Her love life, her education, her modeling career, even her perfect figure was there, free for her to totally destroy. She had no idea how she wound up in her body, but she also had no idea how long it would last, or if they would ever swap again. Now was the perfect opportunity to totally demolish her life. But then again, Alexandra could easily do the same to her. If she did anything to Samantha in her body, Bethany would be devastated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what did she decide to do?</span></div></div>",

Confused by this, she rolled even further onto her chest, becoming far more uncomfortable. As she twitched and turned, she finally developed the energy to lift her suddenly massive arms. It felt like wearing a baggy coat oddly enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sunk her hands under her chest in an attempt to make herself more comfy, only to discover that what she thought were two pillows were actually her breasts. In utter confusion, she shifted her hands loose and pressed against the bed, lifting up her surprisingly hefty body upwards, to look down her chest. Underneath she found not only a pair of huge breasts, but a bulging belly, followed by thick thighs. In disgust, she flew up to a seated position, flinging the blanket away. What she found was that somehow, someway, she had become obese!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer worst fears had come true. She then began to panic. \"Where...where am I? Who am I? What am I?\" She slowly climbed to her lead-like feet and stood up to a vertical base, struggling to balance herself, while the hair on her arms and legs stood in fright. As the light shined upon her new body, she had no choice but to look down. She was disgusted by what she saw. A bulging belly, breasts the size of watermelons, floppy arm wings and a hip that just wouldn't quit. She was wearing a pair of red panties that were being engulfed by her butt cheeks and a red bra that was on the verge of snapping. She examined closely, discovering that she had hair in almost every part of her body, and stretch marks coating her bulging flab. She was frozen by the horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horror was too much for Alexandra to take. She stormed out of the bedroom into a completely new environment. She was in a house that she had never been in a completely different body. The experience was far too much for her to handle. As she explored her surroundings she found a mirror hanging on the wall in the bathroom. So she entered the bathroom and gazed at herself in the mirror. She was gobsmacked by her reflection. To her horror, she was in the body of Bethany Singer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetrified, she closed her eyes and tried to assure herself that this was all a dream, but indeed it was no dream. She almost threw up in her mouth upon the sight of her new body in her underwear.</span></div></div>",

I only had about a hundred and sixty people in my friends list, all friends and family. I never really logged in often, there wasn't really much to do on the website other than chat or look at photos. In fact, I only ever logged in just to chat with two people.

Initially I thought that there would be some kind of online simulation that generated random events that would take place over that specific period in time, expecting hilarious results, but unfortunately, hardly anything happened. All that happened was that I received an email thanking me for using the app and telling me to enjoy my new life. No swap, no simulation, no prediction, nothing. What a rip off!

I wasn't aware at the time, but it turned out that the website contained a new feature enabling the viewer to change the body of other individuals into the form of another's desire. Do I need to tell you who her desired target was? Yes, she transformed me into whatever she desired the most. It wasn't until that very moment I changed when I discovered her true intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn some occasions however, it wasn't only the gender that was altered. This particular story revolves around a couple of students from <b>Dograb All-Girl Comprehensive School</b> who, because of the lack of facilities in their own school, must attend particular lessons in Dograb college. I happened to be good friends with most of them, including the busty <b>Ashley Howell</b> and the nerdy <b>Jade Hazel</b>. The girls would be taken to and from the college via a minibus. Of course, I had no idea what an all-girl school was like, but while in the lavatory, I suddenly transformed, for reasons unknown, into a fifteen year old girl! To make matters worse, I was mistaken for one of the school girls and, as a result, before being fitted into a spare school uniform, I was forced to return to the school with the girls. I was in for a wild experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings got a bit out of my control after a bitter dispute I had with my girlfriend. Upset by the situation, I got drunk and, as a result, I cheated on her. While she was out of town for the following two weeks, somehow the word spread throughout the entire college, and soon all the students were glaring at me and gossiping behind my back, particularly the females. I knew that something sinister was about to happen to me, but I did not realize that I would be punished for my irrational actions by being transformed into a five-year old girl! Forced to endure the rest of the day, and possibly the next two weeks, as a young girl, I had to find out who was responsible before my girlfriend returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's it for now, but don't worry, there's plenty more where they came from!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what's it going to be?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As usual, Monday mornings were long and dull, and as usual, I forgot my coursework. In response, I was once again instructed to stay behind during the lunch break to catch up with the rest of the class. This time however, I had to do my work in the computer room. Needless to say, I wasn't too concerned about the coursework. I was left alone in the computer room, where I was free to surf the world wide web. Unfortunately however, the college staff were on to us students. They had already blocked the most common websites, so of course, I was unable to check my social networking profile page, and I was unable to play online games. So, I decided to search the web, and incidentally, I came across a new website that peaked my interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the risk of causing similar incidents, I will not share the name of the website to you readers, as desperate as you may be, but to explain it briefly, it was a website capable of changing an account member's body into the form of their dreams. After going through the necessary steps to create an account, I checked it out. Basically, it was an image generator, where I was able to combine and mix different images into what I perceive to be the body of my dreams. Of course, I failed to take it seriously and, as much as I hate to admit it, the result was a hot, sexy blonde babe with enormous breasts and wide hips. I know it was a crude thought, but come on, how many of you readers have never fantasized about such a possibility?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, needless to say, my fantasy came true. As I completed the process, a blinding light suddenly shone from the monitor, and I could feel my entire body undergoing drastic changes. Locks of blonde hair sprouted from my head as my figure rapidly shrank to a far more appealing shape. I could feel myself shrinking into the chair as I felt a heavy thrust from beneath my shirt. My waist felt like it was being squeezed as my hips grew noticeably wider. As my body grew ever slimmer, I could feel a cold breeze slip into my collar and tickle my chest. The hair on my body had disappeared, leaving a smooth feel on my tanned skin. I slightly panicked as my masculinity drew closer and closer to disappearing until, finally, the transformation was complete, and the blinding light vanished. I looked down at my new shape, distraught by what had just happened. My nails were longer and my jeans were now too baggy. I switched to the webcam to get a glimpse of my new body, and to my surprise, I was a splitting image of the woman I picked out on the website. Unbelievable. Even the most manly part of my body had disappeared, leaving behind a small patch of pubic hair!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the woman staring back at me in the mirror, and the woman that I became: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://image.sporttruck.com/f/11512443%20w750%20st0/0901st_45_z%20texas_heat_wave_custom_truck_show%20blonde_bikini.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://image.sporttruck.com/f/11512443%2...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs my nipples became more and more erect upon further inspection of my new body, I suddenly remembered about my coursework. Before I could finish it however, I realized that if I was found like this, I would be in big trouble. I had to figure out a way to change back into my normal body, but before I could find the instructions on the website however, I was horrified to learn that the website went under maintenance almost immediately after I changed, and unfortunately, the website would not return for an whole week!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so there I was, in the body of the girl of my dreams, wearing my old clothes, now doomed to go through the rest of the week in this form. In a different scenario, this wouldn't have been so bad, but since I was in the middle of college, with all of my friends present, it seemed unlikely that I'd be able to survive the rest of the week without being noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy coursework had to wait. This was serious. If I were to remain in this form for an entire week, I couldn't just stay in the college computer room the entire time, obviously there were other classes that took place here. I had to leave. But where could I go? Who could I go to? This was a rather peculiar predicament to say the least.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Never have I felt so uncomfortable. I was clearly not used to being a female. For one thing, I was struggling to cope with a pair of such large lumps under my shirt jiggling upon every movement, providing a constant distraction, not to mention the constant fight I had just balance on my feet. I was not used to having so much weight on my chest, but it was an even worse feeling to have my erect nipples rubbing against my shirt. I had a recurring urge to scratch them, but I knew that it would only make things worse. There was also the battle to hold my jeans over my waist, I regretted not wearing a belt that day. I was also not used to having so much hair on my head, locks of blonde hair continued to shuffle and swing over my face, most of the time blocking my vision. But perhaps the worst of all was a weird sensation coursing through my lower torso, clearly I was not used to having female organs in my body. I could only pray that things couldn't get any worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought that being in the body of my dream girl would be a laugh, but I was immediately regretting ever visiting that website, and I was regretting having such a crude dream. But now, there I was, doomed to live out the rest of the week in this body, no doubt forced to experience most of the physical sensations that women go through. I hoped that I would not have to experience a period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had no other choice. I couldn't survive the week like this alone. I needed help. However, it was difficult to trust most of my friends. If I knew my friends, they would take advantage of me like this. I knew I would if I found one of them in a similar situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question however, was who could I trust?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI contemplated one of the guys. <b>Jordan Andrews</b> was a good friend, perhaps my best friend. If I had to put my faith in anyone, it would be him. Although I wasn't sure how he would react if he saw, but I suspected that he would be helpful, and try his best to ensure my safety. The only problem would be whether or not his girlfriend, or his sister, would be as helpful, and not as protective as they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then concluded that a better option would be to trust one of the girls, since they lived through these experiences their entire lives. Perhaps it would be better to trust someone who had experience with being a female. Preferably not my girlfriend however, if she found me like this she would completely embarrass me. If there was a girl that I could trust, it would have to be <b>Hayley Watkins</b>. We were good friends in college, and she always cared for me, as I did for her. She was also quite bright, so she would have been the best person to turn to, unless she had her not-so-trustworthy friends with her by the time I find her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose were the best people that I could go to for help.</span></div></div>",

Well, if I knew him, he'd normally be chilling in an empty room, either on his own to update his coursework or just to relax with his girlfriend. I decided to search for him, firstly directing myself to the English room, which was normally vacant during lunch breaks. As I made my way towards my best friend, I could only hope that his girlfriend, <b>Kelly Walcott</b>, would not be present. Then again, would that actually matter?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, bros over hoes, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, as I made my way down the empty corridor, the classroom door appeared in my line of vision.

It was New Year's Eve and, unfortunately for her, she was going to be stuck in some family's house, babysitting a bunch of young girls. This was not her idea of entertainment, especially on such a special occasion. Meanwhile I was preparing to head off to my friend's flat party to celebrate the countdown to a new year. When she first heard of my plans, my girlfriend was not too keen on my decision to go while she was stuck babysitting, so I promised her that I would come to her house and stay with her for an hour or two before she had to head off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer parents were already away, off to attend a party of their own, so we were left alone in her house. Unfortunately however, when I arrived, she was slightly disappointed. I promised her that I would arrive at her house at half past three in the afternoon, but I was forty five minutes late, which meant that we could only spend half an hour with each other before she had to go and babysit. The first few minutes was marked with an awkward silence, clearly I had upset her, but eventually we started cuddling with each other, like we usually did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Rebecca invited me to her bedroom. She wanted to show me something amazing before she had to leave, so I followed her into her room, where she had her laptop already running, and sat beside her on her soft bed. She had some sort of website loaded on the screen, but I failed to notice what site it was because before I could take a closer look, she told me to close my eyes. She said that she didn't want to ruin the surprise. So, like the gullible fool that I was, I followed her order, and closed my eyes. As I waited for the order to open them, I listened to Rebecca typing something on her laptop. As she continued to type however, I couldn't help but open my eye slightly, just to take a peek. Before I could, Rebecca noticed me peeking and told me off, informing me that if I didn't behave, my surprise would be far less satisfying. With that said, I kept my eyes shut, anticipating what she had in store for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I sat there, with my eyes closed, I couldn't help but notice the odd noises that her laptop was making. Either her laptop was running really slow and awkwardly, or something else entirely was happening, something that I may or may not like. Upon noticing this however, I felt a strange tingling sensation tickling my entire body as the odd noises grew louder. The strange sensation continued to spread and grow, overcoming my entire body until, suddenly, I felt my body endure drastic changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was it. At that point, I had to defy my girlfriend's wish. I had to open my eyes, just to find out what was happening to me, but when I opened my eyes and looked down at myself, I was horrified to find that somehow, some way, my body had changed tremendously.</span></div></div>",

My feet no longer touching the carpet below, my entire body had shrunk drastically and my muscles had completely faded away. My baggy shirt, jeans and trainers had morphed into a pink frilly dress. My hair had grown and squeezed into a pair of cute little pigtails. To my dismay, I looked down at my new body, recognizing the distinct features of that of a little girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorrified by what I had become, I jumped off the bed, slightly stumbling from the sudden gap between the bed and the floor, and rushed towards the mirror hanging on the bedroom wall. To my disbelief, all I could see in my reflection was a ten year old girl, with blonde pigtails, wearing a pink frilly dress with a yellow flower on the chest, staring back at me in awe. Finally it sunk in. I was the very girl staring back at me in the mirror. I had become a ten year old girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horror quickly shifted to anger as I turned towards Rebecca, who had a wicked grin on her face. \"Awww,\" she giggled, adoring my current form, \"You're so adorable! This is better than I could have asked for!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" I tried to sound as intimidating as possible, but it was futile in such a young form. Even Rebecca cringed at the sound of my high-pitched voice. \"What did you do to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check this out,\" Rebecca turned to laptop around so I could look at the screen. She was on a website that I recognized from earlier in the year, a website that specialized in altering the body of others to assume the form of their dreams. Although I initially believed that it was only capable transforming the viewers themselves, Rebecca explained that the website had recently opened a new feature enabling a viewer to change the form of other individuals, particularly previous users found in the history page, into the form of another's desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo I need to tell you who was her desired target? Well, since there I stood, in the middle of my girlfriend's room, now in the body of a ten year old girl, what more proof do you need?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat I was more distressed about however was her intentions. Why would she ever think of doing such a thing to me? Was it because she was jealous of the fact that she couldn't follow me to the flat party that I originally planned to attend that same evening? Was it because I was late to visit her before heading off to that same party? Did I say something in the past to upset her? I needed to know why she could do such a thing to me. So, with a tear of desperation dripping down my cheek, I asked her why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a devious smile on her face, Rebecca explained her actions.</span></div></div>",

That's it? Becky, you didn't need to do this to me. You only had to ask!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't,\" she replied, \"Have you met the parents of the children I'm supposed to be babysitting tonight? Their father told me that if I brought any of my friends to his house he would see to it that I don't have another job in this town again! I couldn't invite you to come with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then why do this to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you get it? I'm not allowed to invite any friends to their house, but they can't say anything if I tell them that I'm babysitting you too, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" I saw where she was going at that point, \"So you're going to sneak me into the house as your little sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as my sister, just another girl that I promised to babysit. That way, they can't say anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then what?

That way, we'll be able to spend the entire night with each other, and no one will suspect a thing! I'll just change you into a little girl again when the parents get back, sneak back to my place, and change you back again. It's a full proof plan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to agree. It was a clever plan, but nonetheless, I already had plans, and Rebecca was spoiling them for me. Instead of a wild night at a flat party, celebrating the new year, I was basically forced into spending the night with my obsessive girlfriend, spending almost half the night in the body of a ten year old girl!

She was so upset when I told that I was going to a flat party for New Year's Eve while she was babysitting. I could see in her eyes that there was nothing that she wanted more than to just spend the night with her boyfriend, even if it means that her boyfriend has to pose as a little girl for a little while. So, reluctantly, I agreed to carry out her bizarre plan, but only because I felt sorry for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I nodded my head, Rebecca was thrilled. I was suddenly swept off my feet when she dropped down to pick me up and embrace me, her huge arms almost squeezing the life out of me. The preparations then followed. As Rebecca got changed, I climbed onto her bed, still overwhelmed by my transformation. The frilly dress that I wore bothered me so, but I doubted that Rebecca would have some old spare clothes from almost eight years ago, and even if she did, I wasn't willing to experience changing clothes in this body, and I sure wasn't going to give Rebecca the pleasure of changing me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Rebecca was ready to go. We both made our way down the stairs, taking far more care in every step I took, left the house and locked the door behind us. Rebecca approached the street, oblivious to the lack of speed that I now possessed, and waited for me on the pavement. There, she made a gesture that truly made me feel inferior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I stood beside her, still in awe at the size difference, she looked down at me and held out her hand. To my disgust, she wanted me to hold her hand. Normally I would be more than happy to hold my girlfriend's hand, but not like this, not in this form, it just felt so humiliating and degrading. Nonetheless, I offered her my hand. She then grabbed my hand, ignorant to the tight grip that she held almost squeezing my hand, and made her way through the street, while harshly dragging me behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like we've been walking through town for hours, when in reality it had only been twenty minutes. Whenever we passed a bystander on the street I would feebly try to cover my face with my hand to make sure that they didn't recognize me. This was already looking to be a horrific night. I could only hope that spending the night with Rebecca was going to be worth all the embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually we arrived at the house where we were supposed to stay that night. A semi-detached house in the middle of the suburbs. Rebecca knocked the door, and the young mother, who immediately took notice of me. She bent down and asked who I was in such a patronizing manner, completely oblivious to my true age, gender and identity. I was spoken to and treated like the little girl that I was, but at least I got a free lollipop out of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen we met the stern father, a rather intimidating figure who immediately questioned Rebecca. Luckily she was prepared for every question. According to her, I was a ten year old girl named <b>Annie McCormack</b>, a cousin who she promised to take care of for the night. She promised him that I wanted experience as a babysitter, and that I wouldn't cause any trouble. It seemed that she managed to convince him, and eventually, after much more smothering and being treated like a little girl, the parents were on their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca then turned her attention to the children that she was selected to babysit for the night.</span></div></div>",

So, reluctantly, I introduced myself. \"Hello,\" was all I said, and in response, the second of the three girls, the nerdy ten year old <b>Kylie</b>, stepped forward and shook my hand, slightly catching me off guard with an unexpected grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Annie,\" Kylie said as she relinquished her tight grip of my soft hand to push her glasses back into place, \"Want to play video games in my room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a tempting offer to say the least, but as much as I loved video games, I was still not comfortable enough to do anything I was familiar with in my current form, especially if it means doing it in the bedroom of a girl that I just met, so I shook my head, still too shy to speak. I failed to realize a look of disappointment on my girlfriend's face, who frowned down at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the introductions, all the girls went off to do their own things. Gemma pulled out her mobile phone and started chatting to her friends in the kitchen and Kylie proceeded to play video games in her bedroom. Thinking that the coast was clear, I climbed onto the sofa in the living room to try and regain my confidence, but I was thrown off track when I noticed the youngest of the girls hopping onto the sofa next to me. I looked down to see her cute little face staring up at me. The four year old girl, named <b>Lucy</b>, had a look of curiosity in her eyes, a look that made me suspect that she knew who I really was. So, in an attempt to distract her, I told her to play with her dolls. Eventually she left, without saying a word. I let out a slight sigh of relief until I noticed Rebecca, sitting in the other side of the room, loading up her laptop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't you be taking care of these girls?\" I asked impolitely, only to receive a harsh reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am,\" she snapped, \"You seem to be enjoying being a little girl a bit too much. In case you've forgotten, I'm keeping my end of the bargain we had earlier. You do want us to have some fun together, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was relieved to know that this humiliating disaster of a night was not going to be a total loss after all. As Rebecca typed away on her laptop, I waited, twiddling my thumbs, in anticipation of finally, after what seemed like a long week, returning to my normal male eighteen year old self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least that's what I thought.</span></div></div>",

I was sitting in the middle of the sofa, waiting in anticipation, until I suddenly felt the pink dress I was wearing starting to slide off my smooth shoulders. I then acknowledged my legs, that were raising from the edge of the sofa. I had to straighten my legs as I realized that I was seemingly sinking into the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as I sat there, I realized that I was, once again, shrinking! As my head sunk into the dress, my hair sprouted and twisted into a pair of pigtails. I tried to stand up, only to trip over the suddenly over-sized dress and fall back on my bottom, panicking at the sight of my latest form. I sprung out of the sofa and onto the carpet below, struggling to cover myself with the massive dress that I was once able to fit into perfectly. Rebecca, that witch, did the exact opposite of what I hoped for, the exact opposite of what she promised to do. Instead of changing me back to my normal male self, she regressed me even further, now no younger than the four year old Lucy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith tears in my eyes, I turned to Rebecca, who was laughing to herself, clearly proud of what she had just done. \"What's wrong,\" she gloated, \"Did Annie make a boo boo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't funny!\" I feebly shrieked, demonstrating my frustration, \"What did you do to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry love,\" she answered, licking her lips, \"But this was the last straw. I know you wanted to go to that New Year's Eve party to flirt with those college friends of yours, so I just pulled out the sympathy act. Works every time. And then I led you to play along with this little game but, as much as I loved you as a ten year old girl, I just couldn't resist making you even younger just to see the look on your face when I tell you that I have no intention to change you back. You were a lousy boyfriend, so now we're going to try you out as my little sister Annie. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was gobsmacked. All I could do was stand there, holding the dress over my body, with tears in my eyes. I just wanted to drop on the floor and cry, but I didn't want to give such a cruel woman the satisfaction. In an act of defiance, I tried to snatch her laptop from her, only to be shoved back onto my backside by the mighty strength of my girlfriend, striking me with enough force to make me wince.</span></div></div>",

As I retreated to the corridors to gossip with my friends, we couldn't help but notice a couple of female students walking by, a group of girls from Dograb all-girl comprehensive school. Every week they would turn up to some of our lectures, in their school uniforms, and without a word, they would go back into their minibus and head back all the way to the other side of the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite rare to pick one of them up for a conversation, but on this occasion, I was lucky. I was fortunate enough to bump into Ashley Howell, an eighteen year old student with an incredibly busty figure. I couldn't help but notice how the buttons on her top struggled to contain the immense size of her chest. I knew that it was rude and wrong to do so, but trust me, if you saw them for yourself, you wouldn't be able to resist, no matter what gender you are!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, to put it bluntly, Ashley noticed my lingering eyes looking down as we spoke. She did not react however, it seemed as though she was used to the attention, she just simply said \"My eyes are up here,\" and as I blushed, she simply giggled. Again, I was lucky. We talked a little bit about her school, and how they lacked the facilities to develop their media studies projects, the very reason why they had to turn up in Dograb college every week. Personally I couldn't hack the constant traveling every week, it would be too much hassle. I admired how Ashley simply shrugged it off, her endurance was truly something to adore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore we could continue any further however, Ashley's friend, Jade Hazel, interrupted me, clearly wanting to say something to her. Although I was a little disgruntled by the rude interruption, I let them carry on and headed to the lavatory. I failed to acknowledge it during my conversation with Ashley, but as I was left alone, a strange tingling sensation tickled my entire body. By the time I finished peeing in the urinal however, the sensation spread and grew, overcoming my entire body until, suddenly, as I made my way towards the sink, I noticed something odd happening to me in the mirror.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I noticed locks of blonde hair rapidly sprouting from my head as my muscles and fat shrunk to a far more appealing shape. As I shrunk in height I noticed my pecks expanding and curving into two huge, round breasts. My waist felt as if it was being squeezed as my hips grew noticeably wider. As my body grew even slimmer and shorter, I felt my baggy jeans slipping down my smooth thighs. The hair on my body had disappeared, leaving a smooth feel on my tanned, spotless skin. I panicked as my masculinity drew closer and closer to disappearing until, finally, the tingling sensation ended. In horror, I simply glared at the mirror, completely overcome by shock and awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was staring into the mirror, looking back at me was a very attractive young blonde girl with surprisingly enormous breasts, almost the reflection of the girl of my dreams. Although my jeans had fallen to my ankles, and my baggy t-shirt barely covered the top of my thighs, I did not care, I was awestruck at my reflection. I dropped my head down to analyze my new body. The first thing I noticed was the huge bouncing breasts blocking my view of my own feet. I placed my new hands on them and jiggled them about for a bit, watching myself in the mirror as I did so. I analyzed further, noticing that the most manly part of my body was completely gone, leaving behind a small patch of pubic hair. I searched my body for it, only find a very juicy pair of buttocks and a hole in between my legs. The more I groped myself, the more my nipples became erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally realization settled in when a cool breeze between my thighs regained my senses. I looked down to see my jeans wrapped around my ankles. At that point, I realized the situation that I was in. Somehow, some way, I had transformed into a young girl, possibly aged fifteen, in the middle of the boy's lavatory, in the middle of a crowded college, with my trousers on the floor. If anyone walked in on me at this point, I would have fainted. Could things get any worse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperately I tried to pull up my jeans, only to fall flat on my chest, slightly bouncing on my new breasts. I was clearly unable to balance my new body in a vertical position. I struggled back to my feet, grabbing my jeans as I did so, pulling them up to my waist. Unfortunately however, they were now too baggy to fit me without a long, strong belt to hold them up. Even my boxer shorts were too baggy for me! I had no choice but to try and hold them up for the time being. This was embarrassing. There I was, holding my pants up, with both hands, wearing trainers that I could barely keep over me tiny feet, and a baggy t-shirt exposing an unusual amount of cleavage, but still not too baggy to hide my erect nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite how much I struggled to maintain my clothing however, and despite what I looked like, I knew that I couldn't stay in the boy's lavatory much longer. I had to leave, preferably without being spotted and, if possible, figure out a way to change myself back to normal, or at least find myself a private place to regain my composure. With this in mind, I slightly opened the heavy door, suddenly realizing the lack of strength I now possessed as I struggled to push the door open, and peeked my head out to check if the coast was clear. To my relief, no one was in sight. I slipped through the door, my erect nipples harshly scraping the frame and, while struggling to keep my jeans over my waist, I crept out into the corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were bad at this point. How could I face my friends looking like this? How could I return home to my parents looking like this? If I had to endure this transformation, why did it have to take place during the first break period? I still had two more lectures and a lunch break to press though! At this point however, that did not matter. I was more concerned with not being caught.</span></div></div>",

I felt a chilling breeze down the collar into my cleavage, a sensation that gently tickled my breasts as I swung my head, back and forth, to check if the coast was clear. To my relief, it was. There were a few students further down the corridor, but they seemed to be so focused on their own conversations that they wouldn't even bother to acknowledge me, something that I was already used to I suppose. Regardless, I was free to sneak out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut where was I going? It wasn't as if I could just stroll back into class looking like this. It wasn't like I could return home to my parents looking like this. And there was no way I was going to face my friends like this, especially while gripping dearly to my old clothes just to cover my new feminine parts. As I took a few more steps down the corridor, I noticed another heavy door, similar to the boy's lavatory. This was the girl's lavatory. Staring at the sign on the door, the universal symbol for <i>woman</i>, I felt a lump in my throat. To enter the girl's lavatory meant accepting my new identity. Whether I liked it or not, I had to accept the fact that, at least for a while, I'd be stuck in this body, and must get used to the fact that I would have to be treated as such. So, after taking a deep breath, in a feeble attempt to rebuild my confidence, I pushed the door open, once again struggling at the tremendous weight of the door, and stepped into the lavatory where, to my horror, someone was already present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, I froze. I turned around and tried to pull the door back open, but unfortunately, it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA familiar voice came from behind me, and at that moment, my eyes widened with fright. I turned my head to face my captor. Before me stood Ashley Howell, the busty school girl who I spoke to earlier, literally seconds before I changed into this equally busty form. She had just finished drying her hands after washing them at the sink. I noticed a look of concern in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was hesitant to reply, I dreaded what my new feminine voice would sound like, but Ashley looked worried, I had to speak, but before I could, she interrupted me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look familiar,\" she added, \"Have we met somewhere before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to answer, but I couldn't think of what to say. I didn't want to tell her that we just had a conversation, I couldn't bare to think of her reaction, but I didn't want to create a false identity, an identity that I would be stuck with for the time being. But what did I say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you the new school girl we've been told about? The one we're supposed to be meeting here in college?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it. I couldn't just stand there, like a pathetic little girl, I had to give an answer.</span></div></div>",

She was clearly intrigued by me, but I was intimidated by the size difference she now possessed over me. A few moments ago, I had to look down to face her, but now there I was, standing over six inches shorter than her, having to look up just to stare into her wandering eyes. I was caught off balance as she sharply clutched my shoulders, as if to demonstrate the strength she now had over my small, fragile form. She looked deep into my eyes, and realized that I was telling the truth. She released me and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you looked familiar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was confused by this statement, until she continued. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" I replied in desperation, \"One minute I was chatting with you, then I went to the toilet, and the next thing I knew, I looked like this!

A curse? I was cursed? How was I cursed? Why was I cursed? Who cursed me? I had so many questions, but considering my current position, I was willing to believe anything, as long as there was a way for me to get out of this body! Despite this however, I was still hesitant at posing as a schoolgirl, even if it was just for an entire day.

Upset by this, I wound up drunk, and as a result, I cheated on her.

There were rumours throughout college that I have done much worse actions in my drunken state. It was of no real surprise that some of my peers from college, particularly the females, would want to get their own back, just to teach me a lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed as if their plan was soon to unfold, but I could not envision what kind of punishment they had in store for me. Perhaps the only fortune in these days of regret was that Rebecca had left on holidays in Greece, and as a result, I did not have to see her for another two weeks. But I couldn't help but wonder if she was involved in this suspicious conspiracy theory, and if so, who would have the privilege to execute my punishment in her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until after first period when their plan started to unfold.

I was having so much fun that I forgot to keep track of the time, because I promised my parents that I would be home by midnight. When I checked the time, it was half past three in the morning! I knew that I was late, and I knew that I would be trouble when I got back home. I left the party and started walking through the park alone. I was in no hurry. On my journey home however, I stumbled across something that I, and most likely anyone else, had never noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the bottom corner of the park, under large, thick bushes, I found a metal door on the ground. Curiously I reached for the handle and pulled the door open. Under the door I saw a staircase leading into pitch black darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally I would close the door, walk away and try to forget what I had just seen. But for some reason that even now I fail to recall, I took out a cigarette lighter from my pocket, lit it up and started making my way down the mysterious stairs, without any concern for what I might find. Mind you, I did have a few drinks that night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I climbed down the stairs it started to get harder and harder to see in the darkness, until finally I reached the bottom of the staircase.

I looked around and I was mesmerized by what I found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was standing in the middle of what appeared to be an abandoned laboratory, hidden away from the outside world. The floor was made of cold steel and there was amazing machinery, covered with piles of scrap and debris, everywhere. It was like a glimpse into the future. Investigating the laboratory even further, still slightly tipsy, I stumbled into another room, where something caught my attention. Upon entering I gazed into the room to see a huge piece of machinery that intrigued me: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/File:Vault_112_TQ.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\">http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/File:Vault...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwelve cryogenic pods circled a large mechanism. As I looked around, I noticed that only two pods were vacant. The other pods were apparently occupied, but it was hard to tell, the freezing cold atmosphere fogged up the pods, making it difficult to tell, but whatever figures were occupying them, it appeared that they were all cryogenically frozen. I investigated the system further, discovering that it was a virtual simulation system, and that the ten occupants were most probably living in a virtual world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirtual reality had always been a personal dream of mine. I always dreamed of entering a virtual world where anything was possible, and standing there, gazing at the very piece of machinery that I always anticipated, it seemed that my dream had finally come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any further hesitation I climbed into one of the empty pods. As the pod door closed behind me, I started to lose consciousness. As I struggled to keep my eyes open, I started having strange illusions until, finally, I lost all consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater I woke up. I realized that virtual reality was no longer a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I woke up however, I found that I was no longer in my original body, but instead I was in the body of a eight year old girl! What kind of sick reality did I stumble across?</span></div></div>",

One particular location was <b>Ogmoel Vale</b>, a small village on the outskirts of Dograb, overlooking the Western English Channel. An isolated, quiet rural hill farming village, one of its most popular attractions was the community center. Although I haven't visited it recently, when I was fifteen years of age, before I attended college, I went on a five day school trip there, where me and a couple of classmates were to sleepover from a Monday night to a Friday morning. We had to sleep in the community centre itself, where the boys would sleep in one side and the girls would sleep in the other. I looked forward to the activities ahead, at least for a moment. When we arrived, the organizers sent me to this mysterious machine, where I was chosen as a guinea pig to be transformed into a female for the rest of the trip. As a result, I was forced to remain in the girls' group, forbidden to meet up with the boys outside hours, where I had to pose as a fifteen year old girl for the rest of the week. Or so I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a more recent story however, there was an entirely different change that took place in college. During the first period of the first day of the week, everyone inside the college feel unconscious, but when we all regained consciousness, we all made a shocking discovery. Everyone inside the college grounds, including the staff, had somehow, some way, switched genders! Needless to say, chaos ensued. All the boys had become girls, and all the girls had become boys, at least all of those who were inside the building. There were a few fortunate individuals who were outside the building during this event, but unfortunately, I was not one of them. Like everyone else, I had swapped genders. The question however, is how? This was a question that we were all determined to figure out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what's it going to be?</span></div></div>",

I must warn you that these experiences were endured by numerous residents in Dograb, particularly the females. Interested in learning more? That's fine with me, I've got a few stories in mind that I think you might enjoy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA popular activity in Dograb college was cheer leading. The cheer leading squad was led by an American student, from the state of Ohio, named <b>Stephanie Granger</b>. Seventeen years of age, she was your typical blonde. Noticeably dull and gullible, she relied heavily on her good looks to get through college. As the head cheerleader however, she had a reputation of being spiteful to her peers, criticizing both their looks and actions compared to her own, particularly to her rival for the position of head cheerleader, the sixteen year old <b>Sophie Bennett</b>. During a trip to the beach however, Stephanie would soon learn, first hand, of the amazing transformations that the residents of Dograb endure on a regular basis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Jessica Andrews</b> was the younger sister of one of my best friends, Jordan, who was entering her first year in Dograb college, along with some of her own friends, including <b>Sam Rivers</b> and <b>Georgina Parr</b>. With long blonde hair and brown eyes, she was a beautiful sight to behold, despite sporting a few extra pounds in weight. Jessica had always been self conscious about her weight, struggling to fulfill her promise to put herself on a diet, but everyone else knew that she was truly blind to how perfect she looked already, there was no need for her to go on a diet. Georgina would even joke about how Jessica behaved when it came to weight. One fateful day in college however, she suddenly found herself slowly increasing in weight. Unable to control this inflation, and with Georgina's giggling eyes watching her everywhere she went, Jessica was desperate to put an end to the humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also a student named <b>Sarah Gibbs</b>, who was classed by many as an <i>emo chick</i>. Despite this stereotype however, she really had a heart of gold, and she was a very good friend to me. She was a very attractive girl with long bleached hair and blue eyes, but she was very quiet when it came to meeting new people. Despite her quiet nature however, she had a hateful relationship with perhaps one of the fattest girls in Dograb college, <b>Victoria Summer</b>, who weighed even more than I did! Victoria would often cover her eating disorder by being mean to others, and one of her enemies was Sarah, who she was very jealous of. One fateful day in college however, Victoria discovered a mysterious berry with amazing qualities that she hoped to share with her nemesis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Dograb college however, it was not only the student that had the misfortune to endure such a humiliating transformation. Our thirty seven year old Drama teacher, <b>Zoe Huffman</b>, was of no exception. With brunette hair and hazel eyes, despite her age, she was very beautiful and attractive, looking more like a twenty year old tart! One of her best features were her ridiculously wide hips and thick thighs. She was single, but she lived with her eight year old son, <b>Jack Doyle</b>. Despite her childish, hyperactive behaviour, almost the entire college fancied her, but I was one of the few who did not. On the first day back from the Summer holidays however, during her class, she spontaneously began to expand, bloated into a giant blueberry form, in front of the prying eyes of her students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what's it going to be?</span></div></div>",

It wasn't as glamorous as Miami, but it was okay in its own right. Anyway, there was a hint of intention in the mind of the squad leader, <b>Stephanie Granger</b>, the stereotypical blonde American girl. She was the type of girl who relied on her good looks to get through life, behaving in such a childish manner in order to attract the attention of the local boys. However, as the rest of the cheer leading squad would tell you, there was more than meets the eye with her. They knew, first hand, just how cruel and spiteful she could be in her quest for perfection, and they were always criticized for their looks and actions compared to her own and, today, there was no exception. She suggested a trip to the beach merely as an opportunity to show off her new swimsuit. Most of her outfits left almost nothing to the imagination, but at least she had the body to sport such outrageous outfits, despite how revealing they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs usual, the first to receive her harsh remarks was the sweet sixteen year old <b>Sophie Bennett</b> who, since the day they met, have been at each other's throats. Never a day went by when Sophie fantasized about completely destroying the life of the head cheerleader. However, unknown to Stephanie, Sophie intended to do just that during their trip to the beach. How? Well, let's just say that she managed to obtain a couple of sweets that were more than capable of getting the job done. It was only a matter of slipping them in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were changing into their swimsuits in the changing room. While Sophie slipped into her own one-piece swimsuit however, Stephanie approached her and snatched the sweets from her grasp, unaware of the power that they possessed. This was the opportunity Sophie needed. She pretended to be distressed, annoyed at the usual actions of her peer, trying her best to lure her into dropping the sweets into her mouth. As predicted, Stephanie taunted her, mocking her height by holding the sweets high out of her reach until, finally, she popped one into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, at first, there was no reaction. Nothing happened as Stephanie licked her lips in a satisfied manner. She was about to concede and hand the sweets back to Sophie, but before she could grab them, Stephanie snapped them out of her reach and, after calling her a \"sucker\", she guzzled the load, clearly enjoying the addictive taste of the delicious sweets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie couldn't help but let out a smile. She was delighted that her plan was a success. Now all she had to do was wait and watch as the magic took place.</span></div></div>",

They were such good friends before arriving in college, but there was never really any reason why they separated. Some said that it was out of jealousy, some said that they just had a big fallout one night, but if I'm totally honest, I believed that it was all down to jealousy. After all, there was nothing similar about either girl. Sarah was such an attractive girl, she had a heart of gold, and she tried her best to be good friends with everyone, including myself. She had long bleached hair and crystal blue eyes, she had a quiet nature, but she was quite an individual once you had the opportunity to know her better, whereas Victoria was a fat cow who despised everything that Sarah did. Victoria weighed even more than I did, but she would often cover her eating disorder by being spiteful to others. So yeah, I'm willing to believe that her jealousy of Sarah was what drove them apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, at least in her mind, Victoria finally managed to exact what she believed to be revenge, even though Sarah never really did anything to hurt her in the first place. One fateful morning in college, Victoria stumbled upon a strange berry with amazing qualities. To be honest, I wasn't really sure where she found it or how she discovered what it did, but honestly, how many of you readers actually care? All you need to know was that she found this berry, and she was completely aware of its power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing the story, as everyone prepared for their opening lectures, Victoria stopped Sarah in her tracks, presenting her with a false apology, and offered the berry to her as a symbol of their truce. Of course, Sarah had no idea what she was up to, but unfortunately for her, she thought nothing of it, and simply swallowed the berry with one gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Victoria developed a wicked smile on her face, Sarah felt a rumbling sensation in her stomach.</span></div></div>",

From what I've heard from her closest friend, the overweight <b>Kayla Duncan</b>, Bryony had been ruining her once gorgeous figure, developing some kind of eating disorder to keep her occupied. Despite her eating habits, Bryony had always disregarded Kayla's warnings about her weight and, in response, she would poke fun of her fat friend. That all changed one fateful night however, when the unthinkable became a reality, and she was cursed to gain an unimaginable amount of weight from certain ticks. What those ticks were however, Bryony was about to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember the story of <i>\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\"</i>? In Dograb, a piece of gum capable of inflating a human being and transforming them into a giant blueberry actually existed. <b>Hayley Watkins</b>, one of the brightest girls in Dograb college, was one of the unfortunate few to feel the effects of the blueberry gum.

During one particular weekend however, a tarot card reader had set up a tent just outside the local fast food restaurant. Upon her first glimpse of the tent on her way towards the restaurant, <b>Kayla Duncan</b> took an immediate interest. From what I've heard from her, she was concerned about our old friend, <b>Bryony Evans</b>, the sweet sixteen year old that had nothing but lounge around in her home ever since she dropped out not so long ago. She was determined to get her friend back out and about once again, and upon noticing the tent outside the restaurant, she thought that it would be a nice change, rather than stuffing their faces at the fast food restaurant every week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs predicted, Bryony took an immediate disliking to the idea. She was not as open-minded as her chubby friend, and she cared very little for the idea of tarot card reading, but nonetheless she decided to join her, hoping for a little laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey entered the tent, and they were presented to an enigmatic figure, shrouded by mystery, or at least Kayla thought so. Bryony simply sighed and continued to drag along the reading. Little did she realize was that the tarot reader had noticed the clear boredom in her face, and was slightly agitated. It was a relief for her to pull out a rather unusual card from her deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon the card was a rather bloated woman that held her hand against her lips. Unaware of the seriousness of what the card represented, Bryony simply giggled, pointing at the figure on the card and made a remark, comparing the figure to her best friend. She was oblivious to the sly smirk that crept on the card reader's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before the two left the tent, both looking rather disappointed. Kayla was disappointed with the ignorance of her friend, and Bryony was just bored, however Kayla was more annoyed by yet another remark about her weight, this time in front of a total stranger. Despite Bryony's recent incredible eating efforts, she was still very thin, at least compared to her overweight friend, a fact that Bryony would constantly remind her about whenever the two went out together. How they were still friends, I had no clue, but for once, Kayla would love to see Bryony experience what it was like to be even bigger than herself.</span></div></div>",

Kayla was in a foul mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she watched Bryony delve further into her feast however, Bryony then let out a sudden hiccup. Of course, while eating such large portions of food, she would often develop rapid hiccups, but Kayla couldn't help but notice something odd about this particular occasion. She ignored the first one, and then the second one, even the third and fourth, but after the fifth, she noticed a slight puffiness in her friend's neck.

But was she the only victim of this strange liquid?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of my best friends, <b>Jordan Andrews</b>, was another victim of age regression. He had black, styled hair, green eyes and he wore glasses. Classed by many as a scene kid, I knew that, deep down, he had a heart of gold. He also had the build that you would expect from a rugby player! Recently however, he was kicked out of his ex-girlfriend's home and begun a relationship with a girl from his class named <b>Kelly Walcott</b>. Little did he realize was that Kelly was just as psychotic as his ex-girlfriend, <b>Emily Stone</b>, who never forgave Jordan for dumping her last year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the hottest girls in Dograb college, <b>Emma Miles</b>, had always underestimated just how pretty she really was. With light brown hair and brown eyes, she also happened to have the biggest breasts in the entire college, including the teachers, and that was saying a lot! She cared deeply about her looks. She always had a disliking towards me, but I still considered her a friend regardless. Her boyfriend was <b>Mark Bates</b>, one of the jocks at college, and there was nothing more that she liked than a night out in the pub with her best mates.

As she ascended to a seated position however, she noticed something odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stretched and let out a yawn, she noticed that her feet, that would once be almost the same length as her bed, were now buried under the blanket. She also noticed a lack of weight on her chest. She planted her hands on her chest, only to realize that her breasts had disappeared!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down in fright to see that her entire body had shrunk into her pajamas. Panicking, she swiftly rushed out of bed, only to fall on her face, realizing that the bed was much higher from the ground. She stumbled back to her feet and rushed into the bathroom. She looked into the mirror on the wall, only to realize that it was too high for her to look at her reflection. So quickly she dragged the desk chair from her bedroom, struggling to pull the chair because of its size. With the chair in position, she quickly climbed up and looked at her reflection in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stared at herself in the mirror in amazement, she realized that the dream that she had was no dream. Somehow, she had grown younger. A lot younger as a matter of fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she couldn't believe it. But by judging on the reflection of herself in the mirror, she assumed that somehow, some way, she was ten years old again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstonished by this transformation, Bryony crawled off the desk chair and rushed down the stairs, noticing how much larger each step was to her now. She reached the bottom of the staircase and entered the living room, where she saw her parents. They were much taller than she last remembered. They looked at her with a confused look upon their faces. But before Bryony could explain herself, they start speaking to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young lady,\" the mother strictly said to her, \"What do you think you're doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Bryony confused herself. But as her parents spoke to her more and more, then she suddenly realized that her parents think that she had always been this way! They thought that Bryony was, and always had been, a little girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Bryony,\" her dad told her, \"You've got to get ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gulped and asked her tall parents the obvious question, horrified by the sound of her youthful voice. \"Ready for what?\"</span></div></div>",

And when I found out how much money babysitters made, I couldn't help but try it out. And so there I was, ready to begin my first day as a babysitter, looking after a ten year old girl that I had no idea was, in fact, one of my old friends, Bryony Evans!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo without any knowledge of who's household I was in, I was welcomed into the cozy living room, where I met the mother of the child. And after a brief chat about the necessaries of looking after their child, the father called for Bryony. \"Bryony,\" I thought to myself, \"My friend has that same name!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked toward the bottom of the staircase where I was introduced to the little girl that called herself Bryony. She had so many qualities that reminded me of my friend. She seemed pretty nervous meeting me, but then the parents left. They gave Bryony a kiss goodbye and were on their way, leaving me behind in their home with their daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Bryony,\" I turned my attention to the little girl, who was strangely intimidated by my height, \"What do you want to do first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alan, listen to me,\" the ten year old tried to explain to me, \"It's me, Bryony Evans!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever her statement was taken into my mind with little sincerity as a laugh. \"I know,\" I said joyfully while rubbing her head, \"And do you want to know something? You have the same name as one of my friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryony suddenly started screaming to my face. \"That's me! I'm your friend! I'm Bryony Evans!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know who you are,\" I replied sternly, \"There's no need to shout at me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Listen to me!\" The ten year old was determined to get the truth to me. \"I'm your friend, Bryony Evans. This is my house. This has always been my house. But this is not me. I don't know how it happened, but I just woke up like this! Somehow I woke up six years younger, and my parents think that I've always been their ten year old daughter. And I don't know how, but you've been assigned as my babysitter! I know it sounds strange, but please, you've got to believe me!\"</span></div></div>",

Is that really you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryony let out a sigh of relief. \"Yes! So you get it now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, but the moment of joy quickly turned into coming to grips of the realization. \"But what happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" I notice a tiny tear drip from her eye, \"I just woke up like this! I don't want to be like this! This is way too scary!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnwilling to see Bryony reduced to this, I tried my best to settle her down. \"Don't worry.

That's what friends are for, right? Firstly we'll have to find the source.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What source? I just told you that I just woke up like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Bryony, think! You woke up like this, but think back. What did you do last night? What did you do recently?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know! I can't remember! How can I concentrate like this!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! Did something strange happen last night? Or did something strange occur overnight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryony tried her best to remember. I could see the look of concentration in her face. I wanted to help her out so much, but I knew that I couldn't help her out in any way until she can give me any clues to how this regression occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she began to remember. \"Well...I did have some of this new drink before bed...I remember feeling a bit weird as I lay in bed, but that's about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith anticipation, I asked her another question. \"What was the drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it was called <b>Youth Juice</b> or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat confirmed it. I knew what the source was. It had to be whatever this drink was. \"Youth Juice?\" I asked, \"What kind of a drink is Youth Juice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's new. It looks a lot like spring water, but it tastes horrible. I only had a sip of it.\" Suddenly a realization came to Bryony, who then gasped. \"Do you think that could be the source?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so. But weren't you a little suspicious about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was I supposed to know? I read the advertisement for it. It said that it would make you appear more youthful. How was I supposed to know that I'd end up six years younger!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you still have it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's in the fridge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation I stormed into the kitchen and opened the fridge. I scanned the interior and spotted a small bottle with the title <i>\"Youth Juice\"</i> inscribed on the side. I picked up the bottle and shut the fridge door. I held the bottle in line with my eyes and read the inscriptions for further details. As I did so, I noticed Bryony following me into the kitchen. \"Did you know that it was made from the Fountain of Youth?\" I asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought that was a metaphor,\" she explained, but I knew that it wasn't her fault, so I continued reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" She asked curiously, anticipating a reply from me.</span></div></div>",

It just seems like an ordinary bottle of water!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInspecting the Youth Juice, I made a decision that could drastically change everything. \"Maybe if I have a quick taste, just to see what happens...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Bryony interrupted me. \"No!\" she screamed, \"Don't do that! What if you end up like me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's a risk, but I've got to find out if it actually works.\" I noticed the look of concern on her cute little face. \"Don't worry,\" I told her, \"I'll only have a little taste, just to make sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryony moved back and watched helplessly as I unscrewed the bottle cap. I then pressed my lips to the open bottle and took a quick gulp. The taste lingered in my mouth as I swallowed the liquid. Bryony was right. It did not taste like spring water at all. But whatever the taste was, I enjoyed it, and gulped down another sip of the drink before coming to my senses and realizing what I had just done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an awkward pause of silence, I heard Bryony speak in awe. \"Whoa,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much did I drink?\" I asked anxiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You drunk quite a bit,\" she replied, \"Way more than I did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I put the open bottle aside I felt a tingling sensation in my stomach. I turned to Bryony who simply stood there with her mouth wide open in shock. I knew that I was going to regret making such a big mistake. The tingling sensation quickly began to spread across my body before I burped unexpectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I noticed my surroundings beginning to grow more distant. Everything, including Bryony, was growing bigger and bigger. I knew that I was shrinking. I continued shrinking as my clothes grew baggier and heavier. I turned back to the bottle of Youth Juice that I placed on top of the fridge, but it simply became more distant and out of my reach. Unwilling to comprehend what was happening to me, I lowered my head, closed my eyes and wrapped my arms around myself. All I could think about was when I was going to stop shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRapidly I could feel the years of my life fading away. In what seemed like an eternity to me, in reality no more than five seconds had passed.</span></div></div>",

Still covering my eyes in horror, I was too frightened to open my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I heard a voice echo above me, a voice of which was very familiar to me. A voice of which, only until now, that only came from below. It was the voice of Bryony Evans, who too made the mistake of drinking the Youth Juice, and who I should have listened to. From one taste of this drink, Bryony wound up ten years old. Earlier I had to kneel down just to be eye level with her, but after having a drink myself, apparently much more than she consumed, I knew that I was going to be much younger than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alan?\" She asked. The sound of her voice shuddered down my spine. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly I opened my eyes, taking my first look at the world from a new perspective. The first thing that I noticed was Bryony Evans, standing tall and looming over me. I looked up to her face to see a look of concern on her face, a look of which one would give to a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a tear dripping down from my eye, I replied to the huge ten year old. \"How...what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryony raised her hand and rubbed my head, similarly to what I did to her earlier. \"You drunk that Youth Juice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How old am I?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Bryony answered, \"You look about five.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five!?\" I stepped back in shock, unwilling to believe her. But as I did so, I noticed a reflection of myself on the fridge door, which towered over me. I looked at my reflection, only to see that Bryony was telling the truth. The reflection confirmed the worst for me. I was now a mere five years old, half the age of Bryony! \"Oh no,\" I screamed, \"We've got to do something about this!\"</span></div></div>",

His mother, Zoe Huffman, the thirty seven year old bubbly drama teacher from Dograb college, tried her best to cheer him up, but to no prevail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two arrived outside the school, where Zoe was to drop off her son.

Startled by this, Zoe quickly leaped back to her feet, only to realize that, even while standing straight, she was somehow eye level with her eight year old son. She looked down to see that her entire body was changing. Her huge breasts deflated and her wide waist was trimmed. Her arms and legs shrank and her wrinkles quickly faded away. Even her clothes were changing. Her checkered top fused with her tight black leggings into the shape of a pink frilly dress. Her high-heels shifted into pink slip-ons with white frilly socks. \"What's happening to me!?\" Zoe screamed, only to cover her mouth with her soft hands at the change of her voice. By now she was noticeably shorter than her son, who simply watched the transformation in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mum,\" Jack suddenly blurted in shock, \"What happened? You look like the same age as me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Zoe panicked on the spot as she continued to watch herself grow more and more feeble and child-like. Everything around was growing much larger. Overcome with shock, Zoe covered her eyes, wishing that the transformation would stop soon.</span></div></div>",

I had no idea who left it there, or what kind of drink it was, all I knew was that it had a tag with my name written on it. Evidently it was intended for me. From what I presumed, the drink looked like some blackcurrant squash in a small bottle with my name tagged on it. At the time, it was lunch break and, while most of my friends were out eating dinner, I stayed behind in class to finish my incomplete coursework, which was due in the following week. Of course, at the time, I was always very thirsty, and very curious. But when I took a sip, I suddenly found myself shrinking into my chair! It was a horrible, humiliating experience that I hope I'll forget very quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, I'm not the only person in Dograb to be shrunk somehow. <b>Rita Brotch</b> shared a similar fate. Rita was an overweight chav with bleached hair. She wasn't very bright and she wasn't very fit, but regardless of her size she was very popular amongst the street gangs in Dograb. In college she made several enemies who would like nothing more than to put the big bully in her place, but they all knew that if they tried anything then she would beat them up, or even get some of her mates from her gang involved. Little did Rita realize was that she would soon have to pay for her aggressive actions, and one fateful day in college, while in the lavatory, she found herself shrinking to a far more insignificant size. It seemed that her day had come, and she had to face the music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot enough?

I had to stay behind in class during my lunch hours to finish my incomplete coursework, since I needed some of the supplies found only here in Dograb college. I had no other choice. While all of my friends were out eating dinner and enjoying themselves, I was stuck indoors struggling to finish my work. It was the same story all week, at least until Friday, when I found something unusual sitting at my desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked into the English classroom, on my own once again, only to find a small bottle sitting at my desk. I was curious, so I inspected the bottle. It was full of some kind of liquid, presumably blackcurrant squash, but what was more interesting was that the bottle had a tag with my name written on it. I couldn't recognize the handwriting, but whoever wrote on the tag must have known that I was staying behind, so I assumed that it was intended for me. With the small bottle in my hand, a sudden thirst suddenly consumed me. I suddenly became very thirsty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a free drink in my hand, why would I even consider buying another one with my own money? This was a convenient discovery, or so I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I took a sip from the strange bottle, oblivious to the bubbling beneath my lips, I sat down in my chair, prepared to finally complete my work. Putting the drink to one side, across the desk, I reached into my backpack, ignorant to the unfamiliar reach it took to grab my folder. I threw the folder onto the table in front of me without noticing the peculiar amount of strength it took to lift such a heavy folder. I then reached back into the bag beneath my chair, but this time however, I struggled to reach down. Puzzled by this, I looked down, noticing how low the floor had suddenly become, but when I looked back in front of me, I suddenly realized that something strange was happening to me.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My chest was suddenly level with the desk. This was odd. Then I realized that I was sinking into my chair. I pulled myself forward in an attempt to touch the floor, but I almost fell off the chair entirely. Even more peculiarly, one of my shoulders suddenly popped out of the collar of my shirt. I tried to readjust myself, only to realize that my clothes were growing out of proportion. Once again I looked back forward, and this time, my chin was suddenly level with the desk. I started to panic as my over-sized shoes slipped from my feet onto the ground. As my head rapidly sunk into my shirt, I realized what was happening to me. My clothes weren't growing at all. I was shrinking! In a state of fright, I stood up, standing from the collar of my shirt, horrified by the massive pile of clothing beneath me. I stood at my highest, but I continued to shrink further into my clothes. Even standing up, I was no longer level with the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally I stopped shrinking, but it definitely took its toll. There I stood, in the nude, standing amongst a pile of enormous clothing, on top of a chair. From my estimation, judging from the remarkable size of my shirt, I must have shrunk to the size of a single inch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorrified to find myself in such a vulnerable state, I needed to find something to cover my tiny naked body. I looked up to see my desk, now almost out of reach. Remembering the strange liquid that I consumed earlier, I predicted that the liquid was responsible for shrinking me to a mere inch tall. Out of desperation, trying my best to ignore the fact that I was naked, I tried to climb up onto the desk. It took a lot of strength and agility, but eventually I did. I was overwhelmed by how vast and distant the environment had become. I was awestruck by how large everything had become. My folder was now big enough to host a rugby match!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked to my right and saw the massive bottle, with my name written on the tag. I walked towards it. Earlier I was able to hold it in the palm of my hand, but now it was as almost as big as a lighthouse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI examined the bottle for further inscriptions, hidden from plain view. Unfortunately however, there was no further information other than what was inscribed on the tag, at least from my point of view. I was sure that it was the drink from this bottle that was responsible for shrinking me to such an insignificant size, but from what I could tell, there was no proof, and at that point, it looked like there was no hope of returning to my normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to do something. I couldn't just stand there, I needed to find help. I realized that finding help from someone would be no easy task, especially at such a tiny size, but I needed to figure out a way to return to my normal size, and there was no way that I was going to figure it out standing in the middle of a desk in an English classroom. My only hope was to find some help.</span></div></div>",

Someone was entering the room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicking, I hid behind the massive bottle, hoping that whoever came into the room would immediately leave without noticing me. In my current size, I couldn't let anyone unwanted to find me, otherwise they could have complete and total power over me, and there wouldn't be thing that I could do about it! I needed to find someone to help me, but there were a few individuals that I'd rather not let find me like this, so I couldn't take the risk, at least not so soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard loud footsteps from behind. Thankfully they did not approach me, instead they approached the opposite corner of the classroom. At that moment, I took a gamble and popped my head around the bottle to catch a glance at the person who entered the room. It was hard to tell from my point of view, all I knew was that it was a girl. I wouldn't mind asking a girl for help if I wasn't naked, that would be truly embarrassing. So instead of rushing out in an attempt to gain her attention, I continued to keep it low until I caught a better glimpse of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as she bent down, presumably to pick up something that she forgot from her lesson earlier. She stood back up and, almost instinctively, I hid back behind the bottle. I turned my head around, trying my best to see through the bottle itself. From my assumption, it looked as if she was standing there, facing the very bottle that I hid behind. She must have been curious about the bottle, or worse, she must have spotted me! To my horror, I suddenly heard the same footsteps approach me. This was it. I was doomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot willing to be caught so soon, I dashed from the bottle and dived into my open folder, hoping that the looming girl behind me failed to spot me. I hid, like the pathetic little bug that I'd become, until suddenly, the folder was flipped open, revealing my naked body lying down. At that moment, my heart sank, and I froze. Nervously I looked up into the face of the girl who caught me in such a pathetic position.</span></div></div>",

I was filled with both relief and despair. Fortunately for me, I was really good friends with her, helping and protecting each other in everything we faced, we had a friendship based on trust and kindness. Despite this however, I feared for my life, lying naked, no taller than a Lego figure, under her glaring eyes. Her expression was that of disbelief, she was clearly amazed to stand before such a minuscule individual cowering inside a folder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alan?\" Her voice was normally soft and quiet, but from my position, it sounded as though her voice was booming from the heavens. \"Alan, is that you? What the heck happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a hint of concern in her thunderous voice, but even at the top of my lungs, I was so small that she couldn't hear my response. That was when she raised her enormous hand and gently scooped me into the palm of her hand. It was terrifying feeling to be standing in the palm of someone's hand, like a little insignificant bug. With a slight stomp of her thumb, she could easily squash me with such a god-like size difference, but fortunately for me, Sarah had a heart of gold. As I stood in her palm, pathetically covering my private parts with my hands, she raised me level with her face, her eyes towering over me like a sphinx. That was when I tried to explain myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, you have to help me,\" I screamed as loud as I possibly could, but even standing so close to her face, she struggled to hear my tiny voice, \"This must have happened to me when I drunk from that bottle. Please, you've got to help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah couldn't help but let out a little giggle as she heard my squeaky voice. Noticing this, I blushed. This experience was already truly humiliating, I was not willing to allow her to make it even more embarrassing than it already was. She then turned her attention to the bottle itself, but there was no use, she had just as much success in finding a remedy as I did earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, from the background, we overheard a crowd of people. In a reaction, Sarah covered her palm with her other hand, momentarily coating me in pitch black darkness, as the crowd loudly continued through the corridor, away from the classroom door. That was a close call. For a moment, Sarah thought that she was caught, and for a moment, I thought that I would be found by someone much, much worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious that we couldn't find a cure for this problem in the English room. Eventually we decided to leave the classroom and search for the one responsible for leaving the shrinking potion behind, with my name inscribed on the tag, so I could face such an undignified experience. However, before we left the room, there was still the matter of hiding me from sight. Unfortunately for me however, there were very few options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong story short, it was such a beautiful day outside, Sarah decided that today would be the perfect day to attend college wearing nothing more than a tight black silk-laced strap mini dress and a pair of heels. Of course, the problem with this particular mini dress was that it had no pockets where I could hide. So, as I noticed her looking down at what little she wore, I realized that there was no other option. It appeared that I was about to have a very close inspection of her underwear.</span></div></div>",

There was the infamous night that I spent with a couple of my female friends from college. At this point, I had broken up with Rebecca Keane and started a highly physical relationship with <b>Hayley Watkins</b>, one of the brightest and cutest girls in college. There was supposed to be a house party taking place in her house that night, but unfortunately, only me and two of her friends arrived, <b>Rachael Ellis</b>, the tall, slim beauty, and <b>Phillipa Jones</b>, the bookworm with perhaps the widest hips in the entire college. Instead, the house party was changed into a sleepover and, as usual, I was stuck as the only guy in attendance, something that, I must admit, I was still not used to. During that night however, Hayley revealed her true intentions for the night. She had purchased a shrinking potion from a local merchant in town, capable of manipulating the size of anybody, from the size of an ant to the size of a house! Need I tell you who the three girls decided to use the potion on? Of course, they turned to the only guy in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, not all of these stories involved the college students. Somewhere further across the island town was the <b>Dograb All-Girl Comprehensive School</b>, where most of the girls in town had to attend. The victim of this particular story was <b>Michelle England</b>, an eighteen year old girl. She was notorious for, not only being one of the shortest girls in the entire school, at least out of the girls in the later years, but also for being one of the chubbiest. Although she was tormented by most of her peers, she did not let this upset her. She continued to stick to her comic books and video games. She even had her own profile page on a website where she was famous for uploading stories and images based on female weight gain, shrinking and age regression (sound familiar?). Well, one day in school, one of her stories came true, as she soon found out when she suddenly discovered that she was slowly shrinking. Was she able to survive the entire day of school without shrinking out of existence? Or did she become the little toy of one of her peers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hope any of these stories peak your interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what's it going to be?</span></div></div>",

Maybe it had something to do with her obsessive behaviour, maybe it was me just being selfish, or maybe it was the significant terror that I suffered when she transformed me into a little girl, but whatever the reason, in the end, it was the right choice. I couldn't spend my time with such an insane girl, but then again, my current girlfriend was really no different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Hayley Watkins</b>, one of the brightest girls in college, had also come out of a bitter relationship with her boyfriend. She was in the same classes at me, and we spoke quite a lot before we both actually mustered the courage to ask each other out, but ever since that night, to be frank, we've been at it like guinea pigs! She had long, dark blonde hair and dark eyes to match and, although she was slightly chunkier than most girls in college, and was not as outgoing as most of them, she was really sweet, and I was very lucky to have her. Or so I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were going out with each other for over a month, and in celebration, Hayley decided to throw a house party, since her parents were out of town for the entire week. As I've already stated, she was not as outgoing as most girls, so when she invited most people from college, only a select few actually replied. In fact, excluding myself, the only two people to actually turn up were her closest friends, the tall, slim <b>Rachael Ellis</b> and the wide bookworm <b>Phillipa Jones</b>. With this turnout, the girls decided to call it a sleepover instead, something that I was not happy about. I don't mean to sound like the jealous night, but I wasn't in a positive mood that night, not just because none of my own friends turned up, and not because Hayley wanted to spend the night gossiping with her friends instead of spending intimate time with me, but because of what happened next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the clock struck at midnight, the girls were all sitting on Hayley's bed, as I pouted in the corner of the bedroom, with my head in my hand. They were giggling amongst themselves, from what I could make out, snickering about me in particular. I couldn't help but notice a sinister glance from Hayley, as if she had something mischievous in mind. At first, I thought that we were finally get together for the first time that night, but as the other two girls turned around to face me, she climbed off her bed and presented me with some kind of bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked inside the bottle. It contained some kind of liquid, with qualities resembling blackcurrant squash, but I was more concerned with the devilish look on Hayley's chubby little face. Of course, I asked what it was, but I did not like the reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why Alan,\" she responded as the other girls giggled in the background, \"Why don't you have a taste and find out for yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course I was hesitant, I had no idea what was inside the bottle, and I had no idea what was going to happen to me, but when the three girls started to become a little more persuasive, I reluctantly obliged. As Hayley opened the bottle, I tilted my head and opened my mouth. She poured the liquid down my throat, disregarding my inability to gulp, as if she was going to pour the entire bottle down my throat. After a few gulps, I pushed the bottle from my face, slightly confused at the sudden height I had to raise my hand to do so. I opened my eyes, only to find that Hayley was now looking down at me.</span></div></div>",

As I stood upon a massive pile of clothing, now in the nude, all I could do was use my hands to cover my private area and look up into the face of my maniacal lover. She had a massive grin on her face, slightly blushing at the sight of my naked body of course. She was joined by the other two girls, who gathered to behold my new pathetic stance. In utter embarrassment, I crouched back down to pull the shirt back over my naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...what did you do to me?\" I was terrified to stand there, with three giantesses towering over me with wicked smirks upon their giggling lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it look like Al?\" Hayley sarcastically replied, drawing her face ever closer to me as she licked her lips. At this size, she was more than capable of swallowing me whole! \"One way or another,\" she added, \"We're going to have some fun tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, I noticed her huge hand looming over me. I was now no taller than her little finger. I was petrified to see her massive fingers fall closer towards me until she pinched me, by my shoulders, in between her index finger and her thumb. She lifted me from the pile of clothing and held me tightly in front of her face. The other girls joined her, resting their heads over her shoulders for a closer look at me, as they both continued their constant giggling. Never have I felt so embarrassed, weak or pathetic as I did at that moment, but staring into the eyes of my girlfriend, I feared that the worst was yet to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then dropped me into her other hand, and there I was, sitting, in the nude, in the palm of her hand. I looked up and caught a glance of her sinister grin once more. What did she have in store for me? I dreaded to think.</span></div></div>",

There I was, no bigger than a finger, sitting in Hayley's palm, in the presence of two of her closest friends, in her own house, with no parents for the rest of the week, and during half term! There was no hope of escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelighted with the total dominance Hayley displayed over me, both Rachael and Phillipa expressed their interest. As they crowded around me, both with sinister intentions in mind, they both began to argue amongst themselves. They were both interested in the possibilities of possessing a male with such an insignificant size, they couldn't decide who should have the privilege of playing with me first. Of course, stating that Hayley intended to toy with me first, considering that I was her boyfriend, a fight ensued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley gently placed me onto her incredibly soft, massive bed, before she was tackled from behind by Rachael, slamming her onto the bed. The impact caused me to fly into the air and land harshly in between the two girls on the bed as they continued to wrestle with each other, unaware that they were squashing me beneath their enormous bodies. As Phillipa bounced into action, I suddenly found myself wedged in between Rachael's butt cheeks, slightly suffocating from the fabric of her ridiculously tight pajama bottoms. Despite being stuck in such a degrading position however, the three girls continued to fight amongst themselves, oblivious to where I was trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until Hayley screamed for the girls to stop when they noticed that I was nowhere to be seen. They went in search until Phillipa pointed out that I was wedged face first in between Rachael's tight butt cheeks. Rachael laughed hysterically, admiring my current position in front of the door mirror, but Hayley was green with envy. She wanted to be the first to toy with her tiny boyfriend, and she was consumed with jealousy to see him stuck in her best friend's firm booty. As Rachael continued to pose in front of the mirror, Hayley prepared herself and, as Phillipa watched from the corner of the room, Hayley pounced at Rachael, tackling her back onto the bed, still oblivious to my well-being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom such a degrading position, it was difficult to hear, but from what I made out, it seemed that the shrinking potion, the one responsible for shrinking me in the first place, was brought into the fight. It seemed that, very soon, one way or another, I was going to be joined by one of the girls at such an insignificant height. Suddenly the fighting paused, and then I could hear gulps. It seemed that someone had consumed the liquid, as I did earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who drunk it, and more interestingly, was she the only one to drink it?</span></div></div>",

Someone had consumed the same potion that shrunk me in the first place, and an a few moments, I would be joined at such a minuscule size. Since I was still wedged in between her butt cheeks, I concluded that Rachael was not the one who shrunk, but just a few moments later, I could hear Rachael struggling until the tight squeeze rapidly grew tighter. Eventually I was launched from my position, slamming hard onto the soft bed. After catching my breath, I looked up to watch Rachael face a similar fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rachael climbed to her feet, pulling herself from her over-sized pajamas, she realized that she was rapidly shrinking, however unlike myself, she stopped shrinking when she reached approximately one foot in height, still several inches larger than myself. I then noticed Hayley, my girlfriend, standing next to her at the same size. The two girls, who now stood there before me in the nude, had a taste of their own medicine, but unfortunately for me, the playing field was far from even, I was still no taller than their knees. However, to my surprise, they did not pay attention to me. Instead, they were panicking amongst themselves. Clearly, they dreaded what would happen to them in the hands of the only person in the house who had not yet drunk the shrinking potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore us stood Phillipa Jones, the only girl who had not yet shrunk, who had an unfamiliar smirk upon her face. Suddenly her shy personality had vanished, and in its place came a wicked woman with sinister intentions in mind. There she stood, at her full size, looming over the two naked girls standing pathetically on the bed, cowering in fright. Phillipa bent down, her massive face casting a shadow over them. From a short distance, I watched, in equal fear, as Phillipa giggled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry girls,\" she smirked, \"But now we're going to have fun on my own terms!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, she grabbed Rachael by the waist and pulled her toward her face, Rachael's long legs kicking all the way. \"Put me down you cow,\" she screamed furiously, a squeak in the ears of her captor, \"You won't get away with this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Rachael,\" she replied, \"You used that potion to shrink your best friend, did you really not expect me to do the same to you? And to be honest, I don't really like your tone, little lady!\" With that said, Phillipa shifted Rachael into a far more degrading position.

After enduring an undignified humiliation, Hayley was thrown back onto the bed, where an equally bruised Rachael comforted her. Delighted with her triumph, Phillipa stood back onto her feet, casting a chilling shadow over her tiny prisoners, and felt a slight tingle in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't go away girls,\" she stated as she approached the bedroom door, \"I just gotta visit the little girl's room for a moment, then I'll be back to have some more fun with my new tiny toys. And if any of you try anything funny, I promise you that you will not like your punishment.\" With that said, she left the room, leaving me and the two girls alone in the room to attend to our wounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley and Rachael were distraught before they remembered the reason for their current predicament. They both looked back at me. The sight of the two nude girls, standing several inches larger than myself, was not only intimidating, but the sight of their naked bodies made me bashfully avert my eyes. I was used to seeing my girlfriend in the nude, but certainly not her unquestionably fit friend. Noticing me shyly turn away from her made Rachael giggle. \"Oh come on Alan,\" she sarcastically joked, \"It's not like I have anything you haven't seen before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls dropped to their knees before me, oblivious to how aggravated I was to stand at such an insignificant size, and began to discuss possible ways to escape this embarrassing situation. As we planned amongst ourselves, Hayley then remembered a solution she also found in case of such a scenario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the cupboard on the side of her bed, there was a small bottle containing some pills that, in case of being shrunk, were apparently capable of restoring people to their original sizes. The problem however, was trying to open the shelf and pull out the pills, not to mention the remaining time before the giantess would return, and not to mention the lack of trust amongst the girls. Regardless however, the two girls tried their best to recover the pills in time, since I was too small to be of any help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some effort, but eventually, with Rachael sitting on Hayley's shoulders, they managed to pull out the bottle of pills and place it on the bed. However, we noticed a disheartening comment in the instructions inscribed on the side of the bottle, hinting possible side effects. However, there was no time to lose, we had to take the risk before Phillipa would return to humiliate us even further. Of course, there was a debate over who should take the first tablet. Needless to say, I was ruled out because of my minuscule size, it was far too easy for the girls to keep me away from the pills to restore my rightful size, so it was up to the greedy girls to bicker amongst themselves and decide which of them would take the first pill.</span></div></div>",

Much to Hayley's annoyance, she was helpless as Rachael consumed the first pill. However, this rage subsided and turned into shock as she witnessed Rachael's body change much more than all three of us had anticipated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael grew noticeably taller, but what was more worrying was the sudden rapid shift in her chest. Like a pair of balloons, we watched in amazement as her breasts suddenly began to inflate and expand out of proportion. It wasn't until the sudden weight on her chest caused her to the lose balance when Rachael realized what was happening. Suddenly it was as if she was resting upon a pair of massive beach balls, and still they continued to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, although she still towered over us, she couldn't have grown more than one foot, but to our amazement, her breasts, which were at one point considered below average, had grown so big that they were now just as tall as Hayley, who herself stood only one foot tall! They had grown so big that they could have easily crushed Hayley, let alone me. In fact, at three inches tall, they looked like huge mountains to me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Rachael was distraught. There she was, her chest attached to two massive balls of flesh that sat on the bed. It appeared that, although she managed to grow at least one foot taller, all the rest of her height seemed to have shifted into her breasts. With such overwhelming weight, she was unable to move under her own power. Of course it would have been futile for me to attempt to lift one of them, let alone both of them, but when Hayley attempted to lift one up, even she was unable to do so. Even the nipples looked so large that I could camp on one of them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be unfair to think that, after what she did to Hayley, she deserved it. No one deserves this kind of punishment. But Hayley couldn't help but let out a giggle, as well as a few caresses. She couldn't resist the urge to just squeeze them with all her might. It was fortunate that I was so small that they couldn't recognize the boner that I had watching such an arousing display. There was very little Rachael could do about it, all she could do was wave her bare arms and legs furiously. She was completely immobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis situation provided a rare opportunity for me and Hayley. Phillipa, the only one of the three girls not to be affected by the shrinking potion, had gained full control over the rest of us, tormenting us for her pleasure. Nothing would have pleased her more than seeing her once superior friend in such a degrading, humiliating position, other than having her way with her in this form. I realized that this could have provided a long enough distraction for me and Hayley to make our escape and search for some help before she could realize that we're gone. Hayley then realized this, since after she was done fondling Rachael's colossal breasts, she crouched down in front of me, oblivious to the chilling sensation of having such a large nude female figure tower above me, and whispered a potential escape plan to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Hayley now stood only one foot tall, I was still a mere three inches tall. Compared to her, I had to be the size of a little puppy. If we were to escape together, we both knew that she'd have to carry me most of the way, as I would not have been able to keep up. So there we were, about to make our move. I was scooped into her arms and pressed into her naked chest, struggling not to get aroused by being surrounded by so much sweaty skin. While she held me closely in her chest, Hayley was about to make her way down the side of the bed.</span></div></div>",

If not her weight, then at least her height. After all, she was one of the shortest girls in the entire school, at least out of the girls in the later years. It was true, she was chubby, and she was short, but she never really let that bother her much. She continued to stick to her comic books and video games, but more interestingly was her love for transformation stories, specifically stories based on female weight gain and shrinking. She even had her own profile page on a website where she was famous for uploading similar stories and images. Despite her horrible school life, she seemed to enjoy herself, and she was quite popular amongst her fans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, things got too real when she uploaded her latest image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer latest image was an illustration of herself, no taller than a few inches, being squeezed in someone's hand. Although she was reluctant in portraying herself in her art, the image turned out to be one of her personal favourites, but when she tried to upload it, something happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light in her bedroom flickered, her computer monitor suddenly gleamed a blinding light, and Michelle felt a tingling sensation course through her entire body, but as quickly as it happened, it ended in a flash. At first, she was puzzled, but after a brief moment, she simply shrugged it off and continued responding to her fans' comments. The image brought a lot of attention from her fans, one even claiming that they could make the image into a reality, a comment that Michelle simply laughed at and ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that Sunday night, she slipped into her pajamas and tucked herself into bed, dreading yet another miserable Monday morning at school. She eventually drifted off to sleep, without realizing that her blanket, that was once too small to cover her feet, was now covering her entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe woke up the following morning and noticed something peculiar.</span></div></div>",

She then tried to pull herself out of her bed, realizing that it took a slight effort for her feet to touch the floor. She stood up, only to trip over her pajama bottoms. As she regained her composure, she realized that they were down to her ankles. The collar on her pajama top was even larger, making it surprisingly easier for her to remove it. She began to change into her school uniform, only to realize that her once tight polo shirt now revealed a little bit of cleavage and, for the first time since she could remember, she needed a belt to wear her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must be losing weight,\" she thought to herself as she prepared herself for what she initially thought to be yet another dull day in school.

After receiving a few cruel remarks from her peers, she progressed to her first lesson, where she once again approached the brink of dosing off before the bell rang for the end of first period.

Eighteen years of age, she had long, dark blonde hair and dark eyes. Although she was chunkier than most girls in college, and although she was not as outgoing as her closest friend, the very tall and slim <b>Rachael Ellis</b>, she did not let these features get in her way. There was just one issue that she had however, an issue that not even her closest friend knew about. Secretly, she was unimpressed by her figure, believing that it was not curvy enough, so when she noticed a new drug, a syringe containing a strange fluid capable of expanding the breasts of an individual, it was no surprise that she would pick one up and try it on herself while in the college lavatory one morning. Unfortunately however, the effects were not as she anticipated. Would her breasts ever stop growing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot all of these stories took place in Dograb college however. Somewhere further across the island town was the <b>Dograb All-Girl Comprehensive School</b>, where most of the girls in town had to attend. The victim of this particular story was <b>Michelle England</b>, an eighteen year old girl. She was notorious for, not only being one of the shortest girls in the entire school, at least out of the girls in the later years, but also for being one of the chubbiest. Although she was tormented by most of her peers, she did not let this upset her. She continued to stick to her comic books and video games.

Seventeen years of age, she was your typical blonde. Noticeably dull and gullible, she relied heavily on her good looks to get through college. As the head cheerleader however, she had a reputation of being spiteful to her peers, criticizing both their looks and actions compared to her own, particularly to her rival for the position of head cheerleader, the sixteen year old <b>Sophie Bennett</b>. After a cheer leading rehearsal one morning however, as the rest of the squad left the changing room, Stephanie stayed behind to try a new pill, with the promise of making her rather small breasts more noticeable. They did work, but unfortunately for her, they did not work as she hoped. Instead of expanding her breasts, her entire body shrunk except for her breasts! What a predicament!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a separate occasion however, these rather humiliating expansion stories would finally become an advantage to one fortunate individual. A regular visitor of the college gym, Rachael Ellis was very sensitive about her figure. Extremely shy about her fitness, she was determined to maintain an athletic figure. Unfortunately for her however, this was not apart of her family genes. No matter how hard she worked out, she would always maintain a tall, slim, weak body. Although many people still considered her very attractive, including myself, the brunette was never truly happy with how she looked. That was until she was offered a strange new drug, capable of expanding her muscles. Without turning back, she took the drug, and almost instantly, she became a huge powerhouse!

She was also known for possessing an inflated ego, but she was just as hot and sexy as she claimed to be, even for a girl of her young age, and despite being one of the tallest girls in the entire college, standing over six feet and one inch tall! Despite her age, she acted very motherly towards everyone, looking down at others and treating them like they were children compared to her. No one deserved to be transformed and taught a serious lesson than Amy Blade. Recently however, she's been doing a lot of posing for her friend's photography coursework, the most recent theme set at a local farmyard. For her photo shoot, Amy stumbled across a pig mask, and decided to use it in a few of her poses. Little did she realize however was that it was a cursed mask, and whoever was unfortunate enough to wear it would be cursed to slowly transform into a pig. Needless to say, Amy had what was coming to her for a very long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother incident occurred on Halloween night. In this particular story however, there was not just one victim. Four close friends from college went out trick or treating before the annual late night costume party held in the college grounds. <b>Hayley Watkins</b>, one of the brightest girls in college, was dressed like a cow girl, <b>Sarah Gibbs</b>, the attractive scene kid, was dressed like an elephant, <b>Rachael Ellis</b>, the tall, slim beauty, was dressed like a mouse girl, and <b>Phillipa Jones</b>, the bookworm with perhaps the widest hips in the entire college, was dressed like a cat girl. All four girls went out trick or treating together, but were infuriated when an old lady refused to treat them with the reason that they were all too old for the tradition. The offended girls sought revenge and threw eggs at her house, without realizing that they were, in fact, messing with the wrong person. Little did they realize was that the old lady was actually a witch who, in response, laid a curse on the four girls, slowly changing them into the animals they were dressed up as. Only until they arrive at the costume party do they realize their fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's it for now, but don't worry, there's plenty more where they came from!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what's it going to be?</span></div></div>",

Well, I guess I do have the figure for it, don't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, what would you expect from someone who was as selfish, as big-headed and as obnoxious as <b>Amy Blade</b>? The sixteen year old drama student was very outspoken and confident with her every move. She turned a few heads when she went as far as to shave her once long, blonde hair and dye what was left pink, just so she could claim it as a fashion statement. Then again, she did manage to pull it off, as much as many of us hated to admit it, despite her massively inflated ego, she was just as hot and sexy as she claimed to be. What was the most shocking thing about it though was that she was only sixteen years old, and she was even one of the tallest girls in the entire college, standing well over six feet tall. She was very mature for her age, but that only gave her the opportunity to look down and treat others like children. Seriously, if anyone deserved to suffer a transformation, if anyone deserved to be taught a serious lesson, it had to be Amy Blade!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was offered by a student from <b>Dograb All-Girl Comprehensive School</b>, a mysterious girl named <b>Alice Robyn</b>, to pose for her photo shoots for her photography coursework, needless to say, Amy was more than thrilled to take part, stating that it was only a matter of time. Of course, at that point poor Alice failed to realize how much the pink haired girl deserved a harsh slap. So, for most of the college year, Amy spent her free time dressing up and posing for Alice's photo shoots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring one fateful week however, the theme for the latest photo shoot was that of farm animals. The pair managed to find a spot in the mountains to decorate as a small farmyard. For a while, the photo shoot went on without a hitch, until Amy suddenly realized that she had forgotten to bring her pig costume. With this said, the girls decided to go on a break and go their separate ways before continuing. As Alice settled by her tripod, Amy decided to take a stroll across the mountain, where she stumbled upon an old abandoned shed, with the door ripped from its hinges. Peeking inside, Amy noticed something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an old face mask of a pig's face, made of some kind of rubber material, lying on the floor, standing out amongst the piles of old heap. The mask looked brand new, as if it was just put there less than an hour ago. As obnoxious as Amy was, she was also naive. Without taking any consequences into acknowledgment, she picked the mask up, proudly noticing a pair of jewels encrusted in the eye sockets, and put it over her face. Staring through the jewels, she was mesmerized by the almost magical view. This was a perfect find, such an astonishing trinket was perfect for her photo shoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with the mask over her face, she returned to finish her photo shoot. Alice noticed the mask, but in the end decided to keep her opinion to herself, preferring to finish her shoot before the sky went dark. At least in Amy's mind, the photo shoot was a success. As she returned home, she placed the mask aside and decided to call it an early night, unaware of the slightly altered tone of her skin.</span></div></div>",

Every year, all the young children would roam the streets, wearing ridiculous costumes, to knock on the doors of their neighbours and receive delicious treats. Every year in the college however, all the students are permitted to attend a costume party within the college grounds late at night. An annual event, this party was a highly anticipated event each and every year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour students, all close friends, were among the many who were excited about the late night costume party. <b>Rachael Ellis</b>, a tall, slim, outgoing beauty, arranged to meet her friends outside her house, where they planned to kill some time by going out into the streets for some trick or treating. Every year, they'd choose a theme to reflect their costumes around, and this year, they all dressed as different animals. While Rachael put together a sexy mouse outfit, wearing a tight one-piece outfit with a tail and matching makeup, <b>Sarah Gibbs</b>, an attractive scene kid, wore a thick, stuffed one-piece outfit with a fake elephant trunk and matching ears, much to Rachael's enjoyment. They were later joined by one of the brightest girls in college, the slightly pudgy <b>Hayley Watkins</b>, who was dressed up as a cow girl with a cow mask, black and white outfit and a beanbag sown to look like an utter, a costume that Hayley reluctantly agreed to wear, and later they were joined by <b>Phillipa Jones</b>, a bookworm with perhaps the widest hips in the entire college who normally wouldn't attend social activities like this, but for a change, decided to wear a cat suit with matching ears and makeup. With all four girls together, all dressed in their chosen costumes, it was time to begin trick or treating, in an attempt to pass some time before the annual costume party at the college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, it was pretty successful. Knocking on doors and receiving tasty treats was very nostalgic for them. The group of girls thoroughly enjoyed themselves, except for Hayley of course, who felt ridiculously uncomfortable in the outfit she threw together. Regardless however, they continued to kill the time, until they came across a strange old lady, considered by the neighbours as a hermit. They knocked on her door, but when she answered, she had a scowl on her face. \"You girls are far too old for this tradition,\" she hissed, \"You girls should get out of those silly costumes and go home!\" With that said, the creepy old woman slammed the door on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were disgusted. Something had to be done to sort this old bag out! That was when Sarah revealed the contents of her backpack. Inside, there were several eggs, all rotten and ready for use. Each girl grabbed a handful of eggs and began lobbing them at the old lady's house, like a group of hooligans. This would teach her to offend them, or so they thought. Unknown to the girls, while they were pelting the house with rotten eggs, the old lady conjured up a spell. It turned out that the old lady was, in fact, a witch and, in response to the girls' actions, she laid a curse on all four of them, a curse that they would soon suffer from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lobbing all of the rotten eggs at the house, the girls decided to pack it up and head off to the college, prepared to enjoy the festivities ahead. On their way to the college however, they noticed something strange.</span></div></div>",

Upon further inspection, it turned out to be a stray cat in someone's front garden, nothing to be concerned about, despite Rachael's odd behaviour around it, as if she was terrified of the sight of cats. Thinking nothing of it however, the four girls continued and, eventually, reached the college grounds. When they arrived, the party had already began. The music was blaring, the lights were flickering, and everyone involved wore colourful costumes. It seemed like a successful festivity, something that was quite rare in Dograb, considering all of the strange things that took place here, especially during annual events like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs predicted, Hayley Watkins, who was normally the least outrageous of the four, was hammered, and not far behind was Rachael Ellis, to the point where both girls even started to make out with each other. Meanwhile, Phillipa Jones started behaving like a cat, not because of the curse, but as a part of her drunken antics, and of course, Sarah Gibbs was trying to chat up some of the guys in attendance, me included! The strangest thing about it was that this was just a normal night out for the four girls!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the four girls reunited with each other in the main hall, where they noticed some peculiar changes. Phillipa poked Sarah's belly, noticing how thick and bloated it was, questioning how much sweets she ate that night. Hayley then informed the girls that she too was feeling abnormally bloated, mentioning how tight her costume had suddenly become. And finally, Phillipa pointed out that Rachael was strangely the same height as Hayley, which was odd, considering that she was supposed to be four inches taller than her. With these changes in mind, the four girls divided into two pairs and went their separate ways, puzzled by such odd alterations.</span></div></div>",

That's fine with me, I've got a story in mind that I think you might enjoy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bitter dispute with my girlfriend, Rebecca Keane, I got upset, and as a result, got drunk and cheated on her. Needless to say, we didn't speak to each other since, and somehow the word spread throughout the entire college, and soon all the students were glaring at me and gossiping behind my back, particularly the females. From the looks on their faces, I could tell that most of them would like nothing more than to punish me for my irrational behaviour. One fateful day however, while Rebecca was away on a two week holiday, their intentions were revealed. In college, a group of the girls, including <b>Hayley Watkins</b>, <b>Jessica Andrews</b> and <b>Rachael Ellis</b> approached me, sharing some kind of magic ring of ancient heritage. I didn't know who found the ring, where she found the ring or how she used the ring, but the ring was capable of completely transforming the form or shape of the desired target. The ring was capable of almost everything. With so much power in their possession, I could only imagine what kinds of punishment I was about to endure, and what sinister intentions these girls had in store for me. Regardless of what happened to me, I needed to figure out how to reverse the power of the ring before my girlfriend returned to take advantage. But were the girls willing to share such immense power?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't mean to render the last option pointless, but if you wish to disregard it for something a bit more personal, then perhaps this next scenario is more for you. As stated, after an argument with my girlfriend, one thing led to another, and I ended up cheating on her. The rumours quickly spread throughout the college and now most of the female students have vengeful intentions in mind. However, while Rebecca went off on a two week holiday abroad, things became a bit more complicated. On a Monday afternoon, during the final lecture of the day, I was given an anonymous note, warning me of what was to become of me the following morning. Of course, I was unaware that one of the girls was in possession of an ancient ring of tremendous power, capable of almost anything, until the wielder of the ring arrived in my house the following morning to begin my inevitable punishment. But what was this punishment? It was entirely up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's it for now, but don't worry, there's plenty more where that came from!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo would you like to follow this story, or would you prefer to follow a different story?</span></div></div>",

From the glares of my female peers, I could tell that they were planning something to do with me. Although, even if there was some sort of conspiracy against me, I understood why my female peers would conspire against me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weekend before, during a night out, I took part in a dispute with my girlfriend, Rebecca Keane. Upset by this, I wound up drunk, and as a result, I cheated on her. Everyone in the college found out about this, but as the rumours spread throughout, this turn of events was soon altered by Chinese whispers. There were rumours throughout college that I have done much worse actions in my drunken state. It was of no real surprise that some of my peers from college, particularly the females, would want to get their own back, just to teach me a lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed as if their plan was soon to unfold, but I could not envision what kind of punishment they had in store for me. Perhaps the only fortune in these days of regret was that Rebecca had left on holidays in Greece, and as a result, I did not have to see her for another two weeks. But I couldn't help but wonder if she was involved in this suspicious conspiracy theory, and if so, who would have the privilege to execute my punishment in her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until after first period that their plan started to unfold. As I wandered from the first lecture of the day, on my way to the restroom, I bumped into a group of the girls in the empty corridor, where there were no witnesses. Among them were <b>Hayley Watkins</b>, <b>Jessica Andrews</b>, <b>Rachael Ellis</b>, <b>Sarah Gibbs</b>, <b>Georgina Parr</b> and <b>Sophie Bennett</b>, all of them had malicious looks upon their faces, each more devious than the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surrounded me, their intentions at this point were still unclear, but I was terrified by what they had in store for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You thought you could get away with it, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to explain my actions, but none of them were listening to me. I used to consider some of these girls my closest friends, but this was a terrifying experience, being circle by a group of girls as if they were apart of some cult. I pleaded for mercy. That was when Rachael pulled out some kind of ring, presumably of ancient heritage. Wearing the ring on her finger, she pointed her fist at me. The diamond ring then started to glow an unearthly colour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will pay for what you've done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I was blinded by a bright beam of light that shot from the diamond. My vision was impaired, but I could feel my body undergoing several changes. I couldn't tell what was happening to me, but as the power of the ring coursed through my altered body, I could hear the cackles of the girls responsible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the light faded, and I regained my senses, but when I came to, I was horrified by the outcome.</span></div></div>",
