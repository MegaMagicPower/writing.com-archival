She couldn't even talk to him without fainting! And Naruto was far to dense to notice anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Hinata would have to find some way to tell him, but how, she could never just walk up to him and say it to his face. What was she to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as she walked down the street, something caught her eye. For there, in the window of a story she was passing, was a heart shaped box filled with delicious candy. 'It's perfect,' thought Hinata with a simle on her face. 'I'll start slowly, by giving him gifts, signed \"From your Secret Admirer\" in order to get his attention, before telling him to him to his face. And what better present for someone who loves to eat as much as Naruto than candy and sweets!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd soon afterwards, we find Hinata leaving what could be the first of many treats for Naruto to find.</span></div></div>",

He exited the stairs as he pulled them out, having reached his floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?\" Naruto muttered in surprise as he saw what was outside his door. Or to be more accurate, what was trying to conceal his door. For there in front of his door was a small mountain of heart-shaped candy boxes, topped with a small red letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, having recovered from his shock, turned to said letter for answers. Unfolding it, Naruto was met with<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear Naruto,<br>\r\nI know that you are sweeter then all these sweets put together, but I still hope that you will be pleased with them none the less.<br>\r\nYour Secredt Admirer\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome, I knew that eventually someone would realize how great I am. I can't wait to meet them and thank them for all this stuff,\" Naruto said as he started carting the candy in, setting it all on his table. And with that Naruto opened the first of the many boxes and put one of the candies in his mouth. \"Oh, man, this stuff is great.\" And with that, Naruto began to devour the candy, relishing their deliciousness.<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Naruto growned, having already eaten the first few boxes and beginning to get slightly sick of the candy. Naruto was about to stop when a thought occured to him, 'Whoever did this really went to a lot of trouble. If it were me, then I'd probably be hurt if I did all of this for someone, only for them to not finish it. If someone was nice enough to give me all of these, then the least I can do is to finish them.' And with his resolve steelled, Naruto ate one of the many candies still to come.<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\nLater, Naruto heaved himself out of his chair, one hand on his distended stomach, and slowly made his way to his bed to digest.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto was not very happy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day after the first treats arrived he'd been overjoyed that someone out there liked him even if he felt a little sick from all the chocolate.  The second day the treats arrived he'd scunched up his nose but been excited.  He'd taken the treats inside and throughtout the night munched on them, the taste not nearly as good as the day before, but still alright.  He'd skipped dinner to eat them ALL.  He'd waited a long time for someone to like him after all...  The third day he searched around for the mysterious person, took the candies in, and reluctantly ate all of those as well.  His stomache severely protested the large amount of sugar, but he would not dissapoint the person.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the week Naruto really hated chocolate.  Staring at the pretty little boxes Naruto inwardly groaned, but outwardly smiled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really wish I could talk to the NICE and WONDERFUL person whose giving me these.\" Naruto called out loudly, peering around and hoping that the person heard him.  When no response came he sighed and brought the treats inside.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside Naruto placed them on the table and gingerly sat down.  His stomach turned at the sight of them but... He opened up the first one and forced it past his lips.  And then the next and the next.  He went around his apartment, doing chores, and popping one into his mouth every time he went past.  He'd gained a few past the last week, but since his clothes were so baggy they were hardly noticeable.  By the fourth box of chocolates his stomach told him he was full, but Naruto promptly told it to shut up.  By the fifth box his stomach was a small tight, hard ball.  By the sixth and final box Naruto was sitting at the kitchen table and forcing the last of the choclate down his throat.  The last piece felt more like a rock than soft chocolate.  Naruto heaved himself out of the chair and moved unsteadily to bed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second week his secret admiree started giving him deserts.  Monday he recieved a pie.  Tuesday a batch of brownies.  Wenseday a large plate of fudge.  Thurday box of large double chocolate cookies.  Friday came a large order of sweet dango.  Saturday he was treated to the site of a strawberry cake and Sunday a chocolate one.  As Naruto forced the last of the chocolate cake past his lips he felt a great strain on his pants as they tried to hold in his gut.  Naruto undressed with great relief and waddled his overstuffed belly to the bed.  Laying down he triend to sleep it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next mornig Naruto found himself in a rather bad     situation.  Naruto ripped his pants up as far as they would go and pulled and tugged on them but couldn\u2019t button up his pants.  Naruto fought hard with them, the tightness very painful on his rather bloated body parts.  The blonde frowned down at his body before sucking in as hard as he could and quickly pulling on the pants to button them up.  It worked, but it was painful, and when he had to breath eout his stomach pushed harshly against the straining clothes.  He then went to put his mesh shirt on\u2026 stuffing himself into and forcing the zipper up painfully.  Naruto sighed loudly and threw on his jacket\u2026 which thankfully still hid his girth. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhen he returned to his apartment that afternoon he nearly groan when  a very lovely batch of chocolate muffins sat at his doorstep.  Naruto carefully bent over and brought them inside.  Robotically he brought one after the other up to his mouth and shoved it in.  By the seventh muffin the strain on his pants forced the button to rip off and zipper to come undone.  Naruto sighed in relief even with the mournful thought of how much weight he\u2019d gained.  BUT he would NOT disappoint whoever was being so nice to him.  He would not hurt their feelings!  Naruto shoved the next one in and the next one.  His stomach hardened with how full it was, but he still kept at it.  Naruto had to take his shirt off because the tightness was making it too difficult to breath.  All night long, when he thought he could stand even a bite, he took it.  When he finally looked down at the last muffin he didn\u2019t even care that his stomach really hurt, he simply picked it up and stuffed it into his mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following week his pants wouldn\u2019t even go up to his waist.  He was forced to buy new pants.  His mesh shirts no longer zipped at all. It was becoming apparent that his jacket was getting too small for his as well.  Towards the end of the month Naruto stood in front of the full length mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was not very happy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis orange jacket was being difficult.  Naruto forced the two sides to some together, barely connecting it and struggling with zipping it up.  He\u2019d gained a whopping\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hello there.\"<br>\r\n     The thirteen year old Naruto looked around, seeing no one but himself was any where in the area, he turned back and tilted his head in confusion at the pretty girl before him.  She was an inch or so taller than him, long white hair reaching down her back, and beautiful purple eyes that gazed back at him happily.  She was pretty.  She appeared nice.  And she was willingly talking to the outcast of konoha.  The light eighty-five pound genin didn't know what to think.  Naruto immediately knew something was wrong, but non the less, smiled at her in return.<br>\r\n     \"Hello?\" He answered, quite unsure of himself.  No girl willingly talked to him, not with his hidious whisker like scars across his face and bad reputation, especially when Uchiha Sasuke was inthe facility.  Sasuke wasn't any where to be seen though and she was talking to him.  She gave him a huge smile, a blush lightly covering her cheeks, and seemed to be trying to get up the courage to say something.  <br>\r\n     \"I... I think your cute!\" She cried out suddenly.  Naruto nearly had a heart attack, alarm bells going off, as he stared at her in utter shock.  She hurried on quickly to explain herself.  \"I moved here a few months ago and you pass by my family's shop every day... and I've been wanting to ask you out on a date!  So... will you go out with me tonight?\" She asked loudly.  Naruto blushed horribly, nodding his head, though still weary.  <br>\r\n     \"Um.. but... Whats your name?\" Naruto asked curiously.  <br>\r\n     \"Oh, how stupid of me! I'm Sana.\"  The girl introduced herself hurriedly.  <br>\r\n     \"It's nice to meet you Sana, my name is...\" Naruto started, despite his caution he was excited to meet someone who apparently liked him right off the bat.  It was refreshing and nice.  \"...Naruto Uzumaki the greatest prankster and savior from the scary Sand nin Gaara!\" Sana finished excitedly.  \"I've heard a whole bunch of stories about you Uzumaki-san!\" Sana said with a squeal of excitement.  Naruto blushed horribly, pleasantly surprised that it was a negative story she'd heard about him, and smiled warmly at her. <br>\r\n    \"Just call me Naruto and I woudn't say saviour exactly.\" Naruto said with a laugh.  <br>\r\n     \"Alright Naruto, why don't you come to my grandmothers restaurant tonight, called the Lamplighter?\" She asked.<br>\r\n     \"I'll be there!\" Naruto told her, happiness bubbling over, he'd never been asked to hang out with anyone before after all.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------<br>\r\n     Naruto entered the restaurant temptatively, but relaxed when the elderly women smiled at him, rather than toss him out immediately.  Perhaps people's minds about him were finally changing, Naruto could only hope that was the truth, before scanning the rather large restaurant.  Sana waved at him fromt the back of the restaurant, smiling broadly, dressed in a beautiful long sleeved black dress.  Naruto himself had simply chosen to leave his weapons, ninja headband, and orange jacket behind.  His orange pants along with his simple black net shirt was something that Sakura had once said was 'presentable.'  Naruto excitedly sat down across from the beautiful Sana who was, as Naruto gaged her to be, maybe a year older than himself.  He didn't understand how someone so beautiful could actually want to go out with someone like him, but he wasn't going to argue.  <br>\r\n     \"Guess what Naruto?!\" She asked, eyes bright with mischief.<br>\r\n     \"What?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n     \"My grandmother is having some huge political members and their families of Fire country's capital eat here and she needs a couple people to try out some of her new plates and deserts and I got her to let us do it!\"  Sana said with a flourish of her arms.  Naruto grinned back at her.  \"Thats really cool!\" Naruto admitted.  He'd never done anything like this before.  None of his friends ever invited him over to their families place and none of them had ever wanted to hang out with him and on top of that she actually was offering all the food he could eat to help out her family?  How utterly fricking cool.  A kind elderly man, who Sana introduced as her grandfather, brought out a couple of drinks.  \"Tastetesters,\" the old man said, \"of some new drinks to offer on the menu.\"  Naruto grinned and took a huge sip as the man watched, not wanting to do it half heartedly for fear of insulting the man, and nodded happily at the great taste.  \"I think you have a keeper.\" Naruto told that man honestly.  The old man grinned.  \"I think so too.\"  And suddenly after drinking the odd but good tasting flavor Naruto felt a sudden utter emptiness in his stomach.    <br>\r\n     For the next two hours Sana's grandparents brought out deserts after deserts and trays of appetizers and platters of food, all of which Naruto would try and tell them what he thought of it, he was having so much fun that he didn't notice that Sana barely tried any of the foods.  He didn't notice that he ate more than was strickly tolerable of each 'tastetester' or that his stomach started to hurt after the first forty-five minutes.  This was due to the fact that no matter how many bites he took the empty feeling in his stomach that came with the drink wouldn't go away.  He finally noticed how much he'd gorged on when he felt a strange tightness and looked down.  His net shirt, which had been slightly loose at the beginning of the meal was stretched tight over his overstuffed stomach, it would be difficult to pull off.  Naruto blushed and stopped mid bite, even though his stomach still felt strangely empty, he put the bite of pie back onto his plate.  Sana was looking at him with a smile on her face.  \"Whats wrong Naruto?\" She asked lightly.  Naruto shrugged, the motion forcing his overstuffed stomach to move up, causing him to wince in pain.  <br>\r\n     \"I ate waaaaay too much,\" Naruto said with a laugh, \"thank you so much for tonight Sana.  I've never had so much fun and all the food was great.  Your grandparents are awsome cooks.\"  Naruto looked at the clock on the wall, it was already pretty late, the long hand nearly at ten.  \"I think I'm gonna head home now though, I'll see you tommorow in front of your shop okay?  Then I can treat you to ramen at this cool place I know?\" Naruto asked, trying to keep the hope out of his voice, he really liked talking to her.  She smiled and stood up, standing behind him and hugging him, her hand wandering down to his stomach and keeping it there for some strange reason.  Naruto turned his head a bit to look at her, idly wondering if she thought he was fat after his strange gorging session, after all he didn't normally eat nearly that much.<br>\r\n     \"Can I ask you something Naruto?\"<br>\r\n     \"Sure, what is it?\"<br>\r\n     \"How would you get rid of a person for a certan period of timethat could pose a problem for your plans?\"<br>\r\n     \"Sorry... what?\"<br>\r\n     \"By forcing them to gain enough weight as to be useless until they lose it.\"<br>\r\nA cloth covered in a strong odor suddenly flew over his mouth.  Naruto tried to stand but the moment he attempted to he felt unbalaced and lost conciousness.              </span></div></div>",

He never showed up for team missions and when Kakashi Hatake's team searched they coudln't find him any where! The landowner said Naruto never showed up at her door to pay rent last night.\"  Shizune said, shaken.<br>\r\n\"Get a four man cell headed by an Inuzuka to search for him immediately!\" Tsunade demanded.  She would not lose her grandson figure so easily.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------<br>\r\n\"You certainly handled my grandfathers concoction well demon.\"<br>\r\n     Naruto groaned and inwardly scolded himself for falling for such an obvious trick.  Really.  Someone being nice to him?  How could he have been so stupid.  Naruto blurrily opened his eyes, feeling something odd in his mouth, and noticing that his hands were chained tightly behind his back and to the wall while his ankles held the same treatment to the floor.  Then he noticed his stomach.  There was a tiny layer of flab just over the edge of his pants where there wasn't any before.  His net shirt was slightly tighter than when he first put it on last night.  Normally Naruto ate more than a normal person because the Kyuubi burned him out so easily with his massive chakra straining the blondes system.  Naruto had insanely fast metabolysm and if he didn't eat enough Kyuubi's chakra would start hurting him.  Now, however, he coudln't feel the Kyuubi's powerful chakra at all.  <br>\r\n     \"Its the chakra colar around your neck dear, Kyuubi won't be able to touch your energy for a while, all the food you eat will automatically be turned to fat thanks to my grandfathers special concotion thats dropping into your stomach as we speak through the tube in your mouth.\" A female voice answered easily.  Naruto jumped and looked up at the voice.  It belonged to Sana, but instead of a fourteen year old girl, a young women of about twenty four stood before him.  She bent down and pinched his cheek.  \"Pretty soon you won't be able to fit those clothes any more little one.\"  Sana said happily.  Naruto cringed.  <br>\r\n     \"Why are you doing this?\" Naruto asked, near tears.  Sana smiled and motioned with her hands to the door where a man stepped out, rolling in a huge trolly of fattening foods.  Naruto felt the emptiness in his stomach roaring at him to eat it, but he stubbornly looked away now that he knew it was because of the drink.  <br>\r\n     \"Due to the fact that your a Jinchuuriki your the only one in this village with the ability to stop me from assasinating those politicians I told you about.\"  Sana answered simply, giving no further information.<br>\r\n     \"Why not just keep me locked up then or beat me into unconciousness?  Why do... this of all things?\"  Naruto asked.<br>\r\n     Sana laughed merrily, never once losing the sparkle in her eyes, before answering him.  \"Whose to say you won't escape?  If we beat you, you can simply heal yourself with your ability, this way even if you escape before my plan is underway you won't be able to do anything.  You won't be use to the weight, you'll be unbalanced and slow, not even Kyuubis' influence will do much for you.  We didn't want to kill you after all, just get you out of the way for a short period of time, you'll be able to lose the weight... eventually.  Not to mention you make quite the entertainment for me.\"  Sana answered before picking up a large piece of cake.  \"I've only got about a week and a half to fatten your ass up so open wide.\" Sana said.<br>\r\n     Naruto turned his head away, keeping his mouth tightly shut, desperately trying to ignore the concoctions pull.  Sana merely shrugged and signaled to the man still in the room.  The servent bent down and forcefully opened Naruto's mouth, shoving it far enough that if Naruto didn't chew he woudl choke, and that was all that was needed before Naruto lost to the desire the drink instilled in him.  the first piece of the large cake was nothing.  The second was easy and so was the third, forth and fifth piece of the monster cake.  Piece number six was also fairly simple to get done as well as the seventh.  Number eight though was hard and Naruto struggled a bit against it.  She simply nodded and told him she would be back in an hour when the food settled.  The trolley was left there though.  \"Normally my grandfathers concoction forces people to eat till they pass out, you've got quite a strong will demon.\"  With that Sana left.<br>\r\n     In an hours time his body felt as if it were starving, no doubt thanks to the tube spilling liqid in his gut, but even so when Sana returned Naruto once more fought against the first piece of desert.  The gorging continued easily enough after that though and this time he was able to eat more, finishing off the monster cake at ten pieces, a total of eighteen pieces in the span of three hours.  Naruto felt the net shirt on him tight again.  And so the pattern continued until by the end of the day Naruto had been force fed the entire trolley.  It was hard to breath, he felt like he might pop, but still that empty feeling remained.  Sana pressed a switch in her hand and smiled knowingly.  \"I've turned off the gorging concotion for tonight, any more food or liqid and you'd die, but don't worry.  My grandfather is an expert on torture and anatomy so he knows just how far to push a human body before it can't take anymore.  You'll be ready again by mid morning tomorrow.\"  Sana said quietly.  Naruto felt tears ride down his cheeks.  He felt disgusting and everything about him hurt.  Sana noticed and bent down, her hand once more touching his incredibly bloated stomach, before rubbing it slightly.  \"You'll look cute so severely fattened.  Don't worry, you'll eventually get used to the feeling.\"<br>\r\n     The second day, half way through the food that Sana was forcing down his throat, he felt his net shirt finally tighten to full capacity.  The bulge of his stomach fat barely being held in the small shirt but incapable of rising up over his already stuffed stomach.  Naruto turned his head away again, but Sana snapped her fingers and one of the two male servants that worked for her forced his mouth open once more.  \"Nah ah Naruto, I want to see that shirt of yours rip open, then well work on doing the same to your pants tommorow.\" Sana said.  Tears ran down his face as Sana picked up a large piece of fudge and shoved it into his mouth, her hand forcing his mouth shut as far as it would go with the tube there, and forcing him to swallow.  She looked dissapointed when the shirt didn't rip and sighed.  \"I think I over did it a bit this hour.  I'll come back in two hours then.\" Sana said as she left the room.<br>\r\n     When she came back, as she promised she would, she was even more vicious than before.  She placed a pie in front of her and scoop up a full handfull in her hand, shoving the whole handfull in his mouth, watching the net with obsessed eyes.  Sana continued this until half the pie was gone and a tiny rip, right over his belly button, formed in the shirt causing Naruto to practically cry in relief.  \"Finally, I was beginning to think that damn shirt was made out of elastic.\" Sana said with a laugh.  Naruto looked down at himself, his gut was now officially hanging over his pants, which he coudl already feel the tightness of.  Naruto sputtered in surprise when another handfull of pie was shoved down his throat.  \"Still a long way to go.\" Sana said, still in her sweet tone of voice.  God did he feel sick.  The trolley still had a batch of cup cakes on it and a bowl of pudding.<br>\r\n     In the middle of the third day Naruto sat uncomfortably on the stone floor, eyes trained on the stone hard stomach that was extended a good three inches in front of him now, and felt the horrible tightness of his pants.  His shirt was now ripped all the way to the colar and was laying beside him as Sana finally had the mercy of removing it after she had her fun.  That wasn't saying much though since she wanted to put a new shirt on him today and see how long it took that one to rip.  The chians that fastened him to the wall and floor allowed him on a few inches of movement.  Naruto tried to get up, but the effort was useless, it was like he was wearing lifting weights on his body, he supposed in a way he was.  Not to mention his body ached horribly.  What would his friends think when they saw his tubby ass?  If he even got out of here alive.  Sana walked in then, with a large smile on her face and a white shirt that didn't quite look like it would fit.  She'd been thoughtful when picking though for it had zippers on the sleeves and done the middle so that they wouldn't even need to unchain him to put it on.  With the help of her two servents, and much useless struggling on Naruto's part, the shirt was tugged vicsiously on.  Without preamble she placed a rather large pile of donuts in front of them.  \"Let's start!\"<br>\r\n     On the morning of the forth day her servents brought in a scale and Naruto cringed.  The two guards lugged him to his feet and helped support the blonde and the weight he was unused to.  She smiled wickedly as she forced him onto the scale.  Naruto 'almost' fainted when he saw the number. 125.  Sana grinned like a mad man.  \"Relax. Each of the chains your wearing, on your ankles and wrists, each weigh ten pounds each.  Your only at 105 but still... thats twenty pounds in three days.\" Sana said thoughtfully.  \"Quite a lot for someone with your frame and we still have seven days left...\"  Sana said with a clap of her hands.  Naruto just stared in stunned horror.  Chouji was nearly four inches taller than him at 120.  By the end of the day Naruto felt his pants rip along his theighs.  Sana was extatic.  Naruto spent the night screaming in pain.<br>\r\n________________________________________________<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \"What do you mean you can't find him?\"  Tsunade screamed at the terrofied ambu who she called in when the chuunin team failed to find her surrogate grandson.  One of the more brave men among the group stepped forward.  \"There's no trace of the boy any where my lady.  It's like he simply dissapeared out of thin air.\"  Tsunade swore, beside her Kakashi wore a grim expression, not at all looking forward to informing his two students of the frightening news.  Naruto had been missing for six days and there was still no sign of him.  <br>\r\n________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Naruto screamed again as he turned his head away from her, tears leaking from his eyes, as he once more tried to bite through the tube going down his throat.  His throat hurt so much.  He felt the pants covering his ass, which had been painfully tight for the last twenty-four hours, break.  He felt so heavy now, his stomach could move in a different direction than the rest of his body now, there was no way he'd be able to stand on his own.  The zippers of the white shirt was digging harshly into his skin, causing the skin underneath to be raw, and in some areas bloody.  The cuffs behind him were soaked with his blood from his struggling and they were beginning to cut off his circulation due to his now fat wrists.  It was the seventh day and earlier that morning when they weighed him he was at 132 in weight. <br>\r\n     One of the servents pushed him against the wall while the other forced his mouth open again, tilting his head back all the way, Sana shoved a funnel piece into the boy's mouth.  Naruto tried desperately to pull away and spit the thing out, but that worked as well as chewing through the tube idea.  Sanna walked over to the trolley and picked up a large bottle of hersheys chocolate syrup, unscrewing the lid and walked over, before pouring it down the funnel.  Naruto coughed and sputtered, but Sanna only slowed down enough that he wouldn't choke.  Naruto's entire body protested against consuming any more food, the bloated thing attached to him screaming in pain as it rubbed harshly against the unrelenting white cloth, Naruto refused to call the monster that hid his feet from his view his body.  Tears leaked out again as the last of the body was dumped into the funnel and the thing was taken out of his mouth for a moment.  \"Please,\" Naruto whispered hoarsely, \"please just kill me.  I've never done anything wrong to you so please kill me.\"  <br>\r\n     Sana laughed, the sound filling the entire room, as her fingers gently held Naruto's chin which now had a second smaller layer of fat under it.  \"I told you that you would look cute severely fattened and I was right.  Truthfully I was going to stop at this point, because lets face it, there's no way you'll be able to move for at least a week in your current state.  Your frame was never meant to be this big and your body can't handle it.  I want to see how much fatter I can get you in the next three days though.  It's stuck in my mind now.\"  Sana shoved the funnel back down Naruto's mouth, the servents chuckling before she reached out and grabbed another full bottle of chocolet syrup.  Naruto's severely bloated belly painfully pushed against the white shirt and ripped open the zipper.  Naruto screamed.<br>\r\n     On the ninth day Naruto's stomach swayed from side to side as the two man servents forced him to his feet with difficulty.  Naruto barely noticed, having gone silent after begging for his death, and didn't even notice much as his feet were forced onto the scale.  Naruto's eyes automatically minused twenty pounds from the number, so used to this daily ritual was he now, and shuddered.  143 pounds.  He was a short 13 year old weighing 143 pounds.  He'd gained 58 pounds in nine days.  He was 23 pounds heavier than even Chouji and four inches shorter.  He felt as if he was going to break the ground with his weight.  At this point he hoped to god that no one ever found him.  The humiliation itself would send him to his grave any way.  \"Tommorow is the assasination.  Then I leave Konoha forever, and you get your freedom tommorow night, if you can walk out of here that is.\" Sana said with a chuckle.  \"We have 24 hours ahead of us though and before this ride is over I want to see if I can make your fat ass hit 150.\"  Sana announced before ushering one of her servents into the room with a trolley loaded with food on it, there was more food there than the previous few days, Naruto silently shuddered again.<br>\r\n     Sana gingerly let her finger cross a large cake that sat atop the trolley before taking the entire thing and set it down in front of Naruto, who'd been forced to the ground again, and whose large round belly shifted at the movement.  One of the men forced Naruto's mouth open as Sana shoved the piece of cake into it.  She'd give him large clothes tonight before she left, let him keep a tiny piece of his dignity, and break the light bulb.  Before that though the boy needed to gain seven more pounds...     <br>\r\n       <br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     Tsunade slapped the assasin across the face the moment she entered the room.  She was livid.  In the middle of her search for Naruto, the Hokage recieved news of the death of all sixteen political figures under her watch, within the hotels on the South side of Konoha.  Right now the white haired assasin sat chained to a chair in the middle of interogation room.  An anbu squad stationed around the room and Ibiki directly behind the Hokage.  The white haired women smiled softly in reply to the stinging red mark on her cheek.  \"I never would have thought you'd have an anbu squad stationed at the end of the sewer system.\" The women said softly.  Tsunade smirked.  <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n\"Did you really believe that you'd be able to massacre our diplomats and get away with it?\" Tsunade demanded. <br>\r\n     <br>\r\nThe white haired women had the adacity to laugh.  Her voice boomed loudly through out the room, many of the anbu shifted uncomfortably from their positions, Tsunade just glared.  \"Oh the tables have turned, who would have guessed that I would be in the same position as him.\"  The white haired women whispered softly to herself.  Tsunade growled and slapt the women again.  \"Who hired you to kill them?\" Tsunade snapped.  Ibiki stepped forward and cleared his throat. <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n\"As much as I appreciate your brilliant work as an... interrogater, i think your time would be better spent searching for Naruto, Hokage-sama.  I'll take care of the woman.\"  Ibiki said sternly.  The white haired women began to laugh hysterically.  Tsunade turned on her heel, angrily grinding her teeth as she left the room, the worry over Naruto's sudden dissapearance was driving her nerves on end.  Then the women spoke.  \"Tell me Ibiki-kun, what type of techniques do you use when torturing prisoners?  My technique was very effective.\" <br>\r\n     <br>\r\nTsunade stopped, something was bothering her about the women's words, she turned to see Ibiki frowning at the women.  \"So you admit to having prisoners?\" Ibiki asked sternly.  She laughed.  \"Only one prisoner.  His chakra would have nullified the only seals within my knowledge to be able to pass by undetected of even anbu.\" The women whispered with a snicker.  \"I had to keep that awful dark chakra of his locked up somehow.\"  Tsunade completely lost it.  Chakra seeped easily into her fist as she slammed it into the women's chest.  The sound of cracking ribs filled the air as the womens chair flew off its feet and slammed against the ground.  As a jinchuuriki, albit a thirteen year old, Naruto's chakra was large enough that the mere residue of his chakra nullified hidden enemy chakra around the villages city district.  This fact was a secret known only to the anbu, Naruto and Hokage herself though, so the fact that this women knew about Naruto's ability was terrifying.  <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n\"Where is Naruto?!\" Tsunade hissed out through clenched teeth.  The women laughed wetly, turning her head and spitting blood from between cracked lips.  \"In quite a bit of pain actually, the poor dear didn't enjoy his time with me at all, I had a lot of fun though.\" She said lightly, grinning impishly up at the infuriated women.  \"About three days ago Naruto-kun was even begging me to kill him.  He couldn't take the pain anymore.\" The women said from her position on the floor.  A foot slammed down harshly on the white haired womens throat the moment those words escaped.  <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n\"Tsunade!  If you kill her we may never find him!\"  Ibiki called, pulling the blonde women away.  Tsunade brushed her hair out of her face, eyes glaring with hatred at the gasping women on the floor.  \"I'll... I'll tell you where... he is... if you... cough... if you talk to me alone without... anbu.\"  The women said through a bloody grin.  Ibiki shook his head at his Hokage.  \"Give me a few hours and I'll have her begging for mercy.\" Ibiki whispered.  Apparently not quietly enough though.  <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n\"Except there's a memory seal on my body.  Whether I have chakra or not I can activate it, and all of my memories will be gone, including Naruto's location.\" The women stated simply.  Tsunade hesitated for only a moment before silently raising her arm.  The anbu instantly dissapeared.  Ibiki hesitated, giving his Hokage a stern glare, before the women spoke again.  \"Bring one person you trust with Naruto-kuns life.  Our deal will need two people.\" The women whispered.  Tsunade considered it and nodded.  <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n\"Ibiki, bring me Kakashi, and tell him to make it quick.\" Tsunade said loudly.  Ibiki too faded out to obey.  <br>\r\n_____________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     When Kakashi entered the room he had to restrain himself from butchering the women.  Ten days ago.  Ten long days Naruto had been missing and to be mere feet from the women who caused and not be able to do anything was unbelievably frustrating.  At some point Tsunade had yanked the women's chair back up and into position, the women herself in the center of the room, directly in front of the criminal.  \"He's here.\" Tsunade snapped.  \"So what is this deal?\" The women smiled softly.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n\"Simple really.  Freedom for freedom.  You two will wear microphones around your neck; one of you will go with me to the edge of the fire nation border while the other will be directed to Naruto's location.  There are four seal doors to an underground chamber to get to Naruto while there are five chakra chains on me.  The closer I get to the border the closer you get to Naruto.  We will sign it in blood so that if one foresakes the other in this deal the three of us, and by extention four of us, will die.  I don't know about the rest of you, but I certainly want to live.  Is this acceptable?\"  The white haired women asked.  Kakashi met Tsunade's eyes and nodded.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n\"Tell me something first.  How do we know that Naruto isn't dead?\" Kakashi asked, eyes cold.  The women smirked at him.  \"I was part of a smaller division of Konoha anbu so we both know Naruto isn't dead.  The reason I didn't consider it and the reason I tortured him the way i did was in order to keep the fox from reacting.  As long as Naruto's LIFE isn't in danger, meaning wounded or dying, then the fox refuses to help Naruto.  An interesting and dire weakness for a Jinchuuriki who has a creative enemy.  Naruto is alive and I will tell you exactly what I've done to him, but first you must sign to secure my life.  Afterward you hear what I've done you probably will be far less willing to make this deal.\"  The white haired women said softly.  Both Tsunade and Kakashi's eyes narrowed at the women, fingers twitching to snap her neck at the mere implication of what she might mean, before stilling it with the sombering thought that Naruto's life was in their hands.    <br>\r\n     <br>\r\nTsunade quickly drew up the blood contract in a matter of minutes, allowing the lowly criminal to inspect it to her hearts desire, before the three of them signed it.  The criminals hands, that were now untied due to the need to sign in her own blood and signature, lay in her lap in a peaceful way that drove both Tsunade and Kakashi to clench their own hands.  \"I would like you to look at it from my point of view.\" The white haired women began.  \"I could not kill him nor wound him for fear of Kyuubi reacting and alerting you.  I am incapable of using genjutsu or mind jutsus so harming his mentality was strictly impossible.  So how do you cause a person a great deal of horrible pain without wounding them physically or emotionally?  It was quite a dilemma for some time.  What pain could I inflict on him horrible enough to make it impossible to move or escape without the option of actually threatening their life?  I'll admit that my technique brought Naruto close to death nearly every night...\" At this Kakashi growled angrily, wanting to throttle the women, and beside him Tsunade was in just as bad shape.  \"However, I found a way to do it without alarming the fox.  You see the fox is a being made out of chakra whose only concern over his body is physical wounds.  He doens't need food or water to keep him alive and thus doens't understand nor care about the suject enough to interfere in any way with his Jinchuuriki in this area.\" The women said triumphantly.  Kakashi really didn't understand where the women was getting with all of this, but Tsunade seemed to have a light of understanding, there was still confusion there though.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n\"So the fox doesn't understand the concept of starvation,\" Tsunade said quietly, her face paling.  The womens laughter was as loud as thunder in Kakashi's ears.  Still, he coudlnt' help but feel a tiny drop of relief.  He'd read the thirds description of Naruto's childhood and knew Naruto was very much used to starvation.  It was still a horrible thing that infuriated him and he would no doubt crush anyone in his way to save his student, but he knew Naruto could recover from something like this.  The smile though, the smile on the women's face seemed to be laughing at them.  <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n\"Tsunade, what type of body would you say Naruto has?\" The criminal asked.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n\"Small, he's the smallest of all our genin.\" Tsunade answered wearily.  The smile grew.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n\"Tell me, what fun would starving an already obviosu starved child be?\" The criminal asked, grin widening.  And then Kakashi's leader did something that he never thought she'd do in front of the enemy.  She vomited... a lot.  Tsunade's legs gave out beneath her and Kakashi swiftly caught the women before all her dignity was out the window.  Her hands were shaking horribly.  Kakashi was terrified now.  What had the women done to Naruto that would send a Kage into such a state at the mere thought?<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\"You...\" Tsuande whispered, completely horrified, \"You force fed him?\"  The criminals smile became positively insane.  Kakashi choked back on his own bile.  His little Naruto had been force fed?  To near death?  It was one of the worst tortures imaginable.  To have your body feel as if it was tearing itself out from the inside and to have food still being shoved down your throat was a torture rarely used because of the sheer inhumanity of it.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n\"It was so much fun to watch him kick and fight against me, to see him scream and sob and then beg for death, and to still keep on going.  What an entertaining person to fatten up.  It really woudlnt' have been nearly as entertaining if the kid hadn't been practically starving.\" The criminal said with a laugh.  Tsunade nearly attacked the woman, but Kakashi managed to just keep the deadly fist out of reach.  Barely.  He felt incredibly sick himself.  Tsunade turned her head away, visibly trying to collect herself before nodding to Kakashi to show that she was alright.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n\"How... how much did you... force him to gain?\" Tsunade asked quietly, her medical part of her brain insisting she needed to know.  The woman giggle and suddenly Kakashi found himself not wanting to know.  She held up her hand and spread out her fingers so that all ten of them were showing.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n\"I had ten days with the boy Tsunade, and I drove him to near death every... single... night, he packed on a lot.\" She said through fits of giggles.  Kakashi coudlnt' hear any more, he walked to the corner and vomited, before slowly wiping his mouth.  'Oh god, Naruto!' Kakashi thought in horror.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n\"How much?\" Tsunade gritted out.  Tears were fighting to pour from her eyes as she mentally went through the horror his body had endured through this ten day force feeding.  Naruto's body was small and to add weight like she was suggesting she'd done meant Naruto's body was badly damaged by it.  Depending on how much she'd forced him to eat and how much weight he'd gained from it Naruto woudln't be able to walk until the damage was fixed.  The women laughed hysterically, filling the chamber with her loud, insane noise.  <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n\"I forced Naruto to gain sixty-six pounds,\" The white haired woman yelled.  Kakashi vomited again.  Tsunade fell to her knees in shocked horror.  The damage would be tremedous to the boy's body.  Naruto simply wasn't meant to have a body that heavy.  They would be lucky if Naruto could 'stand' for a while much less 'walk.'   Kakashi glared at the women still sitting in the chair with hatred.  'If I ever see you again after this day you will die a slow painful death.' Kakashi vowed.<br>\r\n_____________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi followed the instructions he was given through the radio relayed by Tsunade as he moved further underground.  It had been twenty five miles from Konoha, but still within the mountains.  At the moment he was in one of them, listening in as he made his way through the first three sealed doors, and into a dungeon like area with dozens of locked cells.  Kakashi counted down the numbers, as instructed, until he found himself in front of a large door labeled fifteen.  \"I'm in front of the fourth seal door now and awaiting further instructions.\"  Kakashi relayed over the radio.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi heard the sound of feet shuffling and murmurs from the other end.  \"She says that its a combination seal.  You must press your hands up to the door, channel chakre through it, and then twist the seal rings in a certain order.  Are you ready for me to relay the order?\" Tsunade asked quietly.  Naruto was behind this door, they were both tense, and filled with deadly hope that Naruto was alright.  \"Yes.\" Kakashi replied back calmly.  First ring turn left three times... second ring turn left two times... third ring turn right once... fourth ring turn left three times... press your hand firmly into the center circle.  It should be open now...\"  Kakashi opened the prison door wide and stepped inside, the bulb was broken, the cell cast in darkness.  \"Is he there?\" Tsunade's voice asked, obviously tense with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto?\" Kakashi gently called.  A figure leaning against the wall on the opposite side shifted and moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ka... Kakashi?\" Naruto's voice spoke out of the darkness in a hoarse, broken whisper.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here Naruto.\" Kakashi said as he rushed over.  Naruto began to sob.   <br>\r\n         <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Don't touch me! Please... don't touch me!\" Naruto's broken voice came out of the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi stopped moving toward the blonde, instead stopping several feet in front of him, and crouching down.  \"It's okay Naruto, it's me Kakashi, I'm here to get save you.\" Kakashi whispered to the dark corner.  A choked sob echoed from the darkness and Kakashi had to force himself to not race over to him immediately.  \"Please Naruto, let me help you, I'll take you to the hospital.\" Kakashi said softly, hoping he sounded reassuring.  After such horrible torture Kakashi wasn't sure what state of mind Naruto was in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kashi... I... sniffle... I don't think... I can walk.\"  Naruto said hoarsely, obviously trying to suppress a sob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Naruto, I'll carry you.\" Kakashi said soothingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... hic.. don't think... you can... carry me... she... I... I'm...\"  Naruto lost the battle and broke out in a heart renching sob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi rushed forward and gently hugged his student to him as the boy sobbed into his chest.  When Kakashi's hands felt the fattened body he had to will himself not to vomit.  Naruto would take it the wrong way, his student would assume that he was disguested with him instead of what had been 'done' to him.  Kakashi felt around Naruto till his hands touched the bloody cuffs of metal painfully binding them to the wall and with a quick and powerful jutsu broke the pieces apart, quickly doing the same to the metal that held Naruto's ankles to the ground, the moment he was release Naruto completely collapsed against Kakashi's chest.  The sobbing filled the large dungean area as Kakashi gently wrapped his arms around his students form.  Which was slightly difficult with the large amount of weight Naruto had been forced to gain.  It mere size Kakashi gouged Naruto to be twice the size he'd been a mere ten days ago.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his student sobbed Kakashi gently touched each part of his body, checking for wounds and trying to best see in the dark how large his student would look in the light, he did not want Naruto to see a look of stun or horror in his eyes.  It would surely break the boy.  Naruto's shirt was stretched tight over the large stone like watermelon of a stomach he now sported which dipped over the edge of his pants and stretched a few inches past Kakashi's own waist in width.  The hardness was an obvious sign that his stomach had been forcefully stretched out over a short period of time.  It would take at least a weak for it to soften at all after what had been done.  Kakashi tried desperately not to think of how incredibly painful it had been and still was.  Kakashi's fingers lightly traced the boy's sides and down his leg, passing it off as trying to sooth the boy's sobbing, and found the same tightness.  Even when Naruto lost the weight he would probably never be rid of the stretch marks.  Kakashi silently cringed.  Naruto, his little eighty-five pound Naruto, was indeed at the unbelievable weight of a hundred and fifty pounds after being tortured through forced feeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kashi... everything hurts so much... I just want to die.\" Naruto whispered.  \"When I move it feels like my bodies ripping and tearing.  It hurts to breath so much... and I'm so fat I can't even stand up.  Please just kill me.\"  Naruto begged.  Kakashi felt like his heart was being ripped out of his chest.  In the darkness of the prison room Kakashi let a few tears leak from his eyes and fall on his tortured students body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Naruto, don't give up on me yet, I know your in a lot of pain but please just bare with me for a little longer.  I'm gonna take you to the hospital and then they'll help you get better.\" Kakashi begged.   Naruto buried his face in Kakashi's lap before letting out a tiny wisp of air that sounded suspiciously like a bitter laugh.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you gonna get me to the hospital when I weigh almost as much as you do?\" Naruto whispered painfully.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a lot stronger than I look Naruto, I promise I'll get you there.\" Kakashi said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't even seen me yet sensei.  I'm fatter than Chouji by... a lot.\" Naruto admitted, voice cracking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll manage.\" Kakashi said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" Naruto's voice burned with shame and pain at this point. \"I don't want anyone to see me like this.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's how you want it for right now then only Tsunade and I will see you for right now.\"  Kakashi told his student quietly.  Sasuke and Sakura would kill him for making that promise, after they had been searching for their teammate for so long none stop, but it was for the best.  Naruto desperately needed to recover some before he saw anyone.  Ten days was a long time to be trapped in a nightmare.  Kakashi stood up and helped Naruto unsteadily to his feet, the blonde stood on shaky legs, body swaying from side to side.  He just needed to get Naruto out of the cell and then he would carry his student all the way to Konoha after that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they reached the lightened hallway Kakashi unconciously glance down at his student.  Naruto's large body was larger than he'd first invisioned.  Naruto heavily leaned against his teachers body, walking with the large addition of weight for the first time, and blushing horribly in shame.  The poor boy tried desperately to pull the too small shirt he was wearing over the rather huge stomach that was bulging out in full view with the belly button looking depressedly at the floor.  Now that they were out in the light Kakashi could see that Naruto's face was burning up with fever, yet another effect of the obvious strain on his body, and his chest was moving up and down with difficulty.  Naruto refused to look at him and Kakashi supposed that if the situation was switched he would feel shameful as well, even if the entire event was not his fault in the least, unreasonable but human nature.  Kakashi crouched down and motioned with his hands for Naruto to get on his back.  Naruto blushed horribly and shook his head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm too fat Kashi sensei.\" Naruto whispered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get on Naruto, I need to get you to a hospital now, we don't have time to argue.  Please?\" Kakashi said reasonably.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto wrapped his arms around his senseis neck, but cried out in pain as his bloated, stone like stomach smashed against Kakashi's back.  Kakashi tensed as he heard the cry and felt Naruto's body nearly fall to the ground behind him.  Kakashi spun and caught Naruto's form instantly, worried eyes watching as tears silently leaked from Naruto's eyes as the blonde held onto his stomach.  Kneeling on the ground until the tip of his nose touched stone.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'M sorry, just give me a minute, I'll be okay.\" Naruto whispered, his eyes tightly closed as his entire body twinge in pain.  Kakashi bent down beside him and rubbed the boy's back in circular motions.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take as long as you need.\" Kakashi instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'M sorry, I'm ready.\" Naruto whispered as he forced himself off the ground and to stand unstabilly.  Kakashi automatically reached out and stedied him, garnering a tired, pain filled smile from naruto as Thanks.  Once more Naruto wrapped his arms around Kakashi, forcing himself to ignore the pain that erupted from his stomach as he did so, and squeezed his eyes shut.  Naruto blushed as Kakashi gave a grunt of effort before finally lifting Naruto's body off the ground, barely holding on to the fattened legs that attempted to make its way around the blondes gut and Kakashi's waist, and unsteadily taking off toward Konoha.  When they reached the gates Kakashi placed an anbu level genjutsu cloak around the both of them and slipped throught the gates toward the hospital.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kakashi closed the door behind him and tiredly sank to the floor.  He'd managed to accomplish the trip without his student seeing how difficult and painful it was for the man.  Carrying an obese Naruto for twenty five miles strait had been hell, but he refused to let it show in any way.  It had been blatently obvious how absolutely ashamed the boy had been about his weight even if it had been induced through forced feeding.  Kakashi had refused to allow any show of emotion to slip out so that Naruto wouldn't feel worse about the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade, who ordered an anbu team after the bitch that had imprisoned and tortured Naruto, escaped over the border, ran down the hospital hallway with a look of terror on her face.  \"How is he?\" She whispered.  Kakashi shook his head sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's in a horrible amount of pain and doesn't want any one to see him outside of you and me.  Everything she said about what she did to him is true.  Parts of his skin are raw red from being stretched so badly and his whole body's tight.  He really is a hundred and fifty, maybe more, and... he begged me to kill him Tsunade.\"  Kakashi whispered this last part.  Tears slid down Tsunade's face as she nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go to your other students now Kakashi, I'm sure their dying to here that Naruto's alive, even if his condition is bad.\" Tsunade stated as she went to the door and slipped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade breathed in sharply as she took in Naruto's form, leaning against the bedframe with knees to chest, and his head buried into his legs.  She quietly noted how Naruto's stomach extended nearly eight inches outward in an unnaturally stiff manner, like a pregnent woman rather than weight, and how Naruto's body shook every few seconds in pain.  So the weight hadn't adjusted to the body yet, but that was to be expected.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade carefully sat on the bed, trying not to cause too much movement, the ride to the hospital on Kakashi's back must have been hell for Naruto's damaged body and she didn't want to increase that pain in any way.  Tsunade gently touched one of the arms wrapped loosely around his knees.  \"Naruto, please look at me.\" Tsunade commanded softly.  Naruto did, tear stained face and trembling lips heartbreaking to see, before shoving his head back into his knees and letting out a pain filled sob.  Tsunade, as carefully as she could, moved right next to Naruto and loosely wrapped her arms around him.  She whispered comforting words in his ear for several minutes before the boy finally managed to come to some semblance of control. When he did Tsunade silently reached out and healed the boy's ankles and wrists for him.  Then she looked up from her work and spoke softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you to put your legs down sweety, so I can fix some of the damage, and hopefully that will releave some of the pain.  Okay?\" Tsunade asked quietly.  Naruto nodded slowly, twinging in pain as he moved his legs away from himself, and let them lay sprawled out before him.  With the stretched skin it would be painful for Naruto to make any movements for the next week.  Tsunade concentrated chakra into her hands, creating the medical chakra, and then gently placed her hand on Naruto's large stone like stomach.  She took her time, going over every organ and fixing any damage she found, before soothing the mucles into a relaxed state.  When Naruto softly gave out a sigh of relief she smiled.  Most fo the pain was still very much there, but she'd been able to fix a little of it.  When she got to the actually stomach she cringed.  If it had been damaged any further Naruto surely would be dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing an advanced medical jutsu she coaxed the walls in Naruto's stomach to naturally grow larger, faster.  In order to heal naturally Tsunade would actually have to increase Naruto's body size to accomidate all the forced stretching and eating.  Tsunade would have to keep Naruto at that weight for a couple weeks and then slowly have the boy lose the weight.  It was the only safe way for someone to recover from this type of torture.  Tsunade then went to the skin and performed the same precedure.  It would take about a day for the body to settle and enlarge to the right proportion.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade then lifted her hand to Naruto's forehead, the fever was still slightly high, but there was nothing she could do about it.  The fever was a reaction to the strain on the boy's body and wouldn't dissapate until the strain was gone.  It could be there anywhere from a few days to a week.  Tsuande sighed.  She really didn't want to do this to him but she needed to know in order to come to a better understanding of just what had been done.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, you took your physical about six months ago right?  Its required for a genin to get it done at least once a year.\" Tsunade asked quietly.  Naruto nodded slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's what I have to do now.\" Tsunade said quietly.  I want to measure your height... and your width as well as your... weight... and compare it to your old results.  To see how extensive the strain is.  So I need you to first sit in the middle of the bed while I go get the measuring tape.\" Naruto tensed but nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tsunade came back to Naruto sitting int he middle of the bed she quietly began to measure how large around the boy was, silently gapping to herself as the sure bulk that had been added.  Naruto refused to look at her or the tape that was touching his bloated stomach.  When Tsunade pulled out the scale Naruto visably cringed and turned his head away as the woman placed it on the ground.  Naruto slowly lowered himself to the floor, Tsunade hurriedly steadying him with her hands, as he stepped on the scale.  It creaked and stopped at a number.  'A hundred and fifty five pounds.' Tsunade thought in shock.  Naruto just stared down at the number, his face blank and eyes shining.  She quietly measured his height and told him to get some rest.  Naruto did as he was told, laying on his side when he got on the bed, before she closed the door Tsunade heard the distinct sound of hiccups as Naruto tried not to cry again.  <br>\r\n_______________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi sent out a bird to deliver the message to his two other students and met with them in a small waiting room in the hospital.  Sakura came bursting through first, eyes wildly looking around as if Naruto would be there, before she walked up to Kakashi with panic in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is he?  Is he okay?\" Sakura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke entered the room at a walking pace, but from the way the boy's chest rose and fell it was obvious he'd ran all the way tot he hospital.  Kakashi raised his hands in front of him to tell them both to calm down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto's in the hospital and he is going to live, but you can't see him for a while.\"  Kakashi answered as gently as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Why not? What happened?\"  Sakura asked shakily.  Sasuke stood stiffly by the door, the boys entire body tense, and ready to snap at the first person to make the mistake of pissing him off.  Kakashi's hands tightened into fists on his lap and his eyes narrowed.  Both signs that caused Sasuke adn Sakura to tremble.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto was kidnapped and tortured by the the traitor anbu who assassinated all those politicians the other day.\"  Kakashi said softly.  There really wasn't any way to soften news like that.  Sakura fell to her knees, tears flowing down her face, and hand to her mouth in horror.  Sasuke merely stared at Kakashi, shocked eyes widening, before he walked further into the room and sat down heavily on the couch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't we see Naruto?  What did they do to him?\"  Sakura asked brokenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere Kakashi hesitated.  Naruto didn't want his teammates to see him like he was right now but the blonde had said nothing against telling them what had been done.  Perhaps Naruto had simply been in too much pain or simply assumed Kakashi would know not to tell them, but the man believed that they should know why when he explained that it was Naruto who requested that no one see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have either of you noticed that Naruto heals faster than others?\" Kakashi asked.  The both of them nodded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's sort of a special power of his, a keiki genki if you will, Naruto can heal from small scratches quicker than most and if he recieves a dangerous or fatal wound it heals instantly.\"  Kakashi quietly explained.  They stared at him in awe for a  minute, before the man continued.  \"Unfortunately the enemy knew about this healing power so they... had to resort to other means of torture.\"  Sasuke and Sakura both paled.  Sakura reached out her hand and gripped Sasuke's in hers, Sasuke in turn squeezed it, both too stunned and scared to notice what they'd done. \"Naruto was... Naruto was force fed... to the point he nearly died.\"  Kakashi finished quietly.           <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sasuke and Sakura gapped at Kakashi in shock.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha... what do you mean force fed?\" Sakura asked shakily.  Sasuke just stayed quiet listening intently.  Kakashi tried not to show the shudder that ran through him.  They were young, unable to really understand the horror that came with such a torture,  they didn't get how bad it really was.  God, he really didn't want to explain, but they needed to know how much pain Naruto was in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean,\" Kakashi began softly, \"that he was chained down and had food shoved down his throat where he had to either swallow or choke.  I mean that substance was forced into his stomach to the point that it was forcefully enlarged and that his insides were badly damaged.  I mean Naruto's skin was stretched and tissue torn.  I mean they tortured Naruto from the inside rather than the outside every single day for the past ten days Sakura.  He was in so much pain that he begged them to kill him.\"  Kakashi whispered sternly.  Sakura shook her head, mouth opening and closing in silent, horrible comprehension.  Sasuke looked like he was going to be sick.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what's his condition right now?\" Sasuke asked quietly.  Kakashi shook his head, much like how he'd reacted to Tsunade's same question.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't lie, he's in a tremendous amount of pain right now, every move he makes causes him agony.  It will be a couple months before he fully recovers.\" Kakashi explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When can we see him?\" Sakura asked.  Kakashi fidgeted.  This was the hard part.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't be seeing Naruto for a while. Probably not until he's almost fully recovered.\" Kakashi answered softly.  Sakura shot up from her seat.  Sasuke looked angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"  Sakura yelled out.  \"Why not?!\"  Kakashi looked at the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto... doesn't want anyone to see him... to see what they did.\" Kakashi told them.  This time it was Sasuke who stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats just too bad.  We want to see Naruto whether he likes it or not.  I don't care how... I don't care how much they made him... I don't care if he's gained weight!  Why would we care if he's gained weight?!\" Sasuke asked/demanded.  \"It's not his fault and we want to help him!  He's are team mate!\" Sasuke said.  Sakura nodded her head in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to look at it from Naruto's perspective, would either of you two want to be seen?  Just give Naruto some time.  I'm sure in a few days he'll change his mind, but right now Naruto really can't handle seeing you, and for god sake don't tell anyone.\" Kakashi added sternly.  The two nodded solemly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ka... Kakashit sensei?\" Sakura asked timidly, almost fearfully. Kakashi nodded for the girl to ask whatever was on her mind.  He was pretty sure he knew what it was anyways.  \"How... how much did they... you know... how much did he gain?\" Sakura whispered.  Sasuke too looked uncertainly at their sensei.  Kakashi frowned visibly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto's... Naruto's about a hundred and fifty pounds now.\"  Kakashi said bluntly.  Their eyes widened in shock.  <br>\r\n________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo days had passed since Naruto was brought in.  Tsunade gently placed her hand on Narutos large stomach, the large amount of food had finally adjusted somewhat to Naruto so the round belly moved slightly under her hand, now much softer than the tight stone like thing Naruto had been brought in with.  She had weighed him this morning and found that with the food naturally absorbed Naruto weighed a whopping hundred and sixty-seven pounds despite the fact that Naruto had eaten nothing in the last two days.  While Naruto's belly was still grotesquely large on the short boy it was now soft and natural, much of the forced weight had adjusted itself in other places such as his theighs, waist, chest and arms... and his ass much to Naruto's chagrin.  The pain was far less than it had been and Naruto was at least able to stand without assitence.  It would still be several days before the blonde could move though.  Too many internal wounds still needed to heal before he could do that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade moved the plate of food she'd been trying to get Naruto to eat for the last hour or so to the side table and sighed.  It was understandable that Naruto wouldn't want anything to do with food at the moment but starving himself would only cause a great deal of damage on his system.  An intense amount of gain followed by an intense amount of loss would cause an enormous strain on the boy's body.  she tried explaining this to him but the boy refused to listen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tsunade left the room Naruto looked down at himself for the hundreth time that day.  He poked the large belly that extended far from his waist and cringed as he concluded for the hundreth time that yes it was attached to his body.  Naruto got up off the bed,  dizzy as he did so, and forced himself to walk around the room despite how much it hurt.  He absolutely refused to remain like this for any period of time.  He couldn't even see his feet he was so fat!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a Chuunin walked into the room.  Tall, hitting at least six feet, with spikey brown hair and green eyes.  He looked about twenty.  Naruto froze, half turned towards the man, and half toward the shaded windows.  No one was allowed in the room except Tsunade and Kakashi.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So its true.  The demon is a lard ass now.\" The Chuunin whistled.  Naruto stared at the man in horror.  People knew about it!  They knew he'd gotten fat through forced feeding?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your not allowed to be in here.\" Naruto said hoarsely, his throat still not having recovered.   The man nodded with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" the man agreed, \"but I wanted to see the obese beast myself.\" The Chuunin said as he strolled over to him.  Naruto slowly backed up away from him, his body not allowing him to do much else.  The man grinned and put his hand out, poking Naruto's large gut, before laughing like a mad man.  \"You can't move well can you?  This is hysterical.  When I overheard Lady Hokage talking to Hatake I never imagined it would actually be true.\"  The Chuunin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out.\" Naruto hoarsely yelled, tears threatening to spill over.  The Chuunin laughed again and shoved Naruto hard, watching in mirth as Naruto easily lost his balance and hit the floor, crying out in pain.  The man stomped down on Naruto's stomach making the boy scream in agony.  The freshly healing walls of his organs straining and ripping under the mans foot.  Naruto coughed, blood seeping down his chin as he did so.  The mans foot moved roughly back and forth, pushing his stomach from side to side, and smiled wickedly as Naruto tried to push the man's foot off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your so round you can't even fight back.  Tell me, was it fun having food shoved done your gullet?  Did you enjoy the attention?\" The chuunin asked with a laugh as Naruto gasped in pain.  The man's foot left his stomach as he moved around the bed of the room.  Naruto leaned to the side, allowing the blood in his mouth to spill out, before attempting to stand.  Naruto only barely managed to get into a sitting position.  His midsection was screaming at him in agony.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, what would you do if I were to take this food...\" The chuunin said as he picked up the plate Tsunade had left, \"and I made you eat it?\" Naruto felt his body attempt to puke at the thought, but nothing came out, he hadn't eaten in two days.  The blonde looked around for any kind of weapon as the man approached him only to find there was none.  Tears slid down his cheeks as the man got closer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't!\" Naruto begged as the man crouched in front of him.  Naruto screamed as loud as he could, desperately trying to get anyone's attention, before slamming his mouth shut for fear of having something shoved into it.  Naruto tried to hit him, but the man easily caught his fist, and silently whispering an earth jutsu so that Naruto's hands were sucked into the floor beneath him.  Naruto tightly closed his mouth and turned away from the man.  The man scooped the mash potatoes into his hand and playfully smoothed it out over Naruto's face.  Naruto flinched shutting his eyes tightly.  The chuunin then gently yanked at the fat beneath his chin, obviously enjoying messing with the boy, before leaning in and whispering in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see you later, you fat tub of lard, I'm in a henge so I could be anyone at anytime.\"  A hand full of peas was shoved against Naruto's face before the man dumped the plate into his lap and got up.  The man fazed out of existence, leaving Naruto with his arms trapped in the floor.  <br>\r\n______________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tsunade entered the hospital it was to find that absolutely none of the staff would look at her.  Tsunade frowned as a women shifted from one foot to another in order to avoid eye contact with her.  She ignored them and headed strait to Naruto's room.  She could deal with their strange behaviour later.  Fear raced through her when she realized that the door of Naruto's room had been forced open.  The medic rushed through the door and caught her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was on the floor, tears streaming down his face, and face completely blank.  Tsunade rushed forward to see the boy's hands trapped in the floor and the blood and food on his face.  In one fell swoop she cracked the floor open with her heel and as carefully as possible lifted Naruto up and onto the bed.  A hiccup escaped Naruto's mouth before a full blown sob escaped.  Tsunade cradled Naruto's head against her chest as the boy sobbed, her hands crackling with green medical chakra and consuming the boy's entire body.  Anger like nothing else overcame her as she found the cracked rib and internal tares that had only been mended the day before.  She'd kill whoever did this and the medics that allowed this to happen would be demonted and punished! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst though she needed to get Naruto somewhere safe where she could keep an eye on him.  Naruto would be kept in the private courters of the Hokage tower where she and Shizune could watch over his recovery.  They stayed like that for a long time.  Just her and and the one she considered her little brother.  <br>\r\n_____________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kakashi arrived at the bridge the man felt as if he would fall apart.  He didn't want to say what he had to say but it needed to be said.  Don't you just hate situations like that?  Sasuke and Sakura stood there, quietly waiting for him as he stepped onto the bridge.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Missions for today are canceled.  We are needed somewhere else.\"  Kakashi said quietly.  They both stared at him in confusion.  The man sighed.  \"Naruto's been under medical treatment for five days now but a problem has occured.\"  Both his students were immediately on guard, their faces were filled with fear and dread, despite that they looked ready to face anything.  \"Naruto... he's been refusing to eat.  Hasn't eaten in five days and we're afraid of what will happen if we force him to eat.  We need you two to go in a talk to him.\"  Sasuke and Sakura paled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto hasn't eaten in five days?\" Sakura asked.  Kakashi nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll talk to him.\" Sasuke said softly.           </span></div></div>",

Turning somewhat slowly, due to his still slightly injured internals and large weight, Naruto cringed as he saw his two teammates, trying in vain to hide his new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what are you doing here?\" Naruto said, internally wincing at both the stutter and how high his voice sounded then and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were told how you haven't been eating after, well...\" Here Sakura motioned towards the boy's large stomach, the fleshy appendage having softened even more, giving it a more natural look despite being overly large on the formerly skinny boy's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know how unhealthy that is?\" The pinkette continued, stopping Naruto from responding. \"Starving oneself to lose weight is really damaging to one's body. You might lose fat, but your muscles also shrink due to not getting enough nutrients, and it's also very damaging to not only your heart, but your bones, stomach and skin to. Not even that, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What she's meaning to say, is that if you don't start eating, you'll probably have to quit as a ninja.\" Sasuke said, qutting of the girl, sending her a minor, but noticeable look of apology for doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to the side, Naruto gave a mumbled, \"You don't get it.\" forcing himself to not start tearing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA silence ensued between them as Naruto avoided looking at his teammates, while Sasuke and Sakura gave Naruto a strangely soft look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right.\" Sasuke finally said, meeting Naruto's startled look. \"We don't, and we probably never will...\" Here he tapered of, his brow furrowed and lips tightened in anger, though for once not at the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto... Please, tell us why you won't eat. We honestly want you to become better.\" Sakura's voice was soft, making Naruto swallow as he looked at her. Sitting down at the chair beside him, he tried to find something to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto.\" Once again he was startled, his eyes switching over to his black-eyed rival, a fond, yet pained look on the teen's face. \"Please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing heavily, looking between the two of them, a part of him noticed that they didn't look at him with hidden pity and disgust, but rather with fondness, appreciation and pain which he had only even seen directed towards him from Iruka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did eat, the first day.\" He finally said, forcing himself to meet their eyes as the two of them sat down with him. \"I did eat the first meal, but... But despite all the food still stuffed in me, and that meal on top, I was still...\" Here he swallowed again, his lips trembling. \"I was still starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down on his gut, laying a hand on top of the soft flesh. \"I didn't want you to see me like this. I must look disgusting, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not.\" Sasuke said, meeting Naruto gaze. \"I don't know why you think so, but you're not disgusting, you're not ugly, and we would never make fun of you for looking like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is shocking, we won't deny that, but to be honest, we expected you to look way worse.\" Seeing Naruto's questioning look, Sakura elaborated. \"We don't mean fatter, but we expected you to look, well, hurt to be honest. Raw and red if you understand, like someone had used sandpaper on you or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you always make fun of Chouji though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and Ino-pig don't make fun of Chouji for being fat, we make fun of him for acting like a pig, constantly dirtying himself and stuffing himself.\" Here she snorted in disgust, crossing her arms. \"I mean, we get why he has to eat, and we wouldn't really care if he was way fatter, but does he HAVE to act like a pig all the time and getting food smeared all over him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how will I ever get thin again if I have to eat way more to get full?\" Seeing the look they shared, he couldn't help but ask \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, if we had to choose between how you looked before, and how you look now, if we could remove the reason you now look like this, we would rather you stay on the fatter side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" He couldn't have heard him right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree with Sasuke.\" Here Sakura poked Naruto's slightly flabby arm, a part of her happy that Naruto was to shocked to really care. \"I've apprenticed under Tsunade for a month now, and one of the things I learned was how a healthy body looked and acted. You were as skinny as Ino before Naruto, and that was, quite frankly, unhealthly thin for a boy. I'd rather have you fat and healthy than thin and sickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, the three sat in silence, looking between each other. Then Naruto began to sink together, his tense body slowly relaxing as what his two teammates -Best Friends- started to sink in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You honestly don't care about how I look?\" Naruto finally asked, a small, hopeful smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't say we do.\" The Uchiha uttered, a challenging smirk on his face. \"Plus, even fat, I have a feeling you could still push me, if just a little. You're still to weak to beat me.\" Naruto's smile widened as he saw the playful teasing in Sasuke's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we will get the bragging right for being the teammates of Konoha's future fat Hokage.\" The girl finished, sending a wink towards Naruto as he giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you'll do.\" Naruto's smile didn't lessen any, but his cheeks reddened slightly as a hungry growl permeated the room, the boy rubbing his stomach at the sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to eat?\" At the blonde's nod, Sakura went over to the table besides the bed and picked up the tray filled with a few pancakes, some sirup, and a glass of milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I probably need more than this.\" Naruto mumbled, his face heating up even more, but his embarassment stayed pretty low at the accepting nods he got from his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much more? Twice? Thrice?\" Sakura asked, already heading for the door to ask for more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two more stacks I think.\" He answered, his embarassment lessening at the nod he got back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then two more stacks is what you'll get.\" With that, Sakura left to find the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some slight hesistation, Naruto cut into the first pancake, and with a supportive nod from Sasuke, he put the piece into his mouth. He expected to feel sick, eating again after not only his stuffing experience, but also after what that man did, but instead he felt ravenous, his gut finally remembering that it had gone several days without nourishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you need more food, don't be afraid to ask. Just eat until you're full, and we'll be happy.\" Sasuke said, a small, fond smile on his lips as he earned a nod from Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screams of pain and roars of rage was unheard by the trio as a formerly disguised ninja was beaten the hell up by an angry Hokage and silver-haired Jounin as he tried to sneak into the residence.</span></div></div>",

It has been the first time since the incident that he didn't feel stuffed, or starving, just comfortably full. His only concerns now were what everyone else would say, finding clothes to fit, and training. After staring out of the window while absent mindedly rubbing his full belly. He mostly came to the conclusion that if anyone said anything, Sasuke, and Sakura would be  beside him. As for training, he would have more weight than he was used too. He saw it as both good, and bad. The good was that he would have more impact, and power with his punches, the bad, he's gonna be a lot slower than he use to be. After weighing the options, he came to the conclusion that being fat was better for his team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're gonna let you get some rest.\" Sasuke said, bringing Naruto out of his train of thought.\"oh, ok.\" Naruto replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sasuke, and Sakura left, nary to went back to rubbing his belly, continuing his train of thought, thinking of how much fatter he would be if he kept this up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter going to the bathroom, Naruto raised the hospital to reveal the round belly, baritone giggled a little seeing the seal in the middle of his stomached, and honestly thought it looked cooler now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour, or two, lunch was served. After coming to terms with being fat, and his friends accepting him, he thought to himself about pushing his limits, and maybe try to gain more by the time he checked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, nurse, could I have four more?\" The nurse blinked for a second. \"Um, sure.\" She said, surprised that someone his size would want more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--30 mins later--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so stuffed!\" Naruto exclaimed \"I wish I did this sooner.\" After all this, he never wanted to be thin again, he would be the greatest ninja, even if he was bigger than an Akamichi member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was content with himself, his belly was big, and full, and would only get bigger. He made it a personal challenge to see how much he could push his limit at each meal, and for the first time, he was happy that the incident happened.</span></div></div>",

In that time, Naruto was 200lbs, and didn't regret it, except trying to stuff himself in his smaller cloathes. He was kinda embarrassed at first because his shirt couldn't cover his belly, and jacket wouldn't zip up all the way. But after the button in his pants popped off, he said what the hell, and left the jacket unzipped, and took his shirt off letting his belly hang , and the nine-tailed fox seal show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the blonde ninja walked down the street, Ino, Choji, and Shikamaru passed by him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey naruto, decided to stop being a ninja, and be a pig?\" Ino asked, laughing at naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ino, what the hell,\" Shikamaru exclaimed. \"What gives you the right to call someone a pig?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, just look at him, he's probably just gonna go to that ramen stand, and stuff his face, like that fatso on our team.\" She exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, Choji was shaking with fury, he hated it when Ino would make fun of him, it wasn't being called a pig, he didn't have the best manners, but Shikamaru helping him with that. It was being called fat. It was something he was very sensitive too. Not that being fat bothered him, he knew why his family was mostly heavier, and secretly he was proud of it, but he hated it when Ino made fun of him for it, but now seeing as how Naruto was in the same boat, he was kinda ecstatic that he wasn't the only fat shinobi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ino, that was uncalled for.\" Shikamaru said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe if he worked out, and lost some weight he would be happy.\" Said Ino. \"I guess it isn't all bad, with how Naruto's going, I guess he could be the Akamichi clan's new fat pig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this, Choji snapped, but before he could do anything Naruto started yelling at Ino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What gives you the right to call someone a fat pig, while you are acting like a bitch, so what if me, and Choji are fat, I think it's awesome, and Choji isn't the only one in our class who's bigger, and what gives you the right to call someone's clan a bunch of pigs, so what, we have an advantage, we can hold more chakra than you, and do you know why I'm fat now?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno blinked. \"What ever, I'm leaving, let's go Shikamaru, let's not be seen with the pigs, people might things we're with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do what you want, I'm staying, you keep calling Naruto, and Choji pigs, but all I see is a bitch. And I'd rather hang out with two fat friends, than a loathsome, skinny teammate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Ino left, Choji fell to his knees, angry tears running down his face. Shikamaru kneeling next to him, hugging his larger friend. \"Why are we on the same team with her?\" Choji asked through muffled sobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but we both know that there's nothing wrong with being fat, after all, you always have me.\" Shikamaru said kissing Choji<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding back, Naruto looked at Shikamaru, and Choji, dumbfoundedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you two are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A couple, yes Naruto, we've been together for a month, Ino caused it by being herself, and it messed Choji up big time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't stand it, her comments just get worse, and worse.\" Choji said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but she's gone now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to do?\" Naruto asked</span></div></div>",

The pain was great, but he couldn't do anything, but take each punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 10 mins, Choji stopped, and Shikamaru released the shadow possession jutsu, and Naruto collapsed clutching his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's something you have to get use to, being bigger, and slower makes you a bigger target, they think you'll be weaker, soon you'll be able to take it without assistance.\" Choji informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could've just dodged.\" Naruto exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not really, being fatter has a disadvantage, remember, you're not as fast as you use to be.\" Shikamaru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that belly can be a disadvantage if not trained right.\" Said Choji, placing his hand on Naruto's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I want to show you why you need to focus on power.\" Shikamaru said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he rushed Naruto, Naruto tried to dodge only to dodge the attack, but couldn't recover in time before Shikamaru landed a kick square in his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit.\" Naruto said, holding his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last bit are some sumo techniques.\" Choji said. \"Shikamaru will referee.\" Choji said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 20 minutes of fighting, the three ninjas called it a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job.\" Choji said to Naruto. \"It's nice to have another fat ninja in our ranks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should have our own team.\" Choji said. \"The three of us would be strong, and be a force to be reckoned with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in.\" Said Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\" Said Shikamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's celebrate, where should we go for lunch?\" Choji asked.</span></div></div>",

As a result, many of them had taken to wearing their casual clothes about the village instead of their usual attire. In Kiba's case, he wore long, dark pants and a long-sleeved, tan shirt, much like he\u2019d worn as a young child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatting his belly again, he glanced back at the giant dog following him. \u201cWhat about you, Akamaru? You like it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru barked, wagging his tail. Kiba smiled; that was the way things were whenever they went to a restaurant: the dog would get some of whatever Kiba got (provided it was safe for dogs, of course.) \u201cGlad ya liked it, buddy!\u201d he laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidway through his laugh, a loud burp escaped the dog-nin\u2019s mouth. He blinked owlishly, blushing slightly. \u201cUm, sorry about that,\u201d he mumbled, chuckling nervously and scratching the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru ruffed in amusement, but quickly fell silent when he noticed Kiba\u2019s stomach. The Inuzuka was still chuckling, eyes closed in embarrassment, so he did not notice Akamaru staring at his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack when the missions first started drying up, Kiba had, as usual, kept himself occupied by romping around with Akamaru and going for walks. However, as time went on, Kiba had, slowly but surely, started to exercise a bit less and eat a good deal more. And, predictably, it had started to show. Although his appearance was mostly unaffected, Akamaru could make out a noticeable bulge under his tan shirt. Although it had been there earlier that day, Akamaru realized with a twinge of worry, it was more pronounced now that Kiba had just eaten a good meal. His shirt still covered it, but chances were he was only a few good meals away from having his belly see the light of day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ah, man, this ain\u2019t good,</i> the dog thought to himself, starting to whimper. <i> I mean, sure, its just his gut now, and it\u2019s not even that big, but if he starts eating as much as Choji and stops exercising, things aren\u2019t gonna end up well for him\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAkamaru? You OK?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru yelped, snapping to attention. Kiba\u2019s hand was still on the back of his head, but he had opened his eyes and was staring at Akamaru, his expressions quizzical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru stumbled. <i>W-well, um.. Actually, Kiba, I wanted to tell you something\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Akamaru say?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Grabbing the bottom of his shirt, he lifted it up a bit, exposing his slightly rounded stomach. His eyes widened. \"Damn, you're right, buddy; got a little bit of a gut there.\" Pulling his shirt back down, he blushed slightly. \"Guess I've been eating a little too much, huh?\" He smiled nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru gave a startled whimper: he was surprised at how easily Kiba was taking this. <i>Well, it probably wouldn't be too much of a problem, but we haven't been going for as many walks as we usually do.</i> His eyes once again wandered to the lump under Kiba's shirt. <i>After a while, it starts to pile up, ya know?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba winced. \"Ah, yeah, I see what you mean.\" He gave the dog an apologetic look. \"And I'm really sorry about the walks, boy. I really enjoy them; dunno why I've been slacking like that.\" He rubbed his belly. \"I guess with all this free time, I've just...kinda let myself go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru whined, trotting up to Kiba and giving him an affectionate nuzzle. <i>Ah, c'mon, Kiba, it's not that bad. So your gut's gotten a little big; nothing some more exercise couldn't work off.</i> He ruffed, tail wagging. <i>At least you're not like Choji.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba laughed, ruffling the top of his partner's head. \"Yeah, I guess you're right. Still, we'll start going on walks again, I promise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru barked, tail wagging faster. That had gone even better than he'd hoped!

Soon, Jirobo finshed his thurd burger and ordered two more, which includes Bacon cheese burger, the Portobello mushroom burger with fries. Also, he ordered some beer for both of them since there's no law in the Sound village for the most part. After devoring two more burger, Jirobo really felt like he was going to explode with all the food and booze inside him.

He had recently defected from his village and stole a very precious scroll full of the village's forbiden jutsus.  The escape and theft had went very smoothly.  He had even been able to use very little force and had avoided causing casualities.  The man had his own reasons for his sinful actions.  He knew it would create a dark stain on his soul, but the deeds needed to be accomplished.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I won't let you get away!\" was a voice that the man heard. He looked back and saw a small figure rushing towards him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What?!  How was I followed?' inwardly thought the man, cursing his unfortunate luck.  What the man hadn't antcipated was a certain ninja-girl who had saw his escape.  Being highly against criminals and defecters, Sakura felt it was her duty to stop this thief. The pink haird girl reached into her kunai pouch and threw some of the bladed knives at her opponent.  Alarmed by the speed of them, the man had barely enough time to dodge all of them.  Unfortunatly for him, two of the weapons had struck him in both the shoulder and lower legs.  Feeling an immense amount of pain, the nuke-nin quickly used a substitution jutsu put some range between himself and his assailent. Sakura growled at herself for letting her target easily escape from her like that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good thing I know basic medical jutsu.' thought the man.  The man had found refuge at the base of a very large tree.  He quickly removed both kunai and formed a few hand seals. Green chakra eminated from his palms and he moved both his hands to the affected areas. After a few minutes, the blood stopped and the wounds began to close.  After he had been healed, he lifted himself up and started to make his way throught the forest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found you!\" wad all that the male ninja heard as he saw his pursuer rushing towards him, with her fist aiming towards his head.  The man dodged to the side and witnessed the girl ram her fist into the tree, breaking it quite easily.  Shocked at the girl's strength, he knew she wouldn't be an easy opponent.  After getting a good look at her, he could tell that the girl didn't belong to his village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?!\" yelled the man, clearly frustrated with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, I don't need to explain myself to criminals!\" answers the girl as she readied a new attack.  The girl had been assigned to the village along with two other team-mates in order to help with a few tasks.  Due to being the only one of her team near the scene, she acted independent in her actions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I can't afford to drag this on any longer.' thought the man.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.  Please forgive me for what I am about to do.\" calmly stated the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" said Sakura to herself.  She stopped her charge and went on the defense as the man began to form hand signs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ninja art: Raging River of Broth!\" exclaimed the man.  Suddenly, a rich broth erupted fr his mouth.  From a steady stream to a large river, it rushed towards the girl.  Sakura tried to stand against the current, but was eventually overwhelmed the girl.  She was blown back to the shattered tree due to stream's power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ah, I can't move!' panically thought Sakura.  She felt the broth rapidly enter her mouth.  More and more, the brown liquid entered her gullet.  After a few more moments, the river began to die down.  Evenually, the broth disapated.  The man hated using this special jutsu, mostly due to the effects it had on it's victims. At the base of the tree was Sakura.  By the effects of the broth, she had been fattened.  Her once flat stomach had turned into a large belly.  Due to her rapid expansion, the belly poked itself from her ruined top, revealing soft, creamy flesh.  The girl's breasts had grown a few sizes and rested quite nicely onto her new belly.  Sakura's once thin and toned legs had grown into soft and heavy pillars of jiggley fat.  Her new wider thighs caused her tight shorts to ride up her impressive bum.  Both cheeks had swelled greatly and pressed tightly against her shorts. Her strong arms had been covered in a soft layer of flab.  The girl's face had an image of tiredness and fulness.  It was now round, with a very accented double chin. <br>\r\n\"O-oh, so f-full, so fat...\" moaned Sakura.  Her pudgy hands were currently rubbing her exposed belly in an attempted to soothe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.\" was all the man said as he continued on his path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait! Stop!\" exclaimed Sakura as he attempted to run after her target.  After a few minutes she managed to raise her fattened body up. In vain, she attempted to run.  Quite quickly, her stamina dropped and she became very fatigued.  The plump girl fell on to her heavy bum in defeat.  The girl then proceeded to lie doewn onto thr soft grass.  Staring at the night sky, the girl placed her fatter hands onto her gut.  She began to massage her thick belly fat.  She gave a solemn look as she felt the weight of her new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So fat...'         </span></div></div>",

Your mission is to perform bodyguard duty while this man stays with you at your home.  This will last a month until he is able to return to his own village.  However you will not allowed to leave his site and both of you have a prompt curfew at 8:00 P.M.  Understood?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I will accomplish this mission.\" stated the brown haired girl.  She felt that it would be a pretty easy mission to complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.  This mission is one of severe importance.  Our relations with his village resides on the task alone.\" sad the older woman. Success would defiently help the village's resource output.  \"However, there is one more detail you should know.  Due to him being a chef, he's knowledgable in many areas of preparing and cooking food.  Let's just say that it's a tad bit on the fattening side.  I had him stay with me for three weeks and I packed on a good thirty pounds.\" said Tsunade as she rubbed her fattened belly.  Thought Tenten did noticed that her leader was looking on the chunkier side, she obviously didn't mention it.  She did notice that the blonde's cheeks were much rounder than normal with a hint of a second chin.  The woman's legendary breasts swelled with fat and grew even larger.  In her current corpulent state, they sagged down to rest on her tubby fleshy mass of a gut.  Though she couldn't tell as her lower half was covered by the desk she was sitting, that she had attained a bottom heavy figure.  The Hokage's thighs flared out from her widened waistline and the sheer massivness of her bum cause the chair to creak.  \"Ha, don't get me started on how much of a porker Shizune is by now.  Anyway, go meet your assignment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hai Hokage-sama.\" nervously said Tenten as she excited Tsunade's office </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Tenten made her way down the hallway, she couldn't help but notice how excited she was at the prospect of meeting someone new; someone from another country even! If things worked out well and this Ryu guy was kept safe, the Hidden Leaf Village might have a new ally. She would do her best to keep Ryu safe, happy, and comfortable during his stay!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut along with the excitement that was surely entangled, Tenten had some doubts over taking in the cooking ninja; mainly over her girlish figure. Surely Tsunade-sama had simply overindulged, taken advantage of a young cook-nin during his course of duty. But... what if she didn't? What if Ryu's cooking was just <i>that</i> good?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter, she had already agreed to take in the foreigner no matter the consequences. It was for the village!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a final step into the lobby, Tenten looked around; the cooking-ninja stood out like a sore thumb! Not only was he proudly wearing the kanji for \"cook\" emblazoned on his jacket, but he was standing at a grill jerririgged out of office supplies! Three of Tsunade's trusted Jonin sat at the grill gorging themselves, a wonderful plethora of odors filled the room and Tenten's nostrils. Even though she had managed a full breakfast at home, the young weapon specialist found herself salivating!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Ryu?\" she asked, as if it weren't plainly obvious. \"Oh?\" the somewhat pudgy ninja looked up from his concoction, \"Hai- are you my escort?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hai... m-my name's Tenten... Ryu, what's with the grill?\" she had to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, Genma-san said that at such a young age, I couldn't be that good of a chef...\" the chef proudly gestured to the homemade grill, \"So, I guess I got a little carried away... hehe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten looked him over, he didn't seem too dangerous; maybe even a bit of a pushover. He wasn't that tall, or thin for that matter. Ryu was plump, with a bit of cleavage that rested on top of his gut. Surely if anything were to happen, Tenten could handle herself. \"Oh- Shizune-san!\" the young boy waved to a bottom-heavy Shizune, at least twenty pounds heavier than the Hokage. \"Ryu-kun!\" she dropped an enormous stack of papers in order to rush over to the grill, \"I thought you were leaving today!\" Ryu blushed, \"Oh no, I'm just relocating to this nice woman's house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten watched as they reminisced like old friends, Ryu was definately likable. What concerned her the most though, was Shizune's bubble butt! Tsunade mentioned that her assistant had gained a little weight, but Tenten never imagined just how wide Shizune had gotten! Her stomach pressed against the tight purple robe, top-most roll folding over the tie slightly as she bent over to converse with the shorter ninja. Her cleavage was much bigger, the heavy orbs of fat remaining perky. But her rearend, even hidden by her garments, was undeniably huge. Tenten was much more concerned now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on now, Shizune-san, Tenten-chan and I have to go!\" Ryu teased the porky woman, \"I'm sure we've held up her plans long enough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but maybe one last meal for the road?\" Shizune pleaded with the chef, \"You've got a real talent for cooking... as I must exhibit, huh Tenten?\"</span></div></div>",

Thank you so much!  Trust me this food is heavenly.\" squealed Shizune as she brought the younger girl into a big hug.  The poor girl felt herself being crushed under the much heavier woman's weight.  The plump woman's belly pressed deeply against the lithe ninja's frame and Tenten felt her head sinking into Shizune's flabby breasts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now Shizune-san.  Settle down, you're going to suffocate the poor girl.\" said Ryu with a bit of a laugh.  He immediately began to prepare his grill for his new eaters.  The jounins left with full bellies and busted belts.  Ryu lived up to his impressive reputation and always left a client satisfied. Placing a variety of meast on his makeshift grill, he began to work is magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, sorry Tenten-chan.  I guess I got a bit carried away.\" nervously stated the black-haired beauty.  It took a few moments to the weapons-mistress to reorient herself from that flabby body.  \"Ah, it's fine Shizune-san.  This food is making you really excited huh?\" asked Tenten as she began to smell the delicious scents eminating from the grill behind her.  Shizune quickly rushed over and sat next to Ryu, patiently waiting to be fed the lovely meal.  Tenten followed suit and sat next to the plump woman, eagerly awaiting the meal as well.  Finally, the meats were finished and Ryu filled up both their plates full of the grilled foods such as chicken, steaks and burgers.  Shizune began to dig in and ate quite rapidly.  Her new-found girth also allowed her to become quite the messy eater.  The younger ninja looked down at her plate and felt her stomach growl loudly.  She looked at Shizune as the other woman stuffed her maw with the fattening cuisine.  Tenten then noticed that the sash keeping together her robes began to tear as the pressure from her growing gut increased.  She felt a bit nervous in watching her elder eat like she was possessed.  She began to wonder just how addictive this food really was!  The wary girl stabbed a peace of steak with her fork as slowly raised it towards her open mouth.  As soon as the piece of meat hit her tongue, the girl felt like her taste buds were exploding with sheer flavor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's amazing!\" exclaimed Tenten as she began to indulge in the rest of her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you like it!\"  Ryu had a look of pride on his face as he watched the two enjoy his food so much.  Tenten was so engrossed with the flavor of the meal, she failed to notice Ryu cooking even more food on his small grill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\\One Hour Later//<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu finally cleaned up his cooking area and put away his makeshift grill.  He glanced over to his two friends currently nursing their stuffed bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Are we done yet Ryu-kun.\" asked Tenten in a fatigued voice.  Her belly swelled out a bit and was hard as a rock. The girl herself couldn't believe she had eaten so much.  'There was so much and I just couldn't stop.' thought the full girl to herself.  She felt compelled to unbutton her ninja pants to lessen the pressure on her gut, but she decided not to as that would make herself look unpresentable.  Sighing, she looked over to her older friend.  Due to it being one of the last meals cooked for her by Ryu, Shizune went all out.  The other woman undid the sash to her purple robe and her titanic belly flowed out to rest on her heavy legs.  Tenten would guess that the older woman gained 5 pounds just from that last meal.  The aid to the Hokage leaned back and patted her aching pale tummy with her chubbified fingers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you much for that, Ryu-kun.  Ah, now I'm jealous of you Tenten-chan.  You get to eat his food when ever you want.\" complained Shizune as she moved her rounded face to face her friend.  \"I should probably head back to Tsunade-sama now.  Goodbye you two!\" announced the black-haired woman as she tried to leave.  It took a minute or two to pull her hefty body from the strained seat.  Afterwards, she slowly made her way towards her leader, her large and heavy bum jiggling and swaying with each of her steps.  Tenten took a considerable less amount of effort raising from her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready to leave now Ryu-kun.  My home isn't that far from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hai, I'm really excited to see where you live.  I also can't wait to see the rest of this wonderful village!\" said Ryu with glee.  Tenten smiled at his enthusiasm.  To her, living with someone else was quite the fun experience.  Though the damage his amazing cooking could cause to her precious figure did plague her thoughts. 'I just need to have more self-control.  I won't end up a porker like those two.' mentally chastised the girl to herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, let's head out then.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had no idea how much he was accustomed to eating, or <i>what</i> he was accustomed to eating! But judging by his peckish build, it would certainly be more than she was used to. If she wasn't careful, she could starve or poison the poor kid! \"I guess we could stop again... even though I'm not quite finished with my dumplings...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu smiled, \"Oh no, I'm fine Tenten-chan, I was just making an observation.\" he took the last bit of dango off of his stick, \"Certainly a prosperous village like this must have some wonderful places to eat, I'm wondering if any of the local chefs would be willing share recipes with me.\" the plump young chef chuckled.

She practiced often but felt that she was still a newbie at the hobbie.  \"So who's your friend here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, this is Ryu-kun.

So I heard you talking about your cookbook Ryu.  Do you mind if I take a look at it?\" asked the pink-haired girl with a soft pleading smile.  The ninja-chef blushed slightly as he wasn't used to that particular type of attention.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, of course.  Here I always keep it with me in my bag.\" replied Ryu as he reached for his bag.  But as he was about to pull it out, Tenten grabbed his arm lightly.  \"Tenten-chan?  Is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's best if we go back to my place and read it.\" said the girl as she released her grip on his soft arm.   \"Besides, I don't want a repeat of earlier today.  You'd probably attract almost everyone in town!\" joked Tenten.  Ryu scratched his head nervously due to his embarassment.  The chef would tend to find himself in tight spots whenever he showed off his cuisine skills in public.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you right about that.  I'm sorry Sakura-chan but do you mind if I show you back at Tenten's house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem Ryu-kun.  Do you mind Tenten if I tag along to you place?\" asked the medic-nin.  She became steadily excited for the chance to look at a true master's cookbook and she wouldn't dare to miss an opportunity like this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I don't mind Sakura-chan.  Come on, I'll lead the way.\" stated the bun-haired girl as she beckoned the other two to follow her back to her humble appartment.  Sakura quickly caught up to her friend.  The fellow ninja need to ask her something to satisfy her curious nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tenten-chan?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, what is it Sakura-chan?\" she turned her head to face her companion.  Tenten noticed that she looked<br>\r\na bit hesitant to ask what she had in mind.  Sakura moved closer to te girl and whispered her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you eat his food?  Was it really that good?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did and trust me, you just can't help yourself with that guy.\" replied Tenten as she softly rubbed her recovering belly.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tenten fiddled with the keys in her hand, slowly unlocking the door to her humble flat. \"Well Ryu here it is, home sweet home.\" she was relieved to finally get home, going out on the town with her new foreign roomate meant plenty of sightseeing. Combined with a stomach stuffed to the brink, this was a very tiring experience. \"I'll set up your futon, make yourself at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hai, thank you very much Tenten-chan.\" Ryu smiled softly as he and Sakura followed his bun haired bodyguard into his temporary abode, \"You have a very nice home, I'm sure it will be very comfortable for you, Ryu.\" Sakura chimed in as she examined the studio apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten, behind the divider that seperated her \"room\" from the latter space of the apartment, reached into the closet and pulled out her spare futon. She hummed quietly as she set up Ryu's sleeping arrangements, smiling slightly as she did so. Tenten still couldn't get over the fact that she had a roomate, it was just so exciting! Still, concerns over the foreign boy inadvertantly fattening her up barraged her. Only after spending some time with her new friend did her concerns ease up a bit. 'Ryu's a good guy, I'm sure that won't happen.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting a blanket over her donated futon, Tenten slid back the divider, \"Okay Ryu, all set! What do you say we-\" she paused midsentence, Ryu had already slapped together another kitchen appliance, this time a stove top, made from objects around her room! \"Oh- Tenten-chan!\" the plump ninja said innocently, \"Sakura-chan had some questions regarding my recipes, would you like a demonstation as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Ryu...\" Tenten giggled awkwardly, \"I have a stove, you don't have to keep making these grills...\" Sakura, who had only seen a glimpse at the cookbook's contents before the construction of Ryu's oventop, felt the need to delegate just a little further, \"All I asked about were the spices...\" Ryu blushed lightly, \"O-Oh, sorry.\" he chuckled nervously, \"Tenten-chan, may I use your stove then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure.\" Tenten giggled as he started to dismantle his grill. \"Oh no, you go prepare for Sakura's lesson, I'll take care of... this.\" she caught glimpse of an alarm clock, already begining to melt from the heat, \"Next time, you don't even have to ask.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu bowed slightly as he made his way over to the small corner of the room that was the kitchen, Tenten sitting down to take care of Ryu's franken-stove. \"Wow, he really <i>is</i> into cooking.\" Sakura whispered as she sat down beside the weapon-nin, \"He's amazing- I can't wait to taste some of his food!\" Tenten laughed lightly, \"Yeah, I just wished he were a little more observant, my stack of magazines wasn't quite intended to be kindling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the stove was dismembered and all of it's components returned to their rightful places around Tenten's apartment. And while the two leaf ninjas worked in their own corner, Ryu set up everything he could possibly need for Sakura's lesson from the confines of his own bag \"Sakura-chan, are you ready?\" he beckoned her from the kitchen, \"I'll teach you how to make chicken and fried rice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great, let's start right away!\" Sakura practically shot off of the couch to meet with the pudgy ninja chef in the kitchen. Ryu smiled, \"I'm so happy you're interested in cooking with me, Sakura-chan.\" he picked up his baggie of uncooked rice, \"I'm sure you'll be a wonderful assistant, would you start by boiling some water?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten stretched her arms as she leaned back into her couch, \"I'll leave you to it Ryu, I've got some tr-\" but she was interrupted by the chef, too enthralled in his art to fully listen, \"Oh don't worry Tenten-chan, I saw it, I'll be sure to sprinkle some on your meal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-My meal?\" Tenten eyed her stomach, still taut from her earlier meals with Shizune. Surely one little indulgence wouldn't be the end of her rock-hard figure, would it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Of course!\" beamed Ryu with a smile as he received the boiling water from his eager assistant as pour it into his pot.  \"You're doing so much for me by letting me take shelter here and even protecting me.  Cooking for you is the least I can do!.\" answered the chef as he stirred the water and added a few spices to the mix.  \"Sakura would you mind bringing me some flour?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" replied the energetic girl as she searched the pantry for the required ingredient.  After hearing about Ryu's intended hospitality, Tenten felt herself grow a bit pale.  Surely he doesn't cook highly delicious meals all the time right?  Feeling a bit of doubt with her reasoning, the bun-haired girl made her way to her kitchen, which had transformed into Ryu's workplace in a matter of minutes.  Sakura had returned with the flour and happily watched the method in which Ryu used the flour to make long stringy noodles.  Sakura noted that his technique was virtually flawless and watched him mix them in with the broth he had created shortly before.  She just couldn't believe how perfectly he was creating such a simple meal!  Tenten watched his little performance as well, and her uneasy feeling in the bit of her stomach grew by just that much.  She figured if it was prepared that well, it must have an incredible taste, just like her previous meal concocted by the young ninja chef.  Feeling like she should clarify a few things with her guest, she walked over to the busy young man and placed a firm hand on his rounded shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ryu, you don't need to...\" began the weapon-oriented girl, but was soon interrupted by Ryu shoving a spoonful of his homemade broth into the unsuspecting girl's mouth.  Once again, Tenten felt that same sensation come over her body and gave out a little moan of pleasure.  'How did it taste Tenten-chan?  Honestly I think I can give the flavor a more distinct taste.\" said Ryu as he slowly began to drift into his own little world of cooking ideas.  Tenten stayed in place for a bit, until she decided it would be best trying to talk to him later.  Dealing with Ryu in his 'cooking-mode' might cause more damage to her normal body-fat levels.  She sighed and made her way once again to the living room to wait for the meal to become completed.  Ryu then moved on to his next station and began to work on cooking the rice.  \"Sakura-chan do you mind getting some beef and soy sauce?\" asked Ryu to his assistant as he stirred the rice in his saucer.  When he failed to hear a response from his young assistant, he looked over to where he saw her last.  The pink-haired girl was currently at his previous station and looked at the pot of broth curiously.  She reached for the spoon and tasted the peculiar type of soup.  As soon as the warm liquid traversed down her throat, he green eyes lit up in delight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryu-kun, this is incredible!  It's just so wonderful!\" gushed the young woman as she swallowed another mouthful of the soup.  Ryu went over to her and gently took the eating utensil away from his assistant.  \"Now, now Sakura-chan.  I don't want you to ruin your appetite.  Now would you mind giving me some beef and soy sauce?\" asked the chef as he once again headed towards his rice.  He noticed that this was usual behavior for anyone who would help him out with his cooking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, sorry Ryu-kun, I couldn't help myself.  I'll get them right away.\" replied the slightly dazed girl as she went to the fridge.  She promptly gathered the required materials and placed them near Ryu's cooking station.  \"Here you go Ryu-kun.\" said the assistant as she peaked over to what he was cooking now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Sakura-chan.  There's only a little bit for me to finish so why don't you wait with Tenten-chan?\" said Ryu as he cooked the meat.  Sakura nodded her head and went over to where her bun-haired girl was waiting.  She plopped her rear onto the couch and felt herself growing impatient.  'That soup was amazing.  Who knew a simple ramen meal could be so incredible?!' thought the pink-haired nin to herself.  She looked over to her friend and saw that she looked to be in deep thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tenten-chan, are you alright?\" asked Sakura with a bit of concern.  Maybe she was upset that her kitchen was in such a mess?  \"Are you mad about how messy Ryu-kun and I made your kitchen?  I swear, me and him will make it spotless before you know it!\" reassured the worrying friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What?  No that's fine.  I was just thinking of how it's gonna be with Ryu-kun living with me for the rest of this month.\" stated Tenten as she looked over to the kitchen, the uneasy feeling growing within herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you'd like I can stay with you guys too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" replied the girl with a bit of a shocked tone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that Ryu-kun might be a handful due to how excited he gets about cooking.  I think I could help out by assisting him and also stopping him from completely destroying your kitchen.\" said the girl with a bit of a laugh envisioning a chibi-Ryu blowing up Tenten's house.  Sakura also saw this as an opportunity to learn as much from the chef before he had to depart her village.  'Helping out Tenten and picking up new cooking skills, two birds one stone!' thought the girl as she grew excited of this chance.  Tenten, however, saw this as the perfect solution to her 'little' problem.  'With her helping out Ryu in the kitchen, she'll keep him occupied and I can train of these extra calories!  But I wonder if she know just what exactly she's getting into.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, alright Sakura-chan.  I have a spare futon, but we'll need to share rooms.  Is that fine?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. I have no problem with that Tenten-chan.\" replied Sakura with a smile directed towards her kind (but scheming) friend.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is going to be perfect.' both girls thought as they thought over their respected plans.  Though these thoughts were soon interrupted by the chef-nin calling out to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls!  Dinner is ready!\" announced Ryu as he finished setting the table for his two female friends.  Both ninjas became excited and hurried over to the table.  Ryu had set quite a spread for the three of them.  The main dish was his ramen, with beef-fried rice and an assortment of simpler meats.  Both Tenten and Sakura felt themselves nearly drooling by the sight of the feast itself.  \"Well, dig in!\" said the boy as he began to fill his bowl and plate.  The girls followed suit and fill their own plates. As soon as Tenten slurped the first of her ramen noodles, the feeling of complete happiness and joy flowed into her very being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\\Two hours later//<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uurp, no more please...\" moaned Sakura as she nestled her bloated belly in the aftermath of her gorging herself.  Her belly felt so heavy and was stiff to the touch.  Even the slightest of movements caused some discomfort to her overstuffed stomach.  Tenten fared no better than her companion.  Her own stomach, which was still recovering from her earlier meal, felt to her like it doubled in size.  It puffed out a bit from her waistline like previously, but there was one key difference with this occurrence.  When she rubbed her belly this time, the girl became a little frantic when she felt that her former rock-hard abdomen has become a little soft.  Although, it was still hardened by the meal, the girl could definitely pinch a bit of her new belly-fat.  She simply sighed and leaned further back into her chair, attempting to soothe her pains.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it looks like you enjoyed your meals!  I'll be going to bed now.  I have already cleaned the kitchen while you two where on your fifth helpings.  Once again thank you for your hospitality and I can't wait to make you breakfast in the morning!\" said the visiting chef as he left the room.  Tenten wished him good night and then looked over to her equally stuffed friend.  Sakura stood up with a bit of difficulty and walked over to the exit of Tenten's apartment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm going to *burp* get a few of my things from my home.  I'll be back later kay Tenten-chan?\" stated Sakura while still gently rubbing her formerly flat stomach.  Tenten nodded as she slowly got up as well to say goodbye.  After she left, the brown-haired girl looked over to how messy the table the table still was.  She sighed and patted her belly, still feeling that soft bit of belly brushing up against her lean fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I hope Sakura's gonna be okay being left alone with him...'    <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The rain was so bad, in fact, that most shops around the village gave up on getting any customers and closed up! But, of course, no one told Tenten until it was too late. She had just arrived at the training grounds before the heavy downpour interrupted her desperate attempts to work off some extra calories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh...\" she whimpered, still getting soaked underneath a nearby tree, \"I hate rain...\" Normally the weather wouldn't have been such a big deal regarding her training regime, but since Neji was stuck at home and the twin pair of eyebrows were out on a mission, there was no one for Tenten to practice with! \"Stupid Lee, at least <i>he</i> could have stuck around to help me with training, the one time I actually kinda want him around, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn ominous clap of thunder made the bunhaired girl jump slightly, \"M-Maybe I should just go home, I can always train later...\" somehow, going home didn't seem too terrible when it felt like someone was pouring a bucket of water over her head...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...The apartment door opened suddenly, a soaking wet Tenten stood in the doorway with a mildly disgruntled look on her face. \"Tenten-chan!\" Sakura greeted her temporary roomie from the couch, \"You're home- wow you're wet.\" the weapon specialist sneezed accordingly, \"I think I might have caught a cold out there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you read the paper today?\" Ryu asked, genuinely concerned for his friend, \"It called for heavy rain and high winds!\" Tenten smiled awkwardly, \"N-No, I guess I forgot, ehehe...\" She really <i>didn't</i> read the paper, but figured that her determination would guide her through whatever forces Mother Nature could throw at her. She was, however, wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at any rate, did you get some training done?\" Sakura asked, flipping off the small television across the sofa. Tenten's awkward demeanor only deepened, starting to chuckle nervously, \"Oh yeah, haha, I got <i>lots</i> of training done, Sakura-chan, lots!\" Ryu smiled from his seated position at the table, picking up a bowl of soup from the low surface, \"That's wonderful, here, I made some soba.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten's gaze travelled to Sakura, only now noticing the stuffed belly that the pink haired medical ninja sported. \"Uh...\" she mumbled, torn between her desire to please her friend and anxiety regarding his cooking, \"I-uh... I... thanks, Ryu, a bowl of hot soba sounds great.\" she sat down next to the bulky foreigner, \"Just one though okay?\" Sakura heaved herself up, \"I guess I'll have another one, then.\" she chimed as she made her way across the apartment to make herself another bowl, \"Wouldn't want Ryu-kun's delicious noodles to go to waste!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu stared intently at Tenten, \"Are you sure, Tenten-chan?\" he was somewhat shocked that someone had turned down a hot meal after getting drenched in a manner such as Tenten, \"Hot soups are good for colds, after all, my Papa's recipe warms up the body really quickly.\" Sakura sat down with a satisfied groan, \"Come on Tenten-chan, you better eat it before I do!\" she jeered at her bunhaired friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten smiled, thoroughly defeated by Ryu's excellent cooking and her own weak stomach, \"Alright, Ryu-kun, maybe two- but only because I don't want Sakura to be the only one to get any!\" she teased the bloated pinkette right back, \"Hey, watch it!\" she feigned snarkiness<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu smiled warmly, it was so nice to have friends...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The dreary rain from the day past had settles down as a new morning dawned.  Tenten slowly awoke as bits of sunshine hit her sleeping face.  The currently 'bunless' girl sat up and gave a rather large yawn.  Wiping a few strands of her brown hair from her face, the girl looked over to the area where her pink-haired friend slept and noticed that she was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably went to go help Ryu-kun make breakfast again.' concluded the slightly drowsy girl as she absentmindingly used her small hand to rub her pj covered stomach.  She sighed as the girl felt a little more of the softness under the touch of her still-lithe fingers.  'I wonder what he'll make this time.  I actually have a craving for some waffles.' began to think the girl as she felt a small rumble come from her midsection.  The day before he had made stacks and stacks of fresh pancakes for the three to eat, complete with whipped cream and strawberry syrup. Needless to say, both girl devoured them easily.  Deciding to leave her hair down, she made her way towards her kitchen.  The young girl could hear various sound eminating from the hallway and could only assume that her kitchen was once again in a state of disarray.  Though that small complaint disappeared as the scent of the fattening breakfast slowly wafted into her sense of smell.  Tenten entered te kitchen to see Ryu busy using her stove to create some waffles.  Tenten silently cheered to herself as her small breakfast wish had came true.  The brown-haired girl slowly made her way to the table where her pink haired friend was scarffing down the fried food.  Tenten could already the swell on Sakura's increasing abdomen.  She noted that Sakura was still in her sleeping garments as well.  A plain t-shirt and short-shorts adorned her slowly-growing figure.  Though she could exactly tell what it was, Tenten felt as if Sakura looked like there was a little bit more to her than usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Sakura-chan.  How'd ya sleep?\" asked Tenten as she recieved a plate full of the delicious waffles from Ryu.  \"Good morning to you too Ryu-kun.  Thank you for the food.\" said the girl as she began the hearty breakfast.  Sakura had yet to reply to her greeting as Ryu placed even more waffles in front of <br>\r\nthe girl to stuff her maw with.  Like before the medic opted to drown her breakfast with Ryu's homeade syrup.  The chef smiled as he watched his two friends enjoy his cuisine.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning to yourself Tenten-chan.  Hey, I was wondering if you and Sakura-chan would take me on a tour of the village?  The weather is beautiful and the paper said to expect great weather all day!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Ryu-kun.  We'll get ready after breakfast.\" replied Tenten between sweet mouthfulls of the fried dough.  Sakura, who was sitting at the opposite end of the table as the long-haired girl, finally finished her third helping and leaned back into the slightly creaking chair.  Bit of syrup remained on her softer face and parts of her shirt.  Like all the past meals involving Ryu's meal, the girl found herself absoultly stuffed.  Tenten simply ate another mouthful waiting for her friend to finally notice her presense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good morning Tenten-chan!  I didn't see you come in.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\\. Two hours later, on the streets of Konoha//<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Ryu, that complete's the downtown section of Konoha.  Where do you want to go next?\" asked the brown-haired girl with a few sticks of dango in her hands.  Like before, it seemed like Ryu himself had an insatiable appetite and the trio kept stopping at random food stands.  Both Sakura and Ryu were happy to taste so many foods and the chef would always inform his current assistant the exact ingredients and method to create each snack.  The medic-nin would give him a look of awe with each perfect lecture and mentally took note of everything he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's getting close to lunch-time, so I was wondering if we can take a small break.  Besides, you two must be famished from all of this walking!\" answered Ryu as he finished his last stick of dango.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But we've been eating this entire time....' thought the girl as she gave the boy a slightly weird face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree with Ryu-kun, I'm starving!\" said Sakura as she pointed to her growling belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine.  Do you have anywhere in mind Ryu-kun?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I saw a very interesting restaurant back in the downtown district.  Do you mind if we go and check that out?\" asked Ryu as he brought his hand towards his round chin, trying to think of the restaurant in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I think I know which one he's talking about.  I'm pretty sure it recently opened too.\" excitingly answered Sakura as the image of said restaurant flashed into her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, lead the way then Sakura-chan.\" replied the older girl, less than happy at the thought of eating for the 6th time that day.  Right before they were about to head out, a voice suddenly called out to the two girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sakura, Tenten!\" exclaimed a certain dirty-blond suna-nin as she walked over to the small group.  Dressed in her traditional black battle kimono, she still wore her hair into the peculiar four ponytails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?  Temari-san?\" asked Tenten, clearly confused at seeing the female shinobi in her village.  Suna was usually quite far from the village and the girl only visited for official reasons and those were a little rare.  Though the weapons-mistress had to admit that she wasn't exactly happy to see the jounin.  It seemed like she still held a grudge for the woman defeating her so easily in the chuunin exams long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long time no see you two.  Who's the kid?\" curtly said the woman as she pointed her finger towards the hefty young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Temari-san.  This is our new friend Ryu-kun.  We've been showing him around as he's just visiting the village for a month.  What brings you to Konoha?\" said the medic.  Unlike her female companion, she enjoyed te company of the older woman.  They shared quite a past with each other after all!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been helping out with relations and other offical mumbo jumbo.  But I haven't had anything to do in a few days and I've been bored out of my mind and I can't leave for like another two weeks.  Mind if I tag along with you three a bit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Off course!  The more the merrier!\" replied Sakura as she motioned everyone to follow her to the restaurant of Ryu's choice.  Tenten slightly grimmaced at these turns of events.  First she would be subjected to even more calorie-high meals and then she had to deal with the very person to humiliate her ninja-skills.  Her sad thoughts were soon over-shadowed by Sakura's conversation with the pig-tailed girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Temari-san.  Did you know that Ryu-kun here is a master chef-ninja!?  You should come back to our place later to try some of his cooking.  It's really impresive...\"    </span></div></div>",

Temari decided to come along, not that Tenten was too enthralled at sharing a meal with her, and insisted that the \"new guy\" treats. Which Ryu, friendly as he was, agreed to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that the meal would be too terribly expensive, Tama-Go's was a relatively modest hut. They couldn't even afford grills at each seating arrangement like their competing barbecue hut, leaving all the cooking to one chef in the back. \"Poor guy...\" Tenten looked at him, visible through the archway, \"He's sure got a lot of people to cook for, I hope he doesn't crack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Ryu, what do you think looks good?\" Sakura asked her friend, leaning over from her seated position to point at the menu, \"I think the Teriyaki Beef sounds good right about now.\" he responded, \"Of course, if you want I could always-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>No</b>!\" Tenten swiftly jumped over and stopped Ryu from grabbing anything he could use to make another one of his jerryrigged contraptions, \"I-I mean, we're here so you don't have to cook, so you can enjoy someone <i>else's</i> cooking for a change.\" she released his soft arm slowly after startling him so badly, \"Really, Ryu, you don't have to cook for us all the time, sometimes we should get to treat you to a meal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plump boy choked slightly, smiling wamly at his bunhaired companion, \"Oh... th-thank you, Tenten-chan, I'll be sure to enjoy this meal then!\" Sakura nudged one of his lovehandles, \"Yeah, come on, you order the beef and whatever else you want, this one's on me.\" the pinkette gave him a thumbs up, \"consider the occassional meal a thank you for teaching me how to cook!\" Ryu felt something well up inside his throat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh geez...\" Temari, seated beside Tenten, \"Now you've gone and made him well up.\" Tenten nudged her, \"Be nice, Temari-san.\" Ryu turned back to the two women seated across from him, \"Th-Thank you for offering, Sakura-chan, but Temari-san said that I should-\" Sakura laughed nervously, \"Nevermind what Temari says, it's on me... <i>right</i> Temari?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemari laughed, \"It was just a joke!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir conversation was cut short by the second arrival of the burly waiter, this time carrying a notepad. \"Okay, you kids ready to order?\" his smile still warm despite hiding behind his bushy gray beard. Ryu started, \"Yes, I'll have the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour hours later, things would be quite different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter recieving his beef all-but-quickly, Ryu had to point out that not only was it undercooked; but that it was small, relatively tasteless, and was drenched in the wrong sauce. He went on to say that Sakura's chicken was flat and looked very much like a frozen patty thawed out with the outer layer peeled off, Temari's was the only barbecue meal ordered yet it was only topped with the according sauce, not marinated and cooked in it. Even Tenten's salad caught the chef-nin's attention, being mostly lettuce with very little variation in vegetables. All of this, however polite it sounded coming out of Ryu's mouth, managed to infuriate the chef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis led to a series of events (along with yet another grill) that placed Ryu in the modest kitchen. Without a doubt, every customer was delighted with tonight's staff reassignment. Even with such poor quality ingredients, Ryu managed to make splendid meals that filled up everyone's bellies. His friends were no exception, they all recieved much more generous, highly addicting, portions than asked for; Sakura and Tenten had grown quite used to this treatment by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... More...\" Tenten grunted, pushing her plate away from her. She simply couldn't eat any more! It was baffling how Ryu could get such wonderful flavor out of such terrible provisions. Sakura found herself torn between unbuttoning her trousers and finishing off the very last bite of chicken, groaning slightly from the intense pain in her middle. Temari had reached her maximum too, finding little to no more joy in eating ever again... at least for now. \"Is he - Is he always like this?\" Temari asked, leaning back on her hands to support her overworked middle. \"Kinda...\" Sakura grunted<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu and his party were shortly kicked out after that point; the formerly friendly waiter realizing that while Ryu's food was good, it kept people ordering until there was nothing left in their already reserved stock! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even though he was banned from Tama-Go's BBQ House for life, Ryu still managed to go to bed smiling that night, remarking on how wonderful it was to have friends like his...</span></div></div>",

In only a week since taking in the chef-nin, Tenten had found that her clothes were fitting rather snugly, and her trousers practically had to be forced to button. The bun haired girl held her hands behind her back, trying to press any weight around her top half into itself, in theory making her appear smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-So, Tsunade-sama...\" she stuttered, finding it hard to keep a straight face when she was just so embarrased, \"You wanted to s-see me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bloated blonde behind the desk leaned back in her chair laxly, \"It's nothing much, I just wanted to know how Ryu was acclimating to his new lifestyle.\" she, of course, hadn't lost any weight by sitting on her bum all day (not) doing paperwork, \"Is he adjusting as well as hoped?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, he's adjusting <i>just</i> fine...\" she trailed off as she mentally played back all of their misadventures throughout the week. Cooking was only one of Ryu's talents, people really seemed to like him; enough so that the local chefs had started calling him by name. Sakura practically worshiped him, albeit mostly for his culinary prowess, and even the generally antisocial Temari had gradually warmed up to the pudgy boy. And Tenten herself found him quite pleasant to be around, he was always friendly and very considerate. If only he didn't cook so much... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he's getting along with everyone?\" the husky Hokage asked plainly, \"When he stayed with me, all he ever did was stay in the kitchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because you had him cook so much for you, Tsunade-sama...\" Shizune, the heaviest porker in the room had to speak up, Tonton giving a compliant \"Oink...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, he's actually quite the people person.\" Tenten delegated, \"Every few days we go out for a walk around the town with Sakura-chan and he's always voulenteering down at the Shibusin or the Dumpling Shop.\" she remembered the containers that Ryu had asked her to deliver, \"Oh- that reminds me, he sent each of you something.\" the weapon-nin smiled as she picked up two small boxes, \"He knew that I'd be coming to see you today and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are those <b>pork dumplings</b>?!\" Shizune's mouth started to water instantly (Tonton put off slightly with the mention of pig product) The older woman set her pig down lightly on the floor and hastilly grabbed the box, \"Ryu-kun's the best!\" she took a heavy whiff of the aroma flooding from the package, \"They are, <i>yes!</i>\" she pumped her soft arm and greedily unwrapped her parcel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade got curious and sniffed her own box, surely enough, it too was pork dumplings. \"Mmm, delicious!\" she moaned, simply by using her expertly trained nose she could tell that they were as delectable as ever. Tenten watched her entire body quiver as she recklessly tore open the package. Tenten sweatdropped at the sight of the tubby women tearing open packages like children with new toys. Not that she could blame them for being excited, she and Sakura had plenty of a good time stuffing themselves with the initial batch of dumplings last night before bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so, Tenten found own mouth wet at just the sight of Ryu's marvelous cooking even moreso than usual. \"O-kay, so I guess I'll leave you two alone then.\" Tenten leaves the room quickly before she found herself at the opposite end of one of Tsunade's pork buns (and thereby her fists) The weapon specialist slammed the door shut, sliding down until she was sitting solidly against the floor... noting just how much softer it felt to sit lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Tenten released the heavy breath of air she sucked in to keep from looking like a total hog in front of her Hokage. She sighed, happy to be rid of the heavy burden... until her button snapped off of her ninja trousers. \"Crap...\" she whined</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sighing at the slight of her generous belly freeing itself from her tight and slightly ruined pants, the girl slowly rose and made her way towards the woman's restroom.  Even the small trek was slightly embarrassing as her soft belly was exposed and she had to hold up her pants.  Apparently she was fat enough to pop the button to her trousers but not fat enough to keep them up without actually holding them up.  As she made her way down the hallway towards her target, she made sure that no one was in sight to see her in such a vulnerable state.  The girl finally reached the female washroom as creaked the door a bit to see if anyone was possibly inside.  No one was in sight and she couldn't confirm any sounds.  Feeling safe she made her way inside and went towards the large mirror.  The bun-haired girl looked into the reflection and saw a slightly chubby girl staring back at her.  Feeling pale at the sight of the truth, she just couldn't believe how easily she had lost her near-perfectly toned figure.  Eating Ryu's cooking nearly every second of this past week certainly added up on the poor girl's figure.  She looked down towards obvious pot-belly.  It had not even been more than a week ago that the shameful gut had been her prided washboard stomach.  Tenten felt compelled to test the belly, to see exactly how soft she had gotten.  She became a bit surprised when she could push her finger a good two-inches deep inside the fleshy belly.  Something then clicked inside of her.  She needed to train!  The now-chubby girl had long neglected her training in a trade for becoming a bit of a glutton.  With a new sign of resolve on her plump face ( conveniently ignoring the hint of a double chin) she silently swore to herself that she would train her flabby body like crazy in order to return to her former fit figure.  Though she still had those pants to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hm, I can't go back home now.  Ryu-kun and Sakura-chan would be cooking right now.  It's too much of a temptation.' thought the girl.  Indeed, it was too much of a risk and the girl needed to focus on her exercise.  Seeing no other alternative, the girl simply removed her pants, revealing her long creamy legs.  Indeed, the amount of cooking she ate was proportional to the new pudge that settled on her lower body.  Although the girl herself couldn't tell, she seemed to be growing a pear-like figure.  As the pants fell fully, a pair of short-shorts were revealed.  With her problem solved, she got a good look of her heavier lower half.  Her thighs certainly grew and her legs slightly touched each other.  Placing her hands on each hip, they felt flabby to the touch, truly they were the signs of the beginning of a beautiful pair of thunder thighs.  Turning around slightly and thrusting her rump towards the mirror, the girl felt disappointed at how large her bum had grown.  This was the cause of why her shorts were so tight.  Slapping it lightly with her hand, the girl growled a bit in anger as it quivered under the touch.  With her last bit of inspection, the short-sporting girl stepped back to get a better full view of her entire over-fed figure.  She became a bit self-conscious due to her exposing so much of her flabby legs and plump bum.  Before this whole ordeal began, she would have loved to show off her perfectly lean legs and perky butt, but now, she hated the very idea.  And the jiggling.  Especially the jiggling!  Placing her former pants into her bag, she made her way to her usual training grounds.  She had alot of work to do!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\\At the training grounds//<br>\r\nAfter about fifteen minutes of walking, she finally reached the empty training area.  Various logs and training dummies were located all around, perfect for the slightly-hefty girl to work up a good sweat!  She removed a few kunai and shuriken for her to practice her targeting skills.  After all, she needed to keep her '100% accuracy' reputation alive and well!  The weapons-mistress set up a few targets and began her usual methods of throwing the weapons.  Quite to her surprise, each of her bladed weapons cut clean threw each target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well, that's new.\" said the girl to herself as picked up each weapon and reset the pieces of wood.  She would repeat this trivial motion for half-an-hour.  Coincidentally, thirty minutes was all the girl had as she collapsed onto her soft bum and panted slightly.  She rested her hands on her rising and falling belly as she desperately tried to catch her breath.  Even though she only trained for such a short amount of time, she was covered in a thin layer of sweat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhh, this is pathetic!  I used to train for hours in a single session!.' whined exhausted girl as she flung herself to lay on the soft grass beneath her.  The girl felt her stomach groan intensely.  She slapped her belly hard in anguish, trying to vent out some of her stored anger.  \"Shut up belly!  You're fat enough as is.\" scolded the girl to her fattened middle. Suddenly the sky flashed with a radiant light, thunderous sounds bellowed and tiny droplets of rain slowly fell from the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great...\" </span></div></div>",

However \"minor\" wasn't the word to describe her foe, \"heavy\" would be much closer. It was another one of those heavy summer rains that had began to irk Tenten lately, only annoying her because without an excuse to leave she was forced to eat rather than avoid Ryu's delectable cuisine. Not that she wouldn't kill for a hot bowl of soup right about now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten shook her cravings off, this wasn't the time to start thinking about food. It was time to lose that jelly belly she had slowly gained while appreciating her new, sedentary lifestyle! Despite her obviously labored breathing protesting her to work any further, Tenten decided to ditch the target practice in leiu of some more advanced training meathods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill struggling against her own fatigue, Tenten attempted one of the more acrobatic routines that she was once so famous for amongst her graduating class. Starting with a simple backflip, proved difficult enough with her newfound center of gravity, rebounding against a stump and twirling within two of her summoning scrolls. Surely this was something she had mastered, but figuring that a flabby Tenten could do <i>this</i> simple variation better than a newer routine. The weapon-nin would find herself wrong yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery time attempted the routine she was once reknowned for, she fell flat on her fattened bum! If she managed to make it past the incredibly arduous backflip without falling one on of her ends, Tenten would fall short after rebounding off the sloppy wet stump. Only once did she manage to make it to the final step, and even then fell short since she tipped over with courtesy to her generous spread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!!\" she groaned, landing on her chest and her bottom stuck high up in the air, \"I <i>hate</i> rain!!\" she whined, furrowing her eyebrows and pounding on the ground, not bothering to lift her chest out of the mud...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Back at home, Sakura and Ryu stayed on the couch in their sleep attire, not thinking that much would get done outside today anyway. The rain kept most people indoors around Konoha except of course their bunheaded roomie. Sakura giggled as Ryu concluded his latest story, a few cooking-oriented tales that were funny enough between those who shared the passion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, yet somewhat expectedly, the door shot open to reveal the same disgruntled, soaking wet (though somewhat heavier this time) Tenten. Both of her temporary roomates greeted her happilly, eager smiles on their faces. \"Tenten-chan!\" Ryu greeted his sweaty escort, \"I knew you would be hungry, so I fixed up some soup!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten hesitated before letting out a defeated sigh, \"Th-Thank you Ryu-kun...\"</span></div></div>",

The poor girl was feeling a bit dejected after finally realizing that she was in poor-shape.  With all of her penchant for training her heavy body gone, she simple accepted this fattening twist of fate.  At the moment the growing girl layed in her bed trying to fall asleep.  It had been a long day for all three residents.  Instead of the usual hot cooking that the two cooking maniacs created in the past, Sakura had asked if they could focus on more bakery oriented treats, found in a special section of the young chef's cookbook.  Although he was a bit wary to bake some treats, as it was not his strongest field of cuisine and still felt like it wouldn't be satisfactory to his friends.  After much pleading from the pink-haired girl, he caved and they began to practice the ways of sugary confections.  Needless to say, the treats were a hit for both girls.  Cupcakes, cinammon buns, and even donuts were stuffed into the maws of each female-shinobi.  However all the treats gave the girls a suger-high and in their energectic states, they craved even more desserts causing a nearly never-ending cycle.  That low-point in her lazy-lifestyle passed and the effects showed on her bulging gut.  Dressed in her usual sleep-time attire consisting of a yellow button down shirt and matching sweats.  Her recent gain caused her belly to become exposed under the yellow-colored cloth and for the buttons to become strained with the added pressure of her pale gut.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Grr, these pants.' thought the adjitated girl as her pants slowly cut more and more into her fleshy thighs.  If she was ever going to get into a peaceful slumber, they needed to go!  Slowly removing the constraining fabric as to not awake her chubby roomate, she simply dropped them in the floor.  Leaving the girl in her purple-stripped panties, she felt awfully cold all of a sudden and threw the covers over her plump legs in an instant.  She had to admit, sleeping had felt incredibly more satsifying as the fat padding her body has her 'tons' of more comfort.  Giving if a small yawn, she turned to her side in her attempt to fall into a deep slumber.  She felt her eyes closing, signaling her drifting into sleep, until she heard a noise interupting both her sleep and the dead silence of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Huh?' thought the girl as she sat up, her soft belly overlaping her thighs as she rose, searching for whatever caused that strange noise.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmmm, more food please, I love cookies.\" said the pink-haired girl in her sleep.  Dreams of cooking and eating filled her dreamscape.  \"What, I'm not getting fat, don't be rediculous.\" Tenten looked over to the sleeping mass that was her friend and quietly chuckled to herself.  Although it was very dark in her room, she could still make out the other girl's fattened rump hanging out in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Great, no she's even dreaming of eating.  That kid's gonna be the literal death of us.' inwardly concluded Tenten.  Falling back into her soft mattress, she once again tried to fall asleep, hoping that the plump-pinkette would soon stop sleep-talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe a small snack will help me fall asleep?'  </span></div></div>",

She knew that there was an entire tray of eclairs on the counter. Surely no one would notice if one or two were to dissappear, right? After all, Ryu <i>did</i> make them for his friends, and she <i>was</i> hungry...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'll just grab one, I'll just grab one!' Tenten whispered quietly to herself, still not quite finding the willpower to lift her sleepy body off of her futon. Suddenly she heard the rustling of bedsheets, rustling that wasn't coming from her own futon. It was Sakura, clumsilly hefting herself up from an apparantly comfortable. \"Mmm...\" she mumbled. \"Sakura?\" Tenten sat up as her pinkhaired friend moved the divider that seperated their room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could hear Sakura hungrilly smacking her lips, Tenten couldn't help but feel worried for her- Sakura always seemed so in control during missions. \"Sakura?\" she peeked  into the other room, \"A-Are you looking for the bathroom?\" But no answer other than a few incoherent, sleepy mumbles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her now seated position, Tenten watched from her bedroom as Sakura awkwardly made her way over to the eclairs. 'The eclairs?' apparantly, she wasn't the only one with the midnight munchies. The pink kunoichi lifted one of Ryu's glazed treats up to her mouth and sensually, slowly, she devoured the entire thing. Her stomach, still quite swollen from her earlier meals, peeked out of her PJ top; her slowly expanding girth filling out her pajamas quite thoroughly. Suddenly, she picked up another frosted pastry, and then another! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealization hit Tenten like a brick, Sakura was a sleepwalker! Or, maybe in this case a sleep eater. The unbunned girl snickered as she watched her friend gorge herself on Ryu's confections, even half asleep it seemed that she couldn't get enough of it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her bout with the eclairs, Sakura's subconcious guided her back to her futon. She stumbled back into their shared room and layed back down on her futon. Soon enough, it was like she hadn't gotten up at all! Tenten steadilly leaned over to see whether or not Sakura was really asleep. \"S-Sakura?\" she peeped, \"You okay?\" Of course, the slumbering ninja didn't answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten lay back down on her bed, apparantly her debate over midnight snacking had solved itself. Too bad she didn't get any...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Tenten awoke to yet another one of Ryu's hearty breakfasts as per her schedule. She soon found that even Ryu's oatmeal was wonderful, and it wasn't any less wonderful after her fifth helping. \"Another serving, Sakura-chan?\" Ryu asked politely, \"I think I can scrape another bowl from the pot, if you want.\" The bloated ninja pat her stomach, finding that for the first time she had some room left after one of Ryu's meals. \"Oh, thank you Ryu-kun,\" Sakura stood up, \"But I think I'll have one of those eclairs from yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She has no idea!' Tenten said to herself through a spoonful of oats. She watched as Sakura looked around for the desired confection, only to find an empty tray. \"Ryu-kun, did you move the eclairs?\" she asked innocently, checking the fridge, \"No, Sakura-chan...\" Ryu said innocently, \"Tenten-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snickered, \"No, I didn't move them Sakura-chan, we must have <i>eaten</i> them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura pouted, \"Fine, I guess I will have another bowl then...\"</span></div></div>",

Sighing at the obvious reminder of her adopted lehrargic way, she simply pick off the crumb and tossed it into her hungry mouth.  A few more pages and some more fallen crumbs towards her generous gut, something snapped inside the girl's poor psyche.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah!  I'm so bored!\" yelled the girl as she jumped up from her bed, her entire chubby body quivering with respect to the motion.  In her next crazed action, Tenten jumped back on her bed, belly first and screamed into her pillow, her jiggly rump also became raised into the air.  Her distressed yell continued until her very lungs ran out of precious air.  She wanted to yell again, she wanted to yell a hundred times over, but that wouldn't change anything.  Feeling somewhat depressed, she sat back up, raised her chubby legs towards her soft breasts and held them with her hands.  She sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I ever seem to do lately is eat and eat.\" sadly thought the girl as she reflected on the cause of her current dilema.  She had no idea that training her body took so much of her time before.  Without that or her teammates, there was literally nothing the girl could do to avoid the gourmet cooking assaulting her plumped figure.  Though she had her two friends at her humble apartment nearly 24/7, the girl sometimes grew lonely.  Due to Sakura and Ryu's intense passion for creating food, they easily formed a strong bond with one another.  She often felt like the third one out.  The only time where she was able to talk to them casually, would be when they ate together, or the two called out to Tenten to taste test on of their new creations.  Every answer of her many sources of discomfort seemingly came from food.  The two week mark for Ryu's stay was this very day and Tenten didn't know how long before she officially became obese or until she snaps and kills the poor boy.  But there was one thing that was certain.  She needed to find out more on her guest!  Feeling her resolve growing, she rose from her position, actually feeling full of pep, which seemed like such a foreign concept in respect to her new and flabby body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Right, there's definently something up with Ryu.  No one could ever get so fat so quickly in such a short amount of time, even with delicious cuisine!' deduced the girl as she rubbed her gut, seemingly agreeing on her hypothesis.  Even though Ryu became such a good friend in the past few weeks, her current reasoning seemed to ignore the possiblity of chef-nin simply being a na\u00efve young man with a passion for what he loves.  She was about to leave her room until something on the floor near her caught her attention.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what's this?\" said Tenten as she looked down, with a bit of difficulty as her beautifully soft belly and swollen breasts slightly obscured her view.  It seemed to be a lone cookie that fell from her plate.  Though it might have been on her floor for a few good minutes, it looked like it was okay to eat.  After all, it was her room right?  Tenten bent down and reached for the lost treat until she heard a loud noise and froze instantly.  It sounded like a rather large ripping sound and the girl could literally feel her face grow pale.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ripped her pants.  Yes, the bane of all those who've gone under rapid weight gain and now Tenten was one of them.  A clear tear was visable going down the backside of her pants, revealing her red stripped panties, which were clearly strained having to contain her glorius rounded buns.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being fat sucks...\" </span></div></div>",

If anyone had information  on the ninja-chef, it would be the Hokage. For this reason, Tenten had interrupted Tsunade's busy morning of half-heartedly filing paperwork for a small interview. Tsunade was more than happy to comply, so long as it kept her from reading one more dreadful contract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm afraid I can't tell you much.\" Tsunade pushed a stack of paper to the side carefully, \"His native village is friendly enough, but they're not too keen on sharing information.\" the older woman shifted her attention back to Tenten, \"But I'll do what I can to help; he's not causing any trouble is he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weapons mistress cringed; she would have liked to complain about the weight she was putting on while Ryu was her guest, but obviously Tsunade was not the right person to complain to. \"Oh no, he's been great, it's just...\" she paused, trying to conjure up a good fib, \"Cultural interest?\" The Hokage narrowed her eyes, sending shivers through Tenten's entire pudgy form, \"Cultural interest?\" she parroted skeptically. \"Uh, yeah, I really- uh... I really want to know more about Ryu-kun's village; the way he talks about it makes it sound so fun!\" she trailed off with a nervous giggle. Tsunade's eyebrows furrowed questionably, \"Tenten, are you <i>sure</i> you're up to acting as Ryu's bodyguard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Of course!\" she answered rather quickly, \"It's no hassle at all, I'd just like to know a little more about Ryu-kun and where he comes from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade's features relaxed, \"Well, like I said, I don't know much more than you do.\" she started pawing about her desk in search of a file that, if she recalled correctly, held some tidbits of information on the mysterious chef-nin. Finding the desired file after a few moments of searching, she began thumbing through the contained paperwork. \"Is there anything... unusual- er, <i>interesting</i> I should know about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a look of mild dissappointment slowly crept onto Tsunade's rounded face. \"Sorry, but other than a few minor details and his blood type, the only thing I know about him is how wonderful a chef he is.\" Tenten giggled anxiously, \"Hehe, yeah, he really is, isn't he?\" she wasn't much in the mood for laughing, it made her stomach jiggle awkwardly. \"Speaking of which...\" Tsunade took a minute to pause, blushing slightly, \"Did he... send anything?\" Tenten shook her head, indicating a no, \"I kinda didn't tell him that I was coming.\" The portly woman seemed a little dissappointed, \"Well then... I expect two helpings next time.\" Tenten sweatdropped, bowing as she attempted to leave the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you anyway, Tsunade-sama.\" the bunheaded plumper was a little put off at the lack of information regarding her houseguest. His cooking skills were heavenly, and he was a very nice guy; but Tenten was still driven, and the lack of information was a little disturbing considering he was such a pleasant fellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tenten, wait...</span></div></div>",

Still feeling a bit agitated for not getting the answers she saught for, she hadn't noticed that she gave the response in a rather rude manner.  Being a seasoned leader, Tsunade could instantly tell that her younger friend was somewhat disappointed with their talk.  The old woman had felt with her share of stubborn in the past after all!

I'm sure he'll be happy enough to.\" said Tsunade as she flashed a motherly smile to Tenten.  A bit surprised at her sudden mood change, the softer girl looked at het a bit funny, until she got over the feeling and flashed her own warm grin.  Afterwards, the young ninja left her office, giving Tsunade a clear view of her wide, jiggily rump and fully developed thunder-thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Looks like someone needs to go on a diet!' hypocritically thought Tsunade.  Suddenly she realized she still had tons of paper work to and let out a disgruntled sigh.  However hunger overtook her sense of duty and she called out to her heavier assistant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shizune!  I'm in the mood for some ribs!

It would only be a few more minutes until she finaly reached her apartment.  Before she opened the wooden door, Tenten felt compelled to wait a bit to catch her breath.  It seemed that even now even walking long distances took a hefty toll for her recently fattened figure.  Looking down at her rising and falling chest, she grabbed a roll of her gut and looked at it with contempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really hate you.\" was all the girl said to her perfectly innocent bellyfat.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as she opened the door, the smell of home cooking flooded out of the doorway. Despite her contempt for own weight, Tenten found that her despised paunch started to growl furiously. And while the wafting aromas were certainly enough to get a rise out of Tenten's appetite, there was something a little off about them. They weren't quite up to par, or at least not up to Ryu's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tenten-chan!\" Sakura greeted her bunhaired roomie with an excited giggle, \"What do you think, does it smell good?\" she gestured over to the kitchen, where several of Ryu's most basic meals had been concoted by his pink haired protege, \"I've been cooking all morning!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten twitched slightly, she had long anticipated the day that Sakura would contribute to her growing waistline; today was apparantly the day that Sakura's cooking talents had gotten to the point where she no longer required Ryu pulling the strings. \"Oh... that's <i>great</i>!\" Tenten's tone had a hint of sarcasm to it, luckilly for her Sakura was too hyped up on her own skills to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten was glad Sakura had gotten what she wanted out of Ryu's tutelege, she seemed really happy now that she could cook. But unfortunately, Tenten knew Sakura would want to further her education beyond basic; and that meant many more meals would come out of that kitchen and go straight into Tenten. If she didn't start avoiding some of those meals now, who knows how she would look by the end of the month! A chibi-Tenten came to mind, starting out small but quickly growing rounder and rounder. The chubette shuddered at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sakura?\" she figured that conversing with Ryu would kill two birds with one stone, \"Where's Ryu-kun, I really need to talk with him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura, who had returned to the oven, delegated plainly, \"He's out right now,\" she paused to take a slurp of stew, \"Ryu-kun thought he'd try to go around the village with Temari-san today.\" Tenten gulped, 'Poor Temari-san... she has no idea what she's getting into...' she thought to herself; starting to slowly retreat from the kitchen, growing just a little bit wary of the gleam in Sakura's eye; \"Hey, Tenten?\" Sakura's voice stopped the weapon-nin in her tracks, \"Would you mind, I'm not sure this is very good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten's breathing hastened as her anticipation grew, \"U-Uh... n-no problem, Sakura-chan.\" she said warilly. Surely just <i>following</i> Ryu's cookbook didn't make a perfect chef, Sakura had a long way to go before becoming a chef of his caliber right? As the pinkette scooped a spoonful of udon out of the pot and spooned it past Tenten's full lips, she would find herself wrong... yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't <i>quite</i> up to competition with Ryu's cuisine, Tenten could taste the difference, but it had it's own very unique taste to it. Unfortunately for the poor ninja acting as taste tester, it was just as good in it's own way. As she digested. the same warm feeling caressed her plump stomach, the sooting sensation travelling through her pudgy gut. Her cheeks grew flushed and hot, muscles relaxing at the wonderful food. Her stomach rumbled, begging for more, \"Th-Thank you, Sakura-chan, it was really good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plump medic-nin smiled, \"Great! You go sit, I'll get a bowlful and join you!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once again, the plumped ninja found herself at one of the ends of a feeding session.  Despite the small fact that Sakura's food didn't taste exactly like Ryu's, she still found herself drawn to the cuisine.  She sighed as she slurpped more of the soup, letting the warm broth fill her very soul.  She sighed as she patted her hungering belly.  Tenten had barely noticed that Sakura had soon returned to the table with her own hearty bowl of udon.  Almost instantly, the chubby pink-haired girl dug into her self-made meal eagerly.  Sakura considered it such a pleasure to enjoy something that she had cooked all by herself.  In no time flat, the medic nin devoured her serving and found herself craving second helpings.  Without a word, the girl rose from her seat, letting out an audiable 'omph' as she did and went towards the kitchen to fill her still-Hungary gut.  Tenten took note that has the chubby medic walked away, it looked as if her black shorts were going to give out at any moment.  The shorts seemed to be incredibley strained againts the girls growing rear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Though it looks like mine are gonna give our too.' thought the eating girl as she looked down at her own pants that were appearing especially thight against her thick and heavy thighs. The brown-haired girl was still on her first helping, thinking that if she ate more slowly, she wouldn't be as fevored for more of the amazing cooking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't think it's working...' thought the girl to herself as she felt the craving coming from deep within her being.  Given into her hunger, the bunheaded girl followed her friend's lead and quickly finished the first helping of udon.  \"Hey Sakura-chan!  Can you pour me a new bowl!\" shouted Tenten as she waved around her empty bowl, trying to get her fatter friend's attention.  Sakura gladley complied. She was very pleased that her friend enjoyed her food so much!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\\1 Hour Later//<br>\r\nA single hour had passed and both girls rested in their chairs, their bellies full and being gently rubbed, with their seats beginning to creak under the heavy masses of each girl.  Tenten felt stuffed for what felt like an everyday occurence to her.  By now, she had learned the different attributes of the familiarized sensation.  She had always felt discomfort due to her strained midsection, but always felt a warmer sensation eminating from her body.  It often felt soothing, like there was a warm air eveloping her very soul, putting her at ease.  Perhaps this was the reason she began to overeat?  Before she could come to her own conclusion, her philosophical thoughts were interupted by Sakura giving off a rather large groan.  Tenten quickly looked towards her friend to see if anything was wrong.  What she saw was Sakura simply looking as if she was having trouble with her clothes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong Sakura-chan?\" worringly asked the bunheaded girl.  At the sound of the other girl's voice, Sakura jumped up in her seat a bit, her body shaking all the while.  Clearly she became shocked by Tenten disturbing the silence of the room.  As Sakura saw Tenten eye her, her cutely rounded face lit up with a small blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Ah, it's just that it seems like my shorts shrunk in the wash and they're kinda digging into my stomach a bit.  Do you mind if I unbuttoned them?\" politely asked the blushing girl, severly embarassed by her current plight.  She played with the waist of her skirt as the 'shrunken' material dug into the soft flesh of her thighs and generous pale gut.  Tenten had to physically restrain herself from laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Has she no idea of exaclty how fat she's gotten?' thought Tenten sporting a soft grin.  \"It's fine Sakura-chan.  But maybe you should check the rest of your clothes.  The shorts might not have been your only clothes to have become smaller.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thanks for understanding.\" somewhat rapidly replied the other girl as she didn't want to waste time to relieve the constraining feeling around her soft midsection.  Her chubby fingers undid the incredibly strained button and out flowed her hefty belly as it surged forward to rest on her expanded lap.  She gently massaged the areas where her bellly was contrained, easing the soft muscles and tension between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so much better.\" said Sakura, stiffling a moan as to not embarass herself further.  Tenten herself felt like her pants had become somewhat of a hinderenc themselves and chose to copy te medic's actions and unbutton them.  Her strained belly eased itself a bit and she gently rubbed it with affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe you aren't so bad after all.' thought the weapon lover as she felt the softness of her gut with the touch of each finger lightly caressing it.  After a few more minutes of easy their overworked guts, Sakura slowly stood up, as to not upset her stuffed figure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should probably clean the kitchen now.  Ryu-kun wouldn't like to see it so messy.  Please excuse me Tenten-chan.\" announced Sakura as she went in the direction of Tenten's humble kitchen.  The brown-headed girl noticed that even though Sakura's shorts were unbuttoned, it still held up and remained on her heavy lower body.  She guessed that the medic's hips and thighs were fattened to the point where she could easily hold them up without actually trying.  Tenten, deciding to lounge in the living room, picked up her own plump figure from her strained seat.  However once she successfully got up, a disturbing fact made itself aware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap, now I'm fat enough to pop buttons and keep my pants up without trying.\" said the slighty peeved girl.  She looked down to her plump gut and saw that it did well to cover the flaps needed to rebutton the fabric.  Chalking this up as another reason of why being far sucks, she plopped her large rear down on her couch, and settled herself with the cushions.  She began to watch the program on tv (hell, even that was about cooking!) but found herself unable to focus.  Sitting there, her fat body fit well with the surrounding softness of the couch and the girl felt such at ease by the comfort.  Soon, her eyes felt heavy and she felt herself drifting off...    </span></div></div>",

Tenten looked at her with a blank expression, still in the stage between sleeping and conciousness. \"B-But Temari-san, you insisted on seconds and-\" Ryu was cut off by another groan from the quadriponytailed suna-nin, \"I don't (urp) <i>care</i> what I said, don't ever let me eat that much food ever again!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Tenten realized what was going on, a satisfied smirk slowly crawling onto her cutely rounded face; apparantly there was one thing Tenten was better at than Temari: keeping up with Ryu and his neverending stream of cuisine. Or was that even a good thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Temari-san, are going to be okay for dinner tonight?\" Sakura asked, concerned for the poor desert ninja's health. \"No I'm not gonna be (urp) okay!\" she snapped back, \"Your stupid friend stuffed me like a prize hog!\" Tenten let out an audible giggle, ruining her facade of semi-conciousness. \"You think this is funny?!\" Temari barked back, Tenten raising her hands defensively, \"Of course not, Temari-san, I'm just... uh... remembering a funny dream!\" her lie was obvious, and made even moreso by her nervous giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, I'm going back to the hotel.\" Temari huffed as she tried to heave herself up from the couch, finding that her swollen belly acted as a much unwanted anchor. \"A-Are you sure, Temari-san?\" Sakura swiftly made her way over to her foreign friend's side, helping her up from the couch, \"You don't look like you can walk very well...\" she said as she watched the suna-nin awkwardly waddle her way about the apartment.

Tenten waved her arms about wildly, \"Hey, you should be asking me!\" she cried, \"This is <i>my</i> apartment, remember?!\" The plump foreigner chuckled slightly, \"Of course, I'm sorry Tenten-chan!\" Ryu apologetically bowed repeatedly, \"Do you have a problem with Temari-san staying here for dinner?\" Temari cringed and turned pale, \"For dinner?\" she parroted, \"I thought we were agreed that I was never going to eat again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten giggled again as she shifted her pudgy frame into a seated position, then raising from her inflated bum to a stand. She stretched, inadvertantly pulling her shirt from over her softened paunch and allowing it to jut out, 'Well, I guess since Temari's staying for dinner I suppose I should use this time to talk with Ryu.' she said to herself, \"Ryu, do you have a minute?\" she asked aloud, \"I mean, we have a while before dinner and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding Tenten-chan?!\" Sakura asked as she grabbed a bottle of water from the fridge, \"You've been asleep for hours on end- I'm <i>starving</i>!\" The weapon-nin turned just as pale as the too-taut Temari, \"H-Hours?\" she asked aloud; that was plural! That meant at least 120 minutes of mindless sedentary slumber that allowed all those calories with Sakura to just stick themselves onto her belly- making her fatter and fatter! Inner Tenten bit her lower lip and stretched it, 'Damn!!' she cursed herself for her laziness<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what would everyone like for dinner tonight?\" Ryu asked politely as he situated himself at the oven, \"Something foreign maybe?\" Sakura raised her hand excitedly, a smile across her chubby face, \"Ooh, can we have hamburgers tonight?!\" she pleaded, \"I know it's not foreign, but I've been craving them all day!\" Ryu smiled at his unofficial student, \"Sure thing, does that suit everyone?\" he turned to the bloated, bottomheavy bunhead and the stuffed, sandy blonde suna girl; who gave neither signs of approval at more fattening cuisine or disapproval at starvation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, I suppose I'll get started!\" he said, \"Sakura-chan, would you please bring me those speakers, this stove top doesn't have a wide enough grill head and I'm afraid that if I don't make one, the hamburgers won't come at a quick enough pace for everyone.\"</span></div></div>",

Her tight ninja pants were still unbuttoned, by now it seemed as if she'll never be able to fit the flaps over her growing bellyfat.  It even seemed as her gut bulged out even further to rest on her flabby lap.  Triple-decker bacon burgers would do that to anyone, especially bun-haired girls!

Temari was struggling with both her severly full stomach, especially considering that she had eaten not too long ago with Ryu, and also the red sash to her black ninja outfit.  The soft fabric was now cutting into her her slight belly and causing great discomfort for the Suna-nin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ryu-kun!  Can you bring me another burger. I'm still feel like I can fit some more food in my stomach!\" exclaimed the gluttonis girl as she waved towards her chef-friend, her entire arm jiggiling in the motion.  Tenten almost feel out of her seat when she heard what her friend had asked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Is she serious!\" thought the brown-haired girl as she witnessed her pink plumper of a friend slowly massage her eager belly, to further soothe from it's deep hunger.  She the noticed Tenten look at her in a strange way.  Her rounder face, with her second-chin fully developed, gently smiled at her friend.  \"Something wrong Tenten-chan?\" sweetly asked the cute girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you have a bit of sauce on you cheeks.\" lied the brown-haired girl, trying to save herself from a bit of embarassment.  She looked to Temari, hoping that she didn't catch her lie, only to find the other girl too busy trying to loosen the red fabric holding back her gut.  Sakura's face blushed a tons somewhat close to the color of her bubble-gun pink hair, abd she quickly grabbed a napkin to whip her soft cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Tenten-chan.  That was a bit embarassing.\" answered Sakura.  Soon following, silence fell among the three girls.  Sakura was too busy anticipating her next burgee and Temari was seemed to still be struggling with her additional mass to her midsection.  Tenten decided it was best to head over to the kitchen in an attempt to speak with her 'mysterious' friend.  She failed to ponder over the fact that it might prove difficult to get Ryu's attention while he was in 'cooking mode.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit, if you guys are gonna keep feeding me like this, I'm going back to Suna as a heavyweight plumper!\" complained Temari, her sash fully removed and her slight belly resting over her waistline.  \"Huh, what do you mean?\" asked a somewhat confused Sakura.  Temari blinked a few times, trying to see if her friend was joking or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'rs not serious are you?\" asked Temari as she looked at the pink-haired girl's na\u00efve and chubby face.  Before she would be dragged into this possible dilema, Tenten slowly rose from her seat, grunting a bit due to her hefty weight and slowly made her way towards her small kitchen.  Luckily, the two girls didn't notice her disaperance.  As with of the times she had entered her kitchen while her friends were creating elaborate meals, smells of amazing foods hit Tenten's face like a ton of bricks.  Feeling her resolve wavering a bit, she quickly approached the chef-nin.  He looked to he busy with his bigger makeshift grill, but was also whipping up something which looked to be dessert.  Once again, she tapped the boy on her shoulder to get her attention, but a sweet substance was immedialty shoved into her unsuspecting mouth.  It was extremely delicious to the girl and she nearly buckled under her own weight due to the sheer delight it brought her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my special three cream cake batter ice cream!  How does it taste?\"   </span></div></div>",

As her pinkhaired friend bent over slightly to administer said punch, Tenten could see her backfat spilling eversoslightly out of her shorts. \"S-Sakura-chan?\" Ryu peeped out of the kitchen, making the fact that calamity was the only thing that could draw him out of 'cooking mode' quite apparant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RYU!!\" she wailed, awkwardly dashing over to the chef-nin with balled fists. the poor boy had no idea what was going on, \"S-Sakura-chan, wh-what's wrong?!\" Ryu asked, recoiling slightly at the malicious look in her eye and her flared nostrils, \"D-Do <i>you</i> want some of my special three cream-\" Sakura cut him off as she delivered one of her fatal suckerpunches, \"I DON'T WANT YOUR THREE CREAM ANYTHING!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd had it not been for the quick thinking of a certain bunhaired weapon-nin, Ryu's face would certainly have been bashed in with Sakura's fists. She managed to stop the crazed porker's mad swing with her bare hand; which proved to be a terrible idea in retrospect. The portly weapons mistress winced at the intense pain radiating from her poor pudgy palm, had she not been holding back ever so slightly Sakura could very well have broken every bone in her friend's hand. \"Sakura-chan!\" Tenten scolded, \"Calm down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe medical ninja snarled, \"How am I supposed to calm down when-\" Tenten, knowing very well that the next words out of Sakura's mouth were probably 'when we're getting so fat!', swiftly covered the pinkette's mouth with her free hand. '<i>Sakura!</i>' Tenten whispered, '<i>We can't have Ryu getting hurt or stressed out, the village's livelyhood depends on it!</i>' Sakura glared at Tenten from behind her hand, promptly removed to hear Sakura's reply. \"I'M HURT, I'M STRESSED, HOW COME I HAVE TO KEEP QUIET WHEN-\" Tenten quickly covered Sakura's mouth again, lest upset the poor traumatized foreigner even more than he already had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura, why don't you and I chat in the other room?!\" Tenten's sentence was broken by grunts as she heaved the flailing hog into their room, made even more difficult by Sakura's constant jawing on and on about the many ways she would could shove Ryu's face up his own ass; leaving a confused Ryu and a still frightened Temari in the joint living room/kitchen. \"So...\" Temari whistled slightly as she attempted to retie her sash over her distended gut, \"That was a little dramatic... is that ice cream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside her room, Tenten was busy wrestling Sakura into a state of tranquility- things were not going very well. The plump pinkette had her heart set on mutilating her friend, something along the lines of punching him so hard his he would puke up his kidneys, and certainly wouldn't take no for an answer. As her pearshaped counterpart attempted to bearhug her into submission, an attempt to use her newfound girth in her favor, Sakura's flabby arms jut backwards and she elbowed Tenten in the face, giving her a mouthful of her upperarm fat. In short, Tenten's bubblebutt was getting kicked; hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Sakura!</b>\" she attempted to reason with the hysterical kunoichi, knowing that she was no match for her given her immense strength and greater weight, \"<b>Please</b>, just calm down!\" she managed through a bloody nose. \"No way!\" Sakura squirmed, her stuffed belly being squeezed by Tenten's arms causing her great discomfort, \"Not when I could so easilly get fat around that guy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten stopped fighting with her; '<i>Could</i> get fat?' she repeated the sentence to herself, \"You mean-\" Sakura cut her off, finally calming down, \"Yeah that's what I mean, Temari-san said that food is incredibly fattening- no way I'm turning into some huge fat cow!\" Tenten's expression turned sour, amazed at the true measure of Sakura's density...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tenten continued to hold her befuddled expression over Sakura. She knew that at time of distress, people may ignore what is in plain sight, but this occurrence was simply too much for the weapons ninja to believe in. Sakura's eyes were still glazed with anger, mostly directed towards that certain chef that held a mighty threat to her 'figure' but some was presented towards her friend that was getting in her way. Their silence was disrupted by a few drops of blood hitting the floor. Tenten recalled that the hefty girl had managed to damage her nose and the bleeding seemed to have gotten worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damn, not now. I need her to be calm.' thought Tenten, quickly moving to her nightstand to wipe her nose and hold back the bleeding. Luckily for her, Sakura seemed to have calmed down a bit; she was no longer raging like a bull but her expression still spelled out her desired vengeance against the naive chef.  \"Look. let's both calm down now. We don't want to make a scene in front of Ryu, he's a very important representative of his village. Need I remind you that it was Lady Tsunade who gave me this job? The very woman who you served tutelage under and has over one million ways to inflict punishment, you know exactly what she is capable of.\" Sakura seethed through her teeth but her friend was right. She couldn't do anything risky lest she want her master to become disappointed in her. Tenten motioned Sakura to sit on her bed so they could discuss their little fight. The other girl did as told and sat her rounded rear onto the cushion-like surface, the weight of her figure caused the bed to creak. Tenten followed suit, and received a similar reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, there's no use being blunt here. Let me say this Sakura, you have gotten fat.\" The other girl's eyes widened in shock, there couldn't be a reality in which Sakura Haruno gained more than five pounds. Thinking otherwise was simply frivolous!  Before she could actually make a retort, Sakura had looked down. She looked towards her overfed lower body. What greeted her first were her enlarged breasts, easily breaking c-cup territory and straining against the confines of her restrictive bra. Next the girl was given a view of her engorged middle, the soft and flabby gut sat on top of her lap and nearly oozed of the sides of her waist. Standing up, it formed a hanging 'apron' of sorts that covered the sacred area of her plumped paunch. Continuing down, she saw how doughy her thighs had gotten, their former lean quality and muscle tone were buried under a sea of ever quivering fat. Even staring at her hands were a surprise to her, each finger had become similar to sausage links and her wrist failed to differentiate from her forearm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh I can't believe this.\" uttered Sakura still in a state of stupor. Everything had hit her at once, all of the feelings that she had attained over this time frame she had spent with Ryu and Tenten. All of those occurrences where she had gained a full stomach, or when she felt her clothes grow tight around her growing frame. Even the times when she split the seams of her dresses or felt out of breath from walking short distances. Every single one of them hit the girl in a flash. Of course what did she expect? She worked with food, she learned about food and she ate the food. It was only natural that they would leave a mark on her very being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you understand? Please I need you to stay calm.\" Tenten saw that Sakura face was covered by the frings of her hair, forming a nice double chin. The other girl could not tell how her friend would react, it was certainly a difficult situation for one to be in after all.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura?\" said Tenten as she placed a firm hand on top of Sakura's shoulder as a means of support. The pink haired girl slowly raised her head, a blank expression was present. It seemed she had come to terms with her recent gain.  \"So now what? What can we do to avoid us turning into literal whales?\" asked Sakura, trying to find how to avoid anything that would upset Ryu. Obviously they could not come clean to the young man with what had happened to them. As a chef, it would destroy his spirit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to find ways to avoid his cooking without actually hurting his feelings. Do you have any ideas?\" asked Tenten as she rested her hands on her impressive belly, a habit that she had formed as of late. Both of them thought of anything that could be done, a few minutes later, the metaphorical light bulb lit up for Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it. We get someone else. Someone else to be around him as much as we are. Are you up for it?\" Tenten grasped what Sakura was saying, and sad to say, she agreed with their plan.  <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I mean, Ryu's a nice guy and all, his cooking's great too, but still. Trust me when I say this, it comes from experience, people don't just turn a blind eye to gaining incredible amounts of weight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bunheaded girl stopped as she caught the stiffened brow and stiff upper lip of Sakura Haruno, having effectively ruined her hardened kunoichi body- while being completely unaware of it. The pinkette's narrow eyebrow twitched slightly as her eyes sunk to a deathly stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, point taken.\" Tenten quickly caught herself, \"Still though, how are we going to convince someone to just hang around Ryu for weeks at a time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we could dump him back on Lady Tsunade and Lady Shizune?\" Sakura offered cheerfully, eager to get the little overeater off of their collective hands, \"He seems to like them well enough, and I don't see Shizune once without her asking how he's doing. Do you think we could do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten sighed, \"I wish, but if I drop out of the mission I don't get paid for all the time I spent being his body guard or the room and board that I'm promised. That's this month's, next month's and the month after's rent right there. And I'm not in any shape to take up any more missions- at least not any that will help me pay the bills around here.\" the brunette jumped at an idea, \"What if we kept him at your place for a while? You know, without telling Lady Tsunade? Your parents wouldn't mind, would they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura's scowl returned three-fold as the idea fell from Tenten's mouth, harpooned dead by a look of sheer disbelief on the plumper girl's part. \"You just want me to turn into a total cow, don't you?\" she dropped the subject of them sharing a home flat with that statement before jogging an idea of her own. \"Hey, what about Ino? That's a girl who I wouldn't mind seeing gain a couple pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura we're not doing this to be mean.\" Tenten reprimanded sternly, \"We're doing it out of <i>necessity</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's a necessity that Ino get dropped off of that pedestal she's put herself on. Going on and on about her good looks and always calling me manly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura, he's not an object, we're not going to toss him around Konoha like a ragdoll just so we can try and lose some weight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, fine. But I don't see any other option.\" Sakura said sadly, \"Its either we send him somewhere during the day while we go train, which would violate the mission protocalls, or we keep him here with us, which will turn us into kunoichi parade floats!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat there for a second in silence as they contemplated the severity of the problem at hand, taking a moment to imagine themselves as literal parade floats filled with Ryu's cooking. A group shiver and then a sigh was shared between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, maybe we could, I don't know, try to resist his cooking or something?\" Tenten added weakly- though her own budhha belly was a weak testament towards her willpower in regards to the chef-nin's culinary prowess. \"I know its hard, especially since we're already so used to it... and we'll probably just, I don't know, have to stop snacking all together until we can get our appetites under control...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like hell.\" Sakura whined, her stomach gurgling for satiation even now after such a heavy meal courtesy of the blasted boy himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... you're right.\" Tenten moaned as she flopped uselessly onto her bed, chubby arms sprawled out in defeat, \"We may as well give up now and call ourselves Akimichis at the rate we're going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ugh, Ryu I swear to God if you bring that icing any closer to me I'll punch you in the face.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA familiar gruff voice, pained and dulled through overindulgence, resonated between the ears of the two coniving kunoichis as it rumbled from the living room. The two of them looked at eachother as they recognized the voice as one belonging to their forgotten foreign visitor, Temari, whom had taken a generous brunt of tonight's meal for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I-I'm sorry, Temari-san, I-I guess I'll just put it away for now then... {size=2}guess I'll save it for the girls then...{/size=2}<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a sly smile crept between the two of them, each painted with matching devlish glares, resembling a certain spiky-headed ninja, as a nasty plot formed between the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten was the first to object:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura, Temari's our friend, we can't just do that to her.\" she said, trying to hide the tiny smile of enjoyment from behind her chubby cheeks, \"It'd ruin her figure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In what universe is she our friend, you remember how she treated Ryu right?\" Sakura rebuttled, equally as joyous, \"Besides she lives in the desert, she'll sweat off any damage Ryu does to her in no time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wellll...\" Tenten's smile finally shone through, though she required very little convincing, \"So long as youuuur okay with it--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then its settled?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Temari babysits his-cookiness at your place until we drop some extra weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe find out a little about him while we're at it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll take some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More time to lose weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's settled.\" Tenten said with a smile, causing her chubby cheeks to bunch up around the corners of her mouth- her second chin flexing with the use of her facial muscles, \"We'll just <i>explain</i> to Temari that we've been assigned some other work to do during the day--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--and we'll require some <i>assitance</i> in taking care of Ryu while we're out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sister, I like the way you think sometimes.\"</i></span></div></div>",

Haha.\" Sakrua grumbled curtly as she planted one thick leg to the floor, using it as a pushoff point for the rest of her generous build. With a grunt, the chubby kunoichi had joined her two friends in standing, though with a slight unease in her stature. She was swaying slightly, most likely due to her inexperience with her recently-discovered weight gain and the obscene amount of food she had just ingested minutes ago.

So she simply smiled at the young aspirational man and started down the hallway herself, Ryu following soon after with some trepidation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit you guys... I'm so full...\" Temari groaned in a scratchy voice, her stomach swollen and taut with the fruits of Ryu's labor. Beneath her robe, a pale dome had emerged from a once-flat waistline as her stomach struggled to handle the overflow of its tank, her body not used to such generous portions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come off it, Temari!\" Sakura laughed as she not-so-subtly eased the slice of cake from her plate and into Temari's mouth once Ryu was back in the kitchen, \"Finish <i><b>your</b></i> slice already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uwooo...\" the quadriply-ponytailed sand-nin, too weak to fight back from a day full of gratifying overeating with Ryu and Sakura, simply chewed and swallowed by learned muscle response. \"Gonna... kill... you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh <i>stop</i> Temari, you're such a kidder, ahahaha!\" Tenten's laugh was obviously a fake one, but not so much as to alert the ever-dense Ryu from his cleanup position in the kitchen, as she too lowered her dessert towards Temari- a smaller slice of cake, but still far more flaky goodness than Temari would have cared to see by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonna... die...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From how <i>good</i> this cake is, am I right?\" Sakura corrected her again, taking a forkful of Tenten's slice and dropping it in Temari's mouth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, listen Temari, since you seem to <i>enjoy</i> Ryu's cooking so much, why don't Sakura and I force you-- erm, <b>let</b> you stay with him when we, uh, have other stuff to do? Girl stuff. You wouldn't understand.\" Tenten said quietly, enough to go under Ryu's hyper-alert yet strangely dense radar<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-Wuh?\" Temari's sandy blonde brow furrowed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I meant, Leaf Ninja stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we gonna just let you have one slice, of course you can have some of mine too!\" Sakura said, her hostility breaking through the facade slightly as she stuffed another forkful past Temari's lips<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ogod...\" the Suna-nin whimpered in a rare moment of weakness, \"Fine... fine... jus no more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten and Sakura smiled to eachother devilishly, the latter giving Temari a big pat on the swollen food tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad we made an arrangement, Temari-san!\" Sakura said heartily with a friendly slap strong enough to make her arm blubber shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonna... hurl...\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rays of warm sunshine peered through the plain curtains of her room, disturbing her peaceful rest and a peculiar dream she was having.  Rising from her bed, the sensation of her gut becoming pressed against her heavy thighs and plump paunch was a rather unsettling feeling for the girl and yet it was one she had felt every day since the 'weapons' girl lost her waistline in the battle of the bulge. Letting out a heavy sigh, there was a silver lining to this situation. With her plan with Sakura, she would be able to shed all of this extra lard that plague her so. Throwing off the covers, the sight of her bare belly and stretched out sweatpants disturbed her once more. Throwing her massive legs over the side of her bed, this girl began to contemplate exactly what her dream meant. From what she was able to recall, she had been sitting in a chair, a rather big one at that. Tenten was back to her thin self, the reality of her heftier self only a memory of days past. Suddenly a large noise was heard and vat of cream had fallen from the sky right in front of her!  The rest of the dream was rather hazy, but from what she could recall, she ended up breaking the chair and become a well fed whale of a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid fat, must be going into my brain or somthin.\" muttered the ninja to herself and she lifted her hefty body and did a waking up stretch, her flabby arms reaching out for the sky and her shirt rode over her belly, freeing it from its cotton container. Seeing the clock on her wall, the girl noticed that it was still quite early. Hearing a strange noise in her room, Tenten whipped her head (as fast as her chubby neck could articulate) and saw the sleeping figure of fat known as Sakura lying in the futon she had set up.  From the position she was in, Sakura's rather large rear was facing Tenten and the curvatures of her back fat was also present; it was a sight that was less than savory for this girl. \"Alright, so today is the day we get our butts into gear, no more excess eating, no more oversized clothes. Though I wonder where we can find our first lead. Maybe we should see Tsunade-sama...\" mumbled Tenten to herself, causing Sakura to stir in her futon. It didn't take long for her to get up and rub the sand outta of eyes; the blanket fell from covering up her upper body and revealed the xxl red tank-top she wore to sleep and a good view of her pillow like arms. Facing her, Sakura's rosy head let out a big yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy what time is it? I still feel dead tired.\"  The other girl let out a frown. Just months before they were able to get up at the drop of a pin and be ready for any situation, but now, the only thing they were suited for was stuffing their faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, hurry up and get ready! We need to leave before the other two wake up.\" Sakura's groggy eyes looked up to Tenten, a hint of disappointment was present on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No breakfast?\"<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nThe two overly-fed women were able to quietly sneak out of the house without alerting their two guests, leaving a lone Ryu to wake up by himself. Having done all of his morning duties,  found himself in the living room with a note sitting on the table and a sticky note plastered on the face of Temari who had slept on the couch.  Reaching out for the note he began to skim what it said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ryu, me and Sakura had some business to take care of and we won't be back until later tonight. Temari-chan will stay with you until you get back. Make sure you treat Temari well too! She's from the dessert and it would be nice if you pampered her a bit. Maybe a sweet stack of pancakes with some nice scoops of ice cream, she'll love it.\" Placing the note in his cook jacket, Ryu conveniently failed to notice that the second half of the note contained a different style of handwriting. Walking over to the sleeping figure that was Temari he carefully peeled off the note and read it. 'Please don't wake up until noon. Thanks!' Also failing to question the fact that she had a sticky note on her forehead, the proposition of cooking for his 'unfortunate' friend overrode any common sense he had in this situation. Walking off into the kitchen, he hummed himself a familiar tune while Temari slept, unknowing of what the day held for the sand-ninja.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nMoving down the streets of the sleepy village, Tenten and Sakura panted as they continued on their trek. Both of them had failed to realize that their individual stamina was at an all time low and could only take breathers every now and then to aid their poor and out of shape bodies.  Sakura had to focus all of her energy in the simple act of standing up to avoid collapsing down onto her oversized rear. The bun headed girl let out a sigh and herded Sakura to a nearby bench in order for her to avoid passing out .There was little spare room for the pair, their thighs touched each others and gut flesh spilled out to form an expanse of ever quivering flab. Sakura had her eyes closed as she fanned her face to cool herself down; Tenten did her best to separate herself from her plump partner, but it was in vain, her flab simply refused to part with its 'companion.'  Minutes had passed and both had regained their composure. Heaving their bodies from the bench, something peculiar had occurred. Sakura and Tenten were so wedged into the bench that they had became stuck. Struggling against each other, their discomfort grew as their cloths rode up to reveal their massive bellies. On-lookers stared at the pair in an act that could be considered slightly perverse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddamn it Sakura.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Genma Shiranui joined his two companions outside the Hokage's Mansion. Today was a real bitch, Lady Hokage had herself working to death on this Debugakure case and she wa taking it out on all the jounin who were unlucky enough to be placed on guard duty<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she's really P.O.'ed today Aoba.\" Raido sipped a small cup of water. His head was throbbing already and Tsunade's earlier tounge lashing didn't help, \"She threw a file cabinet at me!\" Aoba woed over his busted sunglasses, \"A FILE CABINET, RAIDO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenma grabbed a paper cup of water himself and joined in on the Kage-Bashing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nothing, just a few minutes ago she stabbed my hand with my own toothpick!\" he said, unwrapping a bandaged hand to reveal a very infected stab wound with wood shavings in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought something looked different about you!\" Raido laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, very funny.\" Genma mocked, \"What's so important about this Debugakure thing anyway?\" the bandana wearing jounin crushed the small cup<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no answer, \"Hey guys, I asked-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Debugakure claims to be a hidden village, and is doing so without permission from the existing villages.\" a new voice joined the jounin. Genma looked over nervously to see Shizune, the Hokage's right hand lady<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Miss Shizune!\" he quickly jumped to attention, \"I had no idea you were-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down Genma, I'm with you on this one!\" the black haired medic-nin sat down heavilly, \"I'm usually all for Lady Tsunade actually doing her work, but this is just too much! She's working so hard that she's not even eating anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA desk was seen flying out of the topmost floor of the Hokage Mansion followed by a loud roar of frustration from a certain blonde haired sannin. \"RRAAAAAGH!!!\" her gruff voice echoed throughout the entire village, \"THIS IS TOO MUCH!!!\" she screeched<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH, DAMMIT!!\" Tsunade realized that she had just thrown out all of her work in that desk, \"Genma!! Aoba!! Go get that desk before all the papers fly out!!\" she bellowed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could hear the nervous pitter-patter of grown ninja scurrying off like frightened children at her command. The blonde lay down on a nearby loveseat, God her head hurt so bad! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy were these ninja impersonating an official hidden village? From what she had gathered, they had a great economy and had strived even since the great ninja war! Tsunade had sent squadrent after squadrent to infiltrate this \"Debugakure\", but only about half of them ever came back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the information that she HAD gathered, however, Debugakure's namesake was it's incredibly obese ninjas. They had a special chakra stealing technique, they were surprisingly strong, and their official colors were purple... how they gathered that last piece of information was a mystery to Tsunade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey proved to be worthy adversaries indeed, they had plagued Tsunade's attention for months. And without any  counterattack from the village itself, Tsunade had no idea what to expect from Debugakure! If they launched a surprise attack, they were completely in the dark in regards to how to counter this special chakra absorbing ability!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hoped that sending Team 7 wasn't a mistake...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCombined with the stress of losing perfectly good ninjas by the handful and the tension of not knowing when the enemy will strike, Tsunade hadn't eaten in about three or four days. She had lost a lot of weight (her boobs were unaffected, much to her delight)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cheeks were starting to sink in and you could see her ribcage through her skin. Tsunade sighed as she fell asleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade snorted as she awoke abruptly, her brow furrowed with anger. She was having the most wonderful dream about a land of desserts, chowing down on giant Konoha Dumplings, inhaling pounds of chocolates, slurping up gallons and gallons of frosting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You awake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade looked around, she was in a jail cell. Perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to me when I'm talking to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gaze travelled over to the massive shadow behind the bars. A fat man, a HUGE man, stood proudly. His gut hung out of his shirt (which only covered his manboobs and a little of the ribcage area) and his face sported an extra chin or two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade snorted again, nearly choking with laughter, he looked absolutely ridiculous! \"DON'T YOU LAUGH AT ME!\" his eye twitched, \"You are hereby a captive of the great almighty Debukage!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, I'll just bust out of here and hand your-\" Tsunade stopped when she realised that her chakra flow wasn't flowing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big man pat his stomach, \"You like? It's a special technique to Debugakure, our body mass feeds off of nearby chakra!\" he mocked the Hokage as he pointed a fat finger at her. \"You bastard!\" she yelled, \"Do you have ANY idea as to what's going to happen to you AS SOON AS I BREAK OUT OF THIS CAGE?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHour four, Tsunade's boredom had reached it's peak. She had tried circulating chakra, but that was no good as long as those gaurds were around. She tried squeezing through the bars, her boobs just HAD to be so damn big! She even tried desperately digging out of prison, but the floor was made of tile...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that all Tsunade could do was just wait until someone came around and saved her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, were those footsteps? Yes! Yes they were! Had someone finally come to save Tsunade?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, it was just some gaurd. Some gaurd with food. A lot of food...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner!\" He cried jovially, \"Soup's on!\" in his chubby hands was gripped a tray of very fine foods. Tsunade raised an eyebrow as he approached her cell, \"Come on then, it's chow time lady!\" the Debugakure Ninja smiled widely as he placed entree after entree inbetween the bars<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah woah, what's with all of this food?\" Tsunade narrowed her eyes suspiciously, they were trying to fatten her up. Make it harder for her to escape. \"It's the Debukage's orders, we're supposed to skimp out on the prisoners' meals... but...\" he smiled coyly and slid a box of rice balls through the bars, \"You're way too skinny, here, eat these rice patties!\" he said as he headed out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade glared at the food. It almost seemed to glare back. She initially wasn't going to give in to gluttony. But, since she hadn't eaten in a few days...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mph... this village is weird...\" Tsunade mumbled through her first riceball...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They seem to have the ability to absorb one's chakra from been close to you but they seem to only can absorb one person's chakra at a time well depending on how big they are that is. Either way even if you meet one as long as not to large you should have a few minute's to take it them out before you can't use your chakra anymore.\" The other women said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok I will keep that in mind anyway did we find the location of Tsunade's cell\" Bird asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just did\" Another female voice said over the radio<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is see racoon\" The other women said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See is located at the west side in birds area not to far in their\" Racoon said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great I will go in and get here\" Bird said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast bird their might be a trap in their you will wait for me, snake, racoon, and pig to come to you and we will all go in together this way we will have a better fighting chance got it.\" The other women said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBird had chuckle at the name pig as another women mutter angrily at hating her name and how unfair her name was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BIRD DID YOU HEAR ME\" The women yelled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...rah...Yes bear I heard I won't move until you get here\" Bird said embarrassed of her action<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good we will all be their in a few minutes over and out\" Bear said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just as the women known as bear said in a few minute's her along with three other women joined bird all of them wearing ANBU gear and mask's of each of the animal they their code names where of. The one with a the bear mask had a nice slime figure her breast where 46 DD, waist was 24 inches, and her hips 38 inches though out of the girls she had the larges ass cheeks which jets out about 6 inches she stood at 5 feet 10 inches and she had long black wavy hair. Snake had a nice hourglass figure herself her breast where 54 EE, waist was 24 inches, and hips 54 inches her as was about the same as bears and she stood 5 feet 11 inches her hair was purple and was kept in a short ponytail giving her head a pineapple shape. Racoon was the most top heavy of the girls with breast standing at 58 FF's almost GGG cups, her waist was 24 inches, and hips at 38 inches her ass was much shorter then the other two girls only about out 2 inches and stood at 5 feet 6 inches her hair was long silk black hair that had a bluish look. Pig was more bottom heavy her hips been 60 inches, her waist was 26 inches, and her breast where 48 DD, her ass jetted out 5 inches, she was 5 feet 8 inches and she had long blond hair that was kept in a ponytail. Bird was the most average and slim body her breast 36 C's, waist 20 inches, and hips 24 inches her ass was the smallest of the girls and she only stood at 5 feet 6 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright looks like everyone is here and in good shape\" Bear said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know pig's hips looks like they have gotten bit bigger been pigging out pig\" Bird said smirking behind her mask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up forehead your pissing me off with this pig crap\" Pig said angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why so upset pig I have been telling you, you where always a pig I have been telling you that all your life Ino-Pig.\" Bird was smirking more<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMN IT YOUR PISSING ME OFF SAKURA YOU BIG BILLBOARD HEAD\" Ino yelled as she moved her her mask up and to the side of her head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT WAS THAT INO-PIG\" Sakura yelled back moving her mask up on the top of her head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WILL YOU TWO SHUT THE FUCK UP BEFORE YOU REVEAL ARE LOCATION\" Bear yelled out ripping her mask off revealing herself to be Kurenai the Genjutsu mistress of Konoha<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if your yelling is going to be helping much Kurenai\" Snake said pushing her mask to the left to reveal that she was Anko snake mistress and once student to Orochimaru one of the three senin's<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRacoon just nod to agree with Anko as she pushed her own mask to the right side revealing she was the future heiress to the Hyuga line, Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it Anko we aren't suppose to be say each other's name only talk to each other by code-name\" Kurenai said irritated at her best friend<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think code names will help much plus you just said my name too\" Anko said with a small smirk<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai growled at Anko for pointing that out. Ino and Sakura had small smile's on their faces hoping that Kurenai was down with them. But luck didn't seem to be on their side as Kurenai turn back to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think you two are off the hook am getting tired of your fighting we are on a serious mission which in all aspects you shouldn't be on. But you asked and we allowed it because you really wanted to go so we allowed so now act like ninja's instead of five year olds would you.\" Kurenai said sternally<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Ino and Sakura looked ashamed as Kurenai was right they where on a mission to rescue Tsunade six month ago she was kidnapped and though they where sure it was the people of Debugakure but their was no proof. Sakura and her team was already trying to investigate the village but they couldn't get in their secrety was tight and when they had come back it was a week since Tsunade's kidnapping. Sakura felt bad not to be their for her Hokage as well as sensei so asked to be on the mission. Ino didn't want to let Sakura go by herself and asked to come to and Hinata well since Ino and Sakura where her frineds and Kurenai was her sensei she felt she should go too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are sorry\" Both the girls said apologizing for their behavior<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine lets just do this\" Kurenai said, suddenly Sakura notice something<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait where is Naruto he should be here to\" She asked, as Naruto demanded to go on this mission to as everyone knew Naruto had a special relationship to Tsunade<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said he would cause a distraction to give use more time to rescue Tsunade\" Anko answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the sky was full of fireworks as exposions happened in abanded part of the village Anko smirked at the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn kid is good and has style\" The snake mistress said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on now we got a distraction lets not waste it\" Kurenai said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls headed into the prison as they went they had to say it wasn't that hard their seemed to be almost no one in their keys to laid on a table which they sure opened the cell doors. They traveled along to where Tsunade's cell room though the place seemed empty of even people though they saw a few though all of them fat. So most like crime's of the village or so they thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go this is the room they should have Tsunade in\" Hinata said as they came to big metal door the room had bricks all around it so they couldn't see inside<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess they wanted to make sure not to break out\" Anko said seeing that the cell would probably make it a problem for Tsunade to get out of even with her super strength<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but with those people absorbing her Chakra she won't be even able to break out\" Kurenai said not having a good feeling about this<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well all I know a few month back she moved here for some reason\" Hinata said, with a shrug<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well lets go if it's a trap we can deal with it after all their are five of use and worse case we still have Naruto and with his Kyuubi chakra they won't be able to absorb his chakra that easily.\" Sakura said wanting to save her sensei<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I hate to say it but forehead girl is right if it's a trap we will deal with it and if not Naruto will save use he might be a goofball but hell he has prove himself from time to time.\" Ino said, Sakura was touch by what she said a bit ticked off that forehead comment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well am for it\" Anko said with a grin, Hinata nod in agreement, Kurenai let out a sigh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok lets do it\" Kurenai said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey place the key in and unlocked the door and entered but what they saw shocked them all as they weren't expecting what they where looking at. Though they didn't know what to expect when entering but what they saw was not even in their thought. What was before them was a fat Tsunade well not fat more massive it seemed the Debukage's plan of fatting her up worked. Over the first the first few days the cooks would bring her the daily large moment of food they brought her the first time. Now at first Tsunade didn't mind as she was very hungry and hadn't eaten plus the food turned out to be really great. So good even when Tsunade didn't want to eat when they would bring her one of her three daily courses or even if she was so stuff it felt like she was about to throw up (even though she ever would throw up for some strange reason) she would continue to eat. And as all things happen when one eats a lot Tsunade started to gain weight a lot of it as well as as she got bigger she was given more food. Which only made her gain more weight soon all Tsunade craved and wanted only food well food was only one thing she craved the other was the reason she was brought here to the village. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Tsunade had consume a lot of food while locked up and had grown massively which was why she was moved to this room as it was so large. The Tsunade that was before them was one they almost didn't reconize. As even though she was sitting down she was about even in height with Sakura and Hinata from her large ass and stomach that pushed her up. Each of her ass cheeks where about as large as wrecking balls and pushed to about six feet behind her, her hips each stuck out to seven feet with fat covering her knees. Her feet and hands looked like swollen balloons of fat her arms and low part of her legs where as thick as barrels. Her stomach was twice as large as her ass cheeks and stretched out fifteen feet in front of her looking swollen but soft. Her was already large breast where more massive now each one where at wrecking ball size and stretched as far as her stomach. Even her face was swollen with fat as it looked more like a dodge ball with hair her cheeks where rose red and looked like they had a soft ball stuffed in them her many chins merged with her neck to form one big chin that stretched a foot from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade had her eyes closed when the girls had enter but from their grasp and the sound door opening Tsunade had open her eyes from her nap blinking a few times still only seeing blurrs but she grinned at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh is it meal time already great am hungry\" She said thinking it was the cooks like it usually was most of the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T....T....Tsunade-sama\" Kurenai stuttered out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade's eyes soon focus and saw it was not the cooks but Kurenai, Anko, Hinata, Ino, and Sakura which made the large Hokage grin at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hello girls how are you did you bring me something to eat am really hungry\" Tsunade said as she rubbed or did her best to rub her stomach<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T...Tsunade-sensei what happen to you\" Sakura asked still shocked at what she saw before her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh the same thing that is about to happen to you\" A voice said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls turned around only to see one of the fat women guard smirking at them the girls each took out weapons or got into fighting stance. The women guard was quite large her stomach shoved her shirt up displaying it for all to see it was as big as a beachball. Her breast which it self was barely been restrain by her shirt was as long as a basketball each and pushed out two feet in front of her. Her hips each stood out three feet out as her ass where as large as her breast she had swollen cheeks that where rosey red and she had five chins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would back off if I was you their is only one of you and even though you are large am sure not even you can absorb all of are chakra.\" Kurenai said in a ferious voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure about that\" The women guard said with a smirk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very sure. TAKE HER OUT\" Kurenai said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the girls started to gather their Chakra or tried to but soon all their eyes widen as known of them could gather their chakra Hinata couldn't even activate her Byakugan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what the hell why can't we use are chakra I thought she won't be able to absorb all of are chakra.\" Anko said worried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your right I wouldn't be able to absorb all your girls chakra which am surprise to see that all of you have strong chakra I can only absorb about only one of your girls chakra maybe one and half of your girls chakra right now.\" The women said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...But then how\" Hinata asked getting more worried and confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it your friend Tsunade is helping with that you see when someone eats are delious food they to develop the ability to absorb chakra and as they get fatter. They can absorb more and from the size of your friend she is probably absorbing all your chakra herself. But just incase I had also brought some friends with me.\" The women said <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly they can here some rumbling and feel some slight shaking of the earth they saw more people come up behind the women. Their where all different genders men and women all verity of sizes Kurenai and her team paled at the sight but put up a front as they held her weapons in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They might keep use from using are chakra we can still use are weapon and normal fighting skills so we can still fight.\" Kurenai said to keep their spirits high<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe but not for much longer can you fight\" The women smirked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly before the girls could react the women guard hit a button on her wrist guard she wore brinks from the walls move as two metal ropes game out from behind each brick. The ropes tied around the girls wirst and ankles and pulled them to the wall a few feet off the ground and held them tight. They tired to fight their bindings but it was useless the women guarded entered the room with three other one a fat man the other two fat women all smirking at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grh...you might have caught use but others will come to rescue use\" Sakura said angry as she still tempted to break out of her bindings<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe but for now you are, are's\" The women guard said still smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch..If your expecting to pump use for informations doubt bother you won't get anything out of any of use\" Anko said strongly also pissed off at the situation<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we don't want to get anything out of you we actually want to pump something into you\" The women guard said grinning madly as the girls paled at her words and what happen next<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next.......</span></div></div>",

Currently she was develping new recipies to bring in more customers.  It was sad to admit, but Ayame's and her father's little ramen restaurant seemed to be losing more and more customers everyday!  Right now, Ichiraku's seemed to be on it's last legs, with only Naruto and his plump girlfriend supporting it, with their immense love of ramen.  Ayame stared into the new ramen she had created with pride.  The pot brimmed with hot broth and rich noodles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all thanks to this.\" stated Ayame as she turned to look towards the cookbook near the stove.  She had recieved it from the Cooking-nins that had kidnapped her and accidentally fattened her up due to their incredibly delicious food.  After the entire situation was settle, the leader of the Cooking-nins gave her a copy of the Cooking-nin cookbook.  They had claimed that it held recipies for the tastiest and most fattening of any type of food.  The brown-haired girl used it as a reference to come up with her own unique forms of ramen.  Of course, creating new recipies did not come without a price.  As a result of sampling and eating her own creations, the girl had become even fatter than she had been after she had been kidnapped.  A rather large belly pushed against the confines of her standard uniform, sagging down to rest onto her wide hips and swollen paunch.  Her apron had to be let loose many a times in order to relieve the pressure it had against her round gut.  Thick fat overcame her lower half and settled quite nicely, giving her an alluring pear-shaped figure.  Heavy thighs pushed the limits of her uniform pants an they became near it's ripping point.  Ayame's once svelvte bum had been coated in soft fat, nearly doubling the soft cheeks.  After going over the cookbook again, and making sure she made no errors in her cooking, the girl sat on a nearby chair in order to relax for a bit.  Her heavier self threatened to break the chair, her plump bottom barely fitting in the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, that really did take alot out of me.\" said Ayame, with a bit of a tired tone.  She quickly undid the straps to her apron and loosened up her robe, causing he plump belly to spill out on to her soft thight.  Pudgy hands rubbed  the soft gut as Ayame relaxed herself.  She quickly became excited at the thought of her creations becoming a culinary success and bringing back business to the family restaurant.  Her soft and plump face beamed with hopes for the future.  As she was imagining better times, she suddenly heard a customer calling for service.  She immedialty recognized the voice as her best customer, Naruto.  She qucikly made herself presentable again, and rushed towards the front of the restaurant.<br>\r\n'Hello Naruto-kun and...</span></div></div>",

She was halfway home when she heard something behind her call her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KURENAI. HEY KURENAI\" the voiced called out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai turned around to see who called her but all she saw was a shadow before feeling a incredible pain and then darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Few hours later)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai groggly started to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What the hell happen? Ugh my head hurts worse then all those times I got hammered with Anko' Kurenai thought, as she tried to look around the room only for her pounding headache to make her whince quite a bit<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes when her eyes rejusted to the light and the headache died down a bit she looked around the room. The first thing she notice that she was on a bed thankfully fully cloth but she was chained to the bed here there cuffs on her wrist and ankles with chains attachd to them and locked to the bed. She used her chakra to increase her strength and start pulling on the chains to break them but they didn't give and her chakra didn't seem to be help. She looked at the chains they seemed to be regular iron chains but then notice that there was black seal markings painted around the cuffs and chain<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damn must be something to nulify my chakra or make them stronger then average or some shit like that' Kurenai thought in anger and frustation<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to look around the room to see if she could find something to help her but doubted it but as well to check her surrounds to see if she had any idea where she was or who had capture her. But it was hard to see anything the only light in the room was above her making a circle of light around her and the bed and cast shadows around the room. Making it hard to see anything else suddenly she heard something from the shadows like a door opening and foot steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you finally woke up sleeping beauty\" A voice called from the shadows saying out of the light<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you? What do you want with me? I won't tell you any of Konoha secrets.\" Kurenai asked angrily and said the last part with seriouness<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHA I have no need for any secrets of Konoha. All I desire is you my dear.\" The voice said laughing at Kurenai<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why me? What do you want with me? And WHO ARE YOU\" Kurenai asked in in confusion of who would want her and why and was still angry at not knowing who had her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well lets go with introducitions for then tell you why I have you\" The voice said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person walked into the circle light to reveal to Kurenai who was in shock to see it was?</span></div></div>",

Just to let everyone know this is Naruto after his journy with Jiraiya so you know what he looks like)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Kurenai nice to see you\" Naruto said with his usually foxy grin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto what is going on? Why do you have me tied up for?\" Kurenai asked worried and confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorried that maybe the Kyuubi has taken over him or like Sasuke he betrayed the village and confused to why he would do this even if he wasn't been controled or betrayed the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well to answer that I have two reasons. First Kurenai I have actually have had a crush on you for a long time and always dreamed to having you. As you where one of the few females to care and look out for me.\" Naruto said with a gentle smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of that seems to make Kurenai smile though been tied up with chakra restricting seals on the chains still worried her why he was doing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The second reason is that well with my trip with Jiraiya I had discovered something about myself.\" Naruto said with a smirk, this really worried Kurenai<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I love fat woman\" He said with a large smirk<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai had face fault with a sweat drop on the back of her head with that as of all the things she expected for him to say that wasn't even on the list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....Oh ok...urh that is nice but I still don't understand why you have tied me up with chakra restricting seals\" Kurenai said still not understanding why Naruto went to all this to tell her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehe don't you get it Kurenai I like big woman when I came home to Konoha I notice that there aren't a lot of large woman in the villiage. And so many woman here would look good with a big belly especial some of Kunoichi around here.\" Naruto said chuckling a bit<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly some of the gears in Kurenai's mind started to move as he said that, making Naruto grin as he could tell Kurenai was slowly starting to get the picture. But decided to help her a bit more understand what he was up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I decided to take it upon myself to help said woman in the village reach there true gorgeous potential and help fatten them up and guess who the first woman came to mind to start this was.\" Naruto said with a largest smirk he could mustered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is when all the puzzle pieces clicked together which only made her grasp her mouth open and looked at Naruto worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't mean your....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes am going to fatten you up nice and big Kurenai-chan\" Naruto finishes for her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Naruto please don't you can't do this\" Kurenai said trying to struggle and free herself of the chains <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was pointless as they where to strong and with the seals she didn't have any chakra to help her escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I can and I will Kurenai now lets start the feeding\" Naruto said still smirking as he......?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
