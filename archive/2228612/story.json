You couldn\u2019t tell where you were at, but didn\u2019t hear anything immediately after impact. You sat and waited for someone to come by, and it only took about 20 minutes before hearing footsteps. Your she\u2019ll opens your and you see an older woman looking down at you, and jump at her face. She screams for about a second before you clog her airways. You go up to the brain and stab your tendrils into it. Her body starts to siege up and she starts shaking violently on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up about a minute later in a 65 year olds body named Arlen. You were the wife to a 67 year old farmer named Joe and owned a little farm an hour out of Salt Lake. You were laying in the middle of the field, and remembered your husband and you woke up to check what the loud crashing sound was. You walk back to the house and see your husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe: Well, what was it?<br>\r\nArlen: I think it was something in the shed that fell, I didn\u2019t see anything.<br>\r\nJoe: That was way too loud for something in the shed, did you even look?<br>\r\nArlen: I said it was nothing! I\u2019ve been out here for ten minutes and didn\u2019t hear a thing.<br>\r\nJoe: Alright, whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go inside and go straight to the kitchen, you needed to grow spawn and spread quickly since you landed in such a deserted location. You get to the fridge and a smell attracts you to the cyborg on the right. You open it and start smelling inside, getting on the floor and smelling a bag of sugar. You grab a little and put it in your mouth, and you get a great feeling. It felt like the best parts of coke and sex and made you feel stronger. You grab the bag and a bowl then mix it with water. You chug the mixing bowl of sugar water while your husband walks in. Your about half way done and he comes over to grab it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe: Put that down, what the hell?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shove him into the cabinet with the force of an NFL lineman and he smacks his back on the side. He yells in pain and falls onto the ground. He passes out from the pain and you pick him up. You take him to your bed and lay him down. You go on you phone on the way down to the kitchen and  call your daughter. You ask her, her husband, and 3 kids to come down as well. Her husband works as an assistant coach for the Utah Jazz, so you think you can get to a powerful person and be in a better position to spread your spawn. She responds quickly and says she\u2019ll be down in 2 days.. You go down to the kitchen and finish that bowl of sugar water.</span></div></div>",

You felt extremely bloated and fell asleep on the couch. You woke up at about 4 P.M. and knew you had something inside you. You do this thrust with your stomach and and a spawn starts coming out of your mouth, you slide it back down your throat and go upstairs. You go into your room and see Joe awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe: Arlene, what the hell happened? I can\u2019t walk, how did you push me that hard?!<br>\r\nArlene: You'll be fine honey, let me give you something you\u2019ll feel much better.<br>\r\n*Spawn starts sliding out of your mouth.*<br>\r\nJoe: What the hell!!! Help!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously nobody would hear, and the bug took him over within minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArlene: How do you feel?<br>\r\nJoe: Not well my queen. Get me nutrients to help rebuild my spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized sugar was some sort of steroid for bodies already taken over. You had none left but got some at the store to help joe recover. As soon as he drinks a full glass, he stands up like nothing happened. The rest of the evening and night he both of you order pizzas, bags of sugar, iced cream, and as much meat that was in the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day your daughters family gets there and walks inside. They see boxes and food all over the place. Abby, your daughter, yelled for you while walking upstairs. You and Joe were laying in bed, pretending to sleep, then Abby walks in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby: Hey mom! How are you feeling.<br>\r\nArlene: Hello honey, close the door for a second and come here. <br>\r\nAbby: Sure mom what\u2019s up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closes the door and walks closer. When she gets close to you you grab her arm swiftly and pull her to you, covering her mouth so she doesn\u2019t scream. A spawn crawled out of your mouth, and onto your hand. You switch hands quickly and shove the bug in her mouth. After a couple seconds she starts shaking violently, then falls on the ground for almost a minute before she gets up slowly. </span></div></div>",

You thought this would be a quick process and would be found quick, but it seemed like nobody was around when you crashed. Almost a week goes by and you think this could be compromising the mission at this point, so you push and push through the leave and sticks until you get into a flat surface that seemed like a path. You wait almost another day, but hear footsteps walk past you, then another set a minute later, then another about a minute after that... but they stop next to you. It seemed the meteor was making sounds like it was ready to eject, so there must not be anyone else around. You see half of the vessel crack open and instantly see a mouth, so you jump into it. You tried to remember your training and went up but a huge scream startled you from your host. You quickly stick your tendrils into the brain and loose consciousness for a second, along with the human. You open your eyes and your on the ground. You see a boy about 8 years old run towards you that you know to be your twin brother. \u201cLucy,  are you okay!?\u201d Your brother like yelled out. \u201cI\u2019m fine, I just tripped and fell,\u201d you said. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s catch up to mom and dad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that in about a minute you obtained all the memory and knowledge your host has. Your an 8 year old girl named Lucy who was on a hike with her family. You had a twin brother, older sister and older brother that moved out. You went to Oakville Elementary and lived about an hour out of Portland. You knew exactly how to act like an 8 year old girl, and could easily pull it tart the off for at least a week. You know you had to get to some food to start the breeding process, so you caught up with your parents and tried what you could. <br>\r\n\u201cHoney, are you okay? I heard you scream,\u201d your dad said. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, I just tripped on a stick and got scared. How much longer is the trail?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLike half a mile honey, why you ask?\u201d your mom asks.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m starving, can we stop somewhere on the way back?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSure honey, we can stop at McDonalds on the way back,\u201d says mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d parents are very lenient about teaching healthy eating. Your dad was fat but your mom stayed in shape, but she would rather see her kids fat than anorexic. You could see it in your siblings though, with your older brother getting fat after college and your older sister has started to get chubby since getting to high school. You could see her panting on the way to the car after we got off the path, even though 2 years ago she wouldn\u2019t have broken a sweat. You get in the car and all you can think about is eating. When you get to McDonalds, you ask for 2 Big Macs and a large fry. You parents look at you in shock.<br>\r\n\u201cYou think you can even eat that much honey?\u201d, your dad says.<br>\r\n\u201cYes I promise, I\u2019ll eat all of it.\u201d<br>\r\nYour dad shrugs and orders what you want. When you get your bag you shove a handful of fries into your mouth. This is the first time trying human food, but you had all the taste palates and memories of it from Lucy. You open your Big Mac box and take a huge bite of it. Before you can even finish swallowing it, you take another. Within a minute the whole sandwich is gone and you go for the other one while letting out a huge burp. You finish all your food before getting half way home, and are just as hungry as before. You knew it was gunna sound weird, but you ask if your parents can stop again since your still hungry.<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you still hungry after that? That would fill me up,\u201d your dad says.<br>\r\nYour mom intervenes \u201cWell is she\u2019s hungry we can get something else. She could be having a growth spurt and needs the calories.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop at Taco Bell on the way home and get a Double Chalupa and 3 Doritos Tacos. You could easily eat more, but knew your parents would say no anyway. Once you get it you start ripping into the bag and eat a taco before even leaving the parking lot. Once you get home the food is already finished, and your still as hungry as before. You get home and watch cartoons in your room for hours and are surprised you still enjoyed them. You realize even though you have full control, you still have her attributes and enjoy the things she did. After waiting a few hours,  you feel a squirming in your stomach. Your confused at first, but realize it\u2019s the first of your offspring growing. Your glad, but realize you should speed up the process by eating more. You wait till your parents are asleep and take your moms credit card out of her wallet. You walk to the closest convenience store since you don\u2019t know how to drive, and look for the most fatty and calorie filled foods you can. First you grab a gallon of chocolate milk, then get bags of candy, cookies, iced cream, hot pockets, panned cakes, and chips. The total came to $67, but you thought by the time your mom would find out you would have already converted her. When you leave the store you start chugging the chocolate milk since you can\u2019t hide that in your room. After chugging, you look at her bottle and notice it\u2019s half gone. You\u2019ve seen people puke before drinking less than you just did, and you were still thirsty. You finish it before walking out of the stores sight and feel a little bloated. You look down and see your bloated stomach decrease by the second. You knew the offspring were growing and you felt more squirming from inside. On the way home you ate a bag of chips, pint of iced cream, and 5 candy bars. Then you get home, quietly bring your bags of food upstairs and eat the other iced cream before you go to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Next Day at School<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\nThe next day you get to school and feel good. Your in a better mood than you\u2019ve ever been at school. You were at lunch, eating 4 pieces of pizza and 5 milk cartons. Your friends just stare at you in awe.<br>\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t slow down your gunna get fat,\u201d your friend Amy said. <br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll burn it off quick,\u201d you said with a smirk.<br>\r\n\u201cI bet you don\u2019t, your gunna get fat just like Hannah,\u201d Amy said.<br>\r\nHannah started tearing up and left the table. lol you could think of was not being able to wait to get a host inside Amy. You instantly feel nauseous and run to the bathroom to puke. You go to a stall and try to throw up, when a breeder host comes out of your mouth and into the toilet. You grab it and put it in your pocket. This is the first offspring you\u2019ve been able to produce, but in this young body who knows how long till you can make another. Who do you want to use it on?</span></div></div>",

It gets to her mouth when she starts screaming, but luckily the windows are sound proof since it\u2019s got studying. Before she can get to the door and unlock it, she falls to the ground and starts convulsing. After about 30 seconds, she gets up and looks around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: How do you feel? Are you in full control?<br>\r\nLunch Lady: I\u2019m starving.. but I seem to be linked with her brain.<br>\r\nLucy: Great. I want you to eat as much as you can to produce enough spawn to control all the lunch lady\u2019s by lunch tomorrow. You all should have enough spawn by Friday to disperse to the whole 5th grade.

You knew your plan was coming together nicely, and it was only a matter of time before your whole school could infect their families. At this rate the county should be controlled mostly by us in a few weeks, then the state. One thing you knew though was you needed a new body, one that could produce spawn faster.

Once enough are on our side, our warships will be sent in with more breeders and soldiers to take the rest of the planet. We lost a critical amount of firepower and troops, so we will need at least a whole continent and it\u2019s armies to help is in the fight. It\u2019s imperative that you accomplish this in a year, because you won\u2019t have any communication with your race once you get to earth and we can\u2019t wait that long for more resources. <br>\r\n     To control humans, you must control the brain. Once you find one alone, go into its mouth to the back of its throat, and go up to the brain. Spike your tendrils into it and you should assume full control of their memories and motor skills. You are a queen breeder, which is why we sent you; one of the last of our colony. This means you have the power to leave a baby in our host and control another whenever you want. Make sure you do though, because when you disconnect from a human without a baby attached, the human dies and cannot be controlled again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Only in Oregon story, in all others all hosts produce spawn by consuming nutrients.)<br>\r\n(You can produce breeders and soldiers, which each come with their own physical and emotional changes. Soldiers will get aggressive and serious over time. All they are trained to care about is becoming imposing and hating humans. Soldiers will organically become more strong over time, but also work out allot to accelerate the effect. They can gain up to 20 pounds of muscle in a month depending on the host. They also develop retractable teeth behind their original ones that are sharp as blades, and can detach their jaws to take huge bites. Soldiers are carnivores, and can eat other people for more nutrients.  The breeders will have almost the opposite effect, being more relaxed and friendly I\u2019ver time. Their goal is to get alone with as many people as possible and spread the species. Breeders will also gain weight rapidly and have to eat a lot to feed the offspring. Some big hosts can hold around 20 to 30 babies at a time. They can also spew a gas out of their mouth to knock people out. Either can control any gender.<br>\r\n     You are also responsible of organizing everybody and making sure the spread is quiet and efficient. You can subject other hosts to coordinate things, just make sure they\u2019re smart and have a few month mature breeder or soldier. You can also assign what baby will go to what host.)<br>\r\n     You will be sent in a small meteorite that won\u2019t be opened until your alone. It will take a couple days to create babies, so stay in secret. I\u2019m counting... We\u2019re, counting on you. Most don\u2019t want to say it, but I believe your our species last hope. Don\u2019t let us down.</td>",
