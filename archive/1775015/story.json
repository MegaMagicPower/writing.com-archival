The Virus was originally designed for the military to improve the strength and size of an armies soldiers. However, the Virus was unstable, and would increase a person's body size in huge and unpredictable ways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing an accident at the underground facility where the formula was created, the Virus was released into the outside world and went on to infect millions. In a matter of weeks, most of the world had succumbed to the effect of the Virus and civilisations crumbles into chaos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><i><b>Three hundred years later...</b></i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the outbreak of the virus in 2010, the world descended into anarchy. Years later, Shadow-Tech, the secretive corporation behind the creation of the Virus, managed to seize power and began to find ways to control the Virus. They steered humanity's destiny towards the stars, developing technology to allow mankind to travel at the speed of light and explore the galaxy in pursuit of new worlds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough weakened by the Virus, the planet Earth, under Shadow-Tech's control, formed a mighty empire which began to explore the galaxy, encountering alien races, new worlds and new opportunities. But still, the Virus remained and it's legacy lived on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough they claim to only act in humanity's best interests, Shadow-Tech continue to look for ways to use the Virus to accelerate genetic engineering and improve their empire. To this end, they have set up laboratories around the galaxy, continuing their immoral experiments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\"><b>Characters:</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Grace:</b> A former agent of Shadow-Tech, who stole company secrets and went on the run after the company put a price on her head. A very moral person, Grace betrayed Shadow-Tech after she found evidence of their many illegal activities. Grace is a stunning, 24 year old blonde, who, now that she is on the run, is looking for ways to stay two steps ahead of her former employers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Brooke:</b> A sassy, 26 year old con-woman who possesses her own spaceship and can often be found in the outer colonies, making shady deals with criminals and pirates. The raven haired Brooke often uses her beautiful appearance to wrap men around her little finger before stealing all their money. Brooke has a kind heart, but she is a woman you do not want to cross. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Krysta: </b> Krysta is from an alien species called the Vizians, who inhabit the paradise like world of Vizia. The Vizians are identical to human beings, apart from their blue skin and pointed, elf like ears. Vizia is one of the worlds where Shadow-Tech have been conducting their evil experiments. The Vizians are a peaceful race who are seen as primitive due to their lack of modern technology and space travel. Krysta is 20 years of age and has a cunning mind, she wants nothing more than to see Shadow-Tech removed from her planet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Lieutenant Karlie Fairbourne: </b> An Earth soldier, commanding an all female squad of marines. Karlie is young, but experienced. Her girlish good looks often cause others to underestimate her abilities, but she is capable of kicking a large amount of ass. A busty red head, aged 23 years old. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Eliza:</b> Eliza is a mysterious girl who remembers very little of her past. She was experimented upon by Shadow Tech at a young age, but escaped from one of their labs at the age of 19. She has been infected with the Virus since a young age, but looks perfectly normal. Genetically engineered to be one of the most beautiful females in existence, Eliza was also given strange powers which allow her to become one with the Virus, which she has lived with her entire life. Using only her mind, she is able to control her transformations and expand her body in any way she wishes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Jake Stewart:</b> Jake Stewart works for Shadow-Tech as a special agent. He is currently tasked with keeping the company's projects secret. Jake was infected with the Virus in his teenage years, but thanks to expensive Shadow Tech technology, he is able to hold off the effects of the Virus with regular doses of a secret formula which allow him to stay normal. Jake hates Shadow-Tech and only continues to work for them to save himself from succumbing to the effects of the Virus. 24 years old, good looking and with a body considered \"perfect\" by many women, Jake has become terrified of losing his good looks. </span></div></div>",

She hadn't been sleeping well lately. It had been one month since Grace stole company secrets from her former employers, Shadow-Tech, and she was now a wanted woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had never been Grace's ambition to uncover any kind of seedy conspiracy at the company. While rumours of Shadow-Tech's illegal operations had persisted for years, Grace had never really paid much attention to them; she was thrilled to get a job with the company, and after being moved to the special projects division after her first six months there, it seemed as she had a bright future with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her time in the special projects division continued, Grace had begun to grow more and more curious about her employer's shady activities. Eventually, Grace stole one of her colleague's security cards and used it to access the company's restricted section. What Grace discovered in the restriction section had shocked her to her very core. Shadow-Tech, the seemingly benevolent saviour of humanity, was conducting illegal experiments, vicious hostile takeovers and had, in fact, been responsible for the outbreak of the expansion virus hundreds of years ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nActing quickly, Grace made a copy of the information, but was forced to flee after being discovered by security guards. Her trangression was quickly reported to her superiors, who not only terminated her contract, but made her a wanted fugitive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace grumbled as she tried to get to sleep. Since beginning her life on the run, she had left her home and moved into the city, where it was much easier to blend in. She was currently staying in the vast Metropolis that was San Francisco, one of the most build up cities on Earth. Looking for her here would be like searching for a needle in a haystack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment, Grace was staying in an apartment deep in the city. It wasn't the fanciest place in the world, but it had been safe so far. Though it had been her intention to leave Earth and start a new life somewhere in the outer colonies, her wanted status prevented her from using any registered transports to escape the planet. She was effectively trapped on Earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace had, however, considered her options and started making plans to escape. She had spoken to a woman about getting transport on an unregistered ship which would take her away from Earth and she had been speaking to a mysterious contact who was interested in acquiring the files she had stolen. Grace had to decide what she wanted to do next... </span></div></div>",

As she awoke, she remembered the message her mysterious contact had given her on the phone the previous afternoon... \"If you're still interested in 'comparing notes', meet me at the old 22nd St. station at noon tomorrow. I will only wait for 20 minutes. Ciao\". Whilst Grace knew that the files she had stolen incriminated Shadow Tech, there were still some elements of the information that she didn't fully understand. She decided that even if she didn't sell the data to this contact, maybe they would be able to shed more light on it for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace showered, dressed and made her way out of her apartment. If she was to get to the station on time she'd need to take the surf-bus, called so because it only travels on the roads on the surface of the city. She didn't have a car at present as Shadow Tech could use car registration to easily track and trace people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace arrived at the station at almost exactly 12 noon. She began scanning the area for anyone who might be her contact. It then hit her that she didn't even know what her contact looked like. Giving up on looking for her mystery contact, she decided to wait and hope that this person would present themselves to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Grace it felt like an age, in reality she had been waiting for about 15 minutes. \"Where the hell are you?\" she muttered to herself. She was just about to give up and return to her apartment when someone came up behind her and whispered in her ear. \"Pssst\".</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Grace spun around and came face to face with the reflective Visor of a Shadow Tech trooper's armour. <i>Shit</i>. She tried to make a beeline for the station barriers, but another two troopers blocked her path. Even if she had been armed, she wouldn't have been able to take down the soldiers. Shadow Tech troopers had expert combat training, and, as she had discovered from the files, used extracts of the virus to increase their physical prowess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take her back,\" the lead trooper said, his voice electronically distorted through his mask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe troopers grabbed hold of Grace and hauled her towards a Shadow Tech hovercraft that was waiting outside. A few civilians glanced over and saw her being manhandled by the guards, but quickly looked away. Nobody opposed Shadow Tech. The troopers pulled open the hovercraft doors and threw her inside. Grace hit the floor with a thud, only to have the lead trooper pull her back onto her feet and sit her down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't much of an escape attempt,\" the lead trooper said, pressing a button on his collar which caused his visor to recede into his armour, revealing a scarred, brutal face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Took you long enough to find me though,\" Grace bit back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scarred man chuckled at that. \"I suppose so. You know who I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace shook her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agent Wessex, head of Shadow Tech security.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace had often heard the name, and knew Wessex by reputation. The Director's right hand man, and by all accounts, a formidable figure in the Shadow Tech hierarchy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWessex reached into a pocket on his armoured suit and produced a small holographic projector. He pressed a button, and a small, crystal clear image of a hooded man, seated in a wheelchair sprang up in front of Grace's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, our wayward employee,\" the man in the wheelchair said calmly. \"My commendations, Mr. Wessex. As always.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man's face was entirely covered in shadow, but Grace could see the faint outline of a suit beneath the hooded robe draped over his shoulders. This, she knew, was the Director. The head of Shadow Tech. Rumours had abounded of the Director's status; he was never seen in public and communicated only through intermediaries such a Wessex, but everyone was terrified of him. Seeing him for the first (or what little of him she <i>could </i>see), Grace did not find him especially imposing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you begun the interrogation?\" The Director's asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet, sir,\" Wessex replied. \"I thought you might want to talk to her yourself in case anything...unpleasant happened during the course of our interrogation.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace winced, trying to put on a brave face and hide her rising fear. \"I don't regret what I did,\" she said, voice shaking ever so slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure leaned forward slightly, causing the hologram to flicker. \"You <i>will</i>.\" He turned his attention back to Wessex. \"Find out what she knows. Keep her alive if possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir,\" Wessex nodded and the hologram flickered and faded away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hovercraft's engine began to start up, and one of the trooper's moved to close the doors...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Grace huffed and puffed in response to the feeling of pure pleasure and pain she was in. When she was one of Shadowtech's goons, she read up on everything the virus did to someone,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a combination of mind, and body, change. Infected had been known to turn into bimbos wanting to hump everything they saw; aggressive stalkers looking for a new victim;cows that couldn't even raise a fist in response to danger; and a few more that Grace couldn't think of at the moment. She tumbled off her bed and squeezed her fists to combat the feeling that coursed through her. A little bit of drool fell from her lips onto the floor,her tongue flapped out of her mouth. One thought came to her mind while she released moans of pleasure. She read that the infected could retain their intelligence , without them wanting to infect others. Still, Grace knew that if that were the case, she would still probably be sold off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the virus raged through the land, Shadowtech came in to stop its effects. The business was fortunate enough that it accomplished that goal and made a deal with the more intelligent expanded. The two groups made a deal, which resulted in the infected going to a island habitation to live off the rest of their days. Unfortunate, however, were the infected that were too far gone to receive that message or couldn't make it in time. Those ones were used as living investment, being sold as slaves, pets, or perverted helpers. Not sex slaves, surprisingly, most likely do to the fact the virus would most likely infect the idiot who thought that was a good idea. And Grace knew that those options would soon be her fate after the virus made its way through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stronger feeling of pleasure coursed its way through her, which alerted Grace back to the present. Somewhere in her body, a horrible---and exhilarating---touch of pressure built up in her. Grace's eye widened as she felt this, it meant the change in the body had begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What the hell will I get? Will I get an ass the size of a car? Muscles that could crush steel? Lips that would make even a fish laugh in humor? Oh god, please don't make me a blueberry!</i>Grace's thoughts wormed their way through her psyche. She moaned even louder as the pressure built and released!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of going away, it felt like it flowed through her, Grace wondered what would happen next, but that event started to make itself known. Grace nipples stood up and she gasped as she saw her once modest bust grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace grabbed onto her breasts, feeling as she gained more of it. She cried out in shock, before those turned into cries of pleasure. Her breasts made their way towards soccerball size. all the while poor Grace's mind warped and gained new ideas.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Holy Shit!\" Grace screamed as she saw her soccer ball sized breasts blimp atop her chest. Her mind whirled as the virus wormed its way through her body. She arched her back as incredible pleasure,followed by an equally strong pain, pricked her body.The feeling rose like a waking tiger as it raced from the top of her nipples to the bottom of her groin. Rising higher and higher until a climax!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Grace cried as the effect exploded out of her.It soon subsided, leaving Grace moaning in sweat soaked sheets.The whistleblower laid on her bed,basking in her glow. Soon she pushed herself upwards to steady her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...that was amazing!\" Grace proclaimed. She stretched to work out kinks in her body, and felt her new found weight pull slightly on her arms. Grace grimaced at the sensation, but was a little thrilled by how big she was.No doubt from the virus taking a part of her brain over.Getting up, Grace began to clean up after herself. She pulled up sheets and blankets and pillows. She didn't want to infect some poor maid as well as her desire not to leave any of her DNA behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the soaked material, she slowly folded them--hard due to her immense bust--into smaller shapes. Finding them at the smallest she could possibly get, she took out her vacuum luggage. A amazing piece of technology that could take up to fifty pounds of weight and compress them into something as small as a backpack. And it looked like backpack as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank god for my once high paying salary.\" Grace joked.She stuffed her infected sheets into the thing, she would find a safe way to dispose of them later. After doing that, she went to work disinfecting the rest of her apartment. She took out some disinfectants that would kill the virus and sprayed them around her room. Unfortunately, these same disinfectants didn't cure a victim once they were infected. Which was good because Grace didn't want to be cured..wait, no. She <i>did</i> want to be cured, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can feel it getting to my head.\" Grace moaned. Finishing the task, Grace went to the bathroom to wash her face off. Turning on the pipes, she splashed some water onto her face. Wiping off any excess with her hands. Looking into the mirror, Grace wanted to get a better view of her new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScraps of her shirt were still around her shoulder, with her new assets hanging from her chest. Her pants were stained by her juices and sweat. The woman's hair was frazzled and unkempt. She looked like a wreck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn. I look terri-\" Grace's words died in her mouth as her Echo 5 communication device beeped. Running out of her bathroom, Grace hastily put it on to see the problem. Her hidden camera in front of her door revealed two drunken looking men stumbling down her hallway. And Grace was about to turn away if she didn't see the quick flash of a Shadowtech Equalizer. She gasped in shock. Shadowtech found her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow? That question wasn't important until she escaped from her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning around the room, Grace began to place whatever she could into her Vacuum Luggage. She didn't have much thankfully, as she didn't intend the place to be a long-term residence. Taking all of her clothes, shoes, pants, and valuables. Grace finished her work in less than five minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one problem at the moment: her top. She didn't have a shirt that could act as an adequate cover. Grace chewed her lower lip as an answer tried to form in her mind. Thinking quickly, Grace pulled out a towel and wrapped it around her body. It held, but did give Grace an ample cleavage window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell~ Hey?\" A voice called from behind the door. It sounded like one of the drunk men had found her room and were trying to play it off as a misunderstanding. But the woman wasn't having any of that. Opening one of her windows, Grace could see the floor all the way down. Taking a step into the cold night, Grace slowly moved down the fire escape. The cold air touched her nipples causing them to turn into fat pink peaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway down, Grace thought she was going to make it, but a familiar aura coursed straight through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now!\" Grace pleaded. But it wasn't enough. Her breasts slowly began to grow, the strain causing her towel to slowly slip off of her. The former Shadowtech personal picked up her pace as she moved down the metal stairs. Kicking down the ladder, Grace's descent made her assets meet cold steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This sucks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's feet finally touched the ground, and just in time too, as her boobs had grown so much they blew off her towel. Grace collapsed in the alleyway, doing her best to catch her breath. Wiping her forward, Grace devised her next step of where to go. On the even and steady ground that is.</span></div></div>",

He had been an average lover, more eye candy than anything, but it was not his love making abilities Brooke was interested in, but his wallet. While the horny idiot in the bed believed it was his masculine charm that had allowed him to bed Brooke, the raven haired beauty had sought him out after seeing him flash his cash around the bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, come back to bed,\" the man said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke ignored him. Rising from the bed, completely naked, she turned her back on the moron in the bed and started to get changed. Brooke had a near perfect body; slim, toned and lightly tanned, with a perky pair of breasts and piercing green eyes. Her dark hair flowed down her back, stopping just below her breasts. She sported a tattoo of a skull on her right arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come onnnnn...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This guy doesn't known when to quiet,\"</i> Brooke thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slipped on her panties, a short skirt and a pair of high heeled leather boots. Grabbing her shirt and bra from the floor, Brooke moved to the other side of the room and crouched down by the opposite side of the bed, her perky breasts still exposed. The naked guy in the bed gave her a grin, and for a moment, she smiled back, looking as though she might be about to reconsider his offer to rejoin him in the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's more like it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke's smile faded very quickly, and, in an instant, she reached into her shirt pocket and pulled out pair of handcuffs. Before her former lover realised what was happening, Brooke had already handcuffed him to the bed. It took him a moment to realise what had happened, but when he did, he began to desperately struggle against the cuffs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What the hell are you doing?\" He blurted out in a panic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke smirked and pulled herself back, quickly putting on her bra and shirt before she began to rummage through the man's possessions, which had been discarded on the floor early tonight. She grabbed his wallet and flicked through it - much to her delight, there was about 1000 credits worth of notes inside. She quickly pocketed it. Not quite the big score she was hoping for, but it made the night worth while. She was about to discard the wallet when she noticed something else in the back compartment - a small, glass tube filled with a green liquid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke held the tube up to her eye, peering at it curiously. \"What's this?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't touch that!\" The man stuttered. \"It's worth a fortune!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" Brooke's face lit up, a sultry smile crossing her pouty lips. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't say, they'd kill me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke chuckled. \"So dramatic. Nevermind, I'll figure it out myself. Thanks for paying for the room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man glared at her as she made her way out of the room, grabbing her leather jacket as she exited the door, leaving her poor, humiliated conquest tied to the bed. Not a bad night's work. As she made her way out of the Hotel...</span></div></div>",

Located on a planet similar to Earth, Astarte had the benefit of not killing the local environment when it was being made.The air was clean and it didn't have a lot of people compared to other colonies. With only 500,000 civilians and 2000 tourists coming each week, Astarte wouldn't be anything special if a word wasn't used to describe it. The word to describe Astarte is: prosperity. Brooke and that idiot in the bed came here for three reasons. Well, one of them came here for three reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One; the colony was the first stepping stone to the \"outer reaches\". The only place that was 100% away from Shadowtech's thumb. The outer reaches was were the explorers of Earth were heading, a new frontier. It was also were Brooke sold her illicit wares, but even then she didn't have a way to alert everybody to her. Which leads to the second reason why Brooke liked Astarte.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Two;do to that, Astarte became the center of smuggling,tech base contraband, and other illicit ventures. Making this one of Brooke's favorite area for fencing any of her goods. If she couldn't sell something at the outer reaches, or needed supplies, or even if she didn't know what something was, she came here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Three;the place had some <i>amazing</i> places for entertainment, hotels, and scenery. The cheap motel was because all the other places were packed. It was the holiday season and many tourists were coming to visit the outer reaches. The little fling with the guy was unexpected for one of them, Brooke was looking for a dupe. However, even she couldn't precisely plan out which hotel she could get a room at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Astarte was built with two \"rings\", an outer and inner ring. The outer ring was on the ground floor of a plateau; with hundreds of middle class citizens living around in a circle around said plateau. This is where most of the workers lived at and hung around. The ship ports were located south, the mining north and the various tech based industries was here. The local wildlife occasionally met the human settlers and some areas were cultivated for parks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The inner ring was were the fun was at. Located on, and inside, the plateau,the inner ring was where the entertainment was. One had to go inside the plateau to reach the top. That isn't even beginning with all the buildings, shops, and nooks and crannies, that the place had inside of it. This was where the backdoor activity was held and the place of Brooke's desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hopefully I can get some credits for this vial of glop\" Brooke said to herself as she made her way to the entrance of the inner ring.</span></div></div>",

Even in the weak glow provided by the substandard lighting here on the seedy side of the spaceport, the liquid within sparkled and shone like liquid emerald.  She'd never seen anything quite like it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few possibilities, of which the most likely was that it was worthless.  She believed the lummox <i>thought</i> it was valuable, but he was the type who would buy dish soap for fifty credits and ounce if you told him it was some new designer drug.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, it could actually be a drug, legal or otherwise, or something else that might pad out her evening's earning's nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt could even be what he'd seemed to think it was, some kind of secret formula that \"they\" were willing to kill for.  The whole thing sounded a little too stupidly cloak-and-dagger for her taste, but what if?  Could be a good way to get very rich.  Could also be a good way to get very dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, she decided, the first order of business would be identifying the stuff so she could tell whether to put it in a safe deposit box or a garbage can.   <br>\r\nFortunately for Brooke, she \"knew a guy\" for just about everything.    She slipped the vial back into her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe holo-display flickered and lost focus for a minute, then the McDonalds' ad -- a slowly rotating close-up of the new McPlankton, four feet in diameter -- disappeared.  The motion sensors had finally kicked in enough for the display to realize someone was standing near it, and was futilely searching for public information on her to base an ad on--not that it would find much.  It must have given up, because it tossed up the generic Young Woman Ad: diet supplements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to do <i>this</i>,\" said the slim, spandex-clad girl in the ad, grinning brilliantly.  She held up a cheesecake which must have weighed ten pounds and flopped face-first into it, \"--without doing<i> this?</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a rumble, and suddenly the girl ballooned up to twice her former size.  She looked worried for a second, then smiled again and popped a handful of red-orange pills into her mouth, shrinking back to normal almost at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Body Furnace Plus!\" she said triumphantly, holding up a medicine bottle.  \"Another fine Shadow-Tech product!   Because you deserve to be thin. TM\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke smirked wryly, putting a hand on her flat stomach.  She was all natural--she'd never used either Body Furnace <i>or</i> Body Furnace Plus.    Waste of money to blow a week's pay on taking off ten pounds when you could just keep fit in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she decided, she <i>did</i> like cheesecake.  Especially the real, rich, imported-from-Earth kind you could feel your pants getting tighter just looking at.  Maybe if whatever she'd found was the real deal, she'd get herself a little treat.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nHey, if it's the </i>really<i> real deal, and I can unload it without get shot, I'll be able to retire and live on the stuff.   </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckled, imagining herself as a blimp in Roman robes, licking crumbs from her plump lips as servant boys fanned her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeh.  Like she would ever really let herself go that much.  <i>She</i>, get fat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a ridiculous thought!</span></div></div>",

A few people walking along in the early morning air looked at her as if to say she had a good night, she looked the part in her sexy retro 21st century clothing, a variation on the skin tight bodysuits that was the usual day wear at that point in the 24th century. Then.....blackness.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome seconds later she came to....and she had the shock of her life.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was standing up and had held onto something to keep her balance..........but where was she, everything seemed so open, she thought there were buildings the other side of the street but it was open daylight......then she looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the f**k!\", she exclaimed, the buildings were there but were scarcely up to her knees. her boots had dug into the roadway with cracks fanning out and her right hand was buried in the roof of the building next door to the hotel, masonry crumbling around her fingers as she had gripped the structure, and there was pandemonium and panic at her feet, which to everybody else but Brooke was a looooong way down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExtracting her beautifully manicured hand from the debris, she did a quick check, her soft skin, the red fingernails, the rings on several of her fingers, all present and correct, no damage, and stroking her long raven coloured locks she contemplated her situation. How did she get like this, a 200ft goddess? Well she certainly felt like one as a wave of euphoria suddenly hit her.....hands on slim hips she took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooh, s**t!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had glanced down at herself and noticed a green stain on her shirt and the inside pocket lining of her leather jacket. She looked into the pocket and saw the container she had taken from the man she had spent the time with, broken. It must have broken when she had put the jacket on in a hurry and accidentally hit a pillar in the hotel reception as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F**k I need to go and get changed now!\", she said with annoyance, and started walking....CRUNCH! CRUNCH!...\"what the hell was that?\".<br>\r\nShe had stepped on several road vehicles. \"Ooops!\", she giggled, her countenance changing, \"I forgot I was big\"...and the small people scurrying around did look rather funny.........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes lit up, \"this is really kind of cool.......this could be good fun.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From the tropics to the poles the world was covered in dense forests interspersed by some isolated planes near the coasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVizia was far away from most of the commercial FLT lanes and the neighboring planets in the solar system didn't offer much in the way of minerals or life. Even the star system's asteroid belt and comet cloud were resource poor and not worth the efforts of most commercial entities to harvest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe result was that Shadow Tech needed to ship most of personell and mercenaries from out of system at great cost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the planet did offer however was a remote testing site for many of their more volatile and experimental endeavors. In order to control the markets they needed to control the expansion virus and it multiple every growing list of sub-secies. To control the expansion virus a variety of ultra-pure chemicals were required and they needed to be rigorously tested . Even the possability of stabilizing and harnessing the expansion virus's mutative properties <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was proving to be a problem for the native Vizians. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe troup of the comely elfin aliens took in the site of a crater the size of the Tunguska incident; the result of a laboratory test gone wrong. One Shadow Tech employee hadn't turned a single screw tight enough on a minor apparatus and that was enough to make the whole thing blow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrysta bit her lip to avoid supressing her emotions, her nude blue body gleaming in the light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind the all female warband, a priestsess of blood stood. \"So you see what you need to do.\" said the old but still sexually attractive woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrysta and her sisters all nodded, \"We know and feel, honored mother.\" came the reply in unison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shaman set herself down, her old bones hardly able to make the journey from the tropical land to the land of conifers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shaman straightened, her necklances and trinkets clinking. She turned her gaze to the sky, \"Earth mother, we call on you to change the life threads of our sisters to better defend our home.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women bowed, their supple, feline bodies flexing into surrender poses. \"Thank you and forgive us,\" they chanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shaman's skin from the elbows down turned translucent as her body began to prepare antibodies that would rewrite each girls' DNA in a kind of convergent evolution to the earth born expansion virus. In the past such powers were mostly used to survive plagues or famines, minor alternations or to shake up the DNA for more diversity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow drastic and forbidden measures were requires. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shaman looked directly at Krysta. \"What shall it be, my daughter?\"</span></div></div>",

The war with the Lizian's had gone disastrously thanks to a number of factors. Corporate mismanagement by Shadow-Corp upper management had seen tactics and strategy driven by profit margins and greed rather than sound military doctrine. The Expansion virus which gave Karlie and her squad superhuman abilities had mutated wildly thanks to unplanned and unnanounced experiments by company researchers in mid battle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany a squad had been lost as women and men went blueberry without warning, or turned into lustful amazons and behemoths during strategically significant moments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the day, the Company decided to buy off the Lizians, selling them a number of human held worlds as well as a large number of male and female soldiers; like an irresponsible debt holder giving up assets to their lender. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarlie's belly rumbled and her tits hurt like hell. She and her squad had undergone a mutation which at first seemed harmless enough; resulting in enormous, inhuman increase of the libido. They'd all fucked like wild animals before the men and women were separated. Then the morning sickness, then the swelling ankles, then the realization. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pregnancy had gone on for about eleven months. The smallest of the women in her squad looked as big around as a normal woman carrying triplets. Karlie herself looked and felt like she had a full grown man gestating inside her. It had been months since she'd seen her own feet and she'd been tormented by extreme cycles of hunger horniness and the need to be milked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScanning her women and the Lizian guards at the testing camp, she idly scratched one of her HH-cup boobs; the milky pale udder jiggled and squirted milk. Around her, Karlie and Megan were being suckled by off duty Lizian soldiers. The warlike Reptilian men didn't nurse and the Expansion virus did nothing to their cold blooded physiology; but the milk of expanded women gave them a high, gave them extra energy and stamina. The effect was ten fold in pregnant expanded women. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarlie's pussy clenched and dripped as she saw Julie and Julia being ridden from behind by horny Lizian soldiers. One feature of their reptilian psysiology was their twin penises; used either for simultaneous anal and vaginal or double penetration. The girls had all taken the double lizian dicks in various ways over the months and they had yet to become tired of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was tradition that kept Karlie unmilked and unfucked. The officer always went last, in case someone tried to attack the girls while they were being bred and milked like beasts in heat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill even though she was a career soldier, she was still human. In anticipation of the fuck/milking, she began to undo the bandages which covered her tits. No Bra on the planet would support them. Boobs fell free of the bandage like fabric holding back the bulging boob flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scratched the side of her smooth dome of a belly. With her tits free, she struggled to get the belt of her skin tight spandex pants. A side effect of being pregnant as all fuck was that her ass had expanded something fierce; and the exercise of carrying around that huge belly and breasts had left her ass firm with just enough fat on it to be jiggly and smackable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo Lizian soldiers, the camp commandant and the chief researcher approaches her, scaly chests firm and muscular and twin members standing up to horse cock proportions. It was fair that only the largest be resreved for the officer of this merry, horny band of prisoners. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs mad virus induced beast lust took her, Karlie thought of her escape plan. </span></div></div>",

The man in overalls sighed from exertion as he carried over to his hover-trolley. He wiped the top of his head as he accomplished the task, the dryness in his mouth caused him to unconsciously lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn. Why was this one so heavy? I mean the others weren't lightweight, but this-\" Renauld mumbled on as he pushed his package towards the ship. He passed by the port's various other crates. He stretched his back a little to get out all the kinks. Around him the bustle of motion played out as men rushed back and forth to their own ships. It was the start of the 'Second Migration Fleet', a Shadowtech sponsored foray into a new supercluster of planets. New colonies had already been set up to act as gateways into this unknown region of space. Anyone who was anyone were doing their best to stock up or capitalize on this new opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenauld's crew as one of these new explorers,sort of. His crew were more or less selling for the colonists than taking action for themselves. Who sold the shovels was getting more than the one digging, for every big winner was nine other losers. Merchants as they thought of themselves, they were planning on selling everything under the sun. And hopefully they could also get to their destination before the other entrepreneurs could do this as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"All right, so I swear this crate's heavier than the other.</i>\" Renauld thought as he continued to push. \"<span class=\"cnavy\">Wait, don't tell me.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a hunch Renauld pushed his trolley into a crate alley. He placed a glove his hand and swiped it over the crate. Instantly a blue dot appeared and Renauld pressed down onto it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Voice Recognition Required.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Renuald.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Access Granted.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenauld watched as the crate jiggled for a moment until it's top popped open. His eyes slowly peered into the interior of the crate. There he saw a young woman, bald head shinning in his sight,watching a video on a Interax II. She blinked for a moment until she looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Howdy.\" Renauld spoke.Yep, another stowaway,he should've have known.This was how he met his crew's future navigator in the first place. The woman's eyes bugled comically in her head, like, literally bugled. Like they swelled in there sockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Okay this is new.\"</i> Renauld thought as he watched the youth's eye slowly deflate.</span></div></div>",

Shadowtech's distinct insignia right above her breasts, if she had any at least. She smiled as she held her hand open for a shake, which Renauld didn't take up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" She spoke. \"I'm Eliza, nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" Renauld replied. \"Nice to meet you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza stretched while Renauld watched. She gave a few mock stretches before she finished her deed. Eliza gave another smile while Renauld stared dumbfounded. She peered at him quizzically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" She questioned. Renauld held a finger up before he quickly lowered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Question.\" He calmly spoke after a few minutes.\" What was with the.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenauld mouthed a word, Eliza didn't seem to catch on though, as she mimicked his same movements. Renauld picked an alternative route of communication, miming the motion of her eyes growing. Eliza didn't seem to catch with this action though as she mimicked him like before. Renauld decided the best way to communicate was through eloquently speaking his concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your eyes. What was with your eyes?\" He spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza's face brightened in realization. \"Its a long story, do you have a ship, I can explain when we're on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenauld blinked in realization, his mouth turning into an 'o' of revelation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit. The cargo! What did you do with it?' Renauld spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I left it back at that warehouse. Why'd you need to know?\" Eliza questioned. Renauled moaned out in distress and swiftly paced back towards the building. Eliza looked at his back, shrugged, then followed.</span></div></div>",

Eliza still trailed behind the man with barely any hesitation in her steps.A few folks stared at the bald woman, but more due to her familiar spandex than her lack of follicles. Some citizens wondered about why a Shadowtech employee was at this station but nothing more than a few whispered conversations came from that.Eventually the two arrived back at the warehouse Renauld had come out of. He swiped a card on the right of the interlocked doors and went inside, Eliza quickly slipping in with him. He stared around for a few moments, until he seemed to have found what he was looking for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to the spot Renauld looked down at the device Eliza had taken out of the crate. It was En-Clear pack, a top of the line environmental protection apparatus. A quite expensive gadget and one that the crew hoped to hawk to the colonists. He smiled as held it between his hands until a finger tapped his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got what you needed?\" Eliza spoke with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't have to get it in the first place if you didn't throw it out of its crate.\" Renauld said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. The little doo-dad took up <i>way</i> more space than it should have.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Cause its a delicate piece of equipment.\" Renauld snapped at Eliza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it can't be that delicate if you're holding it like that\" Eliza pointed out. Renauld frowned but didn't say anything else. Tucking the device his armpit, Renauld began to walk towards the warehouse's doors with Eliza behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His eyes ran from screen to screen in ways literally impossible for a human being to do a few centuries ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExposure to the expansion virus wasn't all bad. A side effect of accidental exposure and years of fine tuning viral-control serums had led to the ability to perform a number of complex mathematical jobs at once for long periods of time without succumbing to boredom or tiredness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTechnically Shadow-Tech were a bunch of scumbags and every year they insisted on cutting his budget, but he always fought them back for it. He needed that budget not only to manage his somewhat extravagent lifestyle but to also maintain his perfect body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking from home on a remote district in Mars colony, Jake worked like seven Starcraft players combined in one body but had the actual body of an olympian. Six feet tall, blonde, chiselled and muscular enough to look healthy without looking inhuman many women considered him the perfect man. Viral side effects made his tongue unusually long and prehensile, able to eat pussy and like a god and find even the most difficult clitoris. It was hyper sensitive to touch and pheramones so he knew what a woman was feeling as well as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't just the perfect man because his twelve inch cock could be as gentle or as brutal as a woman wanted. Or that he had a minor ability to inflate his dick depending on how tight or adventurous a woman was. he would please the most demure virgins or the most jaded size queens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis duty with Shadow-Tech was to help keep their various operations secret. Even after over a century of research Virus Designation E-1029A was still highly volatile and had unpredictable evolutionary paths. If an experiment got out, or went wrong then the company could lose millions of credits. Or worse in Jake's own opinion, someone could get hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA viral strain programmed to turn women into super soldiers had the unexpected side effect of turning them into horny, expectant mothers who wanted nothing but to fuck. He'd send them off to a prison camp belonging to a reptillian race. The girls wouldn't be happy but he knew for a fact that the reptilian overlords would treat them better than the company's repossession or assassination teams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake stopped and took off his headset, even his abilities had their limits. Stretching, his toned muscles bulged and flexed in the easy light of his private den. His only piece of clothing, a tight speedo bulged with his impressive junk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dind't want to think about what would happen if he quit Shadow-Tech and couldn't get access to his serum. But he could never shake how he was ruining people's lives. Sure the girls on the reptilian planet would be alive but he doubted they'd appreciate being sold as prisoners or slaves to two-dicked reptile men. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had too much to lose, to leave this position. So he kept on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he'd been working for nearly eighty hours non stop, it was time for a break. </span></div></div>",
