            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>School had just finished as Arcadia rode the bus home, her headphones at max volume to silence the noise of the kids around her. As the bus stopped, she stood up and walked off the bus and across the road to her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm home!\" she called as she shut the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello!\" her mother called from the kitchen doorway. Arcadia smiled and hugged her mother before heading into her room. Her room was designed in an oriental gothic theme, a 72\" HD TV on the wall, a Xbox 360 and stereo system. She had a futon on the right wall and a twin sized bed decorated in black and silver butterflies. Arcadia sighed deeply and dropped her backpack next to the closet door as she plopped down onto her bed. She swung her legs freely over the bed's edge and closed her eyes before her mother's voice rang out through the silence <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arcadia! Don't forget your little friend is coming to stay for the weekend! CLEAN UP!\" She shouted from the kitchen. Arcadia mumbled and nodded to herself before hopping up from her bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ A few hours later~ <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArcadia whipped the sweat from her brow as she fell onto the couch, her legs giving out from under her. She went into her room and shut the door as her mother began setting up for Arcadia's friends, Alex. With his parent's permission, Alex was allowed to stay at her house the entire weekend. Mom and Dad trust Arcadia enough to leave her and Alex alone for a few hours while they go and pick up their eldest daughter, Megan, from the airport; just getting back from visiting her grandparents in Germany. Arcadia agreed, along with Alex, and Her mother began setting the living room up with snacks of all sorts and drinks, movies included ^^. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rang as Arcadia sat on the couch, reading her Halo: the fall of reach book and her mom ran out happily. \"Answer it!\" her mother urged almost in a hushed tone and Arcadia simply rolled her eyes as she walked to the front door. She swung open the door and looked the guy before her up and down, taking in all his features. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex?\" She asked hopefully. His face lit up as he smiled, his eyes sparkled in amusement. He nodded and opened his arms, bringing her into a warm embrace. Arcadia laughed and wrapped her arms around him as well, her Mother walking into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok you two...I'm trusting you. don\u2019t disappoint me\" Her mother's voice was soft but serious as she hugged her daughter and waved to Alex before heading out the door for the weekend. Arcadia sighed exhaustingly and fell onto the couch behind her. Alex laughed and sat down on the other end of the couch as he began to poke her head repeatedly. He laughed as she twitched with each poke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you doing?\" she laughed and smiled up at him <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing...\" he laughed and poked her stomach. Arcadia shot up and laughed loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok...I'm going to go grab some movies...you sit here and get comfy..\" she said in a seductive tone and headed up the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned and nodded as she left upstairs. Alex stretched out on the couch, trying to get comfortable. As he watched the room around him, something caught his eyes; a strange purple vial on the fireplace, glowing in the fires light and casting a  rainbow on the wall behind it. He quickly jumped to his feet and wandered over to the fireplace, the warmth oddly attracting him. Alex gripped the bottle tightly and popped open the corked lid with ease. A strange berry smell filled the air and he breathed deeply, enjoying the heavenly scent. Alex tilted the bottle and dipped his pinky into the liquid, a purple ooze filling the tip of his finger. He quickly darted his tongue out and swallowed the small amount. It was delicious! He quickly tipped the bottle to his lips, taking a very long chug of it before setting back onto the fireplace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell did I just do?\" He sighed and sat back onto the couch, grabbing a handful of chips. Alex's stomach gurgled rather loudly and he grabbed it in pain, his body screaming in utter pain. He gasped as he rolled onto his back, clenching his eyes as his breathing became rugged. Alex opened his eyes to the see the world spinning around him at an amazing speed! He shut his eyes tight and whimpered in pain before he fell into utter darkness. A strange, yet very strong, smell of many different forms of food filling his nostrils. He moaned tiredly and stretched his legs before reaching out to touch the couches back to help him sit up, but it wasn't there...Alex's eyes snapped open immediately, but he couldn't see the ceiling, only darkness. He stood up lazily and grabbed his head. He was surrounded in some kind of grass, reaching his waist line, and making it hard to move. He gripped at it but his hand shot back. this wasn't grass...IT WAS CARPET! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit\" Cried Alex as he looked to his left to see unfathomable sized couch leg. \"I SHRUNK?!\" He cried and spun around much too fast, causing him to fall into the deep carpet. This could be a huge problem..</span></div></div>",

He would have to climb up the table somehow and then get Arcadia's attention somehow! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might as well start now! What else do I got to do?\" and with those slightly optimistic words, Alex began his journey, first reaching one of the table legs. He roamed around the giant table leg, his had brushing against it's seeming smooth surface for something he could get a grip on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly his hand had hit a nitch in the wood, something that would give a normal sized person a splinter! Testing it's sturdiness before letting go of the ground, Alex hoisted himself upward, his no slip shoes actually coming in handy for once! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Alex had reached a point where he could sit down and rest on the edge momentarily. His eyes scanned the room; the once normal sized room seemed slightly more intimidating at this size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...it finally became a reality, huh?\" Alex asked himself almost like this was some weird dream or reality show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his breath regained, Alex began hi journey upward once more. Moments later he had arrived at the tables edge and was struggling because there was no where to grip his feet firmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe gym class really did pay off!\" Alex joked between gritted teeth as he pushed himself upward and onto the gleaming smooth surface. Mountains of pretzels and candy filled the sky as Alex looked about. There were lakes of chocolate and punch, and marshmallow and strawberry fields. Alex grinned up at the strawberries, licking his lips and wondering how wonderful those strawberries would taste at this height; their flavor must be AMAZING! Alex looked at the stairs and back at the strawberries: it had taken him about 4 or so muntes to get up here...and that\u2019s when he stopped! He couldn\u2019t control it as his stomach urged him onward: he rushed for the bowl! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, there was no way he was going to be able to climb just the bowl straight up to sweets. Alex looked around and snapped his fingers in brilliant thought: he could climb the grapes next to the bowl, and then use the vine to swing over to the strawberries! Seems kind of cartoonish , but hey! What else is there to do; sit and wait? No. Alex walked over to some of the grapes that were spilled over the side of the bowl, and gripping the lowest one, began to climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's going to happen next?</span></div></div>",

The grape bowl was much smaller than the bowl of strawberries, but still somhow huge! Hewalked over to the bowl; the designs stuck out of the bowl itself and would make great use for climbing up the side of the bowl. Cracking his knuckles gently, Alex grabbed onto the first design and made sure he had a good grip before grabbing one just a little higher. Slowly, his climb began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes passed by and finally he reached the rim of the bowl! It was a rather thick rim so he could easily walk a little ways and still be safe from the edge. He looked around him: before him stood a small mountain of green and purple grapes, each easily bigger than him himself! Just beyond that lied the even larger mountain of sweet giant strawberries; his destination. He walked foreward to the rims edge and looked at the grapes before him. As slowly as he could, Alex reached out his foot out and put pressure, making sure the grapes themselves were stable enough to hold him. Indeed it was and he slid onto the first of many grapes. They didnt have much of a smell to them, they were a little chilled, and a little slippery; Alex will have to take great care not to slip! Stepping slowly foreward, Alex reached for the next grape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The climb was on.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was going well, Alex was almost to the tip of the grape mountain! He took a deep breath as he looked over the last grape; the strawberries were in his immediate sight. Filled with new-found hope, Alex gripped the last grape and slipped onto his belly onto the top. He smiled and whipped his brow free of the small amount of sweat forming. This was it! Alex walked foreward and reached for a strawberry, but frowned as he was lowering away from the strawberry. Looking down, he found what was happening: his foot had broken the skin of the grape and his legs were slidding inside of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith as much fight as he could muster, Alex began to wiggle and try to get free. Alas, that only made him sink faster. Soon only hid head stuck out of the grape and he was still slidding inside of the green grape! Now, only his eyes and forehead stuck out of the grape and the desend was slowing into a stop. He was just lucky it was a small grape! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Now what was he going to do?</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With each bite, a small piece of the seemingly giant fruit disappeared. But only half-way through the grape, Alex felt his stomach beginning to fill. How on Earth could such a small piece of food leave him feeling so full...? When suddenly, he felt the grape jiggle on top of him and roll even further onto him. Listening intently, Alex heard the sound of booming foot steps. Someone was coming!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound sparked his body with adrenaline, giving him the resolve to finish off the grape. Quickly, Alex devoured the remainder of the grape! Feeling triumphant, Alex stood up on weary legs and sighed. Using his newfound freedom, Alex jumped around the bowl, gettind behind a strawberry, as to avoid his vistors sight. But he felt his stomach beginning to grumble... 'Damn! Too much, grape...', Alex thought. 'What do I do?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Alex could even make a decision, who walked into the room?</span></div></div>",

Taking it all in Alex thought of the most logical thing to do, right next to screaming and crying like a little girl. That was of course to get to higher ground. Standing back up he looked over the room and not seeing all that much. All there was to climb up on was a table and a couch. There was no way he was going to be able to climb one of the wooden legs of the coffee table so it was down to the couch. It was a good thing he was relatively close because he didn't have long till Arcadia came back and the last place he wanted to be was on the floor when that happened. So after a short run and a great jump he was climbing the threads of the couch, but it was a long way up. He could only hope he would make it to the top and somewhere where he would be noticed before she got back.  </span></div></div>",

His head was pounding along with his heart and he sighed; finally giving his tired legs and arms a rest. The couch had a thick scent of something sweet...maybe it was the extra perfume that had spread on the couch? Alex didn\u2019t care at the moment though. as he stood and looked around; the view to him had changed COMPLETELY! The sun shown brightly from the window, cascading off the punch bowl on the table and casting it's glow where it may. Alex smiled and leaned against the now gigantic couch arm peacefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of feet shuffling from above made Alex remember his mission: To get Arcadia's attention! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex! Here I come!\" Arcadia called playfully down the stairs as she made her way down to him. Alex looked around and began to climb up the arm rest, just as he had done with climbing the couch. Seconds later, he stood up on the arm rest, feeling proud of himself! Suddenly the ground shook followed by Arcadia calling out to him once more. Alex saw her come down bit by bit: her feet all the way up to her now straightened hair as she looked around for him puzzlingly. \"Alex?\" she was answered with silence when she entered the living room. Alex could feel his eyes widen in disbelief, Arcadia WAS a giantess! Her feet could easily crush a home into dust with  single step; her breasts the size of two warm soft water beds!  \"Where did you go?\" Arcadia asked as she wandered about the bottom floor for her no-where to be found guest. Alex jumped up and down, trying to gain the giantess' awareness, but he couldn't before she walked into the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well what am I gunna do now?!\" Alex sighed in annoyance and boredom as the sight of a giantess...a REAL life giantess walking past him began to die off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...what am I going to do now...she doesn\u2019t even look at me!\" he sighed as he sat down on the cushiony ground and pondered. \"I wonder if she'll ever notice me..?\" Alex's thought was interrupted as the world around him grew dark and began to shake violently. His world turned upside down as Arcadia jumped over the couch to lay down on it! Alex spun through the air like a fairground thrill ride, his stomach far behind him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does Alex land? </span></div></div>",

It was strange that the ground didn\u2019t hurt as bad as he  thought it would: it was warm, soft, and smelled rather fruity! Alex shook his head thinking he must of joggled his mind on impact. As Alex tried to stand, he found himself sinking slightly as the grey surface rose and fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did I land?\u201d Alex asked aloud as he looked around him. 2 Large red mountains rested up ahead and he nodded, believing that to be the right place to continue his journey.  After climbing the ever moving ground and over  a grey ledge, Alex found himself on the red plain that led him to the red mountains. The ground rose and fell more sharply here, he realized and watched his step. Heat rose from his feet up to his head as the ground released the warmth below him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mountains were a mere 10 yards away now and they must have doubled in size! Alex blushed as he realized he was on Arcadia\u2019s upper waist and climbing towards her gigantic breasts in the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later the hill began to slope as he stood at the base of her breasts. Reaching a hand out softly, he gripped onto the red material of her top, placed his feet firmly on the ground as he stepped onto the red mountain of flesh, and began his climb. The firm but soft ground squished and sank slightly under his steps but he continued onward up towards where she could see him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground began to curve as he reached the top of her gigantic breast and he now stared at the building sized face of Arcadia miles before him. She was reclined back in a resting position with her eyes scanning the ceiling above her; she seemed deep in thought. Alex let go of the material and climbed up to the peak of the breasts. The ground shook violently as Alex fell face first into the soft, warm breasts and looked up at her; Arcadia had only sighed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARCADIA!\" he called in hopes she would hear him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid she hear him?</span></div></div>",

He could either try to climb all the way up to her face, which could take hours at his current size; not to mention the danger of her getting up and moving while he was in mid-climb. Or he could simply climb one of her breasts and start fiddling with it. The sensation she would feel from that could just be the tool he needed to get her attention! \"That's it!\" He said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind made up, Alex turned and ran at Arcadia's right breast. He made a great jump and managed to reach about a quarter of the way up her breast. Grabbing onto the warm flesh, Alex blushed as he realized he was touching an area Arcadia had seldom let him touch. However, there was no time for feelings of modesty. With his life in peril, he started climbing up her breast. Alex could feel her breasts heaving up and down as she simply breathed! Something so simple could easily ruin all his hopes of reaching the top...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like hours, Alex managed to reach the peak of this mighty mountain. Pulling himself and rolling over to catch his breathe, he sighed in relief. Now there was only one thing left for him to do... Alex turned his head and his eyes locked onto Arcadia's soft, sweet nipple... Again, he was beholding a sight he only caught glimpses of. He stood up and walked over to the giant nipple and laid his hand on it. Almost immediately, the nipple perked up to his touch!

She looked down and saw that her nipples were erect suddenly. Slowly she reached down and cupped a breast in each hand to make sure everything was ok; to make sure that everything was going on ok inside her, Gently squeezing her breasts she gasped a she felt the tiniest pressure on her right nipple. Fearing that is was something that could grow into a big problem if not checked on immediatly, Cara opened her top and looked down to her right breast and froze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething small was indeed on her right breast, but she couldn't tell what is was. Was it a bug? Was it a crumb? Just what was this tiny thing. Reacheing down extremely slow as to not frighten it if it was indeed a bug, Arcadia used her thumb and index finger and plucked the tiny object. Bringing it to her eyes for a better inspection, she gasped and covered her mouth with her free hand in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex?\"</span></div></div>",

He looked so small compared to her hand; she couldnt help but smile at him. She fixed her hair slightly curled blonde hair and laid her hands across her stomach. Her feet crossed leisurely across eachother as she relaxed and watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Alex...that vial...it was for you, anyway!\" She saw his curious face look at her and she giggled, her breasts jiggling and swaying underneath the shrunken tiny. \"Someone was naughty and used it prematurely though. Naughty boy.\" Grinning, she gently pushed him into her warm, soft breast and sighs happily in content. Her nipples still stood erect; her nipple was almost bigger than Alex! Her grin slowly turns into a smile, though one that was more of a tease than happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you need to keep doing what you were doing, my little Alex.\"</span></div></div>",

The thought of Arcadia intentionally shrinking him just seemed even hotter to him, which she could plainly see. Arcadia started giggling upon seeing Alex's little soldier stand at attention. \"Aww, now isn't that sweet? Maybe you need some incentive to get back to work...\" Arcadia brought her hands up around her beautiful breasts and began to smoosh them together, with Alex inside! His little member was easily rubbed against the soft flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot needing any more of a hint than that, Alex wiggled his way out and climbed onto her breast. Seeing him climb out, Arcadia stopped rubbing her breasts together so that he could reach her nipple more easily. Crawling across her breast, Alex reached her nipple. He hungrily bit down on it, which barely felt like a bite at all to Arcadia, and began to suckle on it. He ran his little tongue all of the surface of her nipple, pleasing his girlfriend the best he could. Arcadia squealed as the sensation tickled and aroused her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh! Someone's a naughty little boy...\" Arcadia slides one of her hands to her other nipple and starts to play with it, while the other works its way down south.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Alex...</span></div></div>",

Alex watched, slightly mesmorized by the sight below him. He licked his lips in thought: what should he do? Should he follow that tanned hand on its wonderful journey inside of her? Her breathing had started to speed up slightly, almost to a pant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n              Letting the rock hard nipple go reluctantly, he slid down her breast and tumbled down her stomach. Luckily, all he was was disoriented from the tumble. Arcadia's stomach rose and fell with each breath, just as he chest had done, just not as quick or fast. The skin was so soft here, he almost sunk in, but was just firm enough to allow him a walkway. His destination was the moving appendage in the distance as it pleasure the giant woman he currently resided on. As he neared, he could see her fingers slowly dancing around the outside, almost covered up by the wirey pubic hair; it was thick like a forest but shinned in the light above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n              Raising his eyes slowly, he widened at the sight before him. In the distance he could see two beautiful sights moving: her feet. He watched as her toes curled and uncurled with each move of the fingers dancing around her opening. They were simply stunning! He smiled as he saw she had painted her toes for him, a lovely shade of forrest green. They even had little sparkles for the coating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">He bit his lip as he neared her hip: will he join the fingers for a wicked tango or will he go and waltz with the two in the distance?</div><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He bowed to her hand, kissed her pussy juice covered pointer finger, and continued his sprint to her titantic feet! Arcadia gasped, slightly surprised to see him pass her hot sex up. But what could she expect? Alex loved her feet and she knew it! Good thing she had been wearing his favorite pair of shoes. A pair of beautiful, jet black slip-ons that only covered her toes up. Which of course, made them nice and smelly for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex stopped his sprint as he arrived at her feet. He was standing atop her right shin, looking up at her right foot. Seeing his gaze land on her foot, Arcadia scrunched and unscrunched her toes, her favorite way to tease him. Alex knew that she was teasing him and he loved her for it. He ran forward and clinged to the top of her foot, where he began to shimmy his way up toward her toes. He closed in on them, just as Arcadia brought her foot down, quickly, which flung him right off of them! He landed a few inches from her foot, which was now laying flat on the couch cushion. Determined to get what he wanted, Alex jumped up and flung himself onto her toes. Now he had them! At long last!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rested his head against the pinky toe and gave it kiss. Then, turning his head to the left, he took a deep sniff from between the two toes. The scent was incredible! Immediately, his little cock sprung to life. Arcadia felt it press against her pinky toe, and she contemplated what she should do with it...</span></div></div>",

Giggling, she set him on the couch, her toes laying just at his chest and lower. She could feel the soldier ready for action between her pinky and 4th toe and gripped it softly as her toes scrunched. She closed her eyes and concentrated, making sure that while one toe went up, the other down, and causing a massaging motion. Feeling her tiny man shift and wiggle under her toes was a sign she was doing everything right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her free foot, she tilted the now empty show towards Alex so the heat and smell would drift towards him and drive him wild! Her hand finished its dance with her heat and she shivered, moaning, her head back as a small orgasm over took her. Her toes clenched tightly and relaxed again before they continued their job below. Arcadia smiled down at him, only his soldier and head visible over her giant foot. He looked so cute, helpless under her warm and scented feet, but she knew he was enjoying it on a whole new level than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot sped up slightly, fast and faster until she felt his body wiggle and felt something wet between her toes, but she knew he wasnt quite done yet. this rythm kept up for quite sometime until she felt his wiggles increase 3 fold, before he slowed down to a relaxed state. The feeling of his tiny chest rising and falling rapidly against her foot pleased her entirely. She moved her foot slightly off of him so he could catch his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He knew that it must have been that purple drank that he consumed that caused this to happen to him. He stood up and realized that he was actually a little bit taller than the carpet fibers. This was good because now he could actually move about with a little bit more ease. As he stood and began to take his first examination of the room and his new size, he suddenly heard the sound of very loud foot steps banging down the steps.<br>\r\n'Oh no! It must be Arcadia! I can't let her see me like this! Who knows what she would do...' Alex thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Alex sweetie! I'm baaaack!\" Arcadia said in a very seductive tone. But she was shocked to see that Alex was no where in sight. She was now dressed in a pair of work-out shorts that showed off her gorgeous thighs and rear-end, a fairly loose t-shirt, and no socks because she knew that it would tease his foot fetish desires. Of course, Arcadia had also returned with some movies for them to watch as she had promised.<br>\r\n\"Alex? Where are you?\" She asked, now curious as to where that boy had gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Alex's perspective, he now had a giant Arcadia in her very appealing outfit before him! He could not believe how amazing she looked. However, the only part that worried him now was the part he always found very attractive, and that was her feet. He knew that if he did not get her attention soon, she might accidentally step on him, smooshing him against her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Alex took off right away to get her attention by...</span></div></div>",
