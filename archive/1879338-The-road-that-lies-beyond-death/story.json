In this world, you take on the role of either a Reaper or Player in a game where everything is at stake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you have what it takes to carry out your task then feel free. Just remember eight rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Reapers can't directly take out Players unless the Composer says otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Reapers aren't allowed to force Players to take out their partners under any circumstance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. When a mission is given out, it doesn't matter who completes the mission as long as a Player completes the mission within the time limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. When entering the Reaper's game, You must offer up a entry fee to participate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. If the Players reach Day 7 and beat the Game Master, they are evaluated by the Composer to see who is worthy of living again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. If a Player wants to, they can request to become a reaper but only if the Composer accepts their request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. If one of the Players is erased, the Player's partner will have seven minutes to pair up with a player that's by him or herself or risk fading away as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8.A player can imprint an idea into a person's head but it can only be one word at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust remember one important thing, you can't win this game alone. You have to fight alongside a partner. You can gain a partner by making a pact. I'll explain more once you get in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, Choose who you are...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(For more information about this game, go to wikipedia and type in \"the world ends with you\" or just play the game if you want a more detail description.)      </span></div></div>",

He also wears neon green gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes are amber and he has a small scar on his left cheek. He also wears a blue bandanna on his fore head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: He's has a tough guy appearance but he's quite shy. He tries not to talk much and lets his fists do the talking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just because he prefers his fists to his words, doesn't mean he's violent. He'll try to avoid battles if he can help it. He is also caring and has a strong sense of justice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut sometimes, he's easily too curious for his own good and will often be more subtle of his intentions. But he often helps those who can't help themselves in any situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow he died: He protected a little fox from being attacked by a gang. He defeated the gangsters easily but one of them set off an explosion with a gun while they were in a warehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntry Fee: His fighting skills<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPins on hand: Two pins.  The other     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Has a picture of a sword on it. Pulls out a sword and slashes the enemy nearest to him with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Has a picture of a boomerang.

He tries to recall the last memory he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remembers protecting a little fox from a gang and he leveled those guys in no time but one of jerks pulled out a gun and shot an air tank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a big explosion and then silence. He then hears a voice in his head that asks \"Do you want another chance a life? Come play my game and I might give you another chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon thought about it and decided to accept it because he still had things to do. The voice then says \"Okay. I'll drop the rules of the game into your head.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon nodded and then he felt a painful headache. The voice then said \"Remember those rules because I won't repeat them again. Now let's talk about your entry fee.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon then said \"I'll give up my martial arts to play.\" The voice thought about it and then said \"I can't find anything else you value more so I'll accept those skills.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon then felt a bright light envelop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Station Square</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDAY 1<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon woke up to the sound of a busy intersection. He looked around at the many cars that seem to look for destinations that they'll never reach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon then noticed that every person he walked by paid no attention to him. He dug around his pants and found a mysterious black pin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon gives it a second look and then suddenly, he starts hearing voices but they sounded more like thoughts than actual voices addressing him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then sees a light brown terrier walking around trying to figure out where she is. He could tell it's a she from the way she walks and stands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon then puts the mysterious pin in his pocket as he approaches the terrier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Leon gets an email on his cell phone than tells him 'Get to Tony's hardware store. Complete in 30 min. or face erasure.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon didn't want to know what erasure meant so he went over the rules in his head. He then decided he needed a partner but he wasn't sure about the terrier...       </span></div></div>",
