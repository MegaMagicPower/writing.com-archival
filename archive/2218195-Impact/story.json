It turned out the concern was warranted when, a few weeks after the discovery, scientists realized that Samson asteroid was going to impact the earth in May 2020.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorld leaders struggled to keep their citizens calm in the first week after the announcement; assuring everyone that there was nothing to worry about.  While scientists researched ways to alter Samson\u2019s course, bunkers were built in strategic locations in every country; bunkers which were filled with the help of a lottery system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisaster struck about 4 months prior to Samson\u2019s impact; when a robotic mission to plant a nuke inside the asteroid failed.  With no time left to send a second mission, the bunkers became humanities only hope for survival.  The bunkers had enough supplies to feed the survivors for 3 years until the surface is habitable again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was three days before Samson was due to impact; although minor impacts have been occurring for the last week, as fragments that were broken off by the failed mission entered the atmosphere.  My name is Jamie Lincoln; I\u2019m just shy of my 18th birthday and I was sitting in the high school auditorium waiting for my evacuation group to be led out to the buses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were about 100 people standing around the auditorium; I was standing in one corner with my parents and my little sister Emma.  My parents, Marcus and Olivia, were standing with our suitcases while was leaning against the wall and crying.  While her best friend\u2019s family had been chosen for the lottery, she was devastated to find that her boyfriend\u2019s family hadn\u2019t been chosen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t have many friends, to begin with, but I was lucky that the one friend I did have was chosen for the bunker.  My sympathy towards Emma did have its limits however; I was starting to get annoyed by the constant whining.  Leaning down to her level, I said, \u201cEm, you have to stop crying.  Crying isn\u2019t going to get Kyle into the bunker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with tears in her eyes, I could see Emma\u2019s anger as she glared at me.  \u201cScrew you, Jamie!\u201d wiping her eyes, Emma said, \u201cHow would you like it if you get to live while someone you care about died!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust because he\u2019s not going to be in the bunker doesn\u2019t mean that Kyle is going to die.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cWe\u2019re 300 miles from the impact zone; chances are good that he\u2019ll survive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever.\u201d Getting up, Emma said, \u201cI\u2019m going to use the bathroom; I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry back, sweetie.\u201d Looking after Emma, Mom said, \u201cThey\u2019re going to start the boarding process in a few minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started calling names 10 minutes later; everything was going fine until they came to Ashley Saunders.  She was the stereotypical popular girl; captain of the cheer squad, prom queen, etc.  She, along with many of her friends, made life hell for everyone; including me.  After calling her name three times, the National Guard soldier decided to move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t sure why I suddenly cared about Ashley\u2019s wellbeing, but I was growing concerned that she wasn\u2019t in the auditorium.  I decided, then and there, to go look for her.  Grabbing my backpack, I started towards the door; only for my mom to stop me.  \u201cJamie, where are you going?  They\u2019re about to call our names.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to go find Ashley, mom.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll be back before you know it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s a good idea?\u201d pausing, Mom said, \u201cIs that girl really worth risking your life?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe may be a bitch, mom, but that doesn\u2019t mean she deserves to die.\u201d Looking at Mom, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back, I promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust be safe, honey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy folks, and Emma, just stood there silently as I walked out of the auditorium.  As I walked through the halls of the school, I silently wondered where Ashley was.  I\u2019d been walking around for 5 minutes when I heard a noise coming from a classroom down the hall.  Making my way into the room, I saw Ashley standing by the window.  As I walked closer, I saw that she was charging her cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAshley, we have to go; the last buses are about to leave.\u201d Grabbing her arm, I said, \u201cYou can charge your phone when we get to the bunker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet go of me, you loser.\u201d Pulling away from me, she said, \u201cI have to charge my phone; I can\u2019t live without it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t leave now, you won\u2019t have very long to worry about that.\u201d I grabbed her arm again, saying, \u201cWe have to get back to the buses before they leave; or we\u2019re screwed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Ashley unplugged her phone and grabbed her things, the two of us ran down the hall.  As we crossed the lobby leading to the buses, I could hear a rumbling noise in the distance.  It seemed to get louder with each passing second; as the building started to shake.  Looking at me, Ashley said, \u201cWhat\u2019s that noise?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know.\u201d Spotting the doorway, 20 feet ahead, I said, \u201cCome on, we\u2019re almost there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of us ran out of the building, we were horrified to see that the buses were already leaving.  There was no chance we\u2019d be able to catch up with them before they turned onto the main road.  But that didn\u2019t stop Ashley from trying to chase after them, screaming, \u201cWait for me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment the rumbling noise, and the ground shaking, got must worse.  I looked back towards the building and saw a meteor flying through the atmosphere.  Seeing as it was close to the ground, I realized it was about to hit.  Dropping my backpack, I ran after Ashley to stop her, \u201cAshley stop!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the approaching meteor grew louder with each passing second as I ran to catch up with Ashley.  The noise quickly made it impossible for her to hear me yelling after her, but it did make her stop and turn around.  The look on her face as she saw the approaching fireball was one of pure horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI managed to catch up and throw both of us behind a nearby car; just as the meteor hit the ground no more than 100 feet away.  The ground shook from the impact as Ashley and I struggled to stay behind cover.  The shockwave from the impact threw everything into the air; even the car moved several feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everything calmed down, even though my ears were still ringing, I slowly peeked over the rear of the car to find the parking lot full of burning debris.  But I didn\u2019t focus on that; instead, I was focusing on the newly formed crater, with the burning wreckage of the bus visible over the top.  I could only stare in shock at the bus; knowing it was the one my family was in.</span></div></div>",

I was frozen in place as reality sank in \u2013 my parents and my little sister were dead.  I was only vaguely aware of what was happening around me, but I was suddenly snapped back to reality when Ashley slapped me hard across the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to her, taken aback, and said, \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSnap out of it, Jamie!\u201d looking at me, as she tried to pull me to my feet, she said, \u201cYou got me out of the building; I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m going to die out here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realized she was right when I saw a crowd of people outside the barricades.  I knew it wouldn\u2019t be long before the barricade gave in; with everything going on, two teenagers would be easy targets for looters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a little unsteady, I climbed to my feet and helped Ashley to hers.  Looking around, I spotted my backpack underneath a damaged car door nearby.  Looking at Ashley, I said, \u201cI have to grab my bag, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley started to protest but I ran off before she could.  After grabbing my bag, I ran back to where she was waiting.  By that point the crowd had burst through the barricade surrounding the building; many torching anything they could get their hands on, while a few took notice of me and Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly realized our best option was to run; so I grabbed Ashley\u2019s hand in mine and started running in the direction the buses had been going in.  This time, to my surprise, Ashley didn\u2019t object to me grabbing her.</span></div></div>",

Having grown up in the town, I was horrified to see how quickly it devolved into a warzone as the impact date got closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhole sections of town were either burnt down or completely blocked off.  It had been about 10 minutes since we\u2019d run from the school.  I was still in shock from my family\u2019s death, but I couldn\u2019t really focus on that at the moment.  I was too focused on keeping myself and Ashley alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe\u2019d managed to avoid the group chasing us long enough to make it downtown.  The two of us were resting in an alley in the center of town.   Looking at me, with a hint of exhaustion in her eyes, Ashley said, \u201cWhat are we going to do?  It\u2019s not like we can keep running from those people forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think the best thing we can do is to try and reach the bunker.\u201d Catching my breath, I said, \u201cBefore they started calling names, they said the bunker would be sealed up 3 hours before Samson\u2019s impact.  We just have to get there before that happens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust how do you plan on doing that?\u201d scoffing, Ashley said, \u201cWith all the chaos we\u2019ll be lucky to make it 20 feet without being seen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Ashley; I\u2019m trying to figure this out as we go along.\u201d Leaning against the building, I said, \u201cOf all the people to be stuck with; why\u2019d it have to be you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m happy about being stuck here with you?\u201d looking at me, Ashley said, \u201cI\u2019d rather be with anyone else but you; but unfortunately that\u2019s not what happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo think I would\u2019ve been with my family; but no, I had to come to save you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod, are you really that stupid?\u201d sighing, Ashley said, \u201cYou would have died on that bus if you hadn\u2019t come back for me.  Your last thought probably would\u2019ve been wondering what that loud noise was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeing dead would be better than being stranded here with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately regretted having said that; because I could see that I\u2019d hurt Ashley.

Looking around, I saw a doorway nearby; so I ran over to see if I could open it.  After tugging on the handle for a few seconds the door opened, I quietly gestured for Ashley to go inside; I followed her after grabbing our bags.  I just managed to close the door as the looters came round the corner from the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the looters ransacked the alley outside, Ashley and I walked further inside in an attempt to hide.  As we walked through the office, I realized we were inside an abandoned dentist's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe quickly found an exam room far enough away from the entrances that no one would be able to see us.  But to be safe, I closed the door anyway.  Turning on the lamp over the chair, I sat down in the office chair while Ashley leaned against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of us said anything for a moment; our emotions clearly still in control.  After a moment, I took a breath and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about what I said in the alley; I-I didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got nothing to apologize for; I shouldn\u2019t have said what I did.\u201d Looking at me, moving some hair from her face, Ashley said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry that your family died, and I\u2019m sorry for making light of it the way I did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith everything going on, I guess we\u2019re both on edge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so.\u201d Sighing, Ashley looked at me and said, \u201cBefore you came to get me, did you happen to see Eric anywhere?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric Masterson was Ashley\u2019s boyfriend, and captain of the football team.  The last time I saw him, he was trudging out the doors towards the buses.  \u201cHe left to get on the bus as soon as his name was called.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat jerk probably didn\u2019t even realize I was gone.\u201d Sighing, Ashley said, \u201cI\u2019m not exactly thrilled that I\u2019m stuck with you, but at least you came to look for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may have been a total bitch to me in school, but that doesn\u2019t mean I would let you die.\u201d Taking a breath, I said, \u201cRight now I guess our next step is figuring out how to get to the bunker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe could go to my stepdad\u2019s house; it\u2019s only a few miles from here.\u201d Pausing, Ashley said, \u201cWe could grab one of the cars and try to get to the bunker that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds like a good idea, but I\u2019m not sure we should go now.\u201d Getting out of the chair, I said, \u201cThere may be more looters out there, I think our best option is to wait until night time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard any screaming for a while; I think we\u2019re in the clear.\u201d Looking at me, Ashley said, \u201cI think we should go now while we still have a chance.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Sitting in an adjacent chair, Ashley looked at me and said, \u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou saved my life, Jamie; when not even my best friends or my boyfriend came looking for me.\u201d Gesturing to the empty house, Ashley said, \u201cYou can see the warm welcome I had waiting for me here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t deserve to die; no matter how badly you treated me in high school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a faint smile, Ashley said, \u201cStill, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if someone tried to talk you out of looking for me.\u201d<br>\r\nMom had asked if Ashley was worth risking my life for, but I didn\u2019t want to tell that to Ashley.  \u201cThat\u2019s crazy talk, Ashley.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about my Mom started me down a slippery slope; so I desperately tried to think of something else before the waterworks started. Thankfully Ashley came to the rescue; standing up, she looked at me and said, \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m starving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got up and followed Ashley into the kitchen, watching as she gathered some things from the fridge and pantry.  As she started cooking, she said, \u201cYou can go watch a movie or something; I\u2019ll let you know when dinners ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no trouble at all; I\u2019ve been cooking for myself and my friends since the 3rd Grade.\u201d Putting some diced peppers into a pan, she said, \u201cIf Samson had been destroyed, I probably would have been doing this for one of them anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we\u2019d finished eating dinner, I helped Ashley clean up.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cWhere do your folks keep the cars?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn the garage; but it\u2019s too risky to go right now.  The darkness would hide the looters from us, and they\u2019d be able to track us from the headlights.\u201d Turning on the dishwasher, Ashley said, \u201cWe\u2019re better off staying here for the night and leave tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou make a good point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome with me.\u201d With that Ashley led me upstairs; opening a doorway at the end of the hall.  \u201cThis is my room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeeking inside, I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes; her room was bigger than my parent\u2019s bedroom.  \u201cIt looks nice.\u201d Turning to her, I said, \u201cWhere am I sleeping?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJamie, I don\u2019t want to be alone tonight; in case the looters get in.\u201d turning on the lights, Ashley said, \u201cI\u2019d like for you to sleep in here with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I...\" <i>Somebody pinch me, I must be dreaming.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing her into the room, I quickly realized what she meant; when I saw two beds in her room.  \"Alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to take a shower.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t use up all the hot water.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo began my first time in a girl\u2019s room; although it wasn\u2019t quite the experience I\u2019d expected.  <i>And here I thought she wanted me.</i>  Once the two of us were in bed, she turned over and put her hand out.  Expecting her to say goodnight and let go, I took it; so imagine my surprise when she held my hand until she fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

When I finally woke up the next morning it had stopped raining.  I looked over to find that Ashley wasn\u2019t sleeping next to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing out of bed, I walked out of the room to look for her; eventually finding her standing in front of a picture window admiring the sunrise.  Walking up next to her, I said, \u201cThat\u2019s a really nice sunrise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it is.\u201d Chuckling, Ashley looked at me and said, \u201cToo bad we won\u2019t see another one for 3 years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that thought in mind, Ashley and I stood there watching the sunrise for a while longer.  Once we\u2019d stopped, I said, \u201cI think it would be a good idea if we stuck to the highway as much as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou get right down to business, don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to make sure we survive, Ashley.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have time to take the surface streets; and besides, we\u2019ll be less likely to encounter looters on the highway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax Jamie, I was just joking.\u201d Sighing, Ashley said, \u201cI agree with you 100%, the highway would be our best bet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you point me to the garage; I\u2019ll see if the car still runs, while you gather some supplies for the trip.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a plan.\u201d Pointing down the hall, past the kitchen, Ashley said, \u201cThe garage is down there; the last door on the right.\u201d<br>\r\nOnce we had our assignments, Ashley and I went to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was in the garage, about 30 minutes later, topping off the fluids in a 2017 BMW when Ashley came into the garage holding a tote in her arms.  I looked behind her and saw several more totes sitting on the floor.  Looking at me, she said, \u201cI found some camping supplies in the attic; some food and some extra clothes.\u201d Pausing, she placed the tote in the trunk, \u201cYou look about my step-brother\u2019s size, so I grabbed some of his clothes for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds fine to me.\u201d Discarding an empty oil container, I said, \u201cWe should be ready to go in a few minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Returning with the last tote, Ashley said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I-I\u2019d like a few minutes...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley trailed off but I knew what she was going to say; she\u2019d grown up in this house and she wanted to say goodbye.  I silently nodded as she walked back into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was shortly after 10 AM when we left the house; I was driving while Ashley was the lookout in the passenger seat.  As we pulled out of the driveway, I said, \u201cBarring any issues, I think we can get to the bunker by this evening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s keep our fingers crossed that we don\u2019t run into anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive went perfectly for the next 5 minutes until, as we were driving out of the gated entrance to the neighborhood, we came across a large downed tree blocking the road.  Stopping the car, I turned to Ashley and said, \u201cWell that poses a problem; it must\u2019ve fallen down during the storm last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d looking at me, Ashley said, \u201cThis is the only way out of the neighborhood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe way I see it; we can try to go around it, or we can find another car on the other side.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I quickly decided our best solution was to try and go around the tree; which involved driving on the grass and gravel.  Looking at me, a somewhat worried expression on her face, Ashley said, \u201cPlease be careful; this car isn\u2019t built for off-roading.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be careful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI backed the car up and turned so I was facing the grass on the right side of the road.  After figuring out the best way to go, I put the car in drive.  The tires struggled to get a grip on the still-wet grass, but we managed to gain a little bit of traction.  I slowly continued towards an opening between the tree and some nearby boulders; an opening just wide enough to fit the car through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll was going well until one of the rear tires got caught in an unseen patch of mud.  Despite my best efforts the car wouldn\u2019t budge in any direction.  I even resorted to attempting to lift the car while Ashley worked the pedals, but it did nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everything that\u2019s been happening, I was bound to snap sooner or later.  I collapsed to the ground in a huff; crying in exasperation while Ashley came running to check on me.  \u201cJamie, are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not alright!\u201d tears streaming down my face, I said, \u201cMy family is dead, I\u2019m 100 miles from where I need to be, and I can\u2019t get this damn car out of the mud.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll find another way, Jamie; we have to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow Ashley?\u201d gesturing to the car, I said, \u201cOur only mode of transportation is stuck in the mud.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can find another car down the road; transfer everything into that one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou saw how things looked as we made our way here; every car we passed was either burnt to a crisp or had missing tires.\u201d Wiping tears from my eyes, I said, \u201cLet\u2019s face it; our chances of surviving just dropped to zero.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley stood up and paced around for a moment; before turning to me and said, \u201cThat\u2019s not exactly true.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d confused, I said, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur chances of survival aren\u2019t zero.\u201d Wincing, Ashley said, \u201cThere\u2019s a bunker underneath my house.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Making sure to enunciate every word, I said, \u201cThere\u2019s...a...bunker...underneath...your...house?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlinching, Ashley said, \u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve known about it all this time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, Ashley nodded and said, \u201cMy folks put it in; in case the lott...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was getting angry at that point.  \u201cWhy the <i>hell</i> did you let me plan to carry all of this <i>shit</i> away from it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook; the bunker has a lot of amenities and can hold a lot, but it doesn\u2019t have the people we care about.\u201d Looking at me, <br>\r\nAshley said, \u201cWith everything you\u2019re dealing with right now, I thought you could use your friends to help through it.  Plus I knew you wouldn\u2019t want to be cooped up with just me for three years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m not ashamed to admit that Ashley surprised me at that moment.  I thought she was going to say something like it slipped her mind or that she hated what the decorator did.  But instead, she was thinking of me; and she was right, I did want to see my friends.  Taking a deep breath to calm down, I said, \u201cIn all honesty, our chances of surviving a 100-mile journey were pretty slim.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cWe should use your family\u2019s bunker; since it\u2019s close by and has what we need.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile on her face, Ashley opened the trunk and shouldered some bags.  Grabbing one of the lighter totes, she looked at me and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took several trips to get everything back to Ashley\u2019s house; I followed her orders and placed everything in the garage.  I watched as Ashley input another code which caused a hatchway, hidden under some boxes, to open in the floor.  After tossing down the lighter bags, I turned to Ashley and said, \u201cWe should scrounge around for other things while we\u2019re up here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea.\u201d Looking at me, Ashley said, \u201cYou get some board games and movies; I\u2019ll start bringing out some more food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe spent the better part of an hour gathering more things for the bunker; including every board game and movie I could find.  I was climbing up the ladder, having brought down a box of food, when I saw Ashley come into the garage holding a box \u2013 containing picture frames and other assorted items.  \u201cWhat\u2019s in the box?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome family mementos that we couldn\u2019t bring with us.\u201d Placing the box on the ground, Ashley said, \u201cSince we\u2019re going to be in the bunker, I saw no reason why I couldn\u2019t bring them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick glance at the box showed it contained wedding photos, pictures of Ashley as a kid and some photos of older relatives.  \u201cWish there was a way to grab those things from my house.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a frown, Ashley said, \u201cI wish there was too, Jamie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Ashley\u2019s help, we got everything else into the bunker.  After making one last check of the house, I climbed down the ladder as Ashley closed the hatch.   Once the hatch was closed, I turned to Ashley and said, \u201cWhat are we going to do for food and water?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s an underground river about 200 below us; it\u2019s not only our freshwater source, but it provides power to the bunker.\u201d Pointing down the hall to the right, Ashley said, \u201cThere\u2019s a hydroponic garden down the hall; with enough food for us until we can get back to the surface.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground shook violently as Ashley finished speaking; another piece of Samson had struck close by.  \u201cToo bad there\u2019s no way to look around above ground.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYe of little faith.\u201d Heading down the hall, Ashley said, \u201cThere\u2019s a periscope in the central room; or, if you\u2019re feeling confident, controls for a drone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m impressed; your folks really thought of everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly; all they were concerned about is the cost.\u201d Turning to look at me, Ashley said, \u201cThe power was the idea of the designer, along with the periscope.  The drone, however, was my idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lot smarter than I gave you credit for, Ashley.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Ashley said, \u201cThe teachers said the same thing.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Built into the wall was a big-screen TV; with the drone controls sitting nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to the TV was a door leading to the sleeping area, which had 4 bunk beds, and a bathroom.  A door in the kitchen led to a pantry with shelves full of non-perishable foods; enough to last two people a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked back into the main room, having just checked out the exercise/workshop.

When we weren\u2019t working, the two of us were watching movies or anything else to keep our minds off everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just after 11:10 in the morning; less than 20 minutes before Samson was due to hit.  Ashley was in the kitchen making some lunch for the two of us, while I was checking on the weapons locker in the pantry.  The locker consisted of 3 shotguns, 2 rifles, and 4 pistols; with around 200 rounds for each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was in the middle of putting the weapons back in the locker, oblivious to my surroundings, when Ashley walked into the room with an annoyed look on her face.  \u201cI\u2019ve been calling you for the last 5 minutes.\u201d Sighing, Ashley said, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m checking out the weapons.\u201d Placing a rifle in the rack, I said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to need them once we can return to the surface.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have three years to worry about that, Jamie.\u201d Taking a breath, Ashley said, \u201cHow about you close up the cabinet before I have to learn how to remove shrapnel from your neck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay fine.\u201d Sighing, I closed the cabinet.  \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so worried; we\u2019ve got like 5 minutes before...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the whole place started to shake, and I wasn\u2019t exaggerating.  It felt as though the whole world was shaking apart; as dust fell from above and my life flashed before my eyes.  I kept hearing Emma saying, \u201cHold me, mommy...Hold me, mommy...Hold me, mommy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like an eternity before the shaking finally stopped.  I slowly got to my feet and brushed off the dust.  As my ears slowly stopped ringing, I realized that was still hearing that little girl saying, \u201cHold me mommy...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, I realized it was Ashley who was saying it; as she held onto a nearby post for dear life.  Walking over to her, I placed my hands on her shoulders and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay Ashley; it\u2019s all over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everything going on, I supposed I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised when Ashley wrapped her arms around me in a hug.  She held my tight for a moment until she composed herself.  Looking at me, she said, \u201cA-Are you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy ears are ringing a little, but I\u2019m fine.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cWe did it, Ash; we survived Samson.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s great, but I suggest we wait until all the fragments are gone before we celebrate.\u201d Taking a breath, Ashley said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot here; but neither of us are doctors.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I quickly realized that I resting on one of the bunks; with the bookshelf lying on its side nearby.  My head was throbbing like crazy; I reached up to touch it, only to find half my head had been bandaged.  \u201cWhat the...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley walked into the room at that point; holding an ice pack in her hand.  Seeing me, she dropped the ice pack and ran over to me.  \u201cJamie!\u201d pulling me into a seated position, Ashley hugged the stuffing out of me.  \u201cThank God you\u2019re alive!\u201d<br>\r\nI was touched by her concern for my safety.  After she released the hug, I looked at her and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s with the bandages?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe bookshelf split your head open; I\u2019ve never seen so much blood, at least from a boy.\u201d Sitting next to me, Ashley said, \u201cI figured it was better to use too much than not enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cHow\u2019d you get the bookshelf off me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAdrenaline can do some crazy things; I saw you were hurt, so I sprang into action.\u201d Looking at me, grabbing my hand, she said, \u201cI was so worried you wouldn\u2019t make it, Jamie; I was afraid that the last thing I said to you was out of anger.  Please forgive me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts okay, Ash; we\u2019re both dealing with an intense situation, we both said things that we didn\u2019t mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be down, just the two of us, for years.\u201d Pausing, Ashley said, \u201cThe last thing I want is for us to blow up on each other like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the last thing I want, Ash.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I eventually felt up to it, I went to the bathroom to unwrap the bandages on my head.

Even if I got a scar from it, it was likely no one would notice.  <i>If that isn\u2019t the story of my life; even my scar isn\u2019t worth noticing.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the doorway behind me, Ashley said, \u201cAre you going to be alright?

Within a day Ashley and I had come up with a chores list; divvying up the jobs needed to keep the bunker in one piece.  I was in charge of maintenance, security and the supplies; while Ashley was in charge of cooking, medical needs, and miscellaneous other tasks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just after noon on a Saturday; I walked out of the sleeping area to find Ashley taking a spin on the treadmill in the far corner.  Slowing the speed of the treadmill, Ashley took a sip from her water bottle.  Looking at me, she said, \u201cYou got any big plans today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really.\u201d Grabbing the drone controller, I said, \u201cI was thinking of taking the drone out for a spin; so we can get an idea of what\u2019s out there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s such a good idea?\u201d stopping the treadmill, Ashley got off and walked over to me.  \u201cI understand wanting to see what it\u2019s like out there, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready to see dead bodies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want that either, Ash; but we have to figure out what we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwitching the TV over to the drone, I activated the drone and launched it from its \u2018hangar\u2019 along the side of the house.  As soon as it left the \u2018hangar\u2019 the drone started transmitting data; the air quality was terrible and the ambient temperature was in the low 100s.<br>\r\nThe first images we got back were of trees on fire and most of the adjacent houses in ruins.  I heard an audible gasp from Ashley when we saw that most of her house was burnt to a crisp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI proceeded to take the drone out over the road; flying by where we\u2019d abandoned the car, only to find that it had been crushed by another tree.  I followed the road towards town, keeping an eye on the drone\u2019s battery life.  Sure enough, as we got closer to town, we started seeing charred human remains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dentist\u2019s office where we\u2019d hidden from the looters was still relatively intact; but when the drone arrived over the school, I saw that large sections of it were destroyed.  By this point the drone had been in the air for about 30 minutes; so I decided it was time to come home, even though there was still about an hour's worth of battery left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned the drone around and started following the road back; only to come across the crater and burnt remains of the school bus.  I started to tear up at the sight of the bus on the screen.  Seeing the image on the screen, Ashley came over and took the controls from me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter placing the drone on autopilot, she turned her attention to me.  Without saying a word, she just hugged me for what seemed like an eternity.</span></div></div>",

I'm glad he's dead! Mwahahahaha!\u201d  I couldn\u2019t help but smile when Ashley started laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us had fun playing Life as well.

I wasn\u2019t glad that the world ended, but...well, I used to have a huge crush on Ashley in middle school.  Then things changed once we got to High School; where I ended up squarely in the crosshairs of the jocks, and Ashley and her friends started laughing at me.  Now that it was just the two of us, we were getting along well and working on improving our relationship every day.</span></div></div>",

We were both in agreement that we had to do something; especially considering there was a child involved.  The question was; did we bring them here or go out to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, it seemed as though the trio was ready to give up.  Grabbing the controller from me, Ashley pressed a button and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll come to you; stay there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving figured out Ashley\u2019s plan, I went to the airlock and retrieved an environmental suit.  The suits were designed to protect us from the extreme environmental changes brought on by Samson \u2013 mainly the cold and ash in the air.  Walking back into the main room, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll go out to them; you stay here in case something happens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick stop at the weapons cabinet, Ashley joined me at the airlock.  Handing me a rifle, Ashley said, \u201cThe coast looks clear, but take this just in case.\u201d Giving me a quick kiss, for good luck, Ashley said, \u201cI\u2019ll watch you with the drone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the rifle in hand, I opened the outer hatch and climbed up the ladder.  I\u2019d seen the damage done to the house through the drone, but seeing it first hand was something totally different.  The garage wall had collapsed, making it impossible for me to exit through the door.  Speaking into the mic, I said, \u201cI\u2019ve got to go through the house, most of the garage has collapsed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe careful; that suit doesn\u2019t make you invincible.\u201d Pausing, Ashley said, \u201cIn case you\u2019re wondering, it\u2019s a balmy -15 out there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I entered the house, I was surprised to see it was mostly intact; sure the windows were blown out and there was debris everywhere, but the house seemed to have fared pretty well.  Walking outside, I saw the cause of the collapsed garage \u2013 a tree had fallen and struck the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked down the driveway towards where the trio had been; I could barely see 10 feet in front of me.  I took my time getting there; when they saw I was armed, they started to tremble.  This, coupled with Ashley\u2019s recon, told me this wasn\u2019t an ambush.  <br>\r\n\u201cWe saw your signs.  What do you need?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two adults; a man and a woman, exchanged shocked looks with each other.  Turning to me, the woman said, \u201cY-You\u2019re not going to chase us away?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to chase you away; the rifle was just in case you were planning something,\u201d lowering the gun, I said, \u201cNow it\u2019s not getting any warmer out here; what do you need?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, the man said, \u201cCan we come inside with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir; but we don\u2019t have enough supplies for five people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease sir, I\u2019m begging you.\u201d Looking at me, pleading, the woman said, \u201cWe\u2019ve made it this long on what supplies we had, but we haven\u2019t eaten in four days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were making it difficult for me to turn them down.  After a moment, I said, \u201cYou can come into the bunker; but only for a few days.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but any longer and there won\u2019t be enough supplies for my friend and me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-We understand.\u201d Smiling, the woman said, \u201cT-Thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI helped the trio pack up their tent and the rest of their equipment before leading them back up to the house.  I was the first to climb down the ladder back into the bunker.  I took off the suit\u2019s hood just as Ashley walked into the room; a stern look on her face.  \u201cYou and I need to have a talk.\u201d</span></div></div>",

They\u2019d tried to get to the bunker on their own, but had overestimated how much time they had left.  \u201cWe decided to head as far from the impact zone as we could, but it was tough, and we only had our tent for protection.\u201d Sipping a cup of coffee, Carl said, \u201cWe saw the lights from your drone three days ago and followed it here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley shot me a look when she heard that; I didn\u2019t say anything in response.  \u201cWe\u2019re eternally grateful that you\u2019ve taking us in.\u201d looking at us, Grace said, \u201cWe encountered other private shelters along the way; but they all shot at us as soon as they saw us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnce we saw you had a child, we weren\u2019t going to send you away.\u201d Pausing, Ashley said, \u201cIt\u2019s amazing that you\u2019ve made it <br>\r\nthis far.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I was checking to make sure the hatch was sealed while Ashley took Caleb to the sleeping area to lie down.  I was sweeping up some of the ash on the floor when Carl came over to me.  \u201cIs there somewhere we can talk in private?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, let\u2019s go to the hydroponic garden.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI led Carl into the garden where, after making sure there was no one nearby, he said, \u201cI want you to know how hard this is for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be hard.\u201d Looking at him, I said, \u201cUnder different circumstances, I wouldn't even think twice about helping you guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful for everything you and Ashley have done, but that\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d Sighing, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to think I\u2019m a monster for even considering this.  But, would you two let Caleb stay here with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe love our little boy; and we\u2019d do anything to ensure his safety, which is why I\u2019m asking.\u201d Looking at me, he said, \u201cWe can\u2019t keep him safe in this world; he deserves better than us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you think two teenagers are better equipped to keep him safe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s ideal, but you can provide him with three meals and a roof over his head.\u201d Pausing, Carl said, \u201cThose are things we\u2019re incapable of giving him, and we don\u2019t deserve Caleb if we can\u2019t take care of him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy head was swimming at this point.  Ashley and I were barely out of high school and suddenly we were being asked to take care of a four-year-old boy?  I\u2019d called Samson's impact a world-changing event, but I never expected the world to change that much. \"Could you please send Ashley in? I should talk this over with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Turning to leave, Carl said, \u201cOne suggestion though; I wouldn\u2019t take the drone out too often.  We\u2019re not the only ones out there; and some of them are...desperate.  I want my son to be safe from them.\"</span></div></div>",

It took three days before he was okay being in the same room as us and another two before he said anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings still weren\u2019t perfect, but he was slowly coming around.  I entered the main room from the filter room to find him playing with some toys on the floor.  The night before his parents left, I\u2019d ventured up in the house and found some toys that weren\u2019t too damaged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked to be playing with some GI Joes that belonged to Ashley\u2019s stepbrother Joey.  Noticing me standing nearby, he started to get up and leave the room.  I quickly caught up and grabbed his shoulder.  \u201cCaleb, stop; just...come talk with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb stopped in his tracks and didn\u2019t move for a moment; even from behind, I could tell he was conflicted.  Eventually he turned around and walked back over to me.  Looking at me, he said, \u201cWhy did my parents leave me?  Was I a bad kid?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy heart dropped when I heard that \u2013 was that why he\u2019d been acting this way?  \u201cOf course they didn\u2019t, why would you possibly think that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearing up, Caleb said, \u201cBecause they promised that they\u2019d always be there to take care of me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh boy.</i>  Leading Caleb over to the couch, I sat the two of us down.  \u201cThey left you here <i>because</i> they cared about you, Caleb.\u201d Looking at him, I said, \u201cThey realized the world out there isn\u2019t safe for a little kid.  They felt having you here in the bunker was the best thing for you; you\u2019d be safe and never have to worry about food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill I ever see my mommy and daddy again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said yes; because I don\u2019t know.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cIn the meantime, Ashley and I will do everything in our power to keep you safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that put a faint smile on Caleb\u2019s face; he hugged me just as Ashley walked into the room.  Walking up to us, Ashley said, <br>\r\n\u201cCome on, little man; let\u2019s put you down for a nap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley picked Caleb up off the couch and walked into the sleeping area with him.  I followed behind and stood in the doorway as she tucked him into bed; giving him a kiss on the forehead before walking back to the door.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got this motherhood thing down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as hard as it looks; after all, I\u2019ve been taking care of you for the last month.\u201d With a grin, Ashley said, \u201cLooking after <i>another</i> kid isn\u2019t that difficult.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chose to ignore her jab; instead, I said, \u201cDid you ever think this is what your life would have been like after high school?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean living in an underground bunker with a four-year-old and a guy I used to bully?\u201d chuckling, Ashley said, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t say this is how I thought my life would be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe neither.\u201d Pausing, I looked at her and said, \u201cBut I\u2019m starting to get used to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame here.\u201d</span></div></div>",

After feeling around for a moment, I pulled out a small number of wires. Details aside, I got the truck started and pulled the door closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Jamie...\" Wincing, Ashley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned and found a number of rioters running for the truck. \"Hang on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hit the accelerator, sending the truck screaming forward and drove through the lot, straight for the exit. Two rioters got into vehicles and gave chase. \"they're after us for stealing a truck!\" Frightened, Ashley yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're after us because they're all mad and need someone to blame.\" Serious, I countered. \"We're just teenagers so we're easy targets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley gulped at that, it was not a pleasant thought. The two who had jumped into cars to gave chase used their cars to block the exit but I was taught how to drive on the back roads. \"Jamie, they're blocking our way out!\" Screaming, Ashley warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave a chuckle. \"Buckle up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley's eyes went wide before buckling herself up and grabbed onto her seat for dear life. I turned the wheel and charged the car off the lot into the grass towards an old dirt road in a nearby forest. <i>\"They're nuts if they give chase.\"</i> glancing at the rear view I thought. <i>\"Only a four by four can handle these roads.\"</i> To my surprise, the two cars did give chase onto the road. <i>\"Yup... they're nuts.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are insane!\" Angry, Ashley yelled. \"You are insane!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're insane for following.\" Darkly, I replied. \"This road was not made with luxury cruisers in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did not take long for my words to ring true as I took a sharp turn on the dirt road. the first car was not able to turn fast enough and ended up sliding sideways right into a tree at high speed. The second ca managed to make the turn only the diver was not ready for a steep hill shortly after. While the four by four was able to climb the hill, the car fell short and rolled back before flipping three times to the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you do know what you are doing...\" Wincing, Ashley muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got away from them, that's all that matters.\" Softly, I said. \"What we need to do now is find some form of shelter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't we follow the buses?\" Shrugging, Ashley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The route was top secret as was the location of the bunkers.\" Serious, I replied. \"Even if we knew where their route and where they were going, the fragments are hitting sooner than predicted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which means Samson may hit sooner than predicted.\" Pale, Ashley said. \"Why an old four by four though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The newer models have safeguards to protect from the old tricks.\" Serious, I replied. \"Now focus, do you know of any place close hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley sighed, tears forming. \"I know a place...\" Whispering, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed Ashley's instructions and we soon arrived at...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
