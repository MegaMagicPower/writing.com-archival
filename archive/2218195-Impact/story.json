It turned out the concern was warranted when, a few weeks after the discovery, scientists realized that Samson asteroid was going to impact the earth in May 2020.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorld leaders struggled to keep their citizens calm in the first week after the announcement; assuring everyone that there was nothing to worry about.  While scientists researched ways to alter Samson\u2019s course, bunkers were built in strategic locations in every country; bunkers which were filled with the help of a lottery system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisaster struck about 4 months prior to Samson\u2019s impact; when a robotic mission to plant a nuke inside the asteroid failed.  With no time left to send a second mission, the bunkers became humanities only hope for survival.  The bunkers had enough supplies to feed the survivors for 3 years until the surface is habitable again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was three days before Samson was due to impact; although minor impacts have been occurring for the last week, as fragments that were broken off by the failed mission entered the atmosphere.  My name is Jamie Lincoln; I\u2019m just shy of my 18th birthday and I was sitting in the high school auditorium waiting for my evacuation group to be led out to the buses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were about 100 people standing around the auditorium; I was standing in one corner with my parents and my little sister Emma.  My parents, Marcus and Olivia, were standing with our suitcases while was leaning against the wall and crying.  While her best friend\u2019s family had been chosen for the lottery, she was devastated to find that her boyfriend\u2019s family hadn\u2019t been chosen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t have many friends, to begin with, but I was lucky that the one friend I did have was chosen for the bunker.  My sympathy towards Emma did have its limits however; I was starting to get annoyed by the constant whining.  Leaning down to her level, I said, \u201cEm, you have to stop crying.  Crying isn\u2019t going to get Kyle into the bunker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with tears in her eyes, I could see Emma\u2019s anger as she glared at me.  \u201cScrew you, Jamie!\u201d wiping her eyes, Emma said, \u201cHow would you like it if you get to live while someone you care about died!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust because he\u2019s not going to be in the bunker doesn\u2019t mean that Kyle is going to die.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cWe\u2019re 300 miles from the impact zone; chances are good that he\u2019ll survive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever.\u201d Getting up, Emma said, \u201cI\u2019m going to use the bathroom; I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry back, sweetie.\u201d Looking after Emma, Mom said, \u201cThey\u2019re going to start the boarding process in a few minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started calling names 10 minutes later; everything was going fine until they came to Ashley Saunders.  She was the stereotypical popular girl; captain of the cheer squad, prom queen, etc.  She, along with many of her friends, made life hell for everyone; including me.  After calling her name three times, the National Guard soldier decided to move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t sure why I suddenly cared about Ashley\u2019s wellbeing, but I was growing concerned that she wasn\u2019t in the auditorium.  I decided, then and there, to go look for her.  Grabbing my backpack, I started towards the door; only for my mom to stop me.  \u201cJamie, where are you going?  They\u2019re about to call our names.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to go find Ashley, mom.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll be back before you know it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s a good idea?\u201d pausing, Mom said, \u201cIs that girl really worth risking your life?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe may be a bitch, mom, but that doesn\u2019t mean she deserves to die.\u201d Looking at Mom, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back, I promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust be safe, honey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy folks, and Emma, just stood there silently as I walked out of the auditorium.  As I walked through the halls of the school, I silently wondered where Ashley was.  I\u2019d been walking around for 5 minutes when I heard a noise coming from a classroom down the hall.  Making my way into the room, I saw Ashley standing by the window.  As I walked closer, I saw that she was charging her cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAshley, we have to go; the last buses are about to leave.\u201d Grabbing her arm, I said, \u201cYou can charge your phone when we get to the bunker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet go of me, you loser.\u201d Pulling away from me, she said, \u201cI have to charge my phone; I can\u2019t live without it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t leave now, you won\u2019t have very long to worry about that.\u201d I grabbed her arm again, saying, \u201cWe have to get back to the buses before they leave; or we\u2019re screwed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Ashley unplugged her phone and grabbed her things, the two of us ran down the hall.  As we crossed the lobby leading to the buses, I could hear a rumbling noise in the distance.  It seemed to get louder with each passing second; as the building started to shake.  Looking at me, Ashley said, \u201cWhat\u2019s that noise?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know.\u201d Spotting the doorway, 20 feet ahead, I said, \u201cCome on, we\u2019re almost there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of us ran out of the building, we were horrified to see that the buses were already leaving.  There was no chance we\u2019d be able to catch up with them before they turned onto the main road.  But that didn\u2019t stop Ashley from trying to chase after them, screaming, \u201cWait for me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment the rumbling noise, and the ground shaking, got must worse.  I looked back towards the building and saw a meteor flying through the atmosphere.  Seeing as it was close to the ground, I realized it was about to hit.  Dropping my backpack, I ran after Ashley to stop her, \u201cAshley stop!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the approaching meteor grew louder with each passing second as I ran to catch up with Ashley.  The noise quickly made it impossible for her to hear me yelling after her, but it did make her stop and turn around.  The look on her face as she saw the approaching fireball was one of pure horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI managed to catch up and throw both of us behind a nearby car; just as the meteor hit the ground no more than 100 feet away.  The ground shook from the impact as Ashley and I struggled to stay behind cover.  The shockwave from the impact threw everything into the air; even the car moved several feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everything calmed down, even though my ears were still ringing, I slowly peeked over the rear of the car to find the parking lot full of burning debris.  But I didn\u2019t focus on that; instead, I was focusing on the newly formed crater, with the burning wreckage of the bus visible over the top.  I could only stare in shock at the bus; knowing it was the one my family was in.</span></div></div>",

I was frozen in place as reality sank in \u2013 my parents and my little sister were dead.  I was only vaguely aware of what was happening around me, but I was suddenly snapped back to reality when Ashley slapped me hard across the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to her, taken aback, and said, \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSnap out of it, Jamie!\u201d looking at me, as she tried to pull me to my feet, she said, \u201cYou got me out of the building; I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m going to die out here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realized she was right when I saw a crowd of people outside the barricades.  I knew it wouldn\u2019t be long before the barricade gave in; with everything going on, two teenagers would be easy targets for looters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a little unsteady, I climbed to my feet and helped Ashley to hers.  Looking around, I spotted my backpack underneath a damaged car door nearby.  Looking at Ashley, I said, \u201cI have to grab my bag, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley started to protest but I ran off before she could.  After grabbing my bag, I ran back to where she was waiting.  By that point the crowd had burst through the barricade surrounding the building; many torching anything they could get their hands on, while a few took notice of me and Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly realized our best option was to run; so I grabbed Ashley\u2019s hand in mine and started running in the direction the buses had been going in.  This time, to my surprise, Ashley didn\u2019t object to me grabbing her.</span></div></div>",

Having grown up in the town, I was horrified to see how quickly it devolved into a warzone as the impact date got closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhole sections of town were either burnt down or completely blocked off.  It had been about 10 minutes since we\u2019d run from the school.  I was still in shock from my family\u2019s death, but I couldn\u2019t really focus on that at the moment.  I was too focused on keeping myself and Ashley alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe\u2019d managed to avoid the group chasing us long enough to make it downtown.  The two of us were resting in an alley in the center of town.   Looking at me, with a hint of exhaustion in her eyes, Ashley said, \u201cWhat are we going to do?  It\u2019s not like we can keep running from those people forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think the best thing we can do is to try and reach the bunker.\u201d Catching my breath, I said, \u201cBefore they started calling names, they said the bunker would be sealed up 3 hours before Samson\u2019s impact.  We just have to get there before that happens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust how do you plan on doing that?\u201d scoffing, Ashley said, \u201cWith all the chaos we\u2019ll be lucky to make it 20 feet without being seen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Ashley; I\u2019m trying to figure this out as we go along.\u201d Leaning against the building, I said, \u201cOf all the people to be stuck with; why\u2019d it have to be you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m happy about being stuck here with you?\u201d looking at me, Ashley said, \u201cI\u2019d rather be with anyone else but you; but unfortunately that\u2019s not what happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo think I would\u2019ve been with my family; but no, I had to come to save you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod, are you really that stupid?\u201d sighing, Ashley said, \u201cYou would have died on that bus if you hadn\u2019t come back for me.  Your last thought probably would\u2019ve been wondering what that loud noise was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeing dead would be better than being stranded here with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately regretted having said that; because I could see that I\u2019d hurt Ashley.

Looking around, I saw a doorway nearby; so I ran over to see if I could open it.  After tugging on the handle for a few seconds the door opened, I quietly gestured for Ashley to go inside; I followed her after grabbing our bags.  I just managed to close the door as the looters came round the corner from the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the looters ransacked the alley outside, Ashley and I walked further inside in an attempt to hide.  As we walked through the office, I realized we were inside an abandoned dentist's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe quickly found an exam room far enough away from the entrances that no one would be able to see us.  But to be safe, I closed the door anyway.  Turning on the lamp over the chair, I sat down in the office chair while Ashley leaned against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of us said anything for a moment; our emotions clearly still in control.  After a moment, I took a breath and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about what I said in the alley; I-I didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got nothing to apologize for; I shouldn\u2019t have said what I did.\u201d Looking at me, moving some hair from her face, Ashley said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry that your family died, and I\u2019m sorry for making light of it the way I did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith everything going on, I guess we\u2019re both on edge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so.\u201d Sighing, Ashley looked at me and said, \u201cBefore you came to get me, did you happen to see Eric anywhere?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric Masterson was Ashley\u2019s boyfriend, and captain of the football team.  The last time I saw him, he was trudging out the doors towards the buses.  \u201cHe left to get on the bus as soon as his name was called.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat jerk probably didn\u2019t even realize I was gone.\u201d Sighing, Ashley said, \u201cI\u2019m not exactly thrilled that I\u2019m stuck with you, but at least you came to look for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may have been a total bitch to me in school, but that doesn\u2019t mean I would let you die.\u201d Taking a breath, I said, \u201cRight now I guess our next step is figuring out how to get to the bunker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe could go to my stepdad\u2019s house; it\u2019s only a few miles from here.\u201d Pausing, Ashley said, \u201cWe could grab one of the cars and try to get to the bunker that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds like a good idea, but I\u2019m not sure we should go now.\u201d Getting out of the chair, I said, \u201cThere may be more looters out there, I think our best option is to wait until night time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard any screaming for a while; I think we\u2019re in the clear.\u201d Looking at me, Ashley said, \u201cI think we should go now while we still have a chance.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Sitting in an adjacent chair, Ashley looked at me and said, \u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou saved my life, Jamie; when not even my best friends or my boyfriend came looking for me.\u201d Gesturing to the empty house, Ashley said, \u201cYou can see the warm welcome I had waiting for me here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t deserve to die; no matter how badly you treated me in high school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a faint smile, Ashley said, \u201cStill, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if someone tried to talk you out of looking for me.\u201d<br>\r\nMom had asked if Ashley was worth risking my life for, but I didn\u2019t want to tell that to Ashley.  \u201cThat\u2019s crazy talk, Ashley.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about my Mom started me down a slippery slope; so I desperately tried to think of something else before the waterworks started. Thankfully Ashley came to the rescue; standing up, she looked at me and said, \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m starving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got up and followed Ashley into the kitchen, watching as she gathered some things from the fridge and pantry.  As she started cooking, she said, \u201cYou can go watch a movie or something; I\u2019ll let you know when dinners ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no trouble at all; I\u2019ve been cooking for myself and my friends since the 3rd Grade.\u201d Putting some diced peppers into a pan, she said, \u201cIf Samson had been destroyed, I probably would have been doing this for one of them anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we\u2019d finished eating dinner, I helped Ashley clean up.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cWhere do your folks keep the cars?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn the garage; but it\u2019s too risky to go right now.  The darkness would hide the looters from us, and they\u2019d be able to track us from the headlights.\u201d Turning on the dishwasher, Ashley said, \u201cWe\u2019re better off staying here for the night and leave tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou make a good point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome with me.\u201d With that Ashley led me upstairs; opening a doorway at the end of the hall.  \u201cThis is my room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeeking inside, I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes; her room was bigger than my parent\u2019s bedroom.  \u201cIt looks nice.\u201d Turning to her, I said, \u201cWhere am I sleeping?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJamie, I don\u2019t want to be alone tonight; in case the looters get in.\u201d turning on the lights, Ashley said, \u201cI\u2019d like for you to sleep in here with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I...\" <i>Somebody pinch me, I must be dreaming.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing her into the room, I quickly realized what she meant; when I saw two beds in her room.  \"Alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to take a shower.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t use up all the hot water.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo began my first time in a girl\u2019s room; although it wasn\u2019t quite the experience I\u2019d expected.  <i>And here I thought she wanted me.</i>  Once the two of us were in bed, she turned over and put her hand out.  Expecting her to say goodnight and let go, I took it; so imagine my surprise when she held my hand until she fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

When I finally woke up the next morning it had stopped raining.  I looked over to find that Ashley wasn\u2019t sleeping next to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing out of bed, I walked out of the room to look for her; eventually finding her standing in front of a picture window admiring the sunrise.  Walking up next to her, I said, \u201cThat\u2019s a really nice sunrise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it is.\u201d Chuckling, Ashley looked at me and said, \u201cToo bad we won\u2019t see another one for 3 years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that thought in mind, Ashley and I stood there watching the sunrise for a while longer.  Once we\u2019d stopped, I said, \u201cI think it would be a good idea if we stuck to the highway as much as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou get right down to business, don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to make sure we survive, Ashley.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have time to take the surface streets; and besides, we\u2019ll be less likely to encounter looters on the highway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax Jamie, I was just joking.\u201d Sighing, Ashley said, \u201cI agree with you 100%, the highway would be our best bet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you point me to the garage; I\u2019ll see if the car still runs, while you gather some supplies for the trip.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a plan.\u201d Pointing down the hall, past the kitchen, Ashley said, \u201cThe garage is down there; the last door on the right.\u201d<br>\r\nOnce we had our assignments, Ashley and I went to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was in the garage, about 30 minutes later, topping off the fluids in a 2017 BMW when Ashley came into the garage holding a tote in her arms.  I looked behind her and saw several more totes sitting on the floor.  Looking at me, she said, \u201cI found some camping supplies in the attic; some food and some extra clothes.\u201d Pausing, she placed the tote in the trunk, \u201cYou look about my step-brother\u2019s size, so I grabbed some of his clothes for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds fine to me.\u201d Discarding an empty oil container, I said, \u201cWe should be ready to go in a few minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Returning with the last tote, Ashley said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I-I\u2019d like a few minutes...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley trailed off but I knew what she was going to say; she\u2019d grown up in this house and she wanted to say goodbye.  I silently nodded as she walked back into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was shortly after 10 AM when we left the house; I was driving while Ashley was the lookout in the passenger seat.  As we pulled out of the driveway, I said, \u201cBarring any issues, I think we can get to the bunker by this evening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s keep our fingers crossed that we don\u2019t run into anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive went perfectly for the next 5 minutes until, as we were driving out of the gated entrance to the neighborhood, we came across a large downed tree blocking the road.  Stopping the car, I turned to Ashley and said, \u201cWell that poses a problem; it must\u2019ve fallen down during the storm last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d looking at me, Ashley said, \u201cThis is the only way out of the neighborhood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe way I see it; we can try to go around it, or we can find another car on the other side.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I quickly decided our best solution was to try and go around the tree; which involved driving on the grass and gravel.  Looking at me, a somewhat worried expression on her face, Ashley said, \u201cPlease be careful; this car isn\u2019t built for off-roading.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be careful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI backed the car up and turned so I was facing the grass on the right side of the road.  After figuring out the best way to go, I put the car in drive.  The tires struggled to get a grip on the still-wet grass, but we managed to gain a little bit of traction.  I slowly continued towards an opening between the tree and some nearby boulders; an opening just wide enough to fit the car through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll was going well until one of the rear tires got caught in an unseen patch of mud.  Despite my best efforts the car wouldn\u2019t budge in any direction.  I even resorted to attempting to lift the car while Ashley worked the pedals, but it did nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everything that\u2019s been happening, I was bound to snap sooner or later.  I collapsed to the ground in a huff; crying in exasperation while Ashley came running to check on me.  \u201cJamie, are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not alright!\u201d tears streaming down my face, I said, \u201cMy family is dead, I\u2019m 100 miles from where I need to be, and I can\u2019t get this damn car out of the mud.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll find another way, Jamie; we have to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow Ashley?\u201d gesturing to the car, I said, \u201cOur only mode of transportation is stuck in the mud.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can find another car down the road; transfer everything into that one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou saw how things looked as we made our way here; every car we passed was either burnt to a crisp or had missing tires.\u201d Wiping tears from my eyes, I said, \u201cLet\u2019s face it; our chances of surviving just dropped to zero.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley stood up and paced around for a moment; before turning to me and said, \u201cThat\u2019s not exactly true.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d confused, I said, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur chances of survival aren\u2019t zero.\u201d Wincing, Ashley said, \u201cThere\u2019s a bunker underneath my house.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Making sure to enunciate every word, I said, \u201cThere\u2019s...a...bunker...underneath...your...house?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlinching, Ashley said, \u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve known about it all this time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, Ashley nodded and said, \u201cMy folks put it in; in case the lott...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was getting angry at that point.  \u201cWhy the <i>hell</i> did you let me plan to carry all of this <i>shit</i> away from it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook; the bunker has a lot of amenities and can hold a lot, but it doesn\u2019t have the people we care about.\u201d Looking at me, <br>\r\nAshley said, \u201cWith everything you\u2019re dealing with right now, I thought you could use your friends to help through it.  Plus I knew you wouldn\u2019t want to be cooped up with just me for three years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m not ashamed to admit that Ashley surprised me at that moment.  I thought she was going to say something like it slipped her mind or that she hated what the decorator did.  But instead, she was thinking of me; and she was right, I did want to see my friends.  Taking a deep breath to calm down, I said, \u201cIn all honesty, our chances of surviving a 100-mile journey were pretty slim.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cWe should use your family\u2019s bunker; since it\u2019s close by and has what we need.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile on her face, Ashley opened the trunk and shouldered some bags.  Grabbing one of the lighter totes, she looked at me and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took several trips to get everything back to Ashley\u2019s house; I followed her orders and placed everything in the garage.  I watched as Ashley input another code which caused a hatchway, hidden under some boxes, to open in the floor.  After tossing down the lighter bags, I turned to Ashley and said, \u201cWe should scrounge around for other things while we\u2019re up here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea.\u201d Looking at me, Ashley said, \u201cYou get some board games and movies; I\u2019ll start bringing out some more food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe spent the better part of an hour gathering more things for the bunker; including every board game and movie I could find.  I was climbing up the ladder, having brought down a box of food, when I saw Ashley come into the garage holding a box \u2013 containing picture frames and other assorted items.  \u201cWhat\u2019s in the box?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome family mementos that we couldn\u2019t bring with us.\u201d Placing the box on the ground, Ashley said, \u201cSince we\u2019re going to be in the bunker, I saw no reason why I couldn\u2019t bring them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick glance at the box showed it contained wedding photos, pictures of Ashley as a kid and some photos of older relatives.  \u201cWish there was a way to grab those things from my house.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a frown, Ashley said, \u201cI wish there was too, Jamie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Ashley\u2019s help, we got everything else into the bunker.  After making one last check of the house, I climbed down the ladder as Ashley closed the hatch.   Once the hatch was closed, I turned to Ashley and said, \u201cWhat are we going to do for food and water?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s an underground river about 200 below us; it\u2019s not only our freshwater source, but it provides power to the bunker.\u201d Pointing down the hall to the right, Ashley said, \u201cThere\u2019s a hydroponic garden down the hall; with enough food for us until we can get back to the surface.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground shook violently as Ashley finished speaking; another piece of Samson had struck close by.  \u201cToo bad there\u2019s no way to look around above ground.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYe of little faith.\u201d Heading down the hall, Ashley said, \u201cThere\u2019s a periscope in the central room; or, if you\u2019re feeling confident, controls for a drone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m impressed; your folks really thought of everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly; all they were concerned about is the cost.\u201d Turning to look at me, Ashley said, \u201cThe power was the idea of the designer, along with the periscope.  The drone, however, was my idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lot smarter than I gave you credit for, Ashley.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Ashley said, \u201cThe teachers said the same thing.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Built into the wall was a big-screen TV; with the drone controls sitting nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to the TV was a door leading to the sleeping area, which had 4 bunk beds, and a bathroom.  A door in the kitchen led to a pantry with shelves full of non-perishable foods; enough to last two people a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked back into the main room, having just checked out the exercise/workshop.

When we weren\u2019t working, the two of us were watching movies or anything else to keep our minds off everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just after 11:10 in the morning; less than 20 minutes before Samson was due to hit.  Ashley was in the kitchen making some lunch for the two of us, while I was checking on the weapons locker in the pantry.  The locker consisted of 3 shotguns, 2 rifles, and 4 pistols; with around 200 rounds for each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was in the middle of putting the weapons back in the locker, oblivious to my surroundings, when Ashley walked into the room with an annoyed look on her face.  \u201cI\u2019ve been calling you for the last 5 minutes.\u201d Sighing, Ashley said, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m checking out the weapons.\u201d Placing a rifle in the rack, I said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to need them once we can return to the surface.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have three years to worry about that, Jamie.\u201d Taking a breath, Ashley said, \u201cHow about you close up the cabinet before I have to learn how to remove shrapnel from your neck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay fine.\u201d Sighing, I closed the cabinet.  \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so worried; we\u2019ve got like 5 minutes before...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the whole place started to shake, and I wasn\u2019t exaggerating.  It felt as though the whole world was shaking apart; as dust fell from above and my life flashed before my eyes.  I kept hearing Emma saying, \u201cHold me, mommy...Hold me, mommy...Hold me, mommy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like an eternity before the shaking finally stopped.  I slowly got to my feet and brushed off the dust.  As my ears slowly stopped ringing, I realized that was still hearing that little girl saying, \u201cHold me mommy...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, I realized it was Ashley who was saying it; as she held onto a nearby post for dear life.  Walking over to her, I placed my hands on her shoulders and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay Ashley; it\u2019s all over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everything going on, I supposed I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised when Ashley wrapped her arms around me in a hug.  She held my tight for a moment until she composed herself.  Looking at me, she said, \u201cA-Are you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy ears are ringing a little, but I\u2019m fine.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cWe did it, Ash; we survived Samson.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s great, but I suggest we wait until all the fragments are gone before we celebrate.\u201d Taking a breath, Ashley said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot here; but neither of us are doctors.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Ashley and I couldn\u2019t help but flinch every time we felt the ground shake.  At one point Ashley looked at me and said, \u201cHow much longer is this going to go on for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAstronomers said we\u2019d likely experience secondary impacts for at least 4 hours after the initial impact.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be over soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was silent for a few moments; until she looked at me and said, \u201cDo you think they felt any pain?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid who feel any pain?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe people on the surface where Samson struck.\u201d Pausing, Ashley said, \u201cDo you think they felt any pain?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt all happened so fast; I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t feel anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think there are any survivors on the surface?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would depend on how far away they were; but yes, I\u2019m sure there are survivors on the surface.\u201d Looking at Ashley, I said, \u201cNow\u2019s not the time to think about those on the surface.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d getting up, Ashley looked at me and said, \u201cForgive me for being upset that over 6 billion people either just died, or will be dead in a matter of days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood up to follow after Ashley as she headed into the sleeping area.  \u201cAsh, wait; I-I\u2019m not trying to demean everything that happened on the surface.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cYou think I like the idea that over 6 billion people are gone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley turned around to say something; only before she could, the crowd started to shake again \u2013 this time more violently then before.  Before I knew what was happening, a bookshelf fell on top of me and knocked me out.</span></div></div>",
