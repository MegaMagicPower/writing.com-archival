There he was, less than an Inch tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBout as near as he could tell He'd somehow been transported to a reality where cartoon characters exist, and they are incredibly huge giants to him. Hard to believe? Well if you had told him a week ago he was going to be less than an inch tall and in this situation he wouldv'e asked what you were smokeing and where could he could get some. How he ended up in this mess in the first place is a mystery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day had started off so normally, Ash had just finished breakfast and  thought, why not go for a walk? It was a nice warm morning, not a cloud in the sky. So he decided to talk a walk down to the lake. To get there you had to walk through a wooded area and right away he should have known something wasn't right. The wooded area was completely quite. At that time of the year and that early in the morning you'd  normally hear the sounds of birds and other types of  animal activity, but that day it was so quiet Ash could've heard a flea fart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nlooking  back he couldn't remember much about what happened next. He remember being abruptly picked up off the ground by an invisible force. There was a bright flash of light and the next thing he knew he was lying on my back. Ash opened his eyes. Looking around he knew right away was no longer in the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere in the hell was he? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(<b>So what cartoon world will Ash be trapped in?</b>)</span></div></div>",

The only source of light was large opening in the ceiling at one end.  The floor was he was lying on didn't feel like anything he had ever lied on before. It almost felt like cloth made with once inch thick nylon rope. The whole floor was covered in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt different, nothing he could put his finger on but something didn\u2019t feel right.  He was sure of one thing,he couldn\u2019t lie down forever. The first time he tried to stand up Ash immediately fell straight back down on his ass.  After sitting for a moment breathing in the odd smelling air, he tried to sit up again. This time he stayed on his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another look around he noticed the floor wasn't even. There were huge indentations in the floor, as something heavy with a round-ish surface had been pressed into it. And inside the indentations the colour of the fabric was darker, almost blackened. This was an alien environment and yet strangely familiar. Ash noticed something on the floor not far from him. Curious, he walked over to it. At first he didn't quite know what it was but as he looked at it some more he realized he was looking at a huge Number printed in the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What was the number?)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When he came to, he found himself sitting on green ground, with the grass around him growing twice as high as he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, oh my god....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't believe it. Wooden huts lined up a distance away, and while their designs suggested they were for only a few people, or a singe family at their largest, they had the size of castles from Ash's perspective. A breeze blew through the grass, nearly knocking him over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is bad,\" Ash muttered. \"I don't even know where I am-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA distant boom silenced him. Then came another, louder. Then another, even louder, and the ground trembled beneath his feet. Someone was walking towards him!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ash slowly backed away, staring up in amazement, as the person rounded the corner of the building. It was a tall boy, just out of his teens it seemed, wearing a leather suit of armor. His left foot had been replaced with a metal prosthetic - which Ash realized was rapidly heading for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Hey, look out!\" Ash jumped up and down, trying to get out of the giant's path while at the same time trying to get his attention. He waved his hands above his head. \"Down here, hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground trembled more and more with each crashing footfall, but as the giant came close he paused, seeming to snap out of his daydream. He looked around, puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down here!\" Ash continued to shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the giant turned his eyes downward, and finally spotted Ash. His mouth hung open in surprise as he knelt on one knee, placing his palm against the ground as he bent forward, trying to get a better view.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh suddenly felt fearful as the giant loomed over him, wondering if he'd made the right choice in getting his attention. This boy was the height of an office building, and his feet were easily eight or nine times as long as Ash was tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on earth...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant spoke softly, but his voice still rolled like thunder to Ash. Taking his free hand, he reached down and carefully pushed Ash against his palm using his thumb - a thumb, Ash realized, that was longer and thicker than he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant stood now, leveling his open palm with the ground, and Ash felt himself pressed against its fleshy surface as he rocketed up to the sky. After the G-forces stopped, he pushed himself into a sitting position, and found himself held close to the giant's chest, covered in leather padding. He looked  up at the boy's face - green eyes and a handsome freckled expression, framed with brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" The giant's voice asked, and Ash had to clap his hands over his ears to stop the cacophony from blowing his eardrums. \"Sorry! Sorry...\" He whispered this time. \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh...\" He raised his voice. \"I'm Ash. I'm...not from around here. I don't know how I got here, some kind of weird portal I guess.\" He didn't know what else to say - he didn't know if asking \"Please don't eat me\" would be taken in a way that would end unpleasantly for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh,\" the giant bit his lip, thinking. \"That's...unusual. But here, I'll see what I can do with you. I'm Hiccup, by the way.\" He flashed a smile, before looking up. \"I gotta figure out what I'm going to do with you. Come on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis armor was held together by three belts around his torso, and underneath one of these belts he slipped Ash. Ash hooked his arms over them, securing himself. His feet didn't protrude out the bottom, but it wasn't too uncomfortable. Now Hiccup began walking again, his up and down motions feeling like a roller coaster to Ash. He was warm, pressed up against the armor, and he could have sworn he heard a gurgle from Hiccup's stomach. Closing his eyes and sighing, he sincerely prayed that he was going to end up okay.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The air whipped in his face as Hiccup's steps -  his foot was so big it could flatten a city bus in one stomp - boomed far down where he stared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiccup turned a corner around the buildings, leading to what must have been the village center. Ash gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were more people, yes, all giants to Ash - but there were dragons too. In fact, the dragons were even bigger than the people! If Hiccup was a skyscraper, some of these dragons were an entire city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God!\" Ash breathed, and he clutched to the belt even more tightly. He looked on in panic as a large black dragon came bounding up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Toothless!\" Hiccup called out. <i>Oh no, why is he calling it?!</i> Ash thought. The dragon warbled, and butted his head against Hiccup's chest. \"Hey, cut it out!\" he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiccup felt it only as a playful push, but it jolted Ash. He tried to maintain his grip, but the whiplash made him loosen his hold on the belt. \"Oh no, no no no no...\" He felt himself slipping out from between the belt and Hiccup's torso...</span></div></div>",

Here, Toothless? This is Ash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh watched as the dragon leaned in close and gave a sniff, whipping his hair into a frenzy. Then it snorted, blowing some foul fish-smelling breath on him, and whined in curiosity. It cocked its head to see him better. Ash stared into the eyes, each at least twice as tall as he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Toothless is harmless, aren't ya bud?\" He laughed as the dragon gave a gentle lick, inundating Ash with saliva. \"Here, come on, I gotta get going home. You play around, I'll come back and get you, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToothless seemed to nod in agreement, and bounded off. Ash kept his iron grip on the belt, hardly daring to believe he had just been eye-to-eye with a dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiccup kept walking, and the rest of the path home was uneventful. Soon they approached a massive looming structure (which seemed to be just a hut to the giant) and went inside, closing the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew!\" Ash sighed in relief as Hiccup took him out of the belt, holding him in his warm palm again. \"Gee, thanks for finding me and taking care of me, I really appreciate it!\" He looked up smiling at the giant.</span></div></div>",

People always just shoving me around!\" He flung his hands out at this, keeping his grip on Ash and forcing the poor guy to get jerked up into the air. \"Just back and forth: Hiccup sharpen this, Hiccup keep an eye on that, oh you messed this up!\" He kept gesticulating wildly, giving Ash whiplash every time he swung his hands. \"My point is, everyone was always putting me down, and I didn't really like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe released Ash now a few inches above the table - except it seemed like ten feet to the tiny guy.

He was lifted into the air by Hiccup, who clutched him with two fingers. Ash stopped in front of Hiccup's face, each brilliant green eye wider across than he was tall. His freckles danced in the firelight, and his mouth curled into a devilish sneer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's time for my turn to be top dog.\"</span></div></div>",

As he was passed along, the booming of a massive heartbeat grew loud, and then softer, along with an almost deafening sound of breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, which seemed like a hellish eternity, Ash found himself expelled into the stomach, where he landed on his back in the acids. It was pitch black, and the air was close. He tried to take a breath, and felt himself choke on the lack of oxygen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiccup, meanwhile, licked his lips. \"Now that made today a little more interesting!\" He dropped his feet to the ground, sitting up in the chair again, then stood and walked out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese motions first knocked Ash to the other side of the stomach, then transformed his already treacherous environment into a tremulous pit of death that stirred with every footfall of Hiccup's. Ash realized he didn't have long before he passed out, and he did NOT plan on being someone's lunch today. But was there any hope for him?</span></div></div>",

A short muffled scream was cut off by the burst of liquid in his mouth, like biting into a berry - except this berry had bones, of course, that made a satisfying <i>crunch</i>. The sour iron taste spread in his mouth, and Hiccup realized a bit dribbled from his lips. He wiped it with his fingers, still chewing. He could feel his teeth grinding Ash into a paste, bones being pulverized with each bite, and he knew that the guy was already close to liquefied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a thunderous gulp, he swallowed what remained of Ash, and with a sigh rubbed his stomach again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should be a good appetizer,\" he said.

I changed my mind. Since you got me here, I'll let you live. Here,\" he set Ash on his massive shoulder pad, and he had to cling to Hiccup's thick neck to stay standing. \"You can watch me have some fun around here.\" In demonstration, he lifted his prosthetic, which was about as wide across as a bus, and slammed it down on some cars, flattening one and crushing the hood on another.

The poor guy was only the length of Hiccup's thumbnail, and was suspended painfully by his arm as he was yanked into the air. Ash could hear him yelling as he was brought up to the giant's face. \"Let's see...\" Hiccup muttered, and he tilted his head back and dangled the little man above his open mouth. The yells turned to screaming, pleading for his life from the giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was all in vain. Hiccup just gave a little chuckle, nearly throwing Ash off his feet, before he released the tiny human. Ash looked up and watched as the man plummeted into Hiccup's mouth. There was a tremendous <i>glurk</i>, and Ash could see the bulge in Hiccup's throat as the man was transported to the stomach. Ash felt both terrified and disgusted to see the display going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more people had been swallowed whole, Hiccup next picked up a green sedan from the street. It was just a little longer than the length of his thumb, and sat lengthwise across his palm, not extending past his hand. He looked like a kid who had found a Matchbox car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what the heck are these?\" he asked aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding it lengthwise between his thumb and forefinger, he lifted it up to his eyes to peer inside. A grin appeared on his face. \"Well what do you know?\" He pinched the doors between his fingertips, and with no effort he tore them away. Then he shook the contents of the vehicle into his hand - two men and two women, scrambling to hold onto each other. Hiccup cupped his hand, held it to his mouth, and threw his head back, swallowing them all with another thundering gulp. Without looking, he then crushed the car in his one hand, crumpling it like foil, and dropped it to the ground where it made a deafening crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will happen next?</span></div></div>",

He shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant girl was in her own world until she heard a small voice. She looked around, but saw no one.  I swear i heard someone screaming at the top of their lungs. She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLook down! Ash shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the voice again, she looks down and sees Ash. She gasp in surprise as she saw him. W....What are.... How are.... She stammered. She had to make sure her eyes weren't playing tricks on her, so she got on her knee and picked him and poked him. Her finger was the size of building. She goes wide eyed when she find out your real. After the shock goes away, she rises to full height. Ash held on to her hand as she got up. After it was over, he looked up at the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl had an assortment of questions to ask, but she decided to ask the most important ones. Who are you? She said. M-my name's Ash. I'm not from around here. He said. How did you get here? She said. Some portal brought me here. I know it sound crazy, but it's true. You said. And it made you like this? She said.  I guess so..... He said. Ash didn't know what else to say. He was a little terrified of this girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk..... It's crazy like you said. She said. You....don't believe me? He said. It's hard to believe.... But you made yourself known, so you must wanted me to see you. And i'm guess you want me to help you somehow. She said. C.....can you? Is it possible? He said. I'll see what I can do. I'm Astride. Just so you know. Now where to put you? She said. She didn't have any pockets, and she wasn't going to carry you in her hand. She didn't want anyone to know about you just yet. There were only two places left. She could place him in her boot. It wasn't the pleasant of places, it would keep you hidden, and if she was careful with her step, safe. The other place would be....down her chest. Astride had a light blush as she thought about putting him there. It'd be a much nicer place for him and no one would notice. But she had some serious reservation about putting you there. She didn't know if he could be trusted to handle himself properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of thinking, Astride puts him...</span></div></div>",

But there was no other explanation. He was in an impossibly huge shoe.  Who in their right mind would make a shoe this big? He looked up though the mouth of the shoe and saw the ceiling of a vast room hundreds of feet above him.  It finally dawned on him that he wasn\u2019t in a huge shoe. The shoe was normal size. he was incredibly small. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh's heart started to pound, how the hell did this happen? What was going to happen next? Was Rod Sterling going to pop out of nowhere and do a monolog about the Twilight Zone? Or did he do that while Ash was unconscious?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh had to get out of there, that much was certain. He didn't want to meet up with the owner of the gigantic foot where. But the more he looked the more he came to the conclusion that the only way out was through the mouth of the shoe and that was way out of reach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have stayed in bed, but noooo. I had to go for a walk because it was such a nice day.

Soon the vibrations were accompanied by muffled thuds that grew louder as the vibrations intensified. he stood and looked skywards, the vibrations traveling through his body. Ash's Jaw hit his chest as an enormous being came into view. He easily recognised the being from a cartoon he once watched, but this was no cartoon the person towering above him looked real. Ever seen those pictures of what cartoon characters might look like in real life? Same thing, only this person wasn't a computer generated character.

Ash thought he  was safe until something Heavy and made of cloth landed on top of him. She dropped something a moment later he felt something big encircle himself and the object on top of him, Ash was lifted into the air. He was being picked up!  She was on the move again.

Here, I'll get rid of it for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched as Jane reached down for him. What could he do? Running was out of a question. She could move much faster than he could run, and there was nowhere to run to. The tips of the thumb and forefinger closed around him, holding Ash in a firm but gentle grip. And as he was lifted off the bed and hundreds of feet into the air Ash was thankful for that.  Pressed into her thumb he tried to see what Jane was going to do but  just couldn't turn his neck that far. So instead he looked straight ahead at the friction ridges on the thumb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to kill it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'll just drop it out the window.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Out the Window?! Cripes why don't she just crush me between her fingers and get it over with it!'  He knew a fall from the top floor of the house would just turn him into a splatter shape stain on the walkway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane felt the bug between her fingers struggle the moment she said she was going to drop it out the window.

He was literately riding the top of a living mountain that was traveling at an incredible speed even though to Fern it was a leisurely walk. As she walked, Ash couldn't help but think how insane the whole situation was. At the same time he had to accept that what was happening was real. The grey follicles of hair/fur he held onto certainly felt real enough. Too real for all of this to be a dream, and he'd had some vivid dreams in his day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the fact that he really didn't know how Fern would react. In the cartoon Ash remembered her as being  a nice person, but this wasn't a cartoon. He had no idea how she was going to react or do. For that reason alone he was feeling more and more apprehensive the more he thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFern, unaware of her passenger, walked on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time had passed she arrived at her destination which ,as Ash discovered, was her home.

Almost unbearably so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom? Dad? Anybody home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she called out Ash was tempted to plug his ears but couldn't because that would've meant letting go of his grip on the young giant's fur and he didn't want to do that. After calling out to her parents Fern's next stop was the kitchen where she found the note. They were gone out for groceries. It was dumbfounding to Ash how they would leave like that and not lock the front door, it never would've happened where he came from and hadn't happened since the 1950s. Were people that trusting around here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her parents gone out, Fern did what she usually did. She got herself  a snack.

More importantly, who owned the back pack. Looking up at the stack off books he noticed the title of one of them was \"The Red Headed League\", a Sherlock Holmes Novel. That should've given him some kind of a clue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Well, he couldn't very well stay in there. Looking about Ash found a hole in side of the backpack near the bottom where the sewing had unraveled a bit. It was small, and probably unnoticeable but just big enough to crawl through. Once out of the backpack he could see he was in a bedroom, A child's bedroom from the look of things. It was tidy and for the moment unoccupied. Ash looked out the window, it was nigh time. His first day in this strange yet familiar world was over, if only he knew which home he was in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'At least it's not the Tibble Twins', Ash thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had only walked a few feet toward the bed when he felt the ground shake under him. Shit, someone was coming and he didn't want to get mistaken for a bug. If he was even noticeable at all. Ash darted about the room looking for  potential hiding places.

Ash was Knocked off his feet, but when the Fernquake had finally ended Ash was looking at the soles of two grey feet. He slowly approached them. He had given someone a foot rub before, so he knew how to do it. The question was, where to start? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugged and climbed up onto the toes and made his way to the ball off the foot. Suddenly the foot rocked and he fell face first into the flesh of the sole. He heard Fern giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful Ashy, I'm ticklish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toes flexed and wiggled, making wrinkles in the sole. Ash's leg was caught in one such wrinkle but was released as the foot calmed down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh grumbled under his breath and was about to push himself up to a sitting position when he noticed something different about  the surface of the sole. Other than it's color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite having a very human like foot, Fern's foot didn't have the swirly dermal pattern that humans had. Instead her dermal surface was covered in closely set, conical papillae, that of a Dog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe might not enjoy what he was about to do, but at lease he could study this monster's anatomy. He began to kneed his fists   into the sole, not sure if he was doing anything effective. To his surprise he heard Fern sigh approvingly. Her skin must've been more sensitive than he'd first thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next hour he moved from one point on Fern's Sole to the other. Until finally, exhausted, he had to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't\" He gasped \" can't do no more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the world turned upside down as Fern rolled over on her back and sat up. She then grasped Ash gently with the toes of the foot he'd been working on in what she called a \"Toe Hug\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank You, Ashy.

Sure there was a smell, but not the stomach turning kind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought the best way to do what was asked as part of his \"Reward\" was to simply lay on his stomach and Kiss from that position. He didn't want to do it, but he didn't want to enrage a giant that could turn him into a paste with the very foot he was laying on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Here goes nothing,' He thought and gave his first kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe texture of the skin when his lips touched it was not what he had expected. The Dermal surface had a different feel to it compared to when he touched it with his fingers. Maybe it had to do with the thickness of the skin of his lips compared to his fingertips.  He kissed again and breath in her sent. He felt the sole flex approvingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Warmth emanating from the sole felt good on his aching muscles. He was exhausted. Not just from the foot rub he gave Fern, but also the events of the day. Despite his best efforts he had a hard time keeping his eyes open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFern became a little concerned when Ash stopped kissing. She  turned and looked at her sole. She could hear the faint but distinctive sound of snoring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Poor little guy is tuckered right out' she thought as she carefully picked him up so she wouldn't wake him.

It smelled of foot sweat and moisturizer. Couldn't she have at least put him in a clean sock?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout as near as he could tell the sock was hung on something. Maybe a knob or the bed post. He couldn't tell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laid back and stared upward. He thought of the dream. Was that his fate? To spend his whole life being a foot toy to monsters? Did he have a choice? If he managed to escape from the room, who's to say the next giant he met up with would treat him better or worst?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly one way to find out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh began climbing up to the mouth of the sock, and promptly slid back down to the toe. After six attempts the closest he was able to get was about half way. The angle was just too steep.  He sighed. It was so much easier in the movies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf up wasn't an option, what about down? Ash crawled about the toe of the sock and found what he was looking for. There was a hole in the sock just big enough to allow him to get through. He thought maybe this was the way out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is until he looked down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good hundred feet to the floor below and nothing to cushion his fall but the hard floor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So much for that' he thought and moved away from the hole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeated he resolved to get as much rest as he could before morning. He was going to need it for whatever Fern had planned for him. He thought about that as he drifted back to sleep. He thought of her as a monster, yet the most she had done was make him give her a foot rub. If that was the most the  planned for him maybe it won't be so bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was awoken a few hours later to the sound of an alarm. Ash heard Fern shutting off her alarm clock and getting out of bed. Then he heard her approaching the sock. There was a Tug and the sock was lifted upward.</span></div></div>",

Ferns grey feet at one end, and at the other....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the other end was, up to that moment, the longest pair of feet he had ever seen. Prunella had a thin frame, which made her feet appear even bigger. Like Fern the top of her feet were covered in fur that had a smooth appearance. The soles were bare, and had the same dermal surface as Fern.  Above his head, he heard more whispering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I don't see anyone. Lets make it look like we are reading.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFern picked a book off the nearby shelf. It was one she had read before but that didn't matter.

Is he still there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFern glanced under the Table and Nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrunella's foot shot forward and the next thing Ash knew he was under her long toes. They wiggled all around him, and then they were being rubbed up against him. He was being played with as though he were a pebble. At least he was thankful of two things. Her soles were soft, and she was being gentle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh, he feels so good under there.\" Sighed Prunella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't hurt him,\" Fern warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't\" The poodle girl assured \"---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The very moment Ash hit the Ice tea he was given a taste of what that sensation might've felt like. In fact he was lucky his heart didn't stop from the shock, it could still happen as blood drained from his limbs to try to keep his internal organs warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping for air just above the surface of the ice tea he looked through the clear glass at Muffy's hand pressed against it, noting that she had very human like dermal swirls on her palm and fingers. Kind of amusing what one pics up on when one is bobbing around in a fridged liquid.  His attention didn't stay at her hand however, gazing upward he looked into the content face of Muffy Crosswire. He could tell right away she hadn't noticed his splash landing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt everything rise upward as the glass was lifted up toward her face, her mouth opened slightly to grasp the end of a straw. Before he could even attempt to cry out  Ash was pulled downward by a sudden undertow. Even if he had the strength in his arms and legs he doubted he'd be able to fight against the pull of the suck-age. Desperately he grasped the rim of the straw with numbing hands for a quick moment before shooting up into the straw. The upward momentum abruptly stopped, he was inside the straw now, bobbing up and down, the tea splashing up against the smooth walls of the straw. With nothing to grip onto and no feeling in his fingers to to grip anything he knew next time he'd have no way of stopping the ride.  He looked and through the top of the straw watched as Muffy's lips parted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'N-no--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh felt the air escape his lungs. His ears popped from the sudden change of pressure and he was rocketed upward with ice tea just behind him. Muffy had taken just a small sip that time but it was enough to suck the micro explorer into her hot and humid mouth. Foundering in a mixture of Ice tea and saliva Ash clung desperately at any hand hold he could find it and in the darkness of the Mouth he found on on the tip of Muffy's tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had a lot of work to do on her computer and she thought it would be a good idea to do it now and get it done and over with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was thankful when she came to a stop. Any longer and he would've lost my grip. From somewhere outside the shoe he heard the sounds of a computer coming on. Odds are she'd be there a while and now was the perfect time to escape his shoe prison. He crawled up the length of her foot but unfortunately when he reached the top of the shoe Ash found that Jane had  her velcro straps so tight he couldn't squeeze between the tongue of the shoe and her foot to get out. He was trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no other options he climbed back down to the toe of the shoe, since it seemed he would be getting to know Jane's foot up close and personal whether he wanted to or not. Despite his predicament he was naturally curious. Even in the dim lighting Ash could tell her foot was very much like a humans even through the sock. Nicely shaped too from what he could tell. He could almost forget this wasn't a human, not that there was anything wrong with that. What was she suppose to be anyway? An Aardvark he guessed  but she didn't look like one.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking  across her foot Ash figured it had to be at least twenty to twenty- eight feet across. There was a distinct smell of foot odor and lotion in the air and it was starting to get really warm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly'.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was starting to get real warm in the shoe; the humidity was also rising. This was a big concern. If he remembered my Discovery Channel correctly if the humidity were to reach 100% his body would not be able to cool itself down, if that were to happen, he\u2019d have five minutes before organ shut down. He hope he wasn\u2019t remembering it correctly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh felt the huge tendon underneath him twitch. Suddenly the foot lifted and slammed down, it lifted again and repeated the action. \"Ah, crap she's tapping her foot. Like my luck wasn\u2019t great to begin with but now\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was bounced about from the tips of her toes, to up toward her ankle with out any chance to grab a hold of anything to stop his momentum. Finally Jane\u2019s foot settled back down on the floor and was still again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That\u2019s it. I have to find a way out of here before she kills me!', <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out through the mouth was impossible, so Ash had to try to get Jane to take her sneaker off.  Easier said than done. Getting on his knees he raised both fist over his head and struck her foot as hard as he could. There wasn\u2019t even a twitch. After several more tries it soon became clear that punching wasn\u2019t going to cut it. Most of his blows were being absorbed by the thick fabric of her sock. What ever was left wasn\u2019t being registered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWipeing  away the sweat from his forehead, Ash noted  It was becoming unbearably hot. He had to get out fast.  Ash suddenly remembered he had a pocketknife. It wasn\u2019t very big but it turned out to be just sharp enough to cut a through the sock and expose the bare skin of Jane\u2019s foot. It took him ten minutes to cut a hole big enough in her sock to put his hand through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Okay, Brain\u2019 Ash thought to myself \u2018now what?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t want to hurt her. Nor did he want to piss her off.  So what He did next was crucial. Ash figured he could poke her with the tip of the knife, not to hurt her, just to irritate her enough to get her to investigate. Or he could run his fingers over her skin and hope to get the same result.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He heard a gasp from above, and with a deep sense of dread he rolled over and stared into the startled and amazed face of Jane Read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane looked down into the palm of her hand at the tiny creature she was holding. She'd gotten over her initial surprise and dropped her sneaker back on the floor, slipping her foot back into it in case someone where to walk by and ask why she had only one sneaker on. Upon looking more closely at what she was holding she came to the definitive conclusion that this was no insect she held. It might've been small, but not small enough for her to not to see the pants and shirt it was wearing. It made a noise as it fell out of her sneaker, a barely audible scream. She knew that insects didn't make vocal sounds due to the lack of vocal cords.  She extended the tip of her finger towards it.  Immediately it began to scramble away from it. But why? She wasn't going to hurt it, she just wanted to---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh! It suddenly dawned on her. Of course! The tip of her finger easily dwarfed the tiny creature. Even the tip of her finger would be an intimidating sight. She wasn't entirely sure if a creature so small was intelligent, but then intelligence didn't necessarily require mass.  She hoped it could understand her. She raised her hand carefully, just a little higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to hurt you.\" she spoke quietly. \"I just want to touch you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe extended her finger again, this time the creature did not move. She touched as lightly as she could, after all she didn't want to crush it after making this much progress. She could feel the tiny chest rise and fall, the feel of breath on her skin. And something else, something lower--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, I guess \"it\" is a he.' Jane thought to herself 'I hope I haven't embarrassed him.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the thought of having this much power over a male intrigued her. Even excited her. But she had to put those thoughts aside, for the moment at least. She felt three taps against her fingertip and then then felt what was no doubt a tiny hand press up against the underside of the fingertip as though to say 'How do you do', The closest thing to a handshake that could ever be made between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Nice to meet you too.' She thought as she lifted her finger away. If he understood her, than it was most likely that he also spoke her language. Communication would be difficult if Jane couldn't hear him. Jane though, how could she solve this problem? She thought for a moment then addressed the tiny in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At first she thought he, whoever he was, was reluctant to try. Then she felt a light tug on her hair, so light that if she hadn't been concentrating on it she probably wouldn't have noticed. She stayed in this position until she could feel him climb up into her outer ear. She recalled stories of insects crawling into people's ears and wishing at that moment not to have recalled it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you hear me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!.\" she said smiling warmly \"My name is Jane Read.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Jane Read.

Here she was having a conversation with someone tiny enough to sit in her ear. \"I hope I didn't embarrass you when I touched you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest I was afraid you'd be angry.\" said Ash \"I mean, I do my best to exhibit self control but at that moment it  had other plans.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly, I know it doesn't take much to get them started. I probably pressed down too hard or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must congratulate you though on being able to feel something that small-- Well what I mean is, It's perfectly portioned to my body---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane Giggled. \"It's Okay I know what you mean. Ash, how you ended up in my sneaker?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's all I can tell you. I apologize for having to use my knife but I couldn't stay in your sneaker much longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You poor thing, it's a good thing I didn't decide to go for a Jog. If I did jog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and me both.\" said Ash \"You'd be washing my stain out the next time you did laundry. Ms Read, I could really use some help here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid I can't help you return to whatever world you came from.\" said Jane, a sadness in her voice.\" I've never heard of anything like this happening before. Nothing beyond what I saw in Saturday Morning cartoons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I mean. I need a place to stay. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is that all? You didn't really think  I'd make you leave? Ash, I wouldn't do that. Where would you go, the back yard? You wouldn't survive an Hour! Hang on, I'm going to get up now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world inside Jane's ear shifted as she stood. There was a rocking motion as She took careful steps. Outside  the ear, the world moved quickly. \"Where are you taking me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Upstairs. I need to check on my Daughter. And I think I may have something you can live in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have many children?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have three children, ages eight, four and one.\" said Jane \"And a Husband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Husband.' Ash thought . A bit disappointing. But so far this Jane had a lot of similarities to her cartoon counterpart.\"Are they here Now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Baby is upstairs taking her nap, the oldest is still in school and the other is in a daycare. My Husband is on a delivery.\"  Jane walked upstairs to her Daughter's room and peeked inside. The Child was still asleep in her crib. Satisfied that all was well, she made her way to the bedroom she shared with her husband. For Ash, the ride was surreal. He'd ridden an elephant once, he was six years old and had gone to see a circus. This was like that, but on a much larger scale, and Jane looked much better than that elephant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw her hand return to the side of her ear. What a lovely hand she had. Climbing down through her hair and into the palm once more Ash Sat while Jane Lowered her hand to a night stand where she instructed him to climb off. He watched her open her closet and take a box down from a top shelf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This should work just fine for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not exactly all the comforts of home but it's the best I can do for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll do. Thanks.\" said Ash, then remembered she couldn't hear him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took twenty minutes for the Giantess to turn an old box into a house. Ash watched her with a feeling of security. Here he was, the size of an Ant, under the care of a creature that could only exist in a cartoon and yet here she was making a house for him. Finally, she announced \"All Done!\" and placed her creation in front of him. It wasn't much, but he liked it. It would be like roughing it outdoors without leaving the comforts of home. He stepped inside to have a look around. A moment later, fingers closed around the box and lifted it carefully upwards. A great eye peered into one of the windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look so cute in there.\" said Jane. Ash took a bow which made her giggle.\"I'll put you up on this shelf above the bed and I'll get some food for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eye went away and the the box house was raised further upward until it finally settled on a level surface. The fingers went away and Ash walked up to the window. Jane smiled at him before turning and walking out of the bedroom. Ash watched her leave thinking to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, get those thoughts out of your mind.' he thought. 'She's a married woman.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd been so kind to him, If he dared to do what he thought of doing, that wasn't how to repay her kindness. That kindness could turn into something ugly if she found out, an angry woman is one thing but an angry woman who could crush you under her thumb was quite another. He stepped out of the box house and stood among towering  pictures at the landscape before him. It was like living in a penthouse apartment. Well, he always wanted one of those. He looked over the edge of the shelf to the bed below. Jane's pillow was directly below him. If he could find a way to get down there....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Stop it!' h thought to himself. Why was he thinking this way? Could he stop himself from acting out these desires? He had to get it off his mind. Yes, that's what he'll do. He just had to be busy that's all. He went back inside the box house.In the corner Jane had placed soft looking materials. He went right to work on making them into a bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He wished he could've done the same, and one would think after a day like he had that he would be exhausted. That wasn't the case though. His mind was racing of thoughts he should not have dared think, but now that his head was filled with those thoughts he couldn't get them out of his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up out of the bedding he made for himself and began to pace the floor of his cardboard home. Maybe physical activity would help.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed. Well, it was worth a try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no other ideas coming to mind, Ash stepped outside his cardboard home to the edge of the shelf. He gazed down over the edge. Jane slept on her side, her head resting on her pillow directly below him, the moonlight illuminated her peaceful features. Under the covers her body stretched out like a mountain rang. It was driving him nuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't do it' the voice of reason in his head warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chose to Ignore it. Going back into his home he retrieved the rope he made from a piece of Fabric Jane had given him. He unraveled the material  for less deviant intentions but now it would serve a different purpose. Tying an end to a large figurine he threw the rest over the edge. At first he though he wouldn't have enough but by the time his rope unraveled he was relieved to see that the end touched Jane's jawline with feet to spare. Ash tugged on the rope to make sure it would hold his weight, and once he was sure it would hold he climbed out over the edge of the shelf into thin Air.  His heart raced with anticipation as he climbed down toward his goal. He had been so focused on his decent he didn't notice that the end of his rope was swaying back and forth, brushing against Jane's cheek. Ash was had only a foot or so to go when he heard the bed springs groan.</span></div></div>",

Down in his neither regions it felt good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew it was wrong. In his mind somewhere he felt guilty for taking advantage of  a sleeping woman, no matter the difference in species or size. That wasn't the person he was raised to be. But at that moment he wasn't thinking clearly. It wasn't the head on his shoulders that was in charge. Right then and there he felt like a kid left alone in a toy store. </span></div></div>",

She was dressed in her nurse uniform and from the look on her face was in a pretty good mood. The voice in the back of his mind was telling Ash to move, to jump up and down, and to yell for help. But he was too much in awe to do anything. He watched her glance to the left and heard her wiggle her foot into the shoe beside him; she looked like she was having some trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wouldn't be happening if the laces were looser' he thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied she turned her attention to her other shoe.

Thank God for Adrenaline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her foot settled into the shoe, Ash used what sparing seconds he had to climb up onto her stocking covered toes. He grabbed the netting of the stocking as tightly as he could before she took her first step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUD!!<br>\r\nTHUD!!<br>\r\nTHUD!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach footstep jarred Ash so badly he thought his arms were going to dislocate.

Then there was more walking and he heard the sound of a car door opening. Ash felt Miss Flynn climb into it and heard the door close. A few seconds later there was a loud roar as the Car\u2019s engine came to life.  The foot suddenly went on an angle as it settled on the accelerator.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But it pays the bills and there were worst jobs to be working. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light turned green. Pressing down on the accelerator she continued to the school. She wiggled her toes. She loved these sneakers. Too bad she had to wear dress shoes for the next eight hours. Fifteen minutes and two more stop lights later Ms. Flynn parked in her usual spot and walked into the school. By the time she arrived at the school classes had already begun. Her shift didn't start until the first morning recess. Upon entering the nursing station she slipped her sneakers off while finishing her morning coffee. She didn't notice her passenger hanging onto her nylon covered foot as it settled on the floor, nor did she see him slid off and run clear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it wasn't quite a run, it was more like a stagger. With the constant THUD and the bone jarring impact of each foot fall Ash had just barely  survived the journey. Free of the sneaker, all he wanted to do was get as far away as he possibly could and he didn't care where he was going or if it was rational or not.  He saw a door, and as he ran closer he could see that there was just enough space to crawl under. What he found on the other side was a vast hallway. A school hallway. He was in a school. Highschool, or Elementary? He had a feeling he'd find out soon enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was sooner than he thought as suddenly there was an ear piercing ringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gahhhh!\" Ash cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rumble began before the sound ended. Then the doors to the classrooms opened as students stepped out into the hallway. Giant Students. Heading toward him in both directions but none of them looking down at the floor. Ash's blood went cold. He wasn't too far from the Nurse's station, but he was still out in the open. He turned and tried to run back but the floor shook with multiple foot falls making it almost impossible.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe yelled \"Help me!\" Not that it could be heard over the collective giggles and conversations of the students. Of all of the students there were three who seemed to be homing in on his position. Fern Walters who was coming in from the left, Francine Frensky walking in from the right and just behind her, It was just a question of which one was going to get him first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">* Decided to give Mr Flynn a first name as her first name hasn't been reveled. </span></span></div></div>",

She wasn't looking down as she walked, why would she? If she had, she might've noticed the speck scurrying directly in her path. But she hadn't, and so she  swung her foot forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loafer covered appendage hung for a moment, then began it's downward arc toward him. With the floors shaking as if in an earthquake, Ash ran/stumbled as fast as he could manage. But in his heart he knew he didn't have a chance in hell in avoiding her descending foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shadow in the shape of a loafer fell over him. There was a great displacement of air and he was knocked to the floor, and then milliseconds seconds later the foot landed on top of him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh opened his eyes. What? He was still alive! As the brown loafer lifted away he realized why. By sheer luck he had found himself in the gap between the raised heel and the rest of the sole. Quickly he stood up and continued to run, he would check his underwear later. He was still not quite out of the woods yet. There were still other students in the hallway. And they were all out to get him whether they knew it or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Better to be on top of a foot than underneath. It was probably not the safest or smartest plan in the world, but hell what choice did he have? He'll be stain on the floor if he stayed where he was. Looking about he saw several candidates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe closest was Tough Customers member Molly MacDonald, her worn sneakers would be ideal for climbing. A bit farther away talking to Prunella Deegan was the blind rabbit girl Marina Datillo. Her dress shoes were not ideal, but there was a chance he could either climb either her footwear or Prunella's.  Further down but closer than the Nursing station was Ladonna Compson. Her sneakers were newer but the cuff of her jeans were folded  in a way that would make the perfect place to ride.

In spite of the traffic and the near misses he managed to make it, but as he got closer and closer to Marina, the more imposingly larger she got.  He gazed upward; damn she was tall for her age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sole of her shoe was at least six feet thick, and it took everything he could to pull himself up onto the extended edge of it. That\u2019s when he discovered that this wasn\u2019t going to be as hard as he\u2019d thought it would be. No it was going to be a lot harder than he\u2019d thought it would be. The surface of this dress shoe was almost smooth.  There was almost nothing to get a grip on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you\u2019ve got to be kidding me!\u201d Ash exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Marina and Prunella were in the middle of their conversation about Henry Skreever when the blind girl thought she heard a voice. Very faint, but distinct.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d Prunella asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! I\u2019m sorry. What were you saying?\u201d The conversation continued until she heard the voice again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s gotta be a way to get up there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Marina\u2019s attention was divided on the conversation and the voice. Despite it being faint it sounded close at the same time. Very close. Almost as though it were.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t move your foot yet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Floor! It was coming from the floor below her! Was this some kind of a trick or practical joke? Marina sniffed the air; there was something down there alright,  though she didn\u2019t know what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we'd better get going before we get scolded again.\" Prunella joked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be there in a minute,\"said Marina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waited until her friend's footsteps had faded away, then she focused all of her attention on the voice coming from the floor. It didn't sound like anyone she knew from the school. Or anyone in the city she knew for that matter. It was beginning to sound desperate, labored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was heavy panting and a sigh of relief. Then through the thin sock she wore Marina felt something crawl onto the back of her foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't stay any longer, so with careful and memorized steps Marina went to class. </span></div></div>",

In spite of the traffic and the near misses he managed to make it, but it wasn\u2019t until he arrived did he really fathom Ladonna\u2019s size.  He gazed upward; this was not going to be as easy as he\u2019d thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sole of the sneaker was a good six feet thick, and it took all he had to pull himself up onto the ledge. Then he had to inch his way along the side of the sneaker to a spot where the incline wasn\u2019t as steep. To do that, he had to press his body against the canvas material. Heat radiated outward, it was almost soothing.  But he couldn\u2019t stop. Ladonna could start walking at any moment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he made his way around to the toe of the sneaker, Ash began to climb. But it was slow going, too slow. The canvas material wasn\u2019t exactly the ideal climbing method and from all the running he was almost exhausted. It was that moment that, without knowing it, Ladonna gave Ash an assist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLadonna took a step forward. The impact sent Ash flying into the air where he landed square on the toe of the sneaker. She took another step, again he was air born.  This time he landed on the laces of the sneaker. A third step sent Ash over and into the cuff of her jeans.  Oblivious of the tiny hitchhiker the rabbit girl walked down the hall way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally stopped, Ash finally had a chance to catch his breath. Looking up from where he lay he followed the shape of the leg to the desk above.  So she was in class.  This was quite a mess he\u2019d gotten himself into. The idea that this might be all a coma induced dream did occur to him, but he dismissed it. No dream was ever this vivid, and his sore muscles were proof enough that this was no dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing up over the edge of the cuff he looked about. There were a few he recognized. Most had almost crushed him underfoot.  They didn\u2019t look exactly like the cartoon characters. Take a two dimensional character and make it three dimensional. Then make it as though it could exist in the real world.  That character would still resemble the two dimensional version. At the same time look completely different. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe slid back down to the bottom of the cuff as class began. Ash  pondered for a moment, Should he leave Ladonna and go out on his own? No, he\u2019d had a taste of venturing out on his own and it almost got him killed. He was safer with where he was. But would he be safer with someone else? He was thinking ahead to shelter food and water. It would be easier if he were in a house without a second floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrouble was that line of thought was that he didn\u2019t know and couldn\u2019t have known which home was two floors and which were one.  Well, except for Muffy. That was a given.  But who was to say that these flesh and blood giants lived exactly like the cartoon counterparts they mimicked? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In the meantime, he would catch up on his education. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later Ladonna stepped into her room and dropped her book bag next to her bed. As she did so, Ash climbed over the cuff of her jeans, slid the length of the heel of her sneaker, ran under the bed until he was sure he wouldn\u2019t be seen, and promptly relieved himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn\u2019t what you call proud of taking a piss right on the floor, but the amount was so small compared to everything else that it wouldn\u2019t be noticeable. He\u2019d been holding his water since he\u2019d hitched his ride. You\u2019re probably wondering, if his pee was so insignificant why didn\u2019t he go earlier? Simple, he didn\u2019t want to be rolling around in it when Ladonna started walking. Riding the cuff of her pants legs was like being in an amusement park ride without the safety traps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling up his shorts, Ash looked back out from under the bed. By this point Ladonna had slipped her sneakers off and was walking about her bedroom. Maybe getting ready to do homework, or getting ready to take a shower, or simply putting things away.  He could see through the stretched material of the socks that her feet were humanoid rather than paw like.  That would make a bit of sense when it came to walking upright. Ash watched on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt uncomfortable.  He wasn\u2019t exactly into voyeurism and it didn\u2019t feel right to be watching this giant in her private moments. He had to tell himself this was about survival and not self gratification. For one thing, He had to figure out what kind of a person Ladonna was. Did she have fear insects or get disgusted over something crawling on her. He had no plans to try to get her attention just yet, but if he had to and she had a phobia it wouldn\u2019t turn out very well for him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquish first, ask questions later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also some scientific curiosity. Ash was no scientist but everything he\u2019d seen so far was a slap in the face of everything he was taught was impossible.  A Rabbit evolved humanoid was impossible, a three hundred foot tall rabbit humanoid would\u2019ve collapsed under its own weight, how does that explain Ladonna? It didn\u2019t.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Ladonna stepped out of the room, closing the door behind her. He waiting to make sure she wouldn\u2019t be coming back, and then walked out from under the bed. The room was tidy, and clean in addition to being vast. There were no crumbs that he could see. He\u2019d have to look elsewhere for food but he had expected that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLadonna\u2019s discarded sneakers lay nearby. One was tipped on its side. Curiously, Ash decided to take a closer look. It probably wasn\u2019t the smartest thing to do. After all he\u2019d just barely survived his journey in Ms. Flynn\u2019s sneaker. But there was no danger here; Ladonna was most likely not going to be back for a while. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But despite it all of the red flags glaring at him, Ash slowly lumbered towards the shoe. A bold if not fool-hardy part of his psyche figuring it couldn't hurt to give the things some much-needed investigation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smaller more sane part of his brain is practically nagging at him. Practically saying that it is a fucking <i>shoe</i>. And he can't help but agree with that, But he didn't get a chance when he reached the objects of his less than cautionary curiosity. The opening of beckoned him with a faint warmth, it was oddly comforting...in some weird morbid fashion. The closest one on was haphazardly thrown on its side, allowing for easy access inside. As Ash stumbled in, instantly he smelled a noticeable odor of fair potency-making him lightly cough. The best he could describe it was like cracking open a bag of stale cheddar and vinegar flavored Fritos..and the vinegar is the main attraction. But after getting used to it, Ash couldn't help but smelt something synthetic. That and judging the fact that the imprint of her foot was barely and the discoloration was light seem to suggest that the sneakers are fairly new and she just began to wear them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his left hand outstretched and touching the mildly damp fabric, Ash quietly began to continue his trek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>``Ash Webler, explorer of footwear``</i>   Ash chuckled to himself just because of the sheer absurdity of all this. As he reached what had to be the toe section. He faintly saw five indentations of where her toes must rest. ''For something improbable to all known laws and science, her feet so...human-like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the disturbing likeness becoming more and more apparent, he turned around and walked to the back to the hole of the shoe. Finding that his wanderlust was fairly satisfied for now. But he stopped and looked to find the tongue was directly above his head. With the light of the room's light, he looked up and saw the shoe number, it was a simple seven, with the silhouette of a rabbit right beside it. Causing him to nearly trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I supposed that proves that these guys do have some of the \"natural\" biological quirks of their \"real\" counterparts than I previously thought...and rabbits do have big feet.\" And with a shake of his head, he walked out of the shoe just when the door suddenly. Ladonna was thee...with her green eyes wide as saucers as she stared at Ash's frozen form. The room suddenly grew quiet as they both just stared at each other. The wrinkling of Ladonna's nose was sending information to her brain, telling her Ash was indeed real and very much alive...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was night.  Twelve hours since whatever happened, happened. Twelve hours since he\u2019d last ate and drank. Ash sat against the leg of Ladonna\u2019s bed and sighed.  Above him the Giant rabbit girl was asleep. He had watched her until she decided to change for bed, and then looked away.  Hell hath no fury like a woman\u2019s scorn, but there\u2019s no fury like a giant\u2019s that can squash you like a bug.  Besides, he wasn\u2019t into that sort of thing anyway.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLadonna hadn\u2019t gone to bed right away, after an hour or so of sitting on her bed she had crept out of her room, sometime later she returned with a plate of food and a glass of milk. From the sounds he heard as she ate in bed they were cookies. Now the lights were out, and he was waiting until he heard the tell tale signs of sleep. When he was certain Ladonna was asleep, he wandered the sides of the bed until he saw the corner of a blanket touching the floor. Ten minutes later, and exhausted, he reached the top. Ash made a mental note that he really needed to work on his cardio. Climbing a blanket is not as easy as it was in those stories he\u2019d read. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh\u2019s plan was simple, collect any crumbs he might find and leave.  He had no desire to hang out up there any longer than he absolutely had to.  But when he got up there, and saw that giant lying there asleep, something sparked his curiosity. He wanted to get a closer look.  He approached Ladonna carefully. Ladonna lay on her back. Ash\u2019s eyes never left her face as he climbed up onto her chest. As it turned out most of the crumbs were around the area of her chest so that worked out for him.  Leaving them for now, he made his way to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a face that had human and rabbit characteristics. There was fur on her face, but it was short. Her nose was like a Rabbits. Her mouth hung slightly opened. Other than the two oversized incisors that protruded out from under the upper lip, Ladonna\u2019s mouth was very human. Curiously   Ash carefully climbed up her chin and up onto her bottom lip. There was enough light in the room to allow him to see the interior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRabbits are Herbivores, so their teeth have evolved to eat plant matter. But Ladonna\u2019s teeth were omnivore in nature; able to consume both plant and animal. This was unexpected.  Other than the scale, her mouth was like that of your typical eight years old.  He was about to crawl back off her bottom lip when Ladonna\u2019s mouth suddenly opened wider. There was a huge suction which was making it difficult for Ash to hang on. It didn\u2019t take much for Ash to realize that he was caught in the path of a yawn.  The tongue dropped and the throat opened wide as if expecting him to fall into the mouth at any moment. And as his grip began to fail it looked as though it just might happen!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not the titan he just saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walks a bit, he saw the mentioned woman. She was laying on the couch and reading a novel. Interestingly enough, his eyes were on her bared feet.

For his scale, the space was in the hundreds of feet. And he was going to traverse it for what? Just so he could get closer to those large plump soles? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monkey woman, or woman of monkey evolutionary decent, was still reading her novel. She slowly flexed her feet as if to say \"Come on up Ashley, Lets have some fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made his choice. He looked both directions to make sure no one else was going to show up, and started running.  His eyes were on her face. In his minds eye he pictured her catching a glimpse of him running towards her. He could see her frown and put her book to one side. She stands to her full height and takes two thundering steps toward him before lifting one foot into the air and dropping it down on top of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his mind, she did that. But in reality she didn't notice him at all. He was beyond her notice. And so Ash arrived at the sofa uninjured but out of breath. He gazed up. So close, and yet so far away. How was he going to get up there? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked to Ash that he had no chance of getting up there. Then he saw the book bag propped up against the couch. Trouble was, it was at the end toward the giant monkey woman's head, not at her feet. He'd have no choice but to risk being seen. Still, his prize awaited him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Ash fifteen minutes to scale the book bag. Not bad for someone who was inexperienced. While he caught his breath, Ash noticed a hot and humid wind coming from above. It was the monkey woman's breath. Her eyes were still intently on her novel, while south his goal beckoned him. He looked at her face, that was Monkey and yet not. He looked and her dark brown eyes and her broad mouth that could swallow him like a grain of rice. It was incredible. </span></div></div>",

There was that one point where she had slightly rolled her shoulders that caused a tremor that almost made him jump out of his skin, but for the most part the walk to his goal was uneventful. He'd been completely unnoticed by the giant Which he wasn't complaining about. He really didn't want to be noticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh gazed down the length of  the mighty landscape that was Lavern. The woman wasn't what you'd call obese. Bulky might be a better term, she carried her weight evenly though out her mighty frame. Nice childbearing hips too, from what he could see. And then of course there was his goal which he was getting closer and closer to reaching. The backs of her feet were covered in a fur that wasn't exactly coarse and grew shorter as it got closer to her toes. The toes were round and thick. Unpainted, but the nails were short and clean. As he was about to walk around to the other side of the enormous extremities Ash glanced back the way he came. Lavern was still reading her book. He smiled and walked around to the soles of the massive feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what a site beheld him. These were meaty soles to be certain. They appeared tough, but not calloused. They were wide and powerful. An odd way to describe a woman's foot, but when that woman is hundred's of feet tall how else do you describe them?  As she wiggled her toes, the soles would wrinkle and dust that had been picked up from the floor fell away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he was there, Ash wasn't sure what to do next. Like the Dog that had caught the car, he didn't know what to do now that he'd caught it. The ache in his groin was giving him some ideas though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTentatively Ash reached out and touched the sole of the foot. It felt amazing. He withdrew his hand and peaked out from behind the foot. It didn't seem that his touch had been noticed. Ash decided to become bolder. He pressed his entire body into the sole of her foot. The heat generating from out of the living flesh felt soothing. The oder wasn't as strong as one might think. He could smell soap, so she had showered recently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven pressing up against the sole of the foot appeared to go unnoticed.

Ash's descend stopped with...a cushiony land.

Like a great pioneer of yesteryears, ash gazed at the mighty landscape that was Lavern. The woman had a noticeable belly, it wasn't anywhere near to the point of obesity but it wasn't an hourglass figure. Despite wearing pants normally that usually hides a woman like her curves, her hips had the <i>right</i> amount of childbearing. Not overly big...but still nice. And finally...it was her feet. His inexplicable attraction to them come back, causing his groin to came back after thoughts about them ringed through his mind once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um..Hello there.\" The confused voice caused him to completely stopped what he is doing.  Slowly, Ash found himself staring at the befuddled face of Lavern. \"...What are you doing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I..I just lost as you see, I suddenly just pop up here, and decided to explore...and g-get help. I guess..I got lucky...huh.\" Ash quickly told a \"half-truth\" with a forced chuckle. The giant mother blankly looked at the teenager, she could buy that...but the woman is also the proud mother of two daughters. So she knows when a teenager isn't telling her everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh began to sweat as the monkey woman just...<i>looked</i> at him.

She was young once too...and she did things she definitely isn't proud. A part of her was definitely more than a little bit angry, how would you feel that a strange boy was going to live out his fantasies through you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a part of her was kinda flattered did he was attracted to her. Sure her husband is still very attracted to her and loves her dearly. But it was kinda <i>nice</i> seeing someone Catherine's age go to such lengths.

He never considered himself a pervert, but just being in her presence was making him think things and clouding his judgement as arousal often will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wandered down into a hallway, keeping to the wall.

I gonna stop watching the price is right'  Ash internally mused as he scampered under the first door. Purely choosing it because of how close it was to him. Said scampering was rather short-lived as he entered a bedroom. It was filled with sports merchandise with more feminine things hidden in subtle clusters. Soon a gust of some sharp acidic odor of great strength has greeted his poor nose, making his misfortune belly flipping and flopping like a flipping constantly flipping in this stomach. It was like soured cabbage being boiled in a vat of extra strength vinegar. But that uncanny feeling when he first saw that monkey woman returned with vengeance in spite of his innate disgust and dismay. The culprit of such a malodorous force, a used sock with its fabric crusted with dirt and yellow, judging the gentle heat wafting off of it like a dying campfire. Outright exhibiting that it was very recently worn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just fucking <i>nasty</i>.\"Ash cupped his poor virgin nostrils as his legs scampered away from the offending article of clothing. Which he was immediately greeted by an equally powerful perfume of sweat and dirt. Courtesy of also recently used clothes just thrown haphazardly on the floor. Something he also does to his own room often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis just makes him want to clean it up...prevailed if he actually survives this bizarre event and managed to go back to his reality. But the thought was soon as it was formed as his attention was directly on the direction of the bed. On top was another monkey-woman-monster. Judging from her youthful voice and lack of wrinkles on her young face, he says that she is roughly two to three years older than him. Which he himself is a sixteen-year-old freshman in high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She has to be her daughter doubt about it...\" Ash muttered as he got closer to get a better look at the room's owner. Her brown hair was very long and shaggy, to the point where bangs covering her eyes as she scribbles had to be her homework of the day. Just like the lady in the other room, this chick had the same thick hips, big backside in yellow shorts, medium-sized perky cleavage covered by a red t-tank top. But while she has a similar body shape, she is more muscularly lean and having less fat than her mother. But another thing she has in common with her mother was her feet. Which was thick and big in a sense of width and girth instead of length. Despite their size, they were a little smaller than the mature woman's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe short toes showed off their heftiness as scrunched up every now and again, causing the expansive dusty soles to form countless little wrinkles. Her hard dry heels that had little cracks near the ridge rubbed against each other at a slow pace. Producing a sound commonly heard when you pressed two pieces of sandpaper together. The only thing Ash could do is helplessly twitched his right eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....I'm now pretty sure that these monsters have some bizarre ability to make somebody like me get the hots.\" Ash only laughed to himself with no mirth whatsoever. This world is just mocking him at this point...it <i>has</i> to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will the brave adventurer do?</span></div></div>",

Kanda!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubella Deegan sat barefoot on the floor of her parent's attic and recited an incantation over and over again. Before her was an old book she had acquired though the local occult store. She was attempting to summon forth  an entity known as a Hu-Mon, but so far the only thing she was able to conjure up was a bit of wind. That in itself was promising, but nothing else seemed to be happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubella sighed, maybe she was mispronouncing a word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed the book and stood up. Prunella would be home from school soon and her mother would be back before she knew it and Rubella would have to make up an excuse as to why she wasn't at school herself.  Summoning an entity from another world just wouldn't cut it as far as excuses go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubella padded over to where she had placed her shoes. She considered putting her socks back on, but considering she wasn't going very far it didn't matter. She could've left the attic barefoot if she chose to do so, but she needed a free hand to hold the railing. As she began to slip her  foot into her shoe she thought she saw something scurry further into the shoe. Much too small to be a mouse and it didn't look like any bug she'd ever seen before. Either way, it couldn't stay in there. If a bug she would throw it out the attic window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh looked up, awestruck at the towering colossus before him. A part of his mind was trying to rationalize what he was seeing. It's a hallucination. You hit your head and your dreaming all this. The rest of his mind remain unconvinced and started to run to the toe section of the shoe (For he know knew that's what it was) as an enormous bare foot was raised over him. He stopped when he realized that the foot was no longer being inserted into the shoe. Had the giant creature seen him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got his answer a moment later when a sudden lurch upward knocked him to insole of the shoe. His ears popped and his world tipped 360 before he found himself in free fall. When he had gotten his bearings, Ash found himself laying face first on a vast tan surface. The pattern and texture of the surface told him where he was. He took a deep breath and turned over on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was staring up into the face of the colossal creature. He'd been dumped into it's hand. No, Her hand. As he could tell now that this was a female. A poodle like appearance, with curly orange hair and a gold earring with an emerald in her right ear. A purple headband, a white blouse with fringes at the end of the sleeves, a black and gray sleeveless jacket with flowers,and two pairs of green necklaces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubella starred at the creature in the palm of her hand. It was a Hu-Mon. A lot smaller than what she had been expecting, but a Hu-Mon nevertheless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I did it.\" she said to herself, then smiled broadly.\"I DID IT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so excited she kissed the tiny creature. Then quickly checked to see if it was okay. She felt she had to sell someone of her accomplishment, But was it too soon? What if it suddenly vanished? She'd look like a fool. Placing the Hu-Mon in her vest pocket she left the attic and headed for her room. </span></div></div>",

The girl looked like a cat lady in the making and one that likes to smoke a peculiar plant. It would certainly explain her rambling. His eyes looked down her feet, the big appendages were lengthy and have a long arch. The toes were long and had little pieces of lit between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>' That explains the smell from earlier...'</i> With his cheeks slightly inflamed, Ash looked up only to see Rubella coyly smirking at him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got a foot fetish.\" Rubella's calm voice was a matter of fact.

Causing him to stumble backward. The finger gently stroked on his crotch. Ash shivered as Rubella's smirk grown into a full-blown grin. Her finger instantly removed from the area, and she looked down at her \"familiar\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless the books at school are wrong. I say you got pretty excited down there!~\" The poodle singsonged while Ash defiantly looks away. An effort to save what little dignity he has left.

He didn't want to, but asked \"What are you doing with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this is just for a little durability test.\" Rubella  stated matter of factually. She turned the sandal so Ash could see the darkened worn pattern made by her feet \"You're going to lay down about here and I'm going to wear this sandal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"w-What?\" Ash couldn't believe she was serious. He did the math in his head, and found he sucked at math. But he knew this giant must weigh tons. \"I'll be crushed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hu-Mon!\" Rubella spoke sternly \"I can tell I'm going to have some trouble with you. So we can do this the easy way, or the hard way. The easy way, you lay down like the good little Hu-Mon I know you are, or I can tape you down. The choice is yours, so what will it be? The easy way, or the hard way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh gulped. Neither way seemed that appealing. But since adhesive tape might leave him without his skin when she removed it, and even though this could kill him, he decided it was best to say on her good side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be good, lets do it the easy way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rubella beamed and deposited Ash onto the worn insole of the Sandal. Ash lay somewhere in  the middle of where her instep would be and looked up into the face of this giant. He hoped he was more durable than he thought as the sandal was lowered to the floor next to the other one. Rubella, with deliberate slowness, slipped her foot into the sandal. As her toes slid over Ash, she paused to give him a gentle rub with her big toe. The reaction was as she expected and she giggled as she continued to slip her foot in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove Ash was a ceiling of flesh and bone. Then the ceiling pressed down around him. Molding around his body. Dermal ridges that were somewhere between human and canine came into full detail. With the weight on his body Ash was having trouble breathing. He wondered if this giant could feel his breath on her skin? He wondered if she could feel something else that was poking against her sole against his will though the shorts he wore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen  Rubella stood up.</span></div></div>",

He was in okay shape but he soon found myself out of breath trying to run that distance.

Arthur's coming back!\" Ash thought as he looked up in time to see the Giant bounding down the stairs toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOMBOOOM!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis right-socked foot slammed down almost on top of Ash as he ran past him, the tremor knocking him off his feet.  Shaking away the cobwebs Ash turned his head towards the front door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuster Baxter stepped into the house. 'Great' he thought,'another Giant to make things more complicated than they already are'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked to be holding something in his right closed hand. Buster opened his hand to show Arthur what he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s amazing!\u201d He said \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything that before! It\u2019s so small!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the Hell was he talking about? Ash couldn\u2019t see what was in his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go upstairs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Giants thundered toward him, neither one looking down or watching where they were walking. Ash wanted to follow them to see what they had; only problem he couldn\u2019t get up the stairs. He could get a ride on one of them. Buster\u2019s shoelaces were untied; He figured he could grab a hold of one of the laces. Arthur\u2019s socks looked to be easy to get a grip on. If he could get a grip, and if he could keep his grip.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The friends paused only for a moment in front of the stairs, and with a rush of adrenaline Ash I quickly leaped and landed on Arthur's right foot just above the toes. Ignoring the odor, He quickly grabbed handfuls of the thick rope like material that made up the sock  and held on tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur  didn't notice a thing. As he took his first step up the stairs it soon came apparent to that holding onto the giant foot wasn't  going to be any easier than it was with Jane. With every step he was thrown upward and then bounced around as the foot made contact with a step. It was good thing there wasn't much in his stomach or he would have thrown up by the time Arthur had reached the top of the stairs. Still, he also also noted despite the bouncing around that this was quite an experience for him as he  I could feel the muscles and tendons flex under him each time  Arthur prepared to take a step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur and Buster walked down a hallway and stopped in front of his bedroom door. Quickly, Ash slid off the foot and rolled clear of the Giants. He watched as they entered the bedroom closing the door behind them. Alone in the hallway, He wondered what to do next. He was curious to know what Buster had found, and yet he was also curious of the other rooms on the top floor. Specifically the one occupied by Jane and her Husband. </span></div></div>",

Sure it didn't smell the best at ground level but it was a hellova lot safer than being out in the open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doorbell rang. He watched as Arthur let Buster into the house, that's when he noticed Arthur was wearing shoes. So that's why he didn't put them on. But wait a sec, who's shoe had Ash been in if it wasn't his? Oh well, maybe it was his dress shoes or something. As he watched them walk away, Ash began to think of his immediate future. He didn't know how he got here, but he was coming up with a theory. And he didn't know if he could ever get back. There was a real possibility he'd be spending the rest of his life there, however long it would be.  If he wanted to survive here, Ash knew he  wouldn't be able to do it on his own. He had been lucky so far, but it was only a matter of time before his luck ran out and he ended up crushed under some giant's foot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to get help. Problem was, getting someone's attention wasn't going to be easy. And then there was the question of whose attention should he be trying to get? The Adults would be Ideal, but they were much larger than the children. And the children were smaller but would they be mature enough to deal with? Arthur or his friend\u2019s maybe, but D.W? Most likely not,  how much maturity would a four or five year old have? Not much if he remembered his own childhood correctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo those were his choices, either he tried to get help from the parents or the kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Getting down wouldn't be too much trouble because of the way each step was designed, but going up was going to be a bitch. Unless he could get a ride up there. If he could jump on someone's foot as they walked upstairs he/she could just carry him up, all he had to do was grab on and hold on tight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, that would never work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot far from the stairs Ash saw a laundry basket, inside he saw clean cloths neatly folded. No doubt someone would be dropping them off to various rooms in the house, including any rooms upstairs. he could easily hide among the articles of clothing without being detected, as least he thought so, heck he'd been here almost a half hour and none of them seemed to have notice him yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to feel the floor boards vibrate, someone was coming.  Looking around to make sure the coast was clear,  Ash ran to the laundry basket. It was a wicker basket and it was easy to climb up into it, well easier compared to trying to climb up a set of giant size stairs. He jumped in and crawled under several articals of clothing, a few moments later he could here Giant size footsteps. He heard Jane Humming a tune to herself and his ears popped and was suddenly propelled upward as Jane picked up the basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHidden under the clothes Ash had no clue where he was going. He knew He was going up stairs, which is were he wanted to go, but what the final distination was he had no idea. There was a pause, a door opened, and Jane walked into a room. He felt the Laundry basket placed on a surface. Suddenly He felt weight on top and under him as Jane's hand closed around the peice of clothing underneath and on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a tight grasp, the grip was forceing the wind out of his lungs. Jane was completely unaware that she was crushing Ash between her fingers, if she had she would've been very sorry about it. Luckily it was only momentary as she placed the two articals of clothing into a dresser drawer. She closed the dresser but in her rush to get things done, the drawer was left slightly opened. Waiting for Jane to leave, and also to get his breath back, Ash climbed up over the edge of the dresser drawer. He was definetly in a bedroom. But who's bedroom? </span></div></div>",

It was a much more sheltered area and unless someone lost the remote no one was going to look under there. It would do for now. Maybe he'd finally get to see a full episode of Bionic Bunny for once and see what the big deal was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>FOOM....FOOM....FOOM</b><br>\r\n <br>\r\nSomeone was coming. With great caution Ash looked out to see who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe youngest of the Read children, DW  walked into the living room to watch TV and was making a Beeline to the Couch. So intent on doing this that she didn't notice the Tiny human scampering  back under it. From underneath , Ash watched as DW sat down on the floor, her back against the front of the couch. She picked up the Remote and Turned the TV on. He heard the opening theme of a familiar TV show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bob and Millie Frazier, average young New Yorkers who attended a party in the country last night and on the way home took a detour. Most of us on waking in the morning know exactly where we are; the rooster or the alarm clock brings us out of sleep into the familiar sights, sounds, aromas of home and the comfort of a routine day ahead. Not so with our young friends. This will be a day like none they've ever spent--and they'll spend it in the Twilight Zone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's exacly where I'm spending it,' Ash thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat down for a moment. This was a crazy situation no question about it. Here he was an inch tall, give or take, in a world where the characters of a cartoon show on PBS existed. And not only do they exist but they're Ginormous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA noice broke his train of thought. Sounded like a chip bag being opened. He heard something loud being eaten and suddenly an open bag of cheese doodles was placed just infront of him. Ash's Stomach growled. How long had it been since he'd eaten last? He sure wouldn't mind getting something to eat, but just to get a peice of a cheese doodle ment going into the bag and getting out before DW desided to eat some more. Ash didn't want to get caught. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr worst, eaten.</span></div></div>",

Partially covered by cheese Doodles, I looked up to see a huge pudgy hand enter the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt picked up a doodle beside Ash and disappeared out of view.

The sudden movement caused Ash to fall on his back in the cusp of the Ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\" she said \"I'll try to move more carefully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but try to be natural about it. If you walk about all stiff like that and they'll ask questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just stay quiet. If you were to talk to me it would look as though you were talking to yourself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine slipped her sneakers back on and opened the door to her bedroom. From inside her ear Ash watched through thick ropes of hair as the world outside opened up. Ash thought that riding on a giant this large was almost akin to riding the sand worm from Dune. The moment Francine walked into the kitchen area of  the apartment and he saw the rest of the family Ash let out a gasp of astonishment. He had thought Francine to be the largest creature he had ever seen in his life. Her family towered over her. It was almost too much for his mind to process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine  decided that it was best to simply ignore her passenger and sat down with her family at the table. She poured herself a bowl of what passed as lucky charms in this reality and took part in the morning conversation. As for Ash, he was quite content to be the quiet observer.  Though to be fair, he could only observe one side if her head. From his perspective through the thick hair he could only make out Francine's sister eating her own bowl of cereal. The first loud \"CRUNCH\" of Francine's first spoonful of cereal being eaten startled Ash. He had no idea it would be so loud.  For some reason between observing Catherine eat and listening to the crunching of Francine's chewing he was reminded of Honey I shrunk the Kids. He watched a spoonful of cereal lifted out of the bowl and enter Catherine's smiling mouth and envisioned himself  trapped in that spoon. It made him feel fearful, and yet strangely excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Francine turned her head to talk to her father. It was something Ash wasn't prepared for and he found himself falling head first over the side of the ear.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The moment she heard the faint \"Plop\" Francine knew what had happened. A quick nonchalant glance into her half eaten bowl of cereal confirmed it. There was her little visitor clinging to a cereal bit. Great, now what was she going to do? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something wrong, Francine? \" Her mother asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, everything's fine. What was that you were saying?\" Francine dipped her spoon into her cereal. Everything was FAR from fine. What was she going to do? She couldn't get him out. Not with her family watching. She scooped up a load of cereal in the corner of her bowl, away from Ash. At least this way he'll know she wasn't intentionally trying to eat him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown in the bowl, and beyond the hearing capability of the giants, Ash was screaming. He had screamed a profanity on the way down and a swear word caught in his throat as his body hit the cold milk. Breaking the surface he reached for and held onto the closest sugary bit of marshmallow cereal. He was wiping the milk from his eyes in time to see the spoon dive into the milk some distance away and rise up with cereal. He looked up and saw it disappear into Francine's mouth. He cried out, but his voice was too far away to be heard. What he'd been picturing just moments before was now coming true. It was honey I shrunk the kids, but he didn't have a dog to save his ass! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until the second or third spoon full that Ash began to realize he didn't have anything to fear. Francine was looking down and deliberately missing him. He relaxed. She knew he was there. He began to enjoy the show. After all, it wasn't every day you got to see someone eating cereal from the perspective of the cereal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine's mind was racing for a solution. She was running out of cereal to eat, and she still had to get Ash out of her bowl. Every idea she came up with wouldn't work. Unless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sorry Ash.' she thought as she lowered the spoon for her last spoon full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh never thought for a moment that Francine would actually scoop him up. Though he had no idea how he was getting out of her bowl, the last thing he considered was that she'd have no choice. So it came to quite a surprise when the spoon descended and he was lifted upward. He was in her spoon, just him and a lone marshmallow bit. The last thing in her bowl now in her spoon. Francine's huge primate mouth filled his vision. He saw her jawline move up and down as she finished chewing the previous mouthful of cereal. There was a loud gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Francine, you could've just drank that down with the milk.\" He heard her Sister say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouth in front of him smiled and replied. \"You know they say, the last bites the best.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh let out a scream that was barely heard by the 8 year old 'Sorry Ash' Francine thought as she opened her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Ash, it was a sight of awe and Terror. Teeth three times his size, a huge tongue dipped down as if to accept this new treat, and beyond a gaping abyss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spoon scraped against enamel as it entered the interior of the mouth and everything went dark. As the spoon slid out from underneath him he was pressed up against the roof of the mouth. His ears popped as the air pressure changed and there was a loud gulp. He then felt the jaw rise up and down as Francine pretended to chew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising from the table, Francine picked up her bowl and as she walked away pretended to drink the rest of her milk. She then quietly poured out the milk into the sink before placing the bowl and spoon into the dishwasher. She then      <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Scale was absolutely incredible, and this was just one room. What was the rest of this world like? Ash noticed there were two beds in the room, if he remembered the cartoon correctly and if this reality followed any continuity of the cartoon, Francine had an older sister named Catherine. He couldn\u2019t recall her age but  did remember she stood a good two  feet taller than Francine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh felt a vibration. Someone was coming but the tremors were different this time. Whoever was making them was bigger than Francine. He may have jinxed himself thinking about her sister, she was probably coming back here.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I suppose I should hide\u2019 he thought. But wasn\u2019t necessary?

He could hear the pages  of a book being turned occasionally. This went on for about twenty minutes, after that he heard whoever it was get up and leave, a while after that he heard someone else enter the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash? Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh of relief he ran out from behind the stuff toy to find Francine had placed a scrap of bread on the shelf for him with a cap full of water. He was starting to think of himself as a pet of sorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was the best I could do. I didn't want anyone to notice I was bringing this stuff up.\" she explained as Ash walked up to her. \"I hope you're okay with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing She couldn't hear him Ash simply gave her a thumbs up and hoped her eyesight was good enough to make out his thumb, he doubt it though.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"look, I have to go to school and I have five minutes to catch the bus.\" said Francine \"I'd take you with me but I'm afraid I might lose you so you'll have to stay in my room. Are you okay with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh nodded. It would be better to remain in the safety of her bedroom than to face a school full of students. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll see you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the Young Giant left the room.

Night had fallen, in fact according to the digital clock on the bed stand it was after one in the morning. Well, how the heck did that happen? True it wasn't far fetch for him to have slept through the day, but why hadn't he awoken when Francine had come home, and why hadn't she woken him up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked up behind a potted plant to relieve himself. He'd rather not do it on a bookshelf but considering the miniscule amount he doubt it would be noticed. As he walked behind the plant he found a note written 12 x 25 foot piece of paper :<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Gone to a friends house for the night, Left a string so you can climb down to the floor. Watch out for Catherine.<br>\r\n-Francine*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that explained why Francine was nowhere to be seen, but why hadn't she told him herself? Maybe there was no time and she couldn't find him quickly enough. Upon relieving himself Ash found the string where she'd placed it. Tied securely to a pressed in thumbtack it did indeed go all the way to the floor, and to make sure he wouldn't get hurt if he happened to fall she placed a fuzzy slipper at the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Great, more foot where'  he thought, not that be mind, he was beginning to like being small enough to be in one.

From the sound of her breathing he could tell she was in deep sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I slept through Francine moving about but also Catherine getting ready for bed?\" he thought out loud. He didn't have to worry about waking anyone up, heck at his size he could shout and not be heard from that distance. The more he looked at her the more intrigued he became, the more he wanted to take a closer look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh no you don't' said the voice of reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She's 15'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She's also close to four hundred feet tall, what's your point?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I know what you are thinking.

Yeah right.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay hotshot, how often to people get a chance to checkout  a giant anthropomorphic?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'... point taken...

Live to fight another day.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he was done arguing with himself, it was time to make his way down. That turned out to be easier than he'd though. Ash had never been good as far as his upper body strength went, but now for some reason he was surprisingly easy to scale down the thread to the floor below. Maybe it was like how ants could carry more than their body weight or something. Upon reaching the floor,  his next task was to climb up onto Catherine's bed.  That wouldn't be easy.

With his eyes adjusted to the darkness, he made his way toward the Catherine's bed. What would've been a quick walk normally was a now a long journey that took him a good twenty minutes. In all this time, the young giantess shifted in her sleep twice and made Ash jump both times. It also gave Ash  a way up. When she shifted in her sleep that last time just enough blanket touched the floor, and when he arrived Ash didn't hesitate to use it to climb upward. This turned out to be a little harder than climbing down. So much so that by the time he reached the top he was out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Ash saw when he reached the top was a bare foot sticking out from under the covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was an instrument of destruction as far as Ash was concerned, still he thought it was worth checking out. The room was dark, but Ash's eyes had adjusted to the shadows just enough to make out much of the details. While the foot was covered in fine short hair the sole was completely hairless. Toes were stubby but broad and the rest of the sole was wide. As he got closer he noticed dermal swirls similar to humans on the unblemished skin of the sole. Even from 15 feet away he could feel the heat radiating from the limb. There was an Oder there as well, but not as unpleasant as one would expect, it would seem Catherine had showered prior to going to bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTentatively, Ash reached out and touched a toe. The skin felt soft with a warmth similar to clothes out of a dryer. When there was no reaction from the sleeping Giantess, he decided to climb up on top of  the sole. A risky thing to do, no question, but it was something he felt compelled to do.  He noted as he slowly made his way to the ball of the foot that he was so lite that he didn't even make an indentation in the skin. When he reached the ball of her foot Ash lay face first  with his arms and legs outstretched as though he were trying to hug the foot. The heat radiating outward soothed Ash's aching muscles. He wondered why Francine had warned him about Cath--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the foot shifted and he tumbled down toward the toes of the foot, he landed in the underside of her second toe as her toes began to curl.</span></div></div>",

Opening her book to the right chapter she picked up her soon and continued eating her breakfast. She frowned at the problem she had to memorize and also at the fact that her cereal had begun to go soggy.  So focused on her studies that she didn't notice the tiny person floundering and loosing a battle within her bowl. Ash knew he was going to die. The ice cold milk did it's job on his limbs and with the last of his strength he pulled himself up onto a bit of cereal. He considered just slipping under the surface of the milk and breath in. Drowning would be a far better death than being chewed, swallowed and dissolved. He just couldn't bring himself to do it. There was a flash of silver and a splash as the spoon dove down from above and scooped up cereal and delivered it to a waiting mouth.  The chewing and swallowing process hadn't even begun when the spoon returned. This time scooping up Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a blur of movement and an assent that made his ears pop.  He found himself weakly staring at an enormous mouth. At that close distance it was the only part of her he could see, and he stared in a combination of terror and fasination. At the moment  the lips were closed but moved with the jawline as Catherine chewed. To Ash it was as though the teen was showing him his fate. Then with a loud<b> GULP </b> the mouth opened. If this had been a Saturday Catherine would've been more inclined to eat more slowly, to enjoy her breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a rush forward. Ash got only a glimpse of the inside of the mouth before he was deposited inside it. It went dark as the mouth closed and suddenly the spoon was gone. Ash landed face first on a rippling tongue. The heat radiated from the muscle returning strength to his limbs and rising his core temperature. It was ironic that Catherine was saving and ending his life at the same time.</span></div></div>",

Of course there were some ground rules, one of them being that he wasn't allowed to watch them undress or change clothing. Well, he had no problem with that rule. He was a gentleman when it came to stuff like that. Besides, if he'd got caught he was a dead man. When you are as small as the tip of a finger the last thing you want to do is piss off your room mates, especially when they can crush you under that said tip of a finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe established a home among a potted cactus which provided shelter and a place where he could relieve himself.  His first  home was a TeePee like structure made of paper and match sticks. A few months later he upgraded to a cabin made of match sticks. The heads of course were removed due to fire hazards. Some cotton for bedding and two bottle caps of water that served as his drinking and bathing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid it bother him that he lacked any major technology? Yes. But he had Francine or Catherine to help him in that regard. He couldn't use their computer so they became his hands. All he had to do was speak into a mic and they'd do the rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Months passed, he found out a few things in regard to Francine. For one, unlike her cartoon counterpart, she had never owned a cat, nor had she ever had the desire to own one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I have a cat? I have you.\" she once joked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen The Sisters were away in school or other events, Ash stayed out of sight. He didn't want the parents to find him. As big as Francine was and was bigger Catherine was to her, so much larger was their Mother and Father. Countless times he'd watch their Mother walk into the room to vacuum or  dust or drop off laundry. He really didn't know how she or her husband finding out about a real live tiny alien life form living in their daughter's bedroom.  He hoped it would turn out okay, but in a worst case scenario it wouldn't go well for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes when no one was in the Apartment he'd explore. So far though he'd limited his wandering to just the Bedroom, then one day he decided to venture out even further. He waited long enough to make sure the cost was clear. Then he made his decision. </span></div></div>",

Granted there were a lot of disadvantages like the lost of  independence but the advantages outweighed the disadvantages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his protest Francine felt it was best to show Ash to her friends rather than keeping him a secrete like he'd wanted. She had invited them all to see the visitor from another world. it was a meeting that both fascinated and scared Ash to his very core.Naturally they were all fascinated with him. They  looked at him as though he were some exotic mouse or whatnot. The attention made Ash uncomfortable, but given the situation he supposed it was a natural reaction. Because they all had difficulty hearing him, Francine had placed him in font of a microphone that  she had hooked up to her stereo. Upon hearing his story, one of them named Buster suggested Alien involvement. His friends scoffed at him until Ash pointed out that techincly he himself was Alien to this world and all things considering they couldn't rule out Alien activity. At that point though, the biggest issue was what to do with Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way Francine could keep her little friend a secret for very long. Remembering the snake incident from a few months prior they worked out a plan that would have Ash moved about and living with all of them. Arthur would have Ash a few days, then Buster, then Muffy and so on. The Living arrangement turned out to be very profitable. Not only was there an exchange of information in regard to culture and societies but it also allowed Ash to become an explorer of sorts. Whether it was the objects in the room or the person he was staying with.  Even something as ordinary as a sock became something worth exploring. Course, all the while he stayed in the confines of the bedroom he was sharing and   for a while that was enough to satisfy his curiosities. But over the period of a month, he was beginning to build up enough of a nerve to take it to the next level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter considerable thought, he decided it was time to do so.

Not much had changed in the years. Well, aside for the longer hair and the loin cloth around his waist. His Shorts, shoes and T-shirt had long ago worn out. But, so long as he remained in a warm place he was perfectly fine. The hair, Now that had been a problem for him. How to cut it? Conventional scissors were out of the question, and the idea of having hair growing down to the cheeks of his backside didn't appeal to him at all. The solution came to him one day when he'd been out in the lawn exploring. He had come across a sliver of glass and he immediately knew exactly what he'd do with it. After adding a handle so he wouldn't cut himself he was left with something that could cut his hair perfectly. Not as close as he had wanted, but enough to manage it. He also used it to manage his facial hair, though at first he did cut himself  a few times until he had gotten enough practice. Now it was second nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh always did enjoy the company of Sue Ellen. She was a very creative girl, very positive, and the fact she had traveled the world and still had plans to do so, added to her personality. He enjoyed her company so much, she really didn't have to do much of anything, just being around and listening to her was enough for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the edge of the room, inside his wooden box that Sue Ellen had given him, Ash sat on his miniature chair, reading whatever small literature he had lying around-or at least his size-while waiting for her friend to get back home from school. The box had been altered moderately to resemble an adobe home. Small furniture of his size were placed around to his liking, while a door was carved to the side and some windows for air ventilation were made on the top of the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe books he had around were actually made by Sue Ellen's mother, who had a stock of miniatures lying around from her journeys. A perfect gift for him as he was impressed by the detailing of the pages and how articulate it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he felt massive tremors approaching, shaking his home and appliances. For every one that came, he would jump in his chair, fall down, only to be lifted up higher by the next shake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY ASH, I'M HOME!\" A thundering voice came, vibrating the walls of his home. Standing up from the ground and fixing his chair, Ash stretched as he walked out his front door. There stood Sue Ellen, all of her. She had age well into her teens, growing taller than most girls and being quite athletic as well. Sure she wasn't muscular but she was more agile than most people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer longs sported a blue skirt as she wore some sandals along with green anklets; following her get up, she had a similar cool blouse along with her tan jacket. Her hair had also grown longer along the years, going down her back but still keeping it in her familiar pig tail style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlumping her backpack unto her bed, she looked down to find her tiny friend already in front of her. She waved at him as she spoke, \"Hello there tiny friend! I am ready for another set of fun. Ratburn's been easy on us for the week, all my homework is done, and so far...well I got nothing planned that I remembered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh smiled, he was content with the news; that meant more time being spent with Sue Ellen than waiting for her to finish any assignment she had. \"So what did you have plan?\" Ash screamed back up, as he wasn't as fortunate to have a microphone like he did with Muffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Sue Ellen placed a hand finger under her chin, \"I do have some things in my mind...\"</span></div></div>",

The flooring around her room was difficult to terrain, instead of regular wood or panels, she had carpet installed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn't help with him moving as he would struggle with the fabric to run, or even walk, plus the added accumulation of dirt would usually catch him as he would go unto a sneezing parade.

Standing straight, he began to jog once more; catching up to Sue Ellen's left foot as she lifted her right foot once more and stepped in front of him. He stared in awe as she hovered over him, hands on her hips and peering playfully down at him. He loved as every step she took, moved in synchronization with her leg as she lifted it up, and brought it down on the carpet, creating the boom and breeze he came into familiarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUD!<br>\r\nA few running steps<br>\r\nTHUD!<br>\r\nA few more<br>\r\nTHUD!<br>\r\nAnd soon he was out of breath as the giantess walked even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue Ellen would walk away from him and towards him as well. Ash would see the sole of her foot rise from the sandal as she lifted it up gracefully to fall down on a far away area that would have taken him hours to reach. He then would see Sue Ellen's strides as well, covering more than what he could do even if he went full force. Miles of land for him, covered in seconds-although it was only a few feet for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she stepped over him, it was a terrifying benevolence as one foot would fly over him, the crevices of her blue sandals filling his view as they descend away and another equally large foot passing by him as well. It filled him with thrill and excitement as she did that and only more so as Sue Ellen had sat down, slowly removing her flip flops...</span></div></div>",

They had no idea until the very end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, a shadow fell over them and this huge hand appeared and scooped them up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuffy unexpectedly reached down, fingers closed around Ash and picked him up out of the miniature town. The next thing he knew he was sitting in the middle of the palm of her hand staring up at Muffy's much closer face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah.\" He said \"Just like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well her mother told her she had to put them back and that it was time for dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuffy Lowered her hand back to the miniature town and placed Ash back down where she had scooped him up. Dusting himself off , he looked back up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, JUST like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much, they started running away and the narrator said something about drinking and driving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuffy Frowned disappointed. \"Is that all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid so. They could only squeeze so much into a half hour episode and each week it would be different so the series never went back to continue the story. If I were to guess, I suppose they couple spent the rest of their days being pets or playthings for that not so little girl. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Knock Knock\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Muffy, it's time to go to school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be right out Bailey.\" Muffy looked down at Ash .\"You'll be fine till I get back,right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure,\" said Ash.\"No Problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" said Muffy removing the earpiece. \"See you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh watched her go and then glanced about the room, feeling very very small.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So as of now, she will be 19 instead of her 10 year old self from the show.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh looked at himself in the broken piece of Mirror. Not much had changed in the years. Well, aside for the longer hair and the loin cloth around his waist. His Shorts, shoes and T-shirt had long ago worn out. But, so long as he remained in a warm place he was perfectly fine. The hair, Now that had been a problem for him. How to cut it? Conventional scissors were out of the question, and the idea of having hair growing down to the cheeks of his backside didn't appeal to him at all. The solution came to him one day when he'd been out in the lawn exploring. He had come across a sliver of glass and he immediately knew exactly what he'd do with it. After adding a handle so he wouldn't cut himself he was left with something that could cut his hair perfectly. Not as close as he had wanted, but enough to manage it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt the floor shake. He turned to the bedroom door in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gigantic door could be heard being open. From it, Muffy's titanic form walked in. Each of her steps produced an earthquake to Ash as she walked over to the model community. Of course knowing her presence as soon as she opened the door, Ash was waiting on the center of town as she watched her get get closer. Her hips moving subtly as she knelt down and picked up her microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ash, you there?\" She asked cheerfully as she scanned the area for her little friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm in the park!\" He responded as he waved at her. \"I realized you were coming so I came all the way out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's not really hard for you to know that,\" She teased as she made herself more comfortable as she walked away from the model, still talking through it however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was school?\" Ash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh..same old, same old,\" She sounded exhausted by the question, \"Ratburn gives us a lecture, a very long and boring one, Brain answers most of it, and in the end we sit around just to waste time basically.\" At this point she had gone inside her huge closet to change from her school attire into something more relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like fun,\" Ash responded sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it,\" Muffy responded, \"I really can't just wait to graduate and take over Daddy's business.\" She struggled a bit to keep contact as she was changing and trying to keep the microphone well adjusted. \"I mean I know I need to learn and things, but I already got my place in life, I'm all set! All I need to do is wait for the end of the year and finally I will be done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had come out as she was wearing a very expensive and fashionable shirt along with some designer jeans and shoe wedges. \"But enough talk about that, the weekend is her and I'm ready to party!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you heading out somewhere?\" Ash asked as he saw her friend emerged and her familiar tremor steps approaching him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" She had not knelt down as she was looking at Ash directly from her current height. Ash just kept looking up and up at the towering Muffy as her hands were on her hips and her breasts covered her face from his view point. Muffy meanwhile only smirked as she saw the tiny speck of a friend down on her city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike most of her friends, she was surprised when Francine had discovered the little man around. And she had taken a liking to him. <br>\r\nShe couldn't explain it, but just the sheer size difference between her and him, really invigorated her; so much so that she always jumped in glee when it was her turn to spend some time on him. And as for Ash, well he enjoyed spending time with her as well; since he had a real bed to sleep in and an actual place to live in-even though it was under Muffy's roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was planning to go out,\" Muffy interrupted the silence between them, \"but I could stay if you want me to~\" She winked at him as he began to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was behind a tree and hoped that she hadn't noticed, but luck was not on his side as the gargantuan girl had picked up before he even had hidden. \"Or you could take me with you?\" Ash suggested coming out of hiding. \"I really don't want to hold you up from whatever you were doing, wouldn't really be fair to you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm,\" Muffy thought as she took one arm under her breasts, while the other on her chin. Thinking for a moment, she decided to....</span></div></div>",

She said the design was based off of a hut in a book she had read though when Ash inquired of the title of the book he found he had never heard of it before.

He climbed up into his hammock, and it seemed like he'd only closed his eyes for a few moments before he was awaken to the  Familiar Rumble in the floorboards announcing someone's arrival.

Ash always stared in awe at how humongous everyone was, even after 8 years of living in this world, his amazement never changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine walked in, wearing her usual red sneakers accompanied by her regular jeans. She wore a red tank top-holding her quite impressive breasts and her muscular arms-accompanied by a pixie cut hair style. Years of being an athlete and physical activity lead to her developing quite an amount of muscle mass on her. It wasn't overbearing but it was enough for her to accomplish the requirement of the sports she played.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd today was no different, Francine had come in exhausted from practice-hence the top instead of a shirt-as she was sweaty all over. Still she looked down, as it was customary for her, looking for her tiny friend along the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long as Ash used the sliver of glass to reflect some light as Francine sighed in relief as she was glad she knew where he was. It had been quite a few close calls that she almost stepped on Ash, the first incident being when she first found him, along with many other ones-mostly involving Catherine.<br>\r\nThere was one time she recalled that Catherine just strutted inside the room, when Francine was having some of her playtime with him. Lying down on the floor, she had Ash in front of her face as Catherine had walked in front of her sister, placing her newly purchased boots in front of her, to brag about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them had no time to react as Catherine's boot had engulfed Ash in a second while Francine was in shock at what had happened. Catherine began to bra twisting her boot in place, while Frannie was holding in the tears and anger against her sister. Meanwhile Ash was in panic as darkness had consumed in him and he thought it was the end of him; luckily, he had just being standing somewhere the grooves of the boot were going to land. He was safe, but the movement wasn't making it any less terrifying as he thought he was dead. He was pushed, shoved, and hit with the sole of the boot as Catherine bragged and then removed it to bring in her other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that split second, Francine had grabbed Ash in her hands and moved her closely to him as Catherine was unaware of the situation. After she had left, he had been bruised badly, but so far he was fine. Francine had felt such a relief as she was glad he wasn't dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on her bed, she sighed heavily remembering such event. She was glad Catherine was gone for the most part. Yes she loved her, but with Ash around, it was a hassle to keep him hidden and acting normally. But now that she was out to college, things were relatively easy now-except for the sudden appearance of her parents-but other than that, piece of cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe removed her sneakers as she tossed them into the corner, Ash watched carefully as he didn't move from where he was. The huge building sized shoes were always a scare to him, then again everything was, but he found it deadly when she launched them at such speed. Something that big didn't need to move even faster! Still he waited as he observed Francine patiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to take off her socks, which were soaked in sweat, as she threw them into her laundry basket. The sweat on her muscles glistened her body, making Ash to stare even more-and starting to get red under all his hair. He had seen her friend grow into a fine lady, which made it awkward for him as she had taken care of him for such a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Francine laid down as she stretched her body on her bed. With the relief of her shoes off, she wiggled her toes on the hard floor, as she waited for her body to cool down. \"Hmmm,\" she thought for a moment, she had a few minutes before hoping in for a shower. Her mind drifted towards Ash as she begin to form thoughts of what to do to pass the time... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ash waited as Francine left, feeling every tremor of each step as she made her way into her personal bathroom. A very good convenience, considering everything else. Still, as usual, he climbed down the sheets of her bed as he was impatiently determined to check something for himself. As he walked forward, traversing shoes, old magazines and some very old toys, he made it to the front of the bed as he looked and saw what he was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA footprint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Her</i> footprint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh gulped a bit as he looked at in fine detail. It was drying up for sure but it would have taken sometime nonetheless as the leftover sweat from Francine, left a perfect indentation of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was enormous, that one was for a fact, but it had dawned on Ash\u2019s mind for a while that he probably hadn\u2019t grasped <i>how </i>enormous she was. When they met all those years long ago, she was around 460 feet, to him at least, through the easy sum up of ratios. But now\u2026.she probably had either doubled that or easily had surpassed that already. She was big, he couldn\u2019t doubt it, as he walked alongside the drying up print, giving up in counting the steps it took him to make one of hers, as it ended and far away the other one began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what was worse, or good, she wasn\u2019t done. She was only eighteen and he knew aging and height didn\u2019t end until she was 21, or maybe even a little later. She was going to get BIG, very; and it was probably his paranoia, but he felt he was getting shorter. He couldn\u2019t tell why he felt like that, or show evidence, but when he didn\u2019t know where his head ended and his hair started, it was hard to tell his true height after all this time. <br>\r\nHe wasn\u2019t afraid of it, for sure, but he was\u2026.overwhelmed a bit. And that was only Francine, he hadn\u2019t even thought of the other girls: Muffy, Fern, Sue Ellen, and every other lady friend he encountered. He sighed a bit, out of relief and acceptance, guess it was just a sign that..everyone was getting older and taller-literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill his focus on the thought was snapped as the door to the restroom roared as out came Francine, fully refreshed after her shower. \u201cAAAAAAAAAAaaaahhhhhhhh!\u201d She exclaimed, deafening Ash a bit, only to follow by a series of earth shaking tremors. Francine relaxed as the shower did her well, her jeans replaced with some soft pants and a new red top on her after taking off the sweaty one. She looked down as she saw Ash\u2019s glass glimmer down on the floor. She rolled her eyes as she dried her hair. Sometimes she wondered if he intentionally got himself into trouble or wanted to be stepped on purpose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as she looked down, she was starting to get an idea as she was getting closer. \u201cHey shorty, got some water for you,\u201d she joked as her feet were quite close to Ash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d He asked as he stood up a bit after all the shaking, \u201cWhere are at, High stuff?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine only hovered her foot over him, still wet from the shower as some droplets hanged onto her toes and sole. Ash gulped a bit as he knew what she was doing. \u201cWell? Not going to drink?\u201d She asked, flexing her toes as a drop fell near Ash, splashing him and leaving him completely drenched, while he was still red in the face. </span></div></div>",

Still, I suppose in this case I'll make an exception.\" Ash knelt down and scooped up a glop of water. That was something he never got used to either. With the size of his hands water here had so much of a surface tension that he could pick it up. In the early days he'd been worried his body would not be able to absorb the water. Turned out that was surprisingly no trouble at all. \"At least it's water, not sweat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross, I'd never do that.\" said Francine as she went to where her Bathrobe hung. She went behind the closet door and emerged dressed in her Bathrobe and slipped on her slippers.\"I might tease you a bit, but foot sweat? No way. Sounds Nasty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It Is.\" said Ash as he noted the taste of the water. It wasn't quite clean, there were some traces of soap and of course Francine, but it was drinkable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Just HOW do you know that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hard way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got Francine's attention.

It was right around the time Fern figured out I had a thing for...Lower extremities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine smiled at the memory. Fern had always seemed to find Ash wandering around and sometimes inside  footwear, her Mother's Dress shoes, Sandals, but it wasn't until she was older that it clicked it. If it had been Francine, Ash would've been Horribly teased about it but Fern had more compassion for this tiny traveler from another world. She broke it to him Gently that she knew. What she didn't tell Ash was that she told all the girls before she broke the news to him. They all agreed (Francine reluctantly) that they would not let on that they knew. Instead, they would minutely tease him by doing foot stuff. Exposing a sole or wiggle a toe in his direction, That sort of thing. But always innocently. It ended when Ash Realized that the young ladies knew. That didn't stop the shenanigans though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was--\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cIt was during one of Muffy\u2019s many slumber parties,\u201d Ash explained, Francine immediately began rolling her eyes as she could already imagine the situation. \u201cSpecifically, that sweet 16 sleep over bash-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes, I remember,\u201d Francine joked as she sat down crossing one leg over wanting to hear the story. Like in regular fashion there was ripple effect flashbacking to the time Muffy was insistent on making Francine a party regardless if she wanted to or not. For weeks she had asked her friend, pleaded with her, even was offering to host it, if she just threw it. Francine, not wanting to get too formal with events at the time, reluctantly agreed on one condition. Well two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirls only. <br>\r\nAnd Ash could also come along. <br>\r\nMuffy not wanting to waste any chance to tease her minute friend, agreed. And so a few days later the birthday bash of sleep overs came. All their lady friends went to it, Fern, Sue Ellen, Prunella, etc, as the party went on into full swing, just like when they were younger! Only this time they had their special guest, one they always so fond off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this time however, Ash had more to fill on his plate than before. Pairs of enormous shoes, socks, clothes and all sorts of female attire littered the ground! Not to mention that he had to avoid the massive soles of the girls as they continued walking on by, danced with him in the middle, even purposefully missed stepping on him to see the red on his face. Course this was when he was still oblivious to the girls knowing of his secret, but nonetheless his reaction was priceless to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as the party went on, much to what Francine remembered, she did point out, that at some point they had lost track of him. Ash gulped as he continued, that this is the part he was getting to and the same one to answer her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvidently, he had gone away from the girls to catch a breather. At some point, near stomp experiences had really tired him out. Regardless this lead him to be in an area, well, unknown to him. As many times as he had been in the Crosswire household, he never had fully explored it. One it was too big, and two, all he knew was what Muffy had showed him on her lone tours, and even then she had him on a leash as immediately they would go back to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time however, curiosity got the best of him as he wanted to explore and if possible find one room he knew had to exist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillicent Crosswire\u2019s room. A.k.a Muffy\u2019s Mum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had used the walls as a form of labyrinthian maze. It was a bit of a side project he had years in the making, whenever he had stayed with Muffy. The reasoning for this project was an even older flashback, within the flashback, as he had recalled one of the early memories of him staying with Muffy. As she had left him alone for a few moments in her small mint village, her mother had come in, looking for her, and then eventually, looked at the toy village. Ash, who had clothes back at this moment, was walking outside the streets when he was forced to pretend to be one of the many small figure models in order to not be caught. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillicent had walked inside the small villa however, each step shaking each building, foundation, the models of people, even him. He tried to stay still but only would jerk as a booming heel would come down. He heard her mom laugh, teasing at how small the village was compared to her, not out of harm towards her daughter, but genuinely enjoying the size difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I were this big,\u201d He heard her boom, \u201cI think I would enjoy all the little people looking up at me,\u201d She snickered, taking another step as it boomed, making Ash fly up and land directly on top of her heel. He had even screamed as he landed with a, \"OOoofff!\" As he covered his mouth immediately and looked up and up, to noticed the matriarch of the household look down on him. There was a sly curiosity in her face, a sly smirk, investigating eyes and even a need to reach down, yet the noise of Muffy coming back cut that short as she simply shook Ash off as she walked out of the village; but not before giving a sly wink as she left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now back to the original story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh had spent years formulating this plan as he had a mental map of the house as he continued walking alongside the walls, making distance and record time as he didn't have to crawl through carpeted floor. He passed the familiar path towards Muffy's room, crossed off the paths that took him towards the kitchen and pool areas. Even crossed out where the servants lived as well, as he headed one way and one way only. Towards the massive oaken door that appeared to be the head house room, he gulped as he walked in through the crevice. Years of planning and marking out and he was right, this was the correct place but to his surprise...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His heart had leaped into his throat when he noticed that she had tucked her bare feet under the chair she was sitting on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer soles were pointed in his direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCall it obsessive, hormonal, or whatever, Ash was drawn to a pair of soles like a moth to a flame.  Not knowing how much time he had, or if he might be too late, he made his way though the carpet. As he did so, he studied his goal closely.  Millicent pampered her feet, Ash could tell that right away. He also noticed she had a more narrower foot with toes that were longer and not as round. His heart was beating fast as he got closer and closer; All the while  Millicent continued to get ready for bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he was there. Despite the danger Ash crept up toward one vast sole. Feeling the heat being given off  by the bare  limb he extended one shaky hand and touched skin. It was warm, as expected, but also had a texture that was not unlike leather. He slipped his fingers between the dermal swirls and gave the skin a slight squeeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly everything went dark as the wall of flesh he was studying fell upon him pressing him into the carpet and pushing the air out of his lungs. The incredible weight threatened to crush him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen above he heard \"Hmmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The air was squeezed out of his lungs and he was lifted upwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" Millicent examined the object she had felt under her foot. Ash didn't move a muscle. He didn't dare. He'd never before been held by an Adult giantess. She was so huge that up close he could only see parts of her face. A cheek, and the eye that stared at him. The pupil focus intently on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillicent examined the object. It was one of the figurines from Muffy's toy village. How did it get in here? She was about to get up and bring it back to her daughter's room when she paused and looked at the figure again. Then she smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come to visit your Giantess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What?' thought Ash. 'Did she know?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm flattered, but it's not gentlemen like to arrive unannounced. I Shall have to punish you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPunish?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you ardor my Foot so much, why don't you have more time with it? Would you like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillicent picked up a slipper and dropped Ash into the heel section where he slid and tumbled to the toe section. The slipper was the fuzzy kind with a fuzzy but used interior. It also had a smell to it. Why wouldn't it have one? It was Millicent's favorite pair and he had often watched her wear them. He never thought he'd find himself inside one. He felt the slipper descend to floor level. Then the light dimmed and vanished as Millicent maneuvered her foot into the slipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillicent felt the figure under her toes and smiled to herself. If only this was a real tiny person. To feel him struggling under her toes would be quite a sensation. She sighed and wiggled her toes slowly as she leaned back in her chair. </span></div></div>",

And he looked up, way up, to see her standing before him in her full glory. Hands on her hips as she smirked at his puny body. \"Now what to do with such a devoted servant?\" She teased as she tapped her foot in place, making vibrations all across his body as he shook in the ground. \"Do I step on him with my callous sole? Or do I take him and show him....the more interesting parts of me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Ash blush, immensely, something Millicent caught as she saw the little <i>toy,</i> turn red all of a sudden. This was making her suspicions true, but she needed to know for sure. If she did an action, and if her hunch was correct, a reaction to it would occur. But the question was, what did she decided to do next?</span></div></div>",

Maybe he was still trying to pass off his guise as a toy. Or he was too frightened to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrighten, that gave her an idea. Maybe he'd be more willing to explain himself if he was fearful of her wrath.  Why not? After all it worked with her oldest son whenever he got in trouble. She quietly cleared her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no point in pretending now.\u201d She addressed the occupant of her closed fist in her stern mother voice. \u201cI\u2019m opening my hand, don\u2019t try anything foolish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right, Ash knew it. The Gig was up. As the fingers uncurled he slowly stood and faced her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swallowed. Millicent looked pissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Or are you just a mute?\" Ash once again shaking from the fearful look did not what to say. It was one thing to have been in a situation where the girls teased him, but here he genuinely felt terror as he was certain Millicent would have done worse to him if he didn't speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further to do, he gulped, and said, \"N-n-no-o-o, I'm very c-c-capable of speaking,\" He said stuttering, shaking as he finished as he still felt the aura of anger emitting from Millicent. Meanwhile she was having more than a laugh inside her head, but professionally didn't break character as she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you have been prancing around my home?\" It was more of a demand now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" He said meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With my daughter?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For how long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" He stood quiet before he could even think of a response, \"For a very long time.\" He said. Millicent only stared as she had quite hoped to hear that answered. This confirmed her suspicion of this not being the first time they met but also confirmed that under all jurisdiction, she had control over this.....prize. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking she then said. \"Well then, I guess you have had quite the peeping adventures.\" This made Ash blush as she only laughed at his action. \"My, my, one to be so easily red,\" She leaned in a bit as she whispered, \"I adore that.\" Turning the poor boy even redder.</span></div></div>",

Ash gulped as he noticed all the things she used to keep herself young and beautiful and he couldn't help he might have needed to use those things at a certain point. Still, he gasped as he saw her lift her feet up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWent one foot as he fell on his feet as-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWent the other as he could not stand for a few more seconds until he looked and looked and looked and looked and looked and look- \"EHM!\" Millicent's voice snapped him out of his trance as he looked to the unamused lady looking at him in between her feet. \"I thought my servant, served.\" She said with a keen voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, right away ma'am!\" Ash saluted as he ran towards her heel as he pressed his hand on the rough skin and began to press away; immediately did he feel the difference. With Muffy whenever she asked him here and there to massage her, he could feel a very soft and squishy texture to her feet, making it very enjoyable-and easy-to get a massage done within less than 30 minutes or so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere, it was different. Millicent was thicc, and not just in the waist and bust department. She had thick soles, and Ash could feel them with every push he gave outward. Her skin was also very coarse and rough, added with her age and the of muscles she had developed over the years. He gulped, applying more and more pressure than ever before. He worried that his current job was not enough, he needed to go further beyond than anything before to make sure he wasn't deemed useless. Otherwise he feared for his life.<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n...<br>\r\nand the fact he would be denied serving her as well. Even though he would never admit it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for him, Millicent found his efforts more than endearing, with a hearty sigh of relaxation did she lean back and let him work. She was enjoying, more than anything, the service she was getting. Yes it was minuscule, yes it was a bit surreal, but she enjoyed it to no end, the fact she had a little person serving her every need and catering to her as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she knew he enjoyed it, why else would she had found him peeping in her slipper? She relaxed as she peered down on him. While diminutive, Ash was working hard and very well as he continued to massage, getting in deep within her crevices and folds to try to give her nerves pleasure. He did as he usually did, massage, then climb using wrinkles, massage, and then repeat. Only this time he spent longer and longer given the size of the feet he was working on and the hardship of working with such....client. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless Millicent was getting a little bored that's when she spoke up. </span></div></div>",

Looking up once more, he saw his gigantic friend focused on his device as he sighed, \"Way to go dimwit.\" He said to himself as he walked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe used his familiar path under Francine's bed that lead him to the hallway, it was pressed from his footing for the years that he used and on the end, was a little hole, small enough to not be noticed, yet big enough for him to cross towards the other side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stretched as he sighed, leaving Francine's room as he looked around. No one was home, or in the room at least. Laverne, Francine's mom, was probably either out shopping for groceries or getting the laundry done in the basement of the apartment complex. Catherine for sure was not due out of college for another few weeks. So for sure he was alone, and didn't make him feel better as he felt guilt, a lot, for not telling Francine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what am I supposed to tell her?\" He said to himself as he walked openly in the living room carpet, the fibers almost towering him as he moved through them. \"Oh sorry Franny, I'm just in a-\" He caught himself as he covered himself and looked around-nobody, \"Phew,\" He said as he continued. \"Sorry that I can't tell you what happened between Millicent and I because, because,\" He almost wanted to tear himself apart as he wasn't sure how to even respond to it. He was halfway through the carpet until he heard a massive wind come in from the north and a shattering sound. \"Oh crud,\" He said to himself as he felt it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUMM<br>\r\nOne quake shook his core.<br>\r\nTHUUUUMMMMM<br>\r\nAnother one was moving his body unwillingly.<br>\r\n<b>THUUUMMMMMMMMM</b><br>\r\nNow Ash was being send up in the air by the quake and the movement of the fast air as he landed away from his position as he looked up, Laverne.

Everything, and he meant-everything-that Francine and Catherine had in looks came from Laverne and she had them perfected as she was already plump and finished. Her hips, wider, her breasts, larger, and her legs, longer as well, not to mention her....her....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh had to snap himself out of his trance as he stared at her flats for too long as he stood up and began to run, \"Crap is today the day?\" He asked himself as he wanted to hide, \"I completely forgot.\" He was on his way, unsure of what the future that magnificent massive mother had.  </span></div></div>",

She noticed a small speck crawling around her carpet. Naturally she would have thought it was a bug, but Laverne knew better as a sly smile formed on her lips as she walked towards said \"bug.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh began to panic as every step she took sent him flying higher and higher in the air. When he would land back down he would cry out, \"OOFFF!\" Only to be lifted again as the next step would come. Eventually the light he enjoyed was darkened as Laverne's immense body filled his view. He gulped as the massive milf was looking right at him. He began to shiver as she pulled out her right foot from her shoe and hovered it over him. The callous meaty sole engulfing what even little light he had left as he lifted up his hands and yelled out, \"Please don't!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaverne hadn't said anything in fact she was enjoying the power she was holding. When Millicent had revealed the little man to her, years ago, she couldn't help but like him immediately. She didn't act high and mighty or like a queen as Millicent did, but she did demand the little boy to pay her attributes for living in her home. When she was alone by herself, she would let Ash run around while she walked around, enjoying the little man jump up from her powerful step alone. She also made him massage her large feet, enjoying his little hands get inside her wrinkles. However what she enjoyed to do the most was stomp on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she wasn't sure if the action was fair enough, yet once again her opinion changed due to Millicent's involvement as she had gotten teams of scientists to make an item to become denser. Of course she didn't tell them why she wanted that, but with her power and influence it didn't matter. Eventually a ray was built, one she delightfully tested on the small Ash as his appearance was the same but his body wasn't. It was more tightly compact now due to his small size, allowing for the woman to effortlessly step on him without any concern. Ash would have denied everything they had said about him enjoying such antics, but in reality he loved it. He always wanted for them to do this, but he knew the consequences were higher than the rewards, now with that out of the way he was able to be used as such. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted he could still feel pain and he could still feel pressure, weight and all the other fanciful heavy terms. But he couldn't die, and that was a plus for him, at least it depended on who stepped on him. Laverne only sneered as she whispered back to him, breaking off her seconds trance, \"You know you like it,\" holding back a laugh as she brought her foot down on him. The tiny Ash squeaking a small scream as he was trapped right under the mighty meaty foot, feeling its pressure come down unto him. Like a mighty skyscraper crashing down, he could feel all of Laverne's weight on him as she twisted her foot a bit, making sure he felt her all over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes she lifted it back up to see a small little speck stuck against her brown skin. \"Perfect,\" She said as she slipped back on her flats. The tiny man yelled as she did this, music to her ears after all. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But then, she slowly, seductively, slipped her foot out of her flats. Yeah, she had spotted him alright. She was giving him a show ; letting him see the sole of her foot in every detail.The meaty sole was calloused but soft in all the right places. He should know, after all he'd  massaged her large feet many times. More than once he'd been under them, felt their weight and power over him. He would've died long ago had it not been for that one procedure he'd undergone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillicent explained it made his molecular structure denser. All he knew was that it hurt like hell and it had not only made him denser but slightly smaller. As if he didn't have issues with his height as it was. On a plus side, it could survive a little rough play from Laverne and the other Milfs. And he never had to worry about cutting himself or breaking bones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched as Francine's Mom flexed her sole for a few moments more before she looked over her shoulder, winked, and slipped her flat back on her foot. Ash watched her grab her purse, check her grocery list, and leave. He had a feeling she had something planned for him later that evening. If that were the case, he'd better get some rest now. The only chance Lavern had to really have fun with Ash was late at night when everyone had gone to bed. she timed it with a show she watched that happened to come one once a week at 11pm. Everyone was asleep by then and thus the fun could be had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer idea of fun was sometimes different than Ash's but most times they were on the same page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh decided to sleep in his secondary house located under Catherine's bed. Catherine, who had moved out and was currently in university. Even though she had known nothing of his presence in the apartment, he did miss her. Probably why he decided to set up his secondary home was under her bed instead of Francine's. It was a cardboard box with a hole cut into it. Nothing as fancy as his other home on the shelf. This one was set up as a backup in case he had to hide, which he did more than once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh crawled onto the cotton and stretched out. It was warm , so no need for a blanket.

All this talk of Milfs was getting his mind running around in his head and slowly his dreams drifted towards the topic. However he wasn't dreaming, he was remembering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remembered the first time the Milfs had taken hold of him. After Millicent, his routine task of serving them was more and more constant as the years went by. Either when Millicent held a gathering or just a relaxed evening with one of the others. Still, he couldn't help but drift towards...Jane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gulped as he continued, remembering the first time he had seen her. It had been a cool fall day as Laverne was the only one in the house. Ash had been tending to her as he usually massaged her during these days, until the door had rang. Laverne, leaving him alone for a few minutes, had invited Jane along. Ash's jaw had dropped as he saw her, she was quite the looker for sure. Taller than Laverne, just a bit, but he could see the curves that she had resided on her thighs. They connected downward to some very long legs as Jane walked in. Her breasts were also very impressive and her voice quite soothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thanks for inviting me in Laverne,\" She spoke as she made her way towards the living room, \"It's nice to have some girl talk from time to time,\" She added as every step she took, shook the tiny Ash over and over again, making him fall down as she sat down in front of him, with Laverne right opposite of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any time girl,\" She winked at her as she looked down on Ash as she continued to speak, \"So you quite know why you're here, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, some form of little guy around?\" Jane laughed, as her laughter was beautiful, \"Come on Laverne, do you think I would fall for that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the exact same thing I said,\" Laverne laughed as she bumped the table knocking the poor Ash down once more, \"But then all I had to do was....look down,\" She pointed at the table for Jane to see as she rolled her eyes but followed her friend, \"And everything started making more sense.\" Jane, reluctantly, had looked down that day and only gasped as she saw something before her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh had also gasped as he was standing up did her massive eyes make contact with him as he gulped. The two fell silent as they both looked at one another, until eventually he broke the silence, \"Ummm...hi!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane was still silent until she slowly moved up her hand and waved at him, \"Hello...\" She was astonished, flabbergasted.....just...stunned as she saw this. She didn't know what to think, or what to say, or what to do, all of it going blank for her until Laverne broke the silence, \"You know he can talk, honey.\" She said as Jane almost jumped from the sudden familiar voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laverne, what is this?\" Jane asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, a little man,\" She said with a grin as she stood up, \"Sure he is tiny but don't worry honey, he can't really harm anyone,\" looking down on him she added, \"But you sure can harm him, oh but don't worry he doesn't mind it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane was now even more concerned by this as she had to ask, \"What do you mean by that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaverne only smiled as she said, \"Want a demonstration?\" Jane only nodded as Ash was lifted up before he could say anything and set down on the floor. He gulped, now viewing the true size of these giantesses as Jane was curiously waiting for what was next. Slowly did Laverne lift her foot up, Ash immediately knowing what was going to happen, he was going to shout before his voice was snuffed out by Laverne's sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane gasped as she was about to retaliate to her, until Laverne lifted up her foot and Jane could see the small man...unharmed and...breathing. \"Are you okay?\" She asked as Ash stood up, groaning from the pain he felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never better,\" He said as he was feeling a bit relieved to be quite honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See what I tell ya?!\" Laverne said as she patted her friend's arm. \"He's a good stress ball, can't tell you how many times he has helped me popped those annoying stress joints.\" Jane was still looking down on him, a bit worried for his health, but now a bit reassured about it. \"So any questions?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well first, does he have a name?\" Jane asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash!\" Ash cried out from the bottom as Laverne still wanted him to have manners, even if she intruded on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hello Ash!\" Jane said as she was still not believing what she was doing, still she continued, \"I'm Jane, Jane Read and I...well, it's nice to meet you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you to Miss Read.\" Ash replied, happy he was being treated a bit nicer. \"Uhmm...is there anything you would like for me to do?\" He asked as Jane was puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what do you mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well usually,\" he gulped, \"I...service Miss Laverne when she needs it, or asks. So i was thinking that possibly you could have something for me to do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was even more confused by this until Laverne whispered in her ear. \"Trust me he is great, in fact I can suggest something.\" She said as she whispered...</span></div></div>",

If I knew then what I know now though, I would've gone back to the party a lot earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what did happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened was I noticed the closet door was opened. There were shoes neatly arranged at the bottom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike dropping a pebble in a pond, Memories of what happened surfaced. It seemed almost fated that the first thing he had seen upon entering the bedroom was a collection of expensive looking shoes place neatly on the floor of an open closet. And he just had to get a closer look. He had jogged as quickly as he could having  wanted to get there as quickly as he could in case Millicent came back. It would've been easier to hide among the shoes than to be caught out in the open. It took him a bit longer than expected but he soon found himself catching his breath in font of a pair of one of the many turquoise shoes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd never been this close to a pair of Millicent's shoes before, and it really gave Ash a good indication as to how small he really was to  the matriarch of the household. To get that close while she was wearing them would've been suicide as she very rarely ever looked down while she was walking.  Even when she was standing, her feet never really stayed still. A small move on her part and he would've been a smear on the bottom of a pair of sandals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe casually strolled among the shoes like he had come across some alien town long abandoned . As he admired the surroundings he wondered how much collectively how much the collection of footwear cost. Probably a lot more than he could make in  a year.  Maybe two years.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked, he began to notice an Oder. One that he wasn't at all unfamiliar with. It was unmistakably foot sweat, and it was coming from a pair of used but well maintained joggers. He recalled Muffy telling him at that time that her Mom was on a health kick and had taken up jogging. Since it was in the evening , and he had thought Millicent wouldn't be wearing them until at least morning , he decided to get a closer look. More specifically, Ash was curious to see if the indentation of Millicent's foot was present in the jogger's insole.  He was always curious about the shape of her feet, whether or not her daughter had inherited the shape of her feet from her. He had considered getting a look at her foot while she slept, but thought better of it as there was the chance he could loose his bearing under the blankets and end up at \tEd Crosswire 's feet instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the laces he climbed up onto the tongue of the jogger and looked down. His heart leaped as he saw the darkened indention of a heel. Without thinking of the consequences he climbed over the edge of the opening and slid into the jogger. His feet made a wet sound as they touched down on the insole. Here the smell was the strongest. There was another smell, a air freshener smell, but it did little to cover up the smell of foot sweat. Guess even the rich have issues with Foot Oder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked toward the darkened craters made by Millicent's toes. He imagined the foot that made them, a literal mountain of flesh and blood, getting excited the more he thought about it. Unbeknownst to him he wouldn't be using his imagination much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillicent Crosswire walked though the hallway toward the bedroom she shared with her Husband. Having checked in on her daughter and her friends she informed them that she would be in weight room and should they need anything they would have to call for Bailey. Since she has already dressed in her workout clothes all she needed to do was to put on her joggers. She didn't hesitate to put them on the moment she walked into the bedroom, nor had she heard the startled cry before she slipped her foot into the jogger and tightly do up the shoelaces. Nor did she feel the tiny human who was wedged under her sock covered toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Ash there had been a sense of urgency when he first heard and felt the approaching footfalls. He had been among these giants long enough to recognize individuals by the pattern and intensity of the footfalls.  That sense of urgency turned into panic as he discovered he couldn't get out of the jogger. There was a chance, he told himself, that the jogger wouldn't be touched. That changed however when he heard the bedroom door open and Millicent walked straight for the closet. Looking out from the jogger just out of sight he watched Millicent reach for her joggers. The insole tipped and he slid to the toe of the jogger as she picked them up with one hand and carried them over to her bed. Sitting down on the edge of the bed she slipped one Jogger on. When it came time to put the other on, Ash was in aw of the huge sock foot that slid towards and then over him. He was in almost total darkness as the toes wiggled around him. Then came the constant impacts as Millicent walked out the door to the weight room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering, she decided to<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You guys would either let me out or I'd ride above your foot and not underneath.  This was not the case.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, that wasn't the case at all.  Ash remembered the constant rise into the air followed by a quick descent, a sudden impact and the crushing weight of the foot above him. If it hadn't been for the cushioning of the insole he would've been killed. It was bad when Millicent had been walking, but it was even worst when she stepped onto the tread mill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh remembered how the process of rise, descent, impact, and crushing weight gradually increased in speed as the treadmill sped up. He could only take quick breaths between the crushing weight and he felt as though his brain was sloshing about in his skull. Millicent jogged on the tread mill without a care in the world and without any idea that there was any one or anything fighting for life in her sneaker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOMBOOMBOOMBOOMBOOMBOOMBOOMBOOM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe might've passed out at one point, but he couldn't be sure. Much of what happened  was a blur. Most likely due to the constant impacts. He might've even gotten a concussion for all he knew. He did however vividly recall what happened next. As she ran,  Millicent began to naturally sweat.  More specifically, her feet began to sweat. So now not only was he being constantly pressed into the insole, but his prison was starting to get humid. Most of the sweat was being held at bay by the sweat sock, that would  change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillicent stepped off the Treadmill after twenty minutes of running followed  by another 10 of just walking. Satisfied that she has exercised sufficiently she decided that a hot bath was in order.  As she headed back to her bedroom she stopped by her daughter's room to see how the girls were doing. It was only then that she began to notice something in one of her Joggers. While she talked to her daughter she casually began to scrunch her toes around the object. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was squeezed up into the cloth of the sock as the toes wiggled about him. He tried to cry out only to get a mouthful of sock.The cotton of the sock, which had kept the sweat at bay, now released the bodily fluid down Ash's throat. Words would not describe the taste properly only that it took all he had to keep from throwing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was sure her daughter and her friends were doing okay, Millicent continued  to her bedroom. When she arrived, she sat at the edge of her bed and began to remove her joggers</span></div></div>",

He considered for a moment to back up further under the bed, but decided that he was at a safe enough spot to watch the show. Which it what it was whenever Laverne, or anyone else showed up. It always impressed him how powerful these beings were despite only going about their daily lives. Had he been born 5000 years ago and transported to this world he would\u2019ve considered them the gods of Olympus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaverne walked up to her daughter\u2019s bed to collect some discarded articles of clothing. Being older certainly hadn\u2019t changed some of her youngest daughter\u2019s habits, though she wasn\u2019t as bad as she once was. Little did she know that there was someone admiring her right Loafer. When Ash had arrived, they were Brand new. Now eight years later, they were worn and had been repaired a time or two. She should\u2019ve thrown them out by all rights, but Laverne had found them to be quite comfortable. Oftentimes she\u2019d found it very hard to find footwear that was comfortable on her feet. It was her feet that Ash was thinking of at that moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2019d seen her bare foot a time or two in the years he spent at the apartment and it was no mystery where which side of the family her Daughters got there foot shape from. A wide sole with short round toes. He had often wanted to get closer but he didn\u2019t dare. Not when she was sitting on the couch watching TV or even while she slept. The risk of being caught was always on his mind no matter how fevered it got, her loafers on the other hand was something he was willing to get closer to. It wasn\u2019t until lately that they looked worn enough to climb into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh stepped out from under the bed and gazed upward past the Loafer, the  beige pants and yellow sweater. While Laverne\u2019s attention was on collecting an article of clothing off the bed he gave the Loafer a departing Hug and vowed he would soon find his way inside it. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was near one in the morning before Ash ventured out of Francine's bedroom. While she had gone to bed early, her parents had stayed up to watch the late, late, late show. He waited under Francine's bedroom door and watched them walk past before he made his move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart raced with eager anticipation as he made his way down the hall to the joined Kitchen and living room and ultimately to the mat at the front door. There placed neatly next to two other pairs of shoes and sneakers were Laverne's old Loafers. He could make out the distinguishable outline of the footwear and In the darkness of the apartment they loomed like ancient monoliths,. While it was a bit dark to really see the interior that well, it wasn't a concern to him according to his plan.  He'd been around long enough to know the habits of these colossal beings. Her Husband always left at 5 am every morning and Laverne didn't get up for a whole two hours later. Tonight his goal was to spend the night in one of the loafers and explore more of the interior when it was light enough to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a reason why he hadn't thought of doing something like this up until now. Getting into one of these was relatively easy, getting out was another story. He'd only checked out the inside of Francine's sneakers a few times and never on his own. Each time he did venture to explore his only way out was with help. Unless you were dealing with fuzzy slippers or you had retractile barbs in your fingertips like some Spider-Man there was no way to climb the curved walls of the inside of a pair of footwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Loafers were a different matter. One day he had seen Laverne slip one off to scratch an itch. It tipped on it's side and he could see that there were  loose threads and  worn material on the inside they would make it easier to get out off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh stood in front of the towering footwear. When Laverne had collected laundry from her Daughters room earlier that day he'd decided that her right loafer was the most ideal candidate as the material had cracked and worn enough to make hand and foot holds. With great anticipation he started to climb. First up the seven foot of rubber sole, then onto the faded toe of the loafer. He rested for a moment, then jogged up the length to the opening.  There was still warmth radiating out from the insole, no doubt that would be a bit damp as well. The smell was....Not too  bad, he guessed. She sprayed them with some odor eater  once a week.  It was dark inside, too dark to see any detail, but that was okay. There would be time later for that.  He felt for, and found a  loose thread. Taking hold of it, he climbed down into the Loafer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thread didn't go all the way down, but enough for him to drop the rest of the way unharmed. He landed on the worn insole and was glad he had decided to leave his glass blade in Francine's room . He had no desire to land on that. Ash walked towards the toe section feeling the texture of the damp leather under his feet. As he walked he noted the rather deep groves in the insole, though he couldn't see them he got the impression that they were very deep from years of walking. Ash's heart raced, there would be a distinct shape of Laverne's Foot to be viewed early tomorrow Morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he reached the toe, he laid down. First on his back and then on his stomach. Even though he was almost too excited to sleep, he knew he had too. He didn't want to oversleep after all.  After eight years of giants walking about he had gotten used to the rumbling tremors each of their footsteps made.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>8 years of pheromones were deposited into the material that made up the insole of the loafer. Ash had  been exposed to these the potent chemicals  all night long. So when he  awoke the next morning to the floor shaking and Lavern's husband leaving the  apartment to go to work,  He was feeling more than his usual self. As a matter of fact, he was in a state of euphoria like he had never felt before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn without realizing it he had spent the night  in the deep crater that had been made by her big toe. He breathed in, even through the smell of the old Loafer he could smell fresh coffee brewed. Lavern would be up in a while, he wasted no time. With the light of early morning illuminating the interior he was able to finally see what he'd been waiting a long time to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he had expected the impression of Lavern's foot was really imprinted into the insole, especially since she would sometimes wear them without socks. He could make out the shape of her five toes, the ball of her foot and her heel. He ran his hand across the surface of the darkened leather, this was as close as he'd ever come to physical contact  with Francine's Mother. The crater he sat in was deep too, about three or four feet at it's lowest point he figured. the massive  crater that had been made by the ball of her foot was even deeper. It was no wonder why he had to walk \"uphill\" at some point.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up and gazed up at the ceiling above his head.  Even there, there was wear and tear. The marks made by her toes rubbing up against the material above when she walked was clearly visible here as well. Some of the material had begun to hang down and at one spot he could see where it hanged down to the point Lavern had torn it off for the sake of comfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout realizing he was doing it, Ash had  removed his loincloth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked down to where ball of Laverne's foot rested. He dropped to his knees, and then fell on his stomach. The battered and darkened material felt amazing on his lower regions, he was about to release this pent up desire when he noticed something on the insole just in front of his face. It was enough to clear his mind a bit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a stain a rust colored stain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd something else. Something something so pulverized that it  was barely recognizable. And he saw hair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh got to his knees and backed away. He couldn't say for certain that what he was looking at was what was left of a human being. It just as easily been something else. But the thought of Laverne, all this time, walking around smiling all the while she was unawarely pulverizing someone underfoot...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was time to leave...</span></div></div>",

Low and behold there she was, Catherine Frensky, the much older, much taller, much of everything sibling of Francine. He stood in place struck with fear. He believed he had seen the last of her, yet there she was...and walking straight at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh quickly reacted as he ran away, barely missing a brown boot stepping on him as the hurricane of it flew him across the ground, only to land near the post of the bed. Catherine stretched as she was exhausted from the ride from her college to back home. She was glad to come back, but all she wanted to do now was to rest.<br>\r\nShe was wearing a black jacket with a navy blue shirt underneath, her jeans shown signs of not being washed, while her brown biker boots adorned her feet. Her hair was still done in her usual pony tail, although it was longer than the last time Ash saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine let her bag fall down unto the ground, causing a massive earthquake for Ash. She walked around the room, looking if anything had change. For the most part, everything was still fine except for Francine's stuff being more to her side of her room then staying where they should belong. Still she enjoyed being back at home and having a break from her exams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to her, the small Ash kept observing as he moved from his post towards Francine's bed and hopefully her desk. It was a difficult task as Catherine covered miles in seconds. Still Ash continued on as he tried to keep himself hidden. Just then he realized something, the glass he had with him, it was gone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSearching frantically for it, he spotted it...at the last place he was. All the way over to where Catherine was standing. He gulped as he knew he would never make it without being caught, but he feared that she would spot it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe silently walked back towards the edges of the bed as he prayed Catherine would not find his latest tool, or worse.</span></div></div>",

Sure she was still in high school, but she couldn't help but be proud of her already. So young and already getting so many awards and recognition, she sighed with happiness, she was sure proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Ash was noticing his tool from far away, if he had sprinted he would reach it, but then the problem was, what happened when he needed to be back, he doubted heavily that Catherine wouldn't spot him, and then....who knew. He gulped, cursed a bit, but waited. He was going to stay put until either Francine came or Catherine left. Nevertheless, he felt the tremors once more as Catherine turned and-\"Hey what's this?!\" His heart sank as he heard the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked as the massive fingers of the older sister came down unto his glimmering tool, and with a small push, were gone as well. He was devastated by it, A simple tap and his tool was gone. He fought every instinct to do something foolish as he bit his tongue and hoped that the worst wouldn't happen yet. On the other hand, Catherine was looking at the small glass she had found on the floor and was confused by it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was shaped like a blade, well technically a glass shard could be that, but what was stranger to her was that it had a handle warped around the end, almost as it was dedicated to be some form of weapon. She looked at it intensively as it was quite small. She scoffed a bit as she imagined someone using this. They would have to be incredibly small to be able to use such small thing. But the question now remained, what would she do with it? She was guessing it was one of Franny's school projects but then again, why would she need such a small thing? She questioned as Ash looked from below, hoping his precious blade would be spared. </span></div></div>",

The only real problem was in order to retrieve his glass he\u2019d have to go out into the open. Fortunately and unfortunately he remembered Catherine\u2019s Habits. Catherine in her younger teen years was the exact opposite of her younger sister, who was a bit of a Tom boy. Ash had observed her many times from a distance and there was one particular habit of hers that had kept him from getting caught by her more than once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine never looked down when she walked. It was something he had observed from a lot of people, including her mother. Ash suspected the only reason why Francine looked down was because she had to be on the lookout for someone smaller than her running about on the floor. This was also a disadvantage because the risk of getting stepped on was very high. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine sat down at the computer desk and began to undo the buckles of her biker boots. It had been a 10 hour drive by bus and it was going to feel good to get them off her feet. Ash decided that now would be the best time to retrieve his glass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine slipped off her boot and wiggled her nylon covered toes. She loved her Biker boots, but she found her feet got very hot when she wore them. Then one day her friend Angie had suggested wearing nylons. It worked like a charm.  She placed her foot on the hardwood floor, the coolness felt great on the sole of her foot. While she was unbuckling the other boot, Ash was darting toward his glass. He was only moments away from retrieving the it when the other boot slipped off and Catherine stood up. <br>\r\n\u2018Shit! SHIT!\u2019 he thought as she strode toward him, oblivious to his presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ash\u2019s heart was in his throat as he saw his glass blade disappear under a nylon foot with a floor shaking THUD. He didn\u2019t expect the glass to be broken, but he did expect to hear a loud \u201cOW!!!\u201d followed by swearing and all hell breaking loose. But instead when the foot lifted away all he saw was a damp spot in the outline of Catherine\u2019s Foot. For a quick moment he thought he\u2019d be next, instead the foot swung past him. As it did he noticed his precious tool had stuck into the fibers of the Nylon Stocking! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine sat down on her old bed and stretched out onto it. 10 hours on a bus was tiring, at it would be a little while before her mother would announce supper was ready, so she decided to take a nap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Ash couldn\u2019t see it, he could see it reflecting in the sunlight beaming in through the window. His glass was in the center of the ball of Catherine\u2019s right foot. Of all the luck, what was he going to do now? It might've been possible to replace it if he could find another sliver of Glass but he had found that piece by chance. The only reason why was because someone had broken a drinking glass at a BBQ one summer and not all of the glass had been collected. After all this time he didn't know if he could find another one. There was another option but it was a risky venture. As much as he did and didn\u2019t like the idea of getting so close, he could climb the bed and retrieve the glass. Getting up there wouldn't be a problem, the old ladders made of thread were still there behind the head rest. But to get his glass, he would have to get onto Catherine's Foot. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He recalled the strange look Francine had given him when he suggested stetting up the ladders. She understood wanting one for her own bed, but why her sisters?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never know.\" had been his answer. She had just shrugged and made the ladder, which had been hidden behind the head rest and held in place by a thumb tack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told he had wanted the ladder  because he had wanted to get a closer look at her sister.  At  the time she was almost twice the height of her younger sister and he had wanted to see what someone that big looked like up close.  Well, that plan never actually happened as he had had so many close calls with Catherine over the years that he had decided it was better to be safe than sorry. So for the most part the ladder was collecting dust until now. About half way up he noted her breathing slowing down, Ash recognized it as a sign of falling asleep. Good, sneaking about would be easier, not that he expected to be heard but he certainly didn't want to be seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he reached the top of the bed, Ash took a moment to rest and survey the landscape. It was a good thing Catherine had decided not to climb under the covers as it would've made things harder than they already were. When he was certain she was asleep, he crept out from behind the pillow and jogged down the length of her body to her right foot. There he stopped and gazed at the awesome sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had only seen the soles of Catherine's feet a few times, he thought they looked amazing and it looked like they had only gotten better as she had grown into womanhood This was the closest though  he'd ever been. He soon realized with a grin that he was about to get a whole lot closer than he had ever thought possible. His gaze followed the wide heel up the arch or the foot toward the wide ball of the foot and round toes. There , near the very to of the Ball of her foot was his glass knife. Dislodging it from the nylon fibers of the stocking didn't look so hard to do, he just had to climb up to get it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart started to race, this was so amazing and crazy at the same time. Never in his dreams did he think he'd ever get an opportunity like this. He would not waste it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite some fatigue he felt in his muscles and the smell of a foot that had been in a biker boot for ten hours, as was smiling from ear to ear. A part of him still couldn't believe he was doing this, He only wished he had time to enjoy himself. The Nylon was thin, if his climbing were to tickle the huge sole it could spell certain doom, and maybe he should've spent more time concentrating on not being detected and less time enjoying the sights. A moment later  was a foot or so away from his glass knife.</span></div></div>",

Ash had to be constantly hiding from Arthur's Parents. After the incident with the snake they were a bit more on guard for unusual behavior from Arthur. The only safe zone he had until everyone was asleep was Arthur's Bedroom. His Father rarely went in and his Mother, Jane only came in to dust and vacuum and put clothes away. It was always an event when she'd arrive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched her from the inside of the model of the  Miles M.52 turbojet, watched as she moved about. He had feelings that he never had before or would've normally had. He had thoughts of wanting to be closer to her. To touch her. But that would be a death sentence, so why would he think that way? What Ash didn't know was that it was biological. His body was reacting to pheromones being produced by Jane. Fortunately He only felt the way when she was around, every other time he was his normal self.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was Arthur's little sister DW.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour years old and nothing more terrifying for a bug size human. She was unpredictable  She would enter Arthur's bedroom at times Ash couldn't predict. He had a few close calls, once she had almost spotted and twice he'd nearly been stepped on by her. It had gotten to the point where he was forced to stay inside the  Miles M.52 turbojet model until Arthur came home from school. He felt like a prisoner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bedroom door Opened</span></div></div>",

Even when it came down to sleeping arrangements. His home consisted of a plastic electronic box complete with LED lighting that gave just enough light as to not blind him. He had even devised two way communication through a microphone and headphone speaker. All of which he'd done himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ash stayed with \"The Brain.\" he spent most of the time compairing notes, what was different between the two realities and what was different. It came down to things working out about even technology wise, cultures, but when it came down to television that's when the similarities ended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we don't have a Bionic Bunny.\" said Ash speaking through a microphone. \"The closest we have is a Superhero called Superman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting.\" Brain mused and took notes.\"Is he Bionic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Far from it. He's from another planet. He gets is power from The Sun. His cells store Solar Energy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why isn't he called \"Sun-Man?\"\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh though for a moment \"I don't know. I guess it's because his feats were considered super and the name stuck. Brain I've been doing some thinking. About how I got here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, keep in mind this is all speculation and probably for science fiction than anything else. Have you ever blown Bubbles?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, picture every reality, every dimension, as these bubbles floating about and minding their own business. Then one bubble comes in contact with another. Where they meet a hole forms in the barriers between the two. No, not a Hole. A door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrain thought for a moment. \"It sounds like something out of Sci-Fi. Then again that might explain the suction you felt. Contents from one Dimension/reality coming in from one to another. You think the two realities are still touching?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unlikely, remember I woke up in Francine's sneaker, if this door was still opened I would've jumped back through. No. It's closed all right. At least that one. Who's to say it won't open somewhere else to another reality. I've have read of people simply disappearing right in front of witnesses never to be seen again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think you're stuck here then? Forever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.

That is if you don't mind me tagging along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a tiny person in my house, you really think I'd leave you out of my sight?

Moments later he was riding in the palm of her hand as she walked into the living room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is everybody?\"Ash asked, and then realized the young giantess couldn't hear him. He was out of range now.  If he was going to be here for a while they would have to come up with a solution to that problem. That is of course Francine was willing to help. As of now she was friendly enough. Could that change?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's where you get off\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine's voice broke his chain of thought. He was being lowered to a pillow on the couch. He climbed off as he was told to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right back. I just want to get some snacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched her go. Moments later she sat down next to him with a bowl of freshly popped popcorn. Placing a kernel bigger than him next to Ash she turned on the TV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh thought Francine was being rather cool with the fact she had what was essentially a tiny Alien lose in her home. But maybe she was just trying to be friendly. As much as he was interested in what was on the Frank 2000 inch model TV, he was more interested in Francine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched her take a single popped kernel between thumb and finger  and deposed it into her mouth. A simple gesture, when magnified to the scale of Francine wasn't so simple.  She just ate enough food to last Ash a week! He could hear the digestive processes from where he was standing. And her breathing, and the beating of her heart. Things she probably didn't even notice in her daily life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh Blinked. Francine had somehow picked up on the fact he'd been staring at her. He felt his cheeks get warm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, let me pick you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh found himself grasped between thumb and finger very much like the kernel of popcorn had been earlier. He imagined being held before her mouth, her mouth opening...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, why was he imagining THAT?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,  so what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than letting him into her ear, Francine held him close. How was he going to explain himself? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please don't be weirded out, but I was mesmerized by your eating. We don't have anything as big as you where I come from. Nobody has ever seen anything as big as you eat before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all? I thought I was making too much noise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh let out a breath. At least this version of Francine was reasonable. He'd hate to get her angry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to see me eat something else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh's heart leaped. Was she serious? Well, why not? After all she was just demonstrating. Where was the harm in that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sure\" said Ash. \"H-How about--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She held him before her angry face for a moment before she applied pressure and he popped between her fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least that's what Ash envisioned happened in his mind's eye the moment he blurted it out. Instead all he heard was a giggle from Francine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you'd want me to do that.  Jonah might've gotten away with it, but not you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took him away from here ear and stared at him with dark brown eyes.

I have an Aunt who liked to say that.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled showing teeth and made a biting motion.

She placed  Ash back on the pillow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy the show\" she said and continued eating her Popcorn. Whether she meant her eating or what was on TV it was unclear.  Either way, he was glad he hadn't pissed her off. He recalled the Francine from the cartoon had a temper, there was more to this version of Francine than he first thought. He wondered what else about here was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she'd watched enough TV programing and had finished her snack she picked Ash up between thumb and finger once more. No more was she holding her palm out for him to climb in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked into the kitchen and with one hand poured herself up a glass of water. Then she held Ash close to her face as she drank the water. Through the glass he watched as gallons of water rushed into her mouth, flowed over teeth and tongue before disappearing over the edge of the tongue with loud \"Gulps\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoyed the Show?\" Francine Asked with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked into the bedroom she shared with her older sister.  \"If you're going to be staying here for a while, you'll need a place to stay.

The problem was after the lights had gone out and Francine had fallen asleep. She snored. Not badly, for anyone her size trying to sleep. For Ash, it was loud and made sleep impossible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that he wanted to sleep. He had too much on his mind to try even without the snoring.  Ash had felt something whenever Francine held him up to her mouth, something on akin to arousal and that bothered him greatly. Cartoon or flesh and blood , Giant or not, Francine was still only eight years old. There was no way in hell he was going to become one of those he'd read about. Even though  he knew he could get away with it, his conscious would not allow it. Maybe in 8 or 10 years....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8 or 10 Years? Ash could only imagine what it would be like to live in such a world for that length of time. He pictured Tom Hanks in Castaway. Yep, that would probably be about right.  Would he even survive eight days much less eight years? The odds were not in his favor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came out from behind the pillow and gazed up at the sleeping form of Francine. He tried to envision what she would look like older. Maybe she'd look like her sister who was sleeping in the bed beside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Sister. Now she was closer to his age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought came to his mind She was Asleep, would it hurt to take a closer look? Maybe have a bit of fun? Within reason of course. There would be out of bounds areas he would not  go near. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd have to traverse the area between them and he'd have to climb up onto her bed. Then he'd have to climb back to Francine's bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh's Heart sank. That was impossible. He'd need climbing equipment for such a trek. Maybe it was something he could do later. Maybe make rope ladders, or thread ladders in this case. Maybe with Francine's help. No, that would be too much to try to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I just want to climb up into your sister's bed and explore her sleeping Body.\" Yeah He could just imagine how that would turn out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ash supposed he could try to get some sleep despite the noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had planned this excursion and even looked forward to it, things had changed in the months since he arrived. Other than his longer unkempt hair. He had gotten to know her, though his observations. Her mannerisms, her personality, and he wasn't sure anymore if he wasn't sure if he could go through with the plan.

They were ape like, but not completely.  As for the voices, they too were similar, but came from mouths that were structurally different than the human voice actors of his world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine lay on her side and as Ash approached her face, the exhale of her breath pushed him back while her inhale tugged him forward. Her breath smelled of mouthwash and toothpaste, which wasn't unpleasant. Her mouth was slightly open, but in the darkness and gloom of the room he couldn't make anything out, which was disappointing. Maybe another time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his attention to the thick crop of hair that was normally  tied back in a ponytail.

Still, there were less fun and indirect ways he could get up there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine's hot humid breath blew over him. He gazed into the darkness of her mouth and wished it was lighter in the room so he could see into it better.  He looked out the single window in the room. The moon was growing. Maybe when it was full it might be bright enough. A visit for another night then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh stood up and with much effort began to climb the blanket covering the teen giantess. He had been reluctant to go this rout on account of the fabric wasn't the most ideal for climbing. Maybe with metal hooks progress would've been better. As it was, he didn't have any hooks and progress was slow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he reached the hump of her shoulder, Ash stopped to rest.   It took a great deal of effort to reach the top and the muscles in his arms and legs burned from exertion. He really should've trained more for this, but never counted on how hard it would've been.  From where he sat, he gazed over across the room to where Francine slept. Then reminded himself of the time and continued his trek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately it was all downhill from there and it wasn't long before he was in the redish forest of Catherine's hair. He followed the strands of healthy crop to her ear. An ear that was twice the size of Francine's. Like her younger sister the ear lacked a lobe. With sore muscles he climbed up inside. Warmed radiated all around him, it felt good. Maybe he could stay for a little while. Rest up and continue to explore. </span></div></div>",

Granted it was a used tissue, but it was better than something solid. As it was He was uninjured, just a bit disoriented by being taused away like a piece of trash. Kinda degrading in away. The rim of the basket was too high for him to climb out but fortunately he didn't have too. The basket was made of a wire mesh and he simply climbed down through the huge pieces of garbage to the bottom of the basket and squeeze his way through the mesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who would\u2019ve thought my day was going to turn out like this\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh noticed there were two beds in the room, if he remembered the cartoon correctly Francine had an older sister named Catherine. He couldn\u2019t recall her age but did remember she stood a good two and a half feet taller than Francine. Ash saw a pair of slippers that gave him a pretty good guess to her scale. He looked about the bedroom and shook his head in amazement. This was nothing like the way  it was described in all those online stories he had read. They had made Ash actually want to be in a situation such as this, but this wasn't a story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis first encounter was scary but  amazing at the same time.  He had no idea how he got here or even how long he was going to be here or even if there was a way back. Well if he was stuck there for a while, he may as well be enjoying it. He'd have to be careful.  Ash's first meeting with these giants didn't go as well as he had hoped. It was probably best to avoid direct contact for for now. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nSince no one was in the room for the moment he decided to look around.</span></div></div>",

If she hadn't been focused on the outside of her loafers and had looked inside she might have noticed a tiny creature staring up out from her right loafer. Instead she lifted her right foot and began to slip it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Ash it came too quick to react. The sock covered foot with the outline of the toes clearly visible was upon him, driving him into the insole and sliding him back to the toe section as it moved forward. Soft flesh molded around him encasing him in darkness. He couldn't be sure where he'd ended up but he was fairly certain that he was somewhere under the ball of the foot. Maybe near the toes. The soft insole and the soft padded flesh above kept the thousands of pounds of giant from crushing him completely. For the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Fern began to walk. First the assent, then the forward momentum, then the decent with a bone jarring THUD and the foot above pressing him into the insole with a weight that almost did him in. The process repeated itself again and again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFern walked down the sidewalk. Normally she would be  on her way to The Sugar Bowl, but today she was heading to Mrs. Powers's Ice Cream Shop. She was enjoying the warm weather and felt ice cream was in order. Of course she could've gotten that at the Sugar Bowl but today she was in the mood to try the competition. It wasn't long before she met up with a friend who was happening to be coming from  the very establishment. And why not? His mother owned it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Brain\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood and had brief  conversation with Alan Powers, AKA \"The Brain\". But as she bid Brain \"See you later\" and continued on her way Fern began to notice a sensation in her right loafer, just under the Ball of her foot. She thought nothing of it at first, it became distracting. She stopped again and looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt definitely felt like something was squirming in her Loafer. She wiggled her toes, did an ant crawl inside? She rubbed her foot against the insole of the loafer. Whatever the Object was she felt it move under her toes. It wasn't moving then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFern thought then <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

An immense giant in a navy blue skirt and light blue top, a...Rabbit judging from the ears protruding from the not quite shoulder length brown hair. It...no...SHE....didn't look down. Not even when she lifted a foot wearing a light blue sock over the opening he was staring out from. The foot had just about covered the opening of the shoe before Ash cried out in fear and astonishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Foot immediately withdrew. She tilted her head down, her expression a mix of surprise and confusion. It was then that Ash noticed her eyes. She looked down, but didn't see. Ash couldn't be sure, but she appeared to be blind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached down with one hand and lifted the shoe. The sudden acceleration  knocked him on his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something in my shoe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbing fingers reached into the slipper and fell upon Ash's pron body. There was a gasp and the fingers withdrew for a moment, then slowly returned. The tip of the great index finger carefully traced Ash's body. The fingers lifted away, then the whole shoe tipped and Ash cried out as he tumbled into the cupped palm of the Girl Rabbit's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh looked up into the face of the Rabbit girl. He looked into the eyes. There was a blank stare, no focus of the pupils. She was most certainly blind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What Are you?\" Ash found himself saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was about to ask you the same question.\" Humid breath blew over Ash, he was thankful that though saturated with moisture it smelled clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-perhaps an introduction is in order. My name is Ash, I'm from the planet Earth in the Terran Solar System.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Marina , Marina Datillo. Also from the planet Earth. It's nice to meet you Ash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh frowned. He was still on Earth? Must be an alternate Earth. That, or he was slipped into the Twilight Zone. Marina extended the tip of her forefinger toward him. This confused him at first, until he realized this was her attempt at shaking hands. Ash stood and ran his hand over the white surface of the finger, feeling the dermal surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you Marina.\" He said \" Is this as strange to you as it is for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina nodded \" Very. Are there anymore like you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not around here.\" said Ash \"where ever here is. No more in you're shoe if that's what you are wondering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Admitted Ash. \"One moment I was walking down a dirt path, and the next I was lying on the insole of you're shoe just as you showed up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem calm for such a tiny creature.\" Marina noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm actually scared as heck.\" said Ash \"It's not every day you meet a Giant. But there's no point in freaking out and screaming \"Don't Eat Me\". First impression is very important after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina giggled \"I won't hurt you Ash. Even though I can't see you. You may have guessed I'm Blind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came to that conclusion and an inspection of your eyes sort of confirmed it. Hey, maybe that's why you can hear me. They say when a person looses one sense the other's heighten to compensate.  Either way I'm glad I didn't end up trapped in your shoe. Who knows what might've happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what would've happened.\" Marina replied \"I was about to go for a walk. I'm meeting a friend. Would you like to meet her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh thought for a moment.\"I'm not sure, I---\"</span></div></div>",

She had a mischievous look, but not what could be called malicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now stay still, I don't want to crush you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina slipped her shoes back on her feet and made her way from memory downstairs to where here mother was waiting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All set?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina nodded. A few moments later she was sitting in the front passenger seat of her mother's car heading for her friends house. All the while, she held her left hand closed and resting on her lap. She held her hand just tight enough to keep the tiny creature in her hand immobile but not enough to cause actual harm. She could feel his breath on her palm. It was very minute, but she could feel it. One of the effects of being born blind she supposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Ash, the ride in hot and clammy darkness could've been better and could've been worst. In order to take his mind off his growing fears he decided to look at this through a scientific perspective, and quickly threw most of what he'd learned out the window. So he focused on what science he could use, the flesh around him for starters. He could stick his fingers between the dermal swirls of the skin. They came back feeling oily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to move again. He soon began to hear other voices. They were muffled though the flesh around him, he couldn't make out what was being said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the hand opened once more, a few face stared down at Ash. He was quickly scooped up between thumb and finger and held before a huge dark eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't make out what he looks like\" Prunella concluded \"His face I mean. I'll need a magnifying glass for that. But he is wearing clothes.\" Without realizing she was doing it, she gently rolled him between her fingers musing to herself. \"maybe he has a supernatural origin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prunella, don't do that. You're scaring him\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Prunella looked at the creature between her fingers. \"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you better let me hold him\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was once again deposited into Marina's hand. Other than a film of oil on his skin he was unharmed. He looked up at the slender figure of Prunella. She had a look of curiosity, as though she was looking at a new kind of bug but at least it wasn't disdain. What were they going to do to him?</span></div></div>",

Right now at just over three feet tall she didn't seem to be much of a threat to anyone, but to the micro human in her right shoe staring up at her she looked three hundred  and seventy feet. He remembered D.W and the way she reacted to bug size creatures. If she saw him he was dead, if she didn't see him and squeezed her foot into the shoe, he was dead. If he survived her foot on top of him, she'd probably feel him, freak out and stomp her foot. No matter which way he looked at it, he was dead. He hadn't expected or thought in a million years that he'd die this way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nD.W smiled down. Not because she saw what was in her shoe but because she was getting ready for a party. She lifted her socked foot, cute round toes pointing right at him. Ash cried out but his cries were muffled as D.W's foot began to make it's way into the shoe. Still desperate to try and survive he bolted to the toe of the shoe. He turned in time to get knocked down on his back; heavy fabric covered flesh fell around him. D.W's Toes wiggled into place. With almost no air to breath and with no room to move, Ash waited his Fate. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Ice cream all around him began to melt as the tongue underneath pressed him up against the pallet above as Cream savoured the flavour of the Ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh heard a loud \u201cMMMMMMM\u201d that vibrated through his body. Where ever his skin was bare he could feel the tingling of the taste buds as they reacted to his presence.  he didn\u2019t want to die this way, he remembered enough from Biology 101 that what lay beyond the esophagus wasn\u2019t the greatest spot for a vacation.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n The tongue dropped and tossed him into the middle of Cream\u2019s mouth and propelled him back up against the roof of her mouth. There was a powerful suction and a loud GULP as cream swallowed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With wide eyes, Ash could simply watch as Cream's Massive Uvula pass right over him before descending down the huge fleshy tunnel with the cold treat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Cream was completely oblivious about the tiny human she just swallowed whole as she was too concentrated on the delicious flavor of her ice cream. A large content smile emerges on her face as she closes her eyes blissfully at the sweet delicacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip down Cream's throat was a dizzying and unsettling ride that seemed to put even the great tower attractions of famous theme parks to shame. All about Ash the fleshy walls of Creams throat pulsated rhythmically against him and the goop of ice cream. It was almost as if the slimy pink walls themselves were eager to send him straight within the massive rabbit girls stomach. After what seemed like seconds of heart stopping tension, A great fleshy entryway soon opened slightly to accept the new entrants of the cavernous organ. In no time at all, the muscle hole sucks around Ash's body sending him shuddering by the strange and unsettling texture of the flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds, Ash was soon met with the sounds of gurgles and the rhythmic beating of Cream as he descended into her belly. With a splash, he soon ends up landing within the mucky fluids that were the rabbit girls digestive juices. Immediately, he swam up and turns his head about trying to find some form of mass, food, anything to help stay afloat. Whether it was luck or fate, His request was soon answered as a small portion on the left side of Creams stomach was devoid of any sign of her juices. After using all his strength too swim past the hot fluids, he luckily manages to clamber upon the slimy surface of flesh gazing about the hot steamy chamber in shock.</span></div></div>",

But Light pour back in as Cream opened her mouth to take another lick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her tongue extended out Ash began to run towards the front of her mouth. Suddenly Cream\u2019s Mouth closed shut and he was pinned between her the tip of her tongue and her front teeth. With his back to her teeth Jason was pressed face first into the tip of Cream\u2019s tongue which began to explore his Body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream felt something particularly off about what is her tongue was feeling. She knew that there wasn't any trace of toppings on her treat. She continued to feel the unwanted being all over his tiny body. In some parts, he giggled - in which that reaction echoes throughout her cavernous mouth. Luckily, the cute bunny heard that, suspecting something strange from inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if Heaven's gate opens, a large beam of white light emited as the giantess opened her mouth. And just like Heaven, a goddess-like set of fingers appeared from the light, pinching Ash and drawing him out of her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next sight Ash saw was the sight of the goddess herself! Her amber-colored eye peered over him, investigating the visitor of her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" ponders Cream. \"It's a bug! But it looks like a person.\" The little wanderer was still hanging in between the bunny's pinching fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream sat down, continuing to enjoy her Ice cream while looking the tiny person between her fingers. How did this little person get in her mouth? Maybe he was inside the Ice cream. She paused wondering if there had been any more little people in her treat. Her heart began to sink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard a little squeak. The tiny person was saying something but she couldn\u2019t make it out. She smiled thinking how cute this tiny person was. She began to Lick her Ice cream again listening to squeaks.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She believes this will excite the hedgehog and makes him do something with both her and herself. Then she comes up with an idea, not original, but it may works . . . for as long as she doesn't show any signs that she obtains a very small person. \"Mr. Bug,\" the giantess spoke to Ash in a cute manner. \"I'm going to put you in my pocket. Please don't go anywhere\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile, the skyscraper-sized rabbit drops Ash back in the orange pocket of her dress. She resumed her travels - until she arrived at the house  Amy Rose lived. With manners, she knocked on the door of the house. It wasn't long until that pink hedgehog, garbed in her usual red hoop dress and matching boots, answers the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy greets, \"Hi, Cream!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Amy,\" replies back. \"What are you planning to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got nothing! I was going to shop, but I had ended up spending all of my money. Plus, my Sonikku is off to another adventure in who-knows-what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then can we play around at your house\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why not. Come on in!\" Amy welcomes Cream to her house as soon as she enters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream has something on her mind, but doesn't have an answer. \"Amy, what can we do?\" Let's hope that Amy doesn't find out about the tiny freeloader from within Cream's breast pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh sat at the bottom of Cream\u2019s breast pocket the mixture of ice cream and saliva drying on his clothes. He considered himself fortunate the young giantess hadn\u2019t freaked out thrown him to the ground and stomped his mangled body into the dirt. As it was, it wasn\u2019t too bad being in her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a new video game,\u201d said Amy. \u201cYou wanna play Cream?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream was on the move. She followed Amy to her living room and hoped onto the couch. A few moment\u2019s later Ash heard some very familiar music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it can\u2019t be\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing up the inside of the pocket he peered out at the world. Cream was holding a game controller, the game she was playing looked a lot like Super Mario 3. Well, Mario looked a little different but it was pretty much the same game. Looking to his right Ash could see Amy holding the other controller waiting her turn. For the next hour Ash watched as the two played, Cream was really good at it too for her age. Which didn't surprise Ash at all because on Earth they were teaching kids about computers at a very early age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy paused the game.\"I'm going to get something to drink, would you like some milk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Amy left the room, Cream looked in at \"Mr. Bug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello. Watching me play, huh. Can't wait to play with you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, boy' Ash thought, wondering what this giantess had in mind for Play.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And he was walking blind except for the footprints he was following because he couldn\u2019t see above the grass line. Ash stopped and climbed up a flower stem. When he was above the grass he could see his destination.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles in the distance Ash could see a cabin. Damn it, it was going to take forever to get there. He didn\u2019t have anything better to do, but there had to be a quicker way. Ash was about to climb back down to ground level when he felt a vibration through the stem of the flower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking all around, he saw a Giant version of Miles Prowler. AKA Tails.

There was less chances of being eaten by a predatory insect there, course the chances of being killed by a giant furry was still very high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cabin had all the comforts of home from what he could see of the place. The kitchen, dinning and living rooms combined into one. In front of Ash was a TV, Least It looked like one. Behind him was a couch. Ash walked to the edge of the coffee table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap, It was a good Hundred-foot drop to the floor. He wasn't getting off this table any time soon.  He began to feel vibrations again.

At that time of the year the field was full of wonderful flowers. As always when she would go here she had a basket with her that she used to collect the flowers. Cream knelt down to pick up many different flowers as she could; planning to make a nice bouquet for her mother out of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh's jaw hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring up through giant flowers he saw a Giant version of Cream the Rabbit. She was humming a little tune picking flowers that grew all around him. The huge tree like flower next to him was ripped out of the ground roots and all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018What power she has\u2019 he thought in amazement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to try to get her attention; the problem was how? Oliver guessed he was no bigger than a tiny bug next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\nCream didn't take any notice of the figure, which was hidden between the flowers. She simply continued picking this or that flower humming her song and walking as well as jumping through the field - obviously unaware that with her jumps might cause what would feel like earthquakes to the bugs around her if she landed close to them - or that she might even step on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n\u201cHoly Aunt Petunia!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh just managed to dodge a massive foot as it crashed down just mere inches away from his right leg. The kid was in a real good mood but that didn\u2019t help him much, that last little hop she made nearly pan caked him. She hopped a bit again leaving a deep crater of a foot print behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nOnce her basket was full, she decided not to go home just yet. She fell backwards into the field to relax and enjoy the nice warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nCream  turned, placed her basket full of flowers to one side and promptly fell backwards. Between the wind from the displacement of air and the powerful tremor through the ground the Ash was sent sprawling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the dust had settled, Ash stood up staring at two huge feet propped up vertically, the soles of the shoes covered in clumps of dirt and debris. She was lying down.</span></div></div>",

Instantly stood up to see who was calling, obviously sending the small figure on her chest tumbling head over heels down dress to the ground below. It didn\u2019t go unnoticed, however. Cream saw something small falling off her landing at her feet. Looking down she saw a very small figure lying among the flowers. Cream knelt down but too afraid to even touch that figure as he seemed very fragile to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... who are you?\" she asked in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018She heard me!\u2019 Thought Ash. \u2018I just took a tumble down a living mountain, but she heard me!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up he looked skyward to see that the young rabbit was indeed looking back at him with a look of surprise, concern, and curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe-Hello!\u201d he called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned \u201cI can\u2019t hear you very well. I can just make out what your saying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018What? How can she not hear me with ear\u2019s that big?\u2019 he though. \u2018There must be some sort of range limit.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking quickly, Ash gestured for her to lower her hand down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Okay.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young rabbit lowered her hand palm up to ground level. She waited patiently as the tiny creature climbed into it and carefully lifted her hand up to her face. For the human it was a strange sensation. It was like being in a really big platform elevator. Aside from his ears popping he felt perfectly safe considering he was in a giant hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream silently whispered being unsure if she was too loud for him: \"Um.. well.. who are you?\" she said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did try to keep her voice as calm as possible as she was unsure if he would be afraid of her size to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Cream!\" she introduced herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human looked up into Cream\u2019s face, her smile having a relaxing effect on him. He knew then that he had nothing to fear from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsh,\u201d he replied. \u201cWhat is this place?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the great forest.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat world?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever mind.\u201d Ash looked up at Cream. \u201cIs everyone around here as big as you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBigger\u201d Said Cream carefully sitting on the ground. \u201cI\u2019m only a little girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot from where I\u2019m sitting,\u201d Ash mumbled under his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream wondered.. \"Hmm.. well.. I was honest.. among my friends.. I am the smallest.. Well, if you count Cheese, he's my little Chao friend - then I am not the smallest.. but he cannot speak.\"She then said.. \"Oh where are you? Cheese!\" she called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheese was flying over.. still a tremendous amount larger than Ash. \"Chao chao\" the little chao cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheese then smiled again: \"Aww.. you little one are so cute, you know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But well.. Tails is taller than me.. Mr. Sonic is taller.. and Mummy is like so tall..\" she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then asked: \"Do you want to meet them?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Were I\u2019m from people your size where only read about in story books.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, would you like to see my room?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh thought for a moment. He didn\u2019t want to be a burden to Cream, but he knew the odds of him surviving on his own were not in his favour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I\u2019d liked to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll put you in my pocket so I won\u2019t loose you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood idea, I wouldn\u2019t want to fall from this height.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream cupped her hand and carefully lowered Ash into her dress pocket. He noted it was very deep. \u2018Good,\u2019 he though \u2018less chances of falling out.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream Picked up her basket of flowers and started for home, happy that she had made a new friend, even though he was a little on the tiny side. She tried to walk carefully rather than her usual jumping around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it okay like this?\" she asked to her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard a \"Yes\" and went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes Cream entered the House she shared with her mother. \"Mum, I am back\" she called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi dearie!\" said Vanilla meeting her daughter at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream then handed over the basket of flowers: \"Those are for you!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla smiled: \"Thank you very much. They are wonderful. I'll put them on a table right away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ash didn't want to see Vanilla (Cream wasn't sure if he peaked out or not) she didn't introduce him just then. Instead she went to her room and locked the door behind herself. Reaching into her pocket she took Oliver out and placed him on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry a bit. Mum always wants me to tidy up so right now it's a bit of a mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a small 3-inch figure of Sonic off her shelf and placed it next to Ash. \"You should know him, he's the hero of our planet. Oh I have even more figures... so yeah.. Feel free to you look around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh looked up at the Figure of Sonic. Damn, even a Child\u2019s toy was bigger than him. He didn\u2019t tell her that he honestly never heard of Sonic, though it was safe to say he\u2019d have no trouble recognizing him if this figure represented an accurate likeness. He looked about the room. Over all it didn\u2019t look that messy compared to the way he used to keep his room at that age, he could still remember his mother scolding him about how messy it was. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It didn\u2019t seem to belong to Cream. It was much too big. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s my Mum\u2019s\u201d said Cream glancing over her shoulder \u201cI was using it as a bed for one of my dolls\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was her mother\u2019s? She must be absolutely enormous! But from what he had heard she seemed to be really nice. <br>\r\nCream had noticed that Ash probably didn\u2019t know Sonic.

Everyone on the planet would probably have recognized Sonic\u2019s likeness immediately but the way he looked at the figure it was like it was seeing for the first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then remembered his question. \"What world?\" - it didn't leave her head. Did he imply.. he wasn't like.. from town.. he was from.. Somewhere else entirely. She tried to push the thought away but the more she tried and more lost in it.

It\u2019s Mobius of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh nodded. \u201cI see. Cream, the world I\u2019m from is Called Earth. How I got here is anyone\u2019s guess. I\u2019ll figure it out later. But, I\u2019m here now. So lets just take things one at a time, lets start with where I\u2019ll sleep tonight. I think anything would do.

Aside from a more streamline look and an extra two wheels in the back, and of course it was a size or two bigger in scale compared to him, it looked very much like any Earth car he saw everyday. The interior was pretty bare. A seat for a toy four feet taller than himself and that was about it, not even a dash. He looked under the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, Ash was amazed at how complex this toy really was, all those small working parts. This Tails knew his craft. Looked like a battery similar to a lithium ion powered it. A flexible antenna was mounted in the back, no doubt picking up signals from the remote. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ash had never in his life thought he\u2019d ever see anyone or anything as tall or as enormous as her. Every step she took sent vibrations threw the car and into Ash. Luckily he was getting use to being around Cream so the sight of her mother wasn\u2019t a complete shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust wanted to see what you were up do, dearie\u201d said Vanilla. \u201cOh! You\u2019ve tidied up your room, good for you.\u201d She looked about and saw the car. \u201cIs that the toy Tails made for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh froze as Cream\u2019s mother walked over and picked the car up between two fingers. He thought of what he could do, he couldn\u2019t hide and there was no way he was going to jump out, so he stood perfectly still as Vanilla peered into the inside of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmazing, he even put a little driver inside.\u201d Said Vanilla as she examined the car. Then She handed the car over to Cream \u201c Supper\u2019s almost ready. I\u2019ll call you out when it\u2019s done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she left the room closing the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream then breathed up: \"Phew.. I guess I am lucky she didn't see you move.\" Cream looked it at Ash. \"And basically.. even in there you look totally misplaced. How much did you actually see when you looked forward? I know there's no dash or anything related but... when you sit don't you just look into the foot well area? You were probably also standing on the driver's seat for most of the time to actually see any thing at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI saw plenty.\u201d Said Ash as he climbed out of the toy and into her hand. \u201cIncluding your Mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you stay so still? She thought you were a little toy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was too scared to moved.\u201d Said Oliver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScared? Why would you be scared of my M- Oh\u2026\u201d Cream thought of how Ash saw the world, of course he\u2019d be scared. Her Mom was so much bigger than she was. \u201cDo you find me scary Oliver?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh looked up at Cream. She looked like she was on the verge of tears\u201c Only at first. Seeing someone your size for the first time is a real shock.\u201d He sat down in her palm and gave it a friendly tap \u201cBut I\u2019m not scared of you now. And I\u2019m sure your Mom wouldn\u2019t mind me being here, and I wouldn\u2019t want you to keep a secret from her, but I need more time to get use to everything before you tell her. Okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Don't worry about my Mum, she is the nicest mother I can imagine. She can be a bit strict sometimes but I guess she'd immediately accept you around.\" Cream explained. Putting the toy car on her little table near her bed.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Guess how I got my Chao..\u201d She said as she hugged Cheese. \u201cCheese followed me and Mum agreed I may raise him! So I am sure you'd also be welcome here! Of course only if you like to stay.\" Cream added hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll stay, I have nowhere else to go. And it\u2019s been fun\u201d Ash saw a big smile form on Cream\u2019s face \u201cJust think of me as your favourite Martian.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream frowned \u201c I thought you were from Earth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops I forgot, you\u2019ve never seen that program.

Try as he might, Ash still couldn\u2019t figure out how that creature stayed in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream was just walking down with her mother to get something to eat. She was chatting with her and not talking yet about Ash. she blushed a bit thinking \u2018His voice sounds male... so would people think my boy-friend would be with me now.. nah, he's so tiny, he couldn't be my boy-friend.. Still, just he looks so adorable!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Cream was away, Ash continued looking around the room. The closet door was opened and upon walking closer to it he discovered she had several suits just like the one she was wearing, not a bad idea, that way you didn\u2019t have to think about what to wear, just put the next clean suit on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked up to one of her shoes that were on its side. Since he\u2019d first seen here there was something Ash was curious about. He climbed up into it. The first thing that he noticed was the smell. It wasn\u2019t like human foot smell but more earthly and nowhere near as unpleasant. Walking along the inside he could make out the outline of Cream\u2019s Foot. It would seem that just as her hands were human-like so were her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing out of the shoe he began to have thoughts about them. For some reason he wanted to see what they looked like for himself. But, no, should he even dare to ask? What would she say if he did? He could feel his face going red from embracement just thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard and felt footsteps.</span></div></div>",

After pretending to fly the ship for a moment or two he felt Cream lower the spaceship to a landing. When her fingers moved away and the canopy was opened, Ash saw that he was--</span></div></div>",

Making his way down to it, he crawled under the door. To his delight he\u2019d chosen the right door, he was in her mothers bedroom. She wasn\u2019t there though, that gave him time to look around; and the first thing he saw was a pair of pink fuzzy slippers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made a straight line to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting from the toe of one slipper he climbed up to the mouth of the slipper. As he peered inside, Ash began to hear heavy footsteps approaching. Cream was asleep, so it had to be--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a panic he jumped into the slipper. Fortunately it was fuzzy on the inside and he didn't hurt himself. He heard the door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, finally all work is done. I really should get rid of those shoes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla slipped off her normal shoes - her heels were hurting her from all the walking but she had also gone shopping that day so she needed them as it would look odd for a lady to wear flat shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then approached the slippers with giant steps and slipped into the first one on her foot. And then into the second, not knowing someone was inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh cried out as Vanilla slowly slipped her massive socked foot into the slipper. With no other options and knowing he would never make it to the toes section in time, he hoped up and climbed up onto Vanilla\u2019s socked toes as they wiggled and made they\u2019re way into the slipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her slippers on, Vanilla walked out of her bedroom and into the living room to read. Every step she took was a challenge to Ash. He tried to hold onto the cloth of the sock but each time her foot touched the floor he was bounced into the air and had to scramble up onto her foot before she took another step. He wondered how many more times he\u2019d be able to do it before she either stopped walking or he ended up under her socked toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla walked into the living room, Grabbing her favourite book off the shelf she sat down on the couch.</span></div></div>",

She used the tips of her fingers to press down on the top of the right slipper to sort her toes. After a while everything felt fine and she continued to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh felt something big press into his back. The next thing he knew he was shoved In between Vanilla\u2019s socked toes. As he was pushed deeper in between them he felt the sock underneath him slip away. It was so dark inside he hadn\u2019t realized he was close to a hole in Vanilla\u2019s sock. He wanted to see Her feet, but he never thought he\u2019d get this close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was he still couldn\u2019t see them, but he could sure feel them pressed all around him in a firm but surprisingly gentle embrace. Maybe being stuck between her toes wasn\u2019t so bad after a---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought too soon as he slipped down underneath the tips of her big and second toes. Detecting his presence either aware or unaware, her toes begin to explore the little object under them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh tried to sit up but was quickly shoved back into the sock by one of Vanilla\u2019s huge toes, it slowly began to rubbing into him feeling every micro inch of his body, but not hurting him at all. With one free arm and hand he reached up and touched the underside of the toe on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel friction ridges, not unlike a human but at the same time very different. The skin was soft to the touch and smelled of some type of lotion that wasn\u2019t known to him. Before he realized what he was doing he lifted his head up and kissed the surface of the toe. The only response he got was Vanilla\u2019s toe continual rubbing. Then, the toe was off him, only for her huge big toe to take its place. Under this huge digit Oliver soon hard to breath, he struggled against it but it was hopeless. A hundred people his size couldn\u2019t budge it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Vanilla was completely unaware of the human which was by now in her sock, she did feel a tickling sensation under her toes. She couldn't resist giggling as she wiggled her toes over whatever was in her sock.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I might have sand or something in my socks!\" she figured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, and mercifully the big toe lifted off Ash enough to allow him to wiggle free. He heard a giggle from Vanilla above. She felt him but hadn't realized what he was. He didn't want to get her attention, he was still scared of what she might do, but if he didn't she'd crush him without even realizing it. In the pitch darkness Ash felt around until he was where he thought her big and second toes were and squeezed his way in between them. This resulted in the toes pressing around him gently followed by another Giggle by Vanilla.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Putting the plug in the tub she turned the water on and sitting on the toilet removed her slipper. Light illuminated Ash\u2019s world and he could see what Vanilla\u2019s foot looked like, but before he could inspect them more closely Vanilla laid her feet socks and all over the bathtub. Wanting to make sure all the sand would land in the bathtub so she wouldn't have to clean it up later she removed the socks and shook them out so all sand would fall out. She added some bathing soap and nice bubbles began form. While the tub finished filling up she undressed, by the time she had removed her cloths the tub was full and ready. Before she dipped into the tub she paused and giggled when she saw Cream's bathing duck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe.. should I take it in or not?\" she asked herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ash could swim a bit he\u2019d never been in such deep water before, it was like swimming in an ocean. Trying to stay afloat in a froth of big bubbles was a real challenge, but at least the water was warm. Towering above him completely nude Vanilla peered into the Tub, but he was far too busy trying to stay afloat to enjoy the view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I will,\u201d he heard Vanilla say. Then something big and yellow splashed down close to him, through soap filled eyes he saw that it was a yellow rubber duck. Swimming toward it, he managed to get a hold of it. Looking upward again he watched as Vanilla swung her foot over and stepped into the tub. As she settled down into it the wake of her movement created giant waves in the tub. One particular huge wave threw him up onto the rubber duck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoughing up soapy water and wiping the soap from his eyes, he looked around. The duck was floating in the middle of the tub. Vanilla\u2019s whole body up past her breasts was under the water. She sighed her eyes closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, this is so relaxing,\u201d Vanilla, sighed. She sank deeper into the water causing more waves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening her eyes again she eyed the Rubber Duck playfully. With a wave of her hand through the water, she made a wave that pushed the duck towards the end of the tub. Looking into the soapy water he saw something big coming up. Vanilla\u2019s feet broke the surface and grasped the duck with her toes. She played with the rubber duck, rolling it between her feet as closed her eyes to relax a bit more. The bathing soap formed a more and more big bubble bath with towers of white bubbles blocking Ash's view, not that it mattered because it was all he could do to stay on the duck.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The vast sole was also very human like aside from fine hairs that grew between her toes and the instep of her foot. Using the ridges and lines in her sole, Ash began to climb up onto Tikal\u2019s sole. She watched in fascination wondering what it was like to climb up onto a foot so huge. She watched as Ash paused in the centre of her instep. Then she felt something <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Did, did he just kiss me?\u2019 Tikal thought. It brought a smile to her face, \u2018I\u2019ve never knew my feet could have such an effect\u2019. She would have to return the affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh felt a little guilty kissing Tikal without permission but he didn\u2019t think she\u2019d feel just one little kiss. Moving sideways he made his way to her toes. Tikal giggled as he climbed up onto her big toe. Ash closed his eyes and rubbed his cheek against the soft but bumpy surface of her toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTikal felt Ash kiss her toe, this time she couldn\u2019t contain herself. Playfully she wiggled her toes. Ash slid off her big toe only to be gently caught in among the rest of her toes as they curled around him in a gentle embrace. Then they uncurled around him and her feet touched together sole to sole playfully trapping him between. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I got you surrounded Ash\" Tikal teased as she wiggled her toes. She was having quite a bit of fun, more then she'd had in a very long time, maybe there was a reason why she didn't disappear when Ash saw her, Maybe the Master emerald sensed she was in need of something that it simply couldn't give her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTikal continued playing with him on her toes. She then said: \"You know. Maybe I can take you along inside the Master Emerald!\" She then however quickly remembered. \"Wait. Forget it.. it wouldn't work.\" Then added \"But yeah, it's feeling so nice to have someone to play with or to talk to again. It is feeling like an eternity you know? You see the others do not even see me before they'd have the chance to do so I vanish. It is a bit sad actually!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTikal spread her feet apart and plucked Ash out holding him between her thumb and index finger \u201cSince you\u2019ve been so affectionate toward me, I thinks it\u2019s only fair I return the favour.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Oliver began to say \u201cNo, you don---\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShh, It\u2019s okay, I want to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTikal loosened her grip on Ash allowing him to slid into the palm of her hand. Looking up into her face he wondered what she was going to do. She lifted him closer to her mouth, his eyes when wide, what was she going to do? Her mouth opened lightly, Ash noted that she had a very cute mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid\u201d</span></div></div>",

To be enveloped by such warm softness was something He hadn\u2019t been prepared for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow was that?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I think I\u2019m going to need a cigarette.\u2019 Ash thought, but the most he could do was give her a goofy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTikal also enjoyed playing with him. She noticed how he experienced the kiss but she didn't wonder, her lips must have been immense to him. She also noticed that he was totally unable to talk. She decided to just blink with one eye making him feel that it's just okay, if he does not say a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine\" she whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping a glove off she placed the tip of her finger on top of Ash; she closed her eyes feeling the beating of his heart in his tiny chest. What was that poking her\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTikal opened her eyes and looked down, this time it was the human\u2019s turn to be red in the face. She couldn\u2019t help but giggle. \u201cMy I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d have such an effect on you.\u201d She teased. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s perfectly natural after all. There\u2019s no need to feel embarrassed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026.I just don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m taking advantage of you or anything.\u201d Said Ash Finally managing to get his tongue back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTikal gave him a reassuring smile \u201cYour quite a little gentleman, aren\u2019t you Ash? Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not taking advantage of me, nor am I offended by something you can't control\u201d Then mischievously added, \u201cMaybe I\u2019ve been taking advantage of you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTikal noticed how his heart was beating fast. He was really really... excited? \"Well, I think we should do something special. Should I show you some place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then said again: \"But remember I cannot take you to places where others might be ...or well.. I can.. but it would be dangerous\" she warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wherever you like otherwise.. as long as it's night chances are higher that I keep hidden!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don't have any pockets and I don't want to fall out of my hand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Asked Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTikal only smiled, winked, and swiftly deposited a surprised Ash into her mouth. She immediately felt the human struggle for a moment on the tip of her tongue but he had enough trust in her to relax and lay face down on the powerful muscle under him. She noted the salty taste of his body, as she slipped her glove and sandals back on. She felt his little fingers as they ran along her taste buds. She wrapped her tongue and gently hugged him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we go.\u201d She said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTikal Traveled  along. There was one place she felt she had to show Ash, someplace very important to her. She slowly approached the Master Emerald shrine and saw that Knuckles was sleeping infront of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\" she whispered while taking Ash out of her mouth. \"You see up there.. this big green thing.. is the master emerald.. allowing me to appear.. the red echidna.. he's the guardian.. but well, I better hurry off before he wakes up. He has very sensitive ears!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh looked back at the Emerald as Tikal carried him deeper into what looked to him as an ancient temple. \u201cTikal, what is this place?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI used to live here. This was the centre of a once very busy metropolis, now this is all that remains.\u201d She explained. She walked into a bare room, save for a pile of straw in the corner covered by an old mat. \u201cThis was my home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laid down on the mat, then after propping her head up she placed Ash on her chest. \u201cI\u2019ve really enjoyed our time together, First time I\u2019ve been on a date in a very long time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed our time as well. This has been an amazing experience.\u201d Said Ash. He walked closer to Tikal\u2019s mouth and patted her bottom lip. \u201cI even enjoyed being in your mouth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTikal giggled \u201cWeren\u2019t you afraid I was going to eat you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe for a second\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut I trust you too much to think you\u2019d ever do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTikal smiled showing her teeth \u201cI could have, you tasted pretty good. I could\u2019ve eaten you all up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh No!\u201d Ash replied in mock terror. \u201cPlease don\u2019t eat me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTikal laughed \u201cI won\u2019t, your too cute, and who\u2019d pamper my feet if I ate you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh laughed, and then stopped as if remembering something.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Which was perfectly fine because he was beginning to learn he had a thing for being little under a giant foot. And from he\u2019d felt, Tikal had very soft feet. He doubted he\u2019d be hurt at all. She looked at him with uncertainty and anticipation, he couldn\u2019t say no. He didn\u2019t have the heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right, sure.\u201d Ash finally said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat brought a wide smile to Tikal\u2019s face. With a squeal she removed one of her sandals. Then she placed Ash in the area where her toes would sit. The soft sole of the sandal under him felt warm but didn\u2019t smell, come to think of it, Neither did Tikal\u2019s foot when he\u2019d been crawling around on it. Ash concluded there were small things the Emerald couldn\u2019t recreate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, get ready for my big foot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTikal slowly slid her foot forward, taking her time. Her big toe settled on Ash for a moment, rubbing gently before moving past him and settling just above his head. Her whole Instep settled down on top of him, moulding around his body. Tikal tied her sandal back on, making sure it was on tight enough that her little foot toy would slide under her heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady Ash?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh rubbed her sole to let her know that he was. Tikal giggled and began to carefully walk. About ten minutes after they left the ruins, Knuckles stepped into what was left of Tikal\u2019s home scratching his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s very strange, I thought I heard giggling from inside here.\u201d He shrugged and walked back to the Master Emerald \u201cMaybe what they say about this place is true.

I thought. 'Only a few inches more and I'll be going ...WOAH! ' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I had feared with all the fluids and moisture  building up in the  vagina I had lost my footing and slipped, right throung the hole that leads to the birth canal .I closed my eyes to keep the fluid out of my eyes until I had come to a stop. My hand began to explore the wet and slippery surface.The surface I was on felt different,  but I didn't have to open my eyes to see where I was, the very stong, sweet but seductive, smell was enough to tell me were I was. I opened my eyes, I seemed to have managed to enter through a slip--- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was the light going?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking behind me I could see the entrance is closing up trapping me inside. This didn't look good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Amy, was becomeing even more confused, Then suddenly the urge to masturbate grew so strong that could no longer resists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happens to me? I'm excited for no reason?! I can not take it anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting a bit of privacy, Amy quicky went to her bedroom. Closeing the door and shutting her curtains she layed down on her bed. 'Who am I to argure with my body?' she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy had stopped moving. She seemed to be lying down. It was starting to get very warm. I could hear Amy's Breathing and heart rate going faster. A stream of light suddenly illuminated the inside of  the vaginal canal, but the light was so bright that I couldn't see outside. It was very spacious when I had entered but now it seemed the walls were closing together. But why? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... the place is shrinking ...?! the walls ... I'm am I crushed ...?! Wait a minute... Oh no. OH NO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Amy begain rubbing her clitoris, she simply couldn't resist anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"feels good ... ohhh ... sonic! ... I need you to fuck me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSHIT!! Amy was masturbating! She may have felt me more than I had thought!The walls closed around me threadening to crush me into jelly. Something odd begain to happen, Because the walls were so slippery and I was complete covered in all kinds of fluids the muscles in the walls begain to take me deeper within the birth canal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI closed my eyes, too afraid to see where I was going until I touched another type of surface. It felt soft, moist and circular. Could it be that I was in front of Amy's cervix, her womb?! I opened my eyes. Just as I thought and I was in front of the cervix and the worst was opening up. I could fight against the muscles to freedom but they were very strong. I had to make a choice before it was too late.</span></div></div>",

I'm inside... of you...\" I pleaded while the cervix's wall took my whole body inside, soon, the walls become more loose until I reached to the end, I entered into a more spacious chamber... her womb...

I was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe Chamber, her uterus smelled good, the surface is soft and very wet but enough to sleep confortable, it was good, I saw beyond the chamber and saw two hole that goes directly to her ovaries, heh... soon, the warm and the now calmed sounds of her heartbeat made me more sleepy until I finally give up and began to sleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was now calmed and satified, somehow she managed to have three orgasms at once! it felt very good but in the end the pleasure ended, the pink hedgehog was exausted but awake enough to notify that something was odd but she didn't care much. after few minutes, She get out of her room, and started to go downstair, she wanted to get out a little... maybe visiting a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got an idea, she exit her house once more, no noticing that inside of her lower belly have a sleeping man, Ash, that might cause her the most wierded but pleasant experience of her life.</span></div></div>",

If  Amy's getting excited, and if I can get her attention by only poking her nipple to arouse her until she wakes up that would be great. I hope it works well or I'll be trapped in this world forever.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was starting to shake! And her body temperature began to rise ... it was a good start!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* from the outside, Amy was starting to get aroused, her breathing became deeper and her cheeks were slightly reddish, but the stimulation was not enough to wake her up .*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Seems not enough to wake her, I'll have to squeeze harder then, maybe I should try tickleing. Maybe that takes best effect.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did it that little tremor quicky turned into an earthquake, Ash could see there  a large shadow falling directly over the position where he was before. 'That may be the hand of Amy' thought Ash, 'Maybe she's awake!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n No, she wasn't really awake but she having a wet dream, an erotic dream, the stimulation only motive to rub her vagina with her \u200b\u200bpanties on .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she didnt feel me much, is it me or her nipple hole getting bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were. Amy's nipples were growing very erect due to stimulation. The nipple was harder but he thought if he could still squeeze harder just enough he hoped that this last attempt would wake her up and discover him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* From the outside, Amy was already horny by the stimulation, her body temperature increaseing more and her cheeks were flushed with red .In her sleep Amy lifted her hand and begain to massage her right breast. The one Ash was on. The violent rocking motion was enough for Ash to loose his grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow that's wrong? is shaking a lot ... I'm getting close to the hole! I better hold,-- shit! I'm slipping ...I'm going to fall!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was quite certain of that fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every movement, every tremor, he was being pushed closer to the milk duct in the centre of the nipple. The more he tried to crawl away the more he was pushed from behind closer to the edge of the duct. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Amy was masturbating in her erotic dream, muttering as she rubs her vagina while massaging her right breast. With the tip of her index finger she began to rub the tip of her nipple vertically, shoving Ash forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to fall! ---AAAAAHHH ough!\" Ash fell forward into the duct at the last minute managed to get a hold of a flap of flesh. Within the walls of the nipple, Ash looked downward trying to see the bottom of the duct. It seemed to be an endless darkness. Terrified, Ash held as strong as he could to the fleshy wall, the increasing turbulent activity outside making it very difficult to keep holding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Amy was near climax, her fingers were already in and out of her vagina, until ... \"SONIC!\" Amy yelled , her body convulsed, her breasts bouncing, the intensity was too much for Ash. His grip faltered and seconds later he lost his grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ---\" Ash fell down the milk duct into Amy\u2019s breast. Looks like the end of this story, right? You are wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy fell back in her chair exhausted. 10 minutes later, Amy finally woke up, \"Aah, what a nice dream I had ...\" Amy thought as she Stood up from her chair, \"Sonic and I were married, and we were on honeymoon. We were making our first child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy had dreams like that one all the time, only this one was caused by a stimulation in her right breast, which Amy did not know ... yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My God, I will be late to prepare the dinner, I have some guests tonight, I have to hurry, first I have to change, I need clothes for the occasion.\" Amy muttered as she walked into her bedroom to change, 10 minutes after, she came out wearing elegant clothes, and went into the kitchen to prepare dinner. Not knowing she had a living sentient creature inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh awoke, dazed but alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I'm alive or dead? Have I thought\u2019s within my head? Damn it why am I thinking about Ozzie at a time like this!\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh wasn\u2019t entirely sure where he was, all he could see was darkness.\" Are those heartbeats? \"Indeed it was, the beating of a heart, he also heard the sound of lungs, but where was it coming from? \"That my heartbeat? No ... too strong as to be mine. uhh what am I sitting in, some kind of ... lake?\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh seemed to be on the edge of a river, but the liquid felt too thick to be water. He touched the bottom of the \u201criver\u201d. It felt hot, soft and fleshy. He scooped up some of the liquid in his cupped hands and cautiously took a drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Milk? But this milk is sweeter, \"he thought\" This is different from what I buy at the market ... wait a second \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh stopped to think, \"Sounds of the heart, lungs.\" \"The surface is soft and fleshy. I'm in a river of milk \"Ash remembered what had happened and suddenly realized where he was.\" I'm inside Amy\u2019s breast? How long have I been here? Wait, wait calm down, get a hold of yourself, there\u2019s no need to panic\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying not to lose his reasoning, Ash knew he\u2019d have to get out of there the same way he got it. Ash reached into his pocket for his cell phone. It had an integrated flashlight. He was thankful it hadn\u2019t been damaged. He flipped it open. No service. As if he\u2019d expected any. Turning on the flashlight he shown it forward . He could see fleshy tunnel he\u2019d fallen through and at the end of it he could also see that the duct had closed off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get out of here one way or another\"</span></div></div>",

I wonder how hard it would be to open it?\" he ponders. he grabs at the flesh as he sets his flash/phone light down in the front of his pants so he can see what he is doing. \"errrgh! its still not budging. I have to try harder!\" he grabs her nipple as hard as he can and tries to pull as much as he can open. outside, amy feels a small pinch in her nipple. \"huh? what is that? it must be sand or something rubbing against me.\" she says thinking logically. she rubs her nipple to see if it will fall away. \"woah?! whats happening?!\" ash says supprised at the sudden motion. he falls back into the milk with a slight splash. amy feels her discomfort go away. she gets up and goes to the kitchen to check on a cake that is still baking in the oven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"man this is so hard! how am I going to get out of here!\" ash says frustrated. then he sees some light coming in from the nipple opening. amys rub against her nipple stimulated it enough for him to crawl through. \"yes! i'm outta here!\" he says and dives into the hole. he crawls as fast as he can. then he reaches the end. her breast and nipples are pressed against a tight bra she is wearing. the fabric is letting light in. he grabs hold of the ladder like fabric and squeezes his way up her bra and away from his prison. in a few minutes he is out of her bra and on the top of her breast. *ding dong* \"oh, my first guest is here!\" amy says with glee. she had just set the cake in the fridge to cool down and will prepare it while her friends are chating and playing party games. as she goes to the door, ash holds onto her boob tightly as her bounces are like earth quakes. she reaches the door and lets a friend in. \"hello, Sadie!\" amy says as she greets her first guest in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hi amy!\" says the girl. she is a gray fox girl with long brown hair. she is wearing a tight purple top and a knee length purple skirt. ash sees the other girl and is amazed that there are more different species of anthros in this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"why don't you help me in the kitchen. I need to make icing and toppings for the cake.\" amy says inviting her guest. \"sure! that sounds great.\" replys the girl. they head off, still unaware about poor lil' ash. he yet again grabs hold of the boob, hoping he doesn't loose his grip and fall. suddenly, amy steps down kind of hard, sending a massive jolt through her jiggling breasts. this throws ash too...</span></div></div>",

What he was seeing was impossible, but there it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was in a hallway. A vast wooden dimly lite hallway. Beside him was a potted plant that towered over him like a red wood tree. He could make out pictures on the walls, but instead of people he saw anthropomorphic rabbits. Maybe they were gag pictures like those dogs playing poker, but something told him that wasn't the case. Once again he questioned whether or not he was dreaming. He felt the floor he was laying on. It felt real, more real than any dream he'd ever had. With his brain still trying to grasp what he was seeing, he got to his feet. He was in the center of the hallway, with the walls on either side reaching up to a ceiling hundreds of feet above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he tried to decide what to do next, he felt a tremor through the floor. Then another stronger than before. He'd seen enough Godzilla and Jurassic Park movies to know what that was. He began to hear thundering footfalls, they sounded muffled like someone walking without shoes. There was a bright flickering light coming from behind. Turning into the direction of this new source of light his brain almost short circuited at what he saw. It was a giant anthropomorphic rabbit. Hundreds of feet tall at least, The giant  was holding an enormous candle. The foot falls were slow but steady. Ash blinked. He knew this creature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was</span></div></div>",

Hundreds of feet tall for sure. He remembered his uncle's train set. The figures it had come with were very small. HO scale, his uncle had called it. From what he could tell, he was about the size of those figures, that made him just under a half inch tall. No wonder she hadn't seen him. What would she have done if she had? Would she have been kind and helped, or would he have ended up crushed like a bug under that massive pink shoe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tremors began to intensify again. Either she was coming back, or someone else was showing up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Ash made a dash for the closest shelter, the sofa.

As she entered the living room and made her way to the couch, her eyes didn't look down at the floor. If she had, she might've noticed the speck fleeing for his life. She might've paused to examine him further, maybe even been kind to him, but she hadn't glanced down. Her foot falls made it more difficult for tiny legs to run, while her larger and curvy legs closed the gap between them much quicker.  </span></div></div>",

I hate mayonnaise!\" He thought as he was stuck like glue to the stuff meanwhile April was talking to the brainiac genius of the Turtles Donatello about another possible attack by the Shredder and Krang \"Don't worry Donatello I'll be there with my camera no time flat but this was supposed to be my day off you know!

But sadly that was not the cause. Sighing did she look down and...spotted something. Or more importantly, someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh, staring at the immense beauty called Wonder Woman couldn't help but break from his short gawking affair as her serene eyes looked at him, directly. \"What in the world is that?\" She asked, her voice booming as Ash put quickly together she was referring to him. He gulped, not wanting to move, but not wanting to seem suspicious either as Wonder Woman walked towards him, making powerful and massive earthquakes with her red boots that shook his own being as he lost his footing and flew up into the sky as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, did Wonder Woman react, catching the poor Ash in mid-air as she brought him up to her face. \"So sentient, huh? Okay little boy who are you and why are you in the Justice League Watchtower?\" She asked as her massive  face filled his view,her stunning diamond blue eyes studying his every movement  he could only stare in wonder as one of his favorite super-heroines was in front of him, and enormous of all that. \"So is screaming all you can  do? It's alright no harm will harm to you.\" She said calmly, teasing him a bit as she was now dealing with matters of breaking in to the Watchtower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-oh, no, no, no,Er Ash,my name is Ash and somehow I woke up barely a inch tall and here in the Watchtower.....it-it's the truth honest please believe me!\" Ash cried scared out of his wits after processing her words very carefully, \"I....assure you...I can do more than just scream.\" He said very nervously as he was now standing in her palm, the size of most likely  a parking lot as he felt very, very tiny in comparison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana, now taking a keen interest in the intruder continued the conversation, \"Hmmmmmmmm you seem to be trustworthy but I'm not 100% sure but anyway I'm Diana but you probably know me as Wonder Woman. \" she said extending her unoccupied index finger to shake the little man's hand and giving him a smile \"And you are... your name is Ash you said?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yeah just Ash,\" He said as he took the finger's tip with his hand and shook it, \"And well...I think you can understand my situation currently.\" He was hopeful that at least she would hear him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not so sure about that,\" Wonder Woman said as she leaned on a nearby desk as she looked at him with unflinching yet calm eyes. \"What I see currently is a potential spy. For who? I'm not sure, but whatever the case you're in my hands now.\" Ash was speechless as it never occurred to him that this could happen, suddenly being accused of espionage or worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm not lying!\" He yelled out to her and she arched a eyebrow \"Sorry but please Wonder Woman you must believe me I'm no spy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prove it to me then and I'll believe you.\" She said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was just at home watching television, when all of a sudden there was a bright flash, and I ended up down on the floor and I-I ended up here honest.\" He puffed quite quickly as he gasped for breath. Diana still wasn't convinced as she still wasn't sure she could believe him. Unbuckling her belt from her hip, did she bring it up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If what you say is true,\" She spoke, making a small knot and tied it around him faster than he could blink as the rope was around his waist. \"Then the lasso will tell. Unless you have something to hide.\" He gulped as he took a deep breath and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear that what I say is only the truth.\" He shivered a bit as the lasso glowed it's usual golden light only to dissipate within seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Wonder Woman said as she untied him and put it back around her waist  \"I think I believe you now.\" </span></div></div>",

Come on out of the pillow.</b>\" Ms. Grey's soft,kind voice spoke out mentally but he scared out of his wits stayed put until he literally felt the entire pillow float up and dumped its contents him included he screamed as he was flying uncontrollably through the air into Jean Grey's waiting hand slowly the beautiful ginger haired X-Woman brought him to her titanic billboard face <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay little one I won't hurt you your name is Ash right?\" She gave him a sweet smile slowly he nodded forgetting she could read minds as one could easily read a book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please don't hurt me!\" He screamed \"I-I didn't mean to come in her-\" But once more she gave him a sweet smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright you did nothing wrong!

You must believe me when I say that! If I was you would already have been hurled halfway across the room or under my heel but I don't need telepathy to know you need help I'll do what I must to help you out alright? But I'm afraid we have to wait until my friend Beast aka Dr. Henry McCoy comes back so he can assist you to getting back to normal. Science isn't one of my strongest skills so in the meanwhile you can stay with me if you want.\" She gave him another heart warming smile and he tried his best to avoid thinking how incredibly beautiful she was,how he was developing a secret crush but it wasn't simple to hide your thoughts from a well skilled telepath!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay if you have a little crush on me(no pun intended)I don't mind and I'm certain Scott won't either.\" Jean winked playfully at you \"For now you'll be my little secret okay? My little cute secret!\" She giggled as she placed him on the dresser next to her bed and quickly changed into her usual pink dress outfit she wore when she wasn't in costume from behind the wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er okay thank you Ms....\" He nervously replied <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can call me Jean.\" She said as she sat on the bed watching him interestingly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Jean.\" He said feeling a little less nervous as he was about to ask her for something to eat or drink as he was starving and his throat was dry as a lake the door to her room opened and Jean sensed it wasn't Cyclops on the other side but Wolverine back from his mission and  checking up on her <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Red-Jean you alright in there?

Finally Jean let go giving Ash some room to move again. But as soon as Ash got used to the freedom, Jean pressed her breasts together once more, beginning the cycle anew. During his pitiful struggles, Ash heard Jean giggling from above. She sounded like an actual goddess to him and this little game she was playing certainly helped that image.

Back inside, Ash was resting quite comfortably between the two mounds of soft flesh. Despite the slightly funky smell, he almost wished he could stay there forever. Jean read this thought and considered obliging this little fantasy for a little. However, just then Ash and Jean were both caught off guard by something. Without warning, Ash's surroundings rumbled with a thunderous noise and a blast of hot air. Jean blushed as she realized what was happening, a bit too stunned to reach in and pull him out just yet. Back inside her panties, Ash was slowly recovering from the initial blast when the smell hit. A powerful gas wafted through the air around Ash burning his nostrils as it seemed to focus on the tiny form trapped on Jean's behind. As his eyes watered from the potent stench, Ash struggled to believe how something like this could come from someone and something he just finished describing as heaven beforehand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean felt some shifting and squirming behind her and blushed even more before finally reaching in to pull him out of his hot, gassy prison. Ash was briefly blinded by the sudden light from the outside world, but soon he was face to face with a nervous, blushing telepath. \"Sorry.\" she said sheepishly. \"That one caught me by surprise too. Are you okay? That couldn't have been pleasant when you were right in the line of fire.\" Ash was silent so Jean simply assumed he was in shock and peered into his surface thoughts.</span></div></div>",

Now he was convinced that she was scaring him intentionally. He tried to get up again, but the finger swiftly returned to pin him to her palm. However, this time it didn't go away. \"Ready for a little fun, Ashy?\" she said in an almost sinister tone. And then without warning the game finally began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe finger suddenly started to tickle the tiny man held in her palm. Ash squirmed and thrashed about uncontrollably, trying to break free, but unable to break from the overpowering might of the titanic telepath. \"Coochie coochie coo!\" Jean teased from above as she watched Ash's hopeless struggles. She was having the time of her life doing this. Ash on the other hand continued to thrash about, laughing uncontrollably as the mutant kept up this onslaught. \"P-please....s-s-stoop!\" Ash barely managed to get out between bouts of laughter. Jean, however, was not done. Holding him down with the fingers of the hand he was trapped on, she moved her opposite finger to around his armpit and with careful precision, started to tickle there as well. \"Coochie coochie!\" she kept teasing. Ash laughed and thrashed about even harder, starting to cry from laughing so hard. \"Please!\" he begged once more, but this was only met with more tickling. \"Tickle tickle!\" Jean was feeling even more playful. This was WAY more fun than her old dolls. She felt his hands futile trying to push the finger away amused just how helpless her new toy was. \"Uh-oh. Someone's being naughty. You know what that means.\" she said in a playful tone as her finger moved to the opposite armpit. Ash was completely helpless. His begging seemed to fall on deaf ears as he thought he was about to get dizzy from all the tickling. Then finally.</span></div></div>",

You tried to move your arms to stop it, dispose how futile your last few attempts were, but Jean surprised you by moving her finger down, not aiming for your torso or your arms, but instead someplace lower. Your mind was still getting over the last assault so by the time you finally pieced together what she had planned, it was too late. Jean\u2019s finger was already resting on your crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squirmed wildly, doing everything in your power to get out from there, but all your efforts succeeded in doing was grinding your privates against the massive digit, doing her job for her. Jean smirked as she took notice of this fact. \u201cWell I see someone\u2019s eager to skip to the fun part.\u201d The finger pressed down a bit, making the grinding that much more powerful. Your rod was soon at full length, or as far as it could get while being pinned by Jean\u2019s finger. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry, I can take care of the rest for you.\u201d You wanted to keep on fighting, but it seems the telepath was putting a psychic suggestion in your mind as your struggles weakened. Soon the finger began to shift back and forth over your defenseless form. You tried your best to take your mind off Jeans actions and the immense pleasure that her advances brought, but since you were dealing with a telepath, this proved to be impossible. Jean made sure to keep every minute detail fresh in your mind as her finger slid slightly back and forth, stroking the bulge in your pants. Her smirk grew more and more as Jean\u2019s massive face continued eying you, not with malice, but with a noticible expression of playfulness. This was all a game to her. And like it or not, you were stuck as her playmate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bit your lip showing what restrain you could in the face of her fingers onslaught. Jean increased the pressure a bit more. Not enough to harm you, but definitely enough to push you over the edge. As the finger stopped, a large stain covered your pants. You looked away, scared, humiliated, and worried about where things could even go from here. \u201cLooks like someone had fun down there. Now let\u2019s see...\u201d</span></div></div>",

He tried to push against the lip to stay outside of her dark, dripping maw, but the mutant didn't need to put forth any real effort to overpower this resistance. Ash was soon inside the damp cavern, shaking nervously at the thought of accidentally becoming this girl's lunch. Jean quickly pinned him under her tongue to keep him in place as she went out to try to get rid of Logan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she talked, Ash was assaulted by a deafening voice that seemed to boom from every direction. It was so much that he couldn't even make out what words she was saying, just a massive cacophony of unintelligible sound. He covered his ears and remained curled up as the tongue occasionally batted him while she spoke to her teammate. Jean planned for this to be brief, but of course, Logan was stubborn as ever. It took a while to finally get rid of him. Back inside, Ash was taking a quick look around. He kept his gaze away from the back where the endless abyss threatened to literally swallow him, instead focusing on the walls around them, all dripping with saliva. The tongue was now resting on him for a while and the sound seems to have stopped. Keeping his ears covered just to be safe, Ash's attention now turned to the rows of teeth that were blocking the exit. The were all as white as pearls and perfectly shaped. As much as one would admire them normally, from here, his one thought was the fear of being ground up and crushed between them. He really hoped Jean would let him out soon before these morbid thoughts get any worse.</span></div></div>",

However, he could see a small gap across him that seemed to lead somewhere. While thinking, he soon got a huge surprise when something crawled past him. He doesn't know what it is, but it was huge. He did remembered that he have a flashlight in his pocket somewhere as he started searching for it. He finally found it and turned on to see where he really is right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis surrounding reveiled an odd place, everthing around him seemed to be covered in giant, discarded, objects; they're usually food-related such as bags and wrappers However those aren't the only things around here. This place was also covered in giant-sized bugs crawling around. The one that pasted him was an ant; a huge one too! Ash soon realized where he is and quickly rushed toward the gap to prove his point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ash guessed it, he was in the middle of a colossal kitchen as he saw a few stuff that make out a typical kitchen. Looking up, he saw that he was under a giant refrigerator this whole entire time. He looked back ahead and at first saw nothing until he heard what appeared to sound like a series of thunderous footsteps that came far away. He pretty much saw this coming as a looming shadow appeared from the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh looked at that direction and there he saw a huge, feminine figure walking toward the kitchen.

Worried that he might be testing the tomboy's patience, he finally reached out and pressed his arms into the flesh. Almost immediately they slid on the sweaty surface. Figures. Though honestly this shouldn't be surprising given her lifestyle. Lynn felt a strange sensation as Ash slid along her sole. She managed to retain her poker face but only just barely. She heard Ash whimper up a sorry as he got back up to his feet preparing to do this for real. Lynn realized this and braced herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh started rubbing his hand along the sweaty flesh once more, the sweat hit him almost as hard as the rank odor did. Droplets slid off her toes and onto his head as he kept this up, rubbing both arms back and forth. With each passing second, the smell and taste of her huge soles seemed to cover his entire form. Ash were practically marked by them after a few minutes. God only knows if you could ever wash the stink out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Lynn was biting her lip as you got to work. Tiny or not, Ash really seemed to know what to do down there. She was definitely planning to make this a part of her daily routine. But it still felt kinda weird. Some odd awkward feeling. She wasnt sure what to do. Would the others see it as a weakness. No. She couldn't let that happen. Still, she couldn't be her usual rough self just yet. She had no clue how durable or fragile Ash was. And she had no intention of giving him up either. This was a rather interesting pickle.

Well..it is only her feet, but it stills counts as her <i>first</i> kiss. A small but strange smile appeared on her freckled face, who know she would have gotten such a willing playmate?  And not to mention the fun things they will do together to have in the near future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut sadly Lynn noticed the gawking and sighed. She going to have fun with Ash in <b>private</b>. With a swift kick, she punted the boy into the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys knock yourselves out.\" Lynn shrugged as she sat on the couch, and put her feet on the armrest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um..what about the order of who gets a turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget about it, whoever gets him first, gets to play with him.\" Lynn rolled her eyes as she rubbed the balls of her feet together. A clear blush is on her face, she clearly mimicking the earlier feeling with little success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sisters minus Luan shrugged up and made smiles of varying shades and degrees. Seeing that the little helper is just so eager to please them\u2026has awoken something in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ash slowly starts to get his bearings, he just realizes what he did. Embarrassment and shock are clearly written on the poor confused teen's face. Soon something is looming over his tiny form. Ash turns his head upwards, only to find\u2026</span></div></div>",

However, as your blurry vision began to clear, you looked up to notice the two blonde twin giantesses who were staring down at you with grins so wide you could clearly see their lack of front teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princesses first!\" the one wearing a pink gown and a tiara smugly proclaimed while holding out her gloved arm; only when you looked back and noticed the goth rearing back while letting out a 'Sigh' you realized that she was stopped while attempting to get you as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy's pause allowed Lana to lean over and get a hold of your body, which traveled far up in the air as the giant kid rose back up to her original position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt an ant under her gaze and, judging from her expression, you judged she was the kind of person that liked to crush ants for the fun of it. The look that screamed 'this is going to be fun' she was giving you did nothing to ease your nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This little doll's coming to our room,\" Lola declared while shooting you a predatory grin, one that reminded you of a tiger ready to leap on its defenseless prey,<br>\r\n\"We're gonna have a lot of fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact she called you 'doll', the tone she gave you such title with and her grin only made your heart sink, and you feared that these two giant kids could easily kill you if they weren't careful enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't think to yourself for long though; Lola hastily grabbed her twin sister's arm and began walking out of the living room, beginning to walk on a staircase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce upstairs, the hyperactive twins ran all the way straight to her room and shut the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got to take a look around: the room looked pretty large, but its contents couldn't conflict more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one side, the room looked like it was made for a member of the royal family; the other side looked like a jungle, you judged from the bed being untidy... and from the rather large snake that rested on top of it, curled on itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered what such animal was doing in the room of two six year olds, but you weren't left too much time to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to our room, little guy,\" the kid who held you eagerly spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned back in the cupped palms of Lana to face the enthusiastic twins, who were once again grinning down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut the formalities Lana, let's give this little guy the greatest tea party ever!\" Lola spoke in poorly contained excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was fitting, she thought, a beautiful princess such as herself deserved nothing more than a tiny servant such as the little guy who stumbled into the Loud House. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guessed you should have seen this coming, judging from this spoiled girl's looks and behavior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer twin sister didn't seem to share her opinion though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" she protested,<br>\r\n\"He's not doing some dumb tea party, we're gonna play together first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile pronouncing those words, Lana's mind flashed with memories of what Lynn had the tiny teen she was holding do and blushed at the thought. She wondered what kind of things you could do for her... or which places you could fit in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger twin glared at her sibling, who returned the glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the tension between the two. growing so thick you could cut it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, inevitably...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's playing with me first!\" Lola screamed.<br>\r\n\"No, me first!\" Lana countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then, the two began arguing violently,  their high-pitched infantile voices threatening to burst both your eardrums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercifully, the argument stopped soon; sadly, it was because the two of them started a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile still held in Lana's fist, you were unfortunately pulled into the fight as well and began feeling nauseous, especially when Lola jumped onto her twin and the two began rolling onto the carpeted floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt sick, but struggled to keep your latest meal where it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GIRLS!\" you screamed instead causing both twins to stop instantly; Lana had Lola on top of herself and was ready to deliver  a kick while the second twin was pulling her sister's pigtails. In all of this, you were being held in between a bare hand and  a pink-glowed one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't it be better if I...\" you had to pause to swallow a lump in your throat, <br>\r\n\"... If I picked who gets me first?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing no way out of their whims, you thought this was a reasonable agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's actually a good idea!\" Lana interrupted with a smile, causing the other twin to glare down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, afraid they were going to start fighting again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, such occurrence didn't come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Hurry up and pick already. You don't make a princess wait, you know.\" Lola spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt amazed, were they actually listening to you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind raced as you thought that if you picked a twin, the other was going to make it pay during her turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou picked Lana, you were sure the 'princess' would want your head; you picked Lola, you feared Lana was going to feed you to the snake that was on her bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the case, you had to pick one and hope the other wasn't going to be mad.</span></div></div>",

You're a guy, too!\" she complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou offered a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? He wants to play with me, so shut up already!\" said the other twin with a surprising amount of authority in her voice. You felt it, this wasn't going to be enjoyable at all. It was fine though, you just needed it to be painless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" she gave up,<br>\r\n\"I'll just wait for my turn... just hurry up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Lana walked over to her bed and jumped right next to the snake who abruptly woke up and crawled under her bed, startled. The tomboy little girl shot you a disappointed expression while Lola grinned smugly and walked over a tea table, which was conveniently already prepared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as one would imagine it, a pink child's table with little chairs that had stuffed animals sitting on them with toy cups in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you were set among the other toys, on your own chair, but there was an evident problem: you didn't even go up to the top of the table. The stuffed bear sitting beside you was probably several times your current height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... looks like we've got a bit of a problem...\" Lola pointed out while a burst of laughter came from the other side of the room, causing her to growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed by the sound of her older twin's laughter, Lola grabbed a tale book from nearby, lifted you up from your chair, placed the book on it and set you back on it with enough strength to make your body shiver. The objective was fulfilled though: you could finally see the upper part of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There! May this tea party begin!\" Lola exclaimed cheerfully, grabbing a tea pot from the table and beginning to tilt it into one a 'guest's' cup. Surprisingly, the amber liquid came for real and filled cup after cup with brown liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou neared your head to your cup, which was absurdly big for you, and gave it an experimental sniff: indeed, it was tea. It was cold though. Who knew how much time it had been in the tea pot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola reached forward and promptly took a sip, uncaring of the liquid being cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, there we go!\" she exclaimed, putting her cup back, her gaze going from doll to doll,<br>\r\n\"Everyone, I'd like you to meet our new guest: Ash!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou huffed and put your elbow on the table, hand on your cheek while the blonde giantess began talking to her dolls (you included), as if she was speaking to an actual crowd, but with only one listener in reality... not that you were listening too much though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, am I actually doing this?\" you muttered under your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo think just yesterday you were home, studying for a test... and now you were here, pretending to be listening to a giant six year old while her twin patiently waited for you to be done which, you hoped, was gonna happen soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did you even get here, you wondered, because this clearly wasn't your home or your neighborhood. But more importantly, why were you tiny? And why did these girls seem so calm about it? And how many more of them were there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lols! Your 'guest' looks bored out of his skull!\" Lana chimed from her bed after what seemed an eternity, but was in reality just ten minutes after the start of this torture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola growled, then looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong?\" she addressed you with a glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I don't think I can't do this,\" you replied, trying to sound sorrowful but only managing to sound bored,<br>\r\n\"That's just... pointless! I'm bored!\" you blurted out, thinking that Lola would understand. She was just six after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBad mistake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola's face immediately displayed anger. Usually, an angry six year old little girl  would look adorable; this one angry six year old little girl looked frightening, and not just because she was huge compared to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rude! Is that anyway to talk to your beautiful princess? Apologize!\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a knot in your stomach and your mouth was faster than your brain,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so so sorry princess Lola, I beg for your forgiveness.\" you blurted out, before blushing and looking at yourself, wondering in which dark corner of your mind you've found those words. Were you even apologizing? What happened to your dignity?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her bed, Lana leaned forward, eager to see what happened next. She sure didn't envy the tiny teen sitting in front of her twin, but she felt like he kind of deserved it for picking Lola first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better.\" Lola spoke to you, filling you with relief... which was drained along with the color from your face as she spoke her next sentence,<br>\r\n\"But I think a punishment is needed. I can't let such act of rudeness go unpunished after all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your heart pounding your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P... Punishment...?\" you stuttered breathlessly, wondering what this girl could come up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome dangerous kiddie game? She didn't look like the average six years old to you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. You're gonna get what you deserve!\" Lola exclaimed.</span></div></div>",

Shut up, Lana!\" Lola panted, trying to keep her tiny 'prisoner' where he was, but finding it quite hard to do so: the little guy was a fighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe that was why he was able to resist Lynn's own feet for that long, the young girl mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spoiled titan was about to give in and let go, when Lana decided that this was fun and that she wanted to join in as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a swift leap from her bed to the carpeted floor, the older twin made her way to where her sister was and kicked off her shoes in no time flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if I join in this?\" she chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola growled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think I'm letting your stinky feet get anywhere near my perfect nails-\" she began, but was interrupted by a grinning Lana, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really wanna lose to a little guy?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola groaned in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Fine.\" she agreed after a moment of hesitation, before she too got a smirk on her face as she looked at your current prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, all of a sudden she... let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body was relieved of the pressure and your nose inhaled fresh air again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dizzily took in as much air as you could. Sadly, it wasn't that much, because after just a second after you were freed, you were sandwiched in between two feet again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInitially, you believed that Lola was repeating what she had been doing so far, but you realized you were wrong: this time, the feet weren't assaulting your sides, but were instead in front and behind you. One of them was the same from before, but the other was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell coming from it was truly hideous, and it stung your nose, burning your nostrils and slowly working it's way down to your lungs; its skin, unlike Lola's, was rougher, and it rubbed off against your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour only supposition was that the other twin, Lana, had decided to 'aid' her sister in punishing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more the merrier, you sourly thought as you resumed struggling against both feet, trying to make the part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it happened... you weren't sure what you were going to do, as you were powerless against these giant kids, but you didn't care. All you needed to do was get away from their feet before they became more creative on how to use them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the gigantic pair of sisters, they giggled at unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's really squirming there!\" Lana laughed,<br>\r\n\"That ti-ti-ckles! Hehehaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, Lola too was laughing. So was this what Lynn felt like earlier? Because it sure felt good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lana, I have an idea!\" Lola chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard that, and didn't like it one bit. You liked it even less when a second pair of feet joined in the 'party', mashing you from all sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour nose was begging for mercy as it was assaulted by pungent and pleasant smells, your body smashed by soft and rough skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, your strength began to wane, and your struggles started to cease until you tired yourself out and stopped without accomplishing any actual progress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins noticed your lack of struggling and grinned to each other, giving you one last, painful squeeze with their feet before releasing you, letting you fall on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enemy was defeated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour beaten body was shaken as air traveled to your lungs, which you greedily filled with big gulps of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fun!\" Lana exclaimed, eyeing you with a big smile; Lola smirked. <br>\r\n\"Yeah! Guess I can forgive your rudeness after all, this had been fun!\" she agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't. Not at all, and were starting to reconsider the whole 'feet thing'. Next time you saw Lynn, you weren't going to be so happy, you knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that!?\" you exclaimed, both annoyed and scared,<br>\r\n\"You could've hurt me real bad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, silence! You were very rude, you know, you did deserve a punishment for insulting a beautiful princess such as myself.\" Lola retorted in a scolding tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And besides,\" Lana chimed in, rising to her full height which, from your small one, was very impressive, <br>\r\n\"Didn't you enjoy doing this with Lynn? This wasn't any different, was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means nothing...\" you muttered in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" Lola spoke again, <br>\r\n\"Now, on to the next game!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou perked up; so did Lana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, before you could question what 'game' she was talking about, the sound of a door opening caught your attention, as well as the attention of the giant twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, along with them, looked at the doorway, only the see the door opening indeed, letting a certain sister walk inside...</span></div></div>",

Her mild smell while much stronger up close and personal, it was still nowhere near as oppressive and smothering as the tomboy's own musk. In fact, it was almost..inviting. With his damned blush returning, he places his palm near her right heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Holy crap...her feet are so soft and pudgy. I guess she doesn't walk much. Very much unlike Ms.Sporty.'</i> Ash mused as he caresses her pale soles. Taking a small notice at the little twitches they make. Lucy, on the other hand, was beyond frazzled. Her hands were covering her beet red face and hiding a wobbly smile from her siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continues his little massage, Lucy slowly lowers her feet. Gently mashing Ash's face and upper-body up against the flesh. Simply taking the action as a signal, the boy starts to give little smooches, causing the little emo to give off some adorable giggles and...sweetly caress the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Hey...maybe she isn't so bad.'</i> Ash suddenly thought as he felt her giving him a weird massage. An odd but sweet gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lucy continues her little affectionate game, Lynn couldn't help but feel...<i><u>miffed</u></i>. How can little miss hot topic make Ash...so <i>eager</i>? Did one of those stupid spells finally worked or something like. With an annoyed huff, the annoyed girl got up from the couch, and walk towards the pair. There she simply sat in front of the other girl and mashed her feet up against hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lynn! What the <i>hell</i> are you doing!\" Lucy suddenly squeaks in surprise, a divergence from her usual monotone manner of speaking. The hardness of the older pair of feet was such a weird feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk Tsk Lucy, what will Mom say and do if she heard you right now?\" Lynn innocently fluttering her eyes at her, and her feet began to rub against the Goth's own at a strange pace.\"And to answer your question. My dogs are still barking, so I still need Ash's help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you wait, after I'm done? You could have hurt Ash.\" Lucy monotonously scolded her older sister. Her voice began to strain, as she instantly knew what mischevious girl is planning on doing. Meanwhile, Ash was in-between both sisters' soles. Luckily he was in was in an opening, so he wasn't completely sandwiched in. But the combined odors was making his head swim in laps, and he was getting pretty damn tired of the loud sisters'antics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure he fine. And besides, we need to spend more time together.~\" Lynn cooed as her toes gently scared against Lucy's misstep. Causing the little beatnik to form a wobbly half mile and uncharismatic giggling. The young girl managed to refrain herself from busting a gut...for now. But Lynn's toes was proving to be a tough opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs all this happen, Ash grew more and more annoyed. It is about time for the boy to strike back! And there are two pairs of cute feet for him to rained his vengeance on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

It was indescribable. If she had to write a poem about it, she'd say it felt like being watched while showering, albeit it'd be complicated to find a proper rhyme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Lynn, she too was blushing but, unlike her younger sibling and roommate, she wore a very large grin upon her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel the little guy squirming in between her and Lucy's feet. The sensation felt amazing, something she never felt before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could never imagine that, in all of this, your patience was quickly running out. You were feeling dizzy because of the mix of smells and your lungs were burning, your mouth and nose desperately tried to take in fresh air but couldn't find any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the two giant siblings kept this up for longer, you were sure you were gonna faint; not wanting to even imagine what these wild cats would do to an unconscious you, you set your mind and body on fighting back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd one's greatest mistake is to underestimate a cornered rat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Luce, how does this feel?\" Lynn teased her eight year old sibling, who furiously bit her lower lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lynn-\" she began, but her sentence was interrupted as a strong, tickling sensation began spreading throughout her at light speed: something, or rather someone, just began squirming wildly against her foot, as well as Lynn's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, the older sister bursted out laughing; disliking laughter, Lucy tried to contain herself by shutting her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she found it rather hard to keep herself from laughing: her already red cheeks puffed out as she held herself back for about five seconds, before starting laughing uncontrollably herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two laughing titanesses nearly dropped to the floor from the sensation you were giving them; too bad for them, they didn't notice that the two walls of flesh that surrounded you had loosened up in the meantime, giving you a chance to get free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily, you spread your limbs as wide as you could and began pushing back with all your might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIncredibly, you actually managed to push back both feet keeping you trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn and Lucy seemed to notice, because they suddenly looked in your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wha-\" Lynn stuttered while still caught up in a fit of laughter; she wasn't quick enough to push her foot forward again and you made a leap, the feet you were trapped between earlier colliding behind you while you rolled down on the carpeted floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn's eyes widened - that was really impressive of the 'shrimp'. Lucy's gaping jaw suggested that she was in the same line of thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shakily stood back up and brushed yourself off with your hands before turning around to send a glare to the two siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you please explain what the hell was that!?\" you exclaimed,<br>\r\n\"I was about to pass out back there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy and Lynn seemed taken aback by the outburst. Majorly the second, she thought this little guy liked this kind of stuff... at least from what she had seen and experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, calm down,\" she said with a shrug,<br>\r\n\"Weren't you enjoying this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flushed red, ashamed to have to admit to yourself that a small part of you DID enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lo-Look,\" you stuttered, dropping your glare,<br>\r\n\"... This is all going a bit too fast for me. I've just woken up here and you're all-\" you trailed off, your blush deepening,<br>\r\n\"... What I mean is, I don't know where I am, I don't know how I got here and I don't know why I'm this size. So... I need help,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn shot Lucy a brief glance, before looking down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, huh...\" she began, bending over to pick you up with a hand,<br>\r\n\"We don't quite know how you got here, either; Lana was the one finding you asleep and showed you to us. As for your size...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn offered another shrug at this point, and so did Lucy: they were just as clueless as you were about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me,\" a third voice lisped, causing you to turn around, only to see another giantess, way shorter than the other two but still huge to you; she wore a green sweater, pink pants and brown shoes, along with huge glasses on her face. She had brown, ruffled hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Lis...\" Lynn greeted the newcomer, having completely forgotten her younger siblings were all still there, with the exception of Lily. Not only her younger sisters though, Luan too was still there, sitting on the couch, her head sunken behind a book she was holding upside down in an attempt to hide the furious blush she wore on her face. Clearly, she had been staring at Lynn and Lucy's 'playtime'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola and Lana too were staring at the two roommates with amused expressions on their faces and, every once in awhile, they shot you expectant smirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your size must have somehow altered, leading you to shrink to this small size. I have never heard of something like this though, but if I had to make a theory, I'd say your body was hit with some kind of shrinking energy that caused you this disgrace,\" Lisa continued while looking at you, who felt like an insect under a magnifying glass,<br>\r\n\"As for your arrival here, I can't think of anything aside from a willing entrance in our household.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Willing?\" you parroted back,<br>\r\n\"No no, you're getting it wrong! I was studying for an exam, but I think I sorta drifted off at some point... when I woke up, I was here, like this, with you guys...\" you nervously explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tough situation, huh?\" Lynn empathically chimed from behind you,<br>\r\n\"You're a poor lost soul whose fate has shown to be incredibly cruel.\" Lucy added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a drama queen, you thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then this is an incredibly singular occurrence,\" Lisa continued, before looking at her older siblings, who were still sitting beside each other, barefoot,<br>\r\n\"If you just hand him to me for a couple hours, I'll be studying hi-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a sec, who said we're handing him?\" Lynn interrupted, with a wide grin on her face,<br>\r\n\"This little shrimp and us have still a lot of fun ahead of us,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back at the sporty brunette, blushing, but with a worried expression. Her idea of 'fun' was confirmed by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou told to yourself that, even though you didn't know how, you were here now, the size of a doll, and these giantesses weren't going to let you got so easily.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At the mention of 'fun', all the siblings present in the room began eyeing you expectantly, almost in a <i>hungry</i> fashion. And the thought that you might be eaten alive for real certainly scared you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Luan was taking discreet glances at you before looking away, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, you weren't going to be around her for much longer, because Lynn suddenly decided that it was time to bring this little guy somewhere private to enjoy 'quality time'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and Lucy get this lil' runt first,\" the sporty teen proclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shivered, what other kinds of sick fun could Lynn harbor while you were with them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa simply shrugged, Luan said nothing and Lucy blushed even more. But Lola and Lana were two fighters,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Hey! That's not fair!</b>\" they protested in unison, shooting their sporty sister two identical glares,<br>\r\n\"You got him so far, it should be our turn now!\" Lola continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, he's still all ours,\" Lynn simply responded while standing back up, holding you in a hand while the other went to take Lucy's arm as she began dragging her roommate across the house and towards the room they both shared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowls of annoyance accompanied the two sisters and you as they climbed upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, the sound of a door shutting could be heard downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Lucy,\" Lynn began once the two giantesses you were apparently stuck with right now closed the door; Lynn, much like before, appeared somewhat flustered and embarrassed, a blush adorned her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Yeah?\" Lucy asked, taken aback by her sister's unusual behavior. Usually, Lynn was though, and aggressive, and noisy; this Lynn didn't seem herself at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I know what I said, but d'ya think you could leave me and this runt alone for a moment?\" Lynn stuttered, before she regained a confident smirk, which she shot you,<br>\r\n\"I wanna have some more fun with ya, shrimp,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, you weren't sure if you liked that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually-\" you tried to oppose, but were interrupted by Lucy, who spoke as if you weren't even there,<br>\r\n\"But Lynn,\" she said,<br>\r\n\"It was my turn still...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but... I'll give him to ya later, okay?\" the older sister insisted. Lucy saw no point in arguing any further: if her sister decided she wanted some time with the tiny helper first, she was going to get it no matter what she said or did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh.\" the goth told gloomily as she headed to... a coffin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes shot open, there was a coffin on top of an actual bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy opened the lid and slid inside, before letting the lid fall back in place, shutting the coffin like it was no big deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas every member of this family so... particular, you asked yourself. You had no time to find answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem,\" Lynn cleared her throat, drawing your attention towards her. You also had a chance to take a look at her side of the room, and judged that it looked like a hurricane had passed there: shirts stained with what appeared to be mud were scattered around on the floor along with several different balls of all sizes and shapes, a baseball bat and a hockey stick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gaze ultimately went back to the brunette giantess, who was staring down at you with a smirk, as well as a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, ready for some more fun?\" she asked in an eager voice as she turned around and climbed on her bed with you still in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat on her pillow, her slender legs stretching to the farthest point they could reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, Lynn leaned forward, extending her arm and placing you right back at her feet, their smell almost immediately launching an assault on your senses. And now that you were this close, it was quadrupled from the last time you smelt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe temptation to cover your nose grew stronger and stronger each second you spent next to this titaness' feet, but you fought the urge to shoot a glance past them. Something that didn't result too easy, given how high they were compared to you, but you regardless managed to catch a glimpse of Lynn's smirking but blushing visage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya do a good job down there, bud,\" she said with unwell hidden excitement, the kind of excitement you'd hear in a younger child about to receive candy from their mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remained silent and hesitated in front of the impressively big soles of the brunette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould you...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the heck, you decided, you've already given yourself to these giantesses' whims, what was the point in stopping now? That'd only make Lynn upset, and you definitely didn't want to be around in such occurrence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, after a few more moments of hesitation, you began gingerly extending your hands and slid them along Lynn's left foot, deciding to start off with a foot rub. Maybe not what she was expecting, but still a good way to please her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a matter of fact, shortly after you started, Lynn began moaning softly and put a hand to her mouth in an attempt to choke back her murrs of pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis little guy was good at this, she thought; again, that feeling she felt before showed up again. She felt embarrassed, unsure and fragile as an egg shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy at her feet was doing a pretty good job and she felt so good, but so awkward...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust what was happening to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the first time she felt this kind of sensation; she had felt something similar only whenever she and her siblings had nice moments together, but this feeling was much stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she perhaps growing attached to the little guy? A perfect stranger, an abnormality... but also a willing playmate that didn't judge her for her... 'particular interests'...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile thinking about such things, Lynn discovered she was blushing madly while you had changed foot in the meantime, massaging it the best you could while also doing your best not to inhale the smell too much. It burned your nostrils and slowly worked it's way into your system, who knew for how long you were going to to he smelling it before fresh air replaced it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing you work with such devotion made Lynn smile, before another moan escaped her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, all of a sudden, a crazy idea came to her; at first, she laughed at it and tried to shake it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, she actually started liking the thought quite a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey shorty,\" she addressed you, wiggling her toes above your head,<br>\r\n\"Listen, I was thinkin' about something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn blushed furiously and trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know how to take her reaction at her own words, but nonetheless found enough courage to ask,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... And?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn laughed awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking...\"</span></div></div>",

All the girl knows that she just <i>like</i> him...okay!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the fact he likes her <i>feet</i>, one of the things about her loving siblings downright <i>fears</i>.Except for Lana...because, her feet can rival her own and the little loves all things gross and \"gnarly\". But with Ash..it's completely different, the foot rub he gives earlier was simply a deal breaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the coffin's door was slightly cracked open. Emerald eyes faintly could be seen watching the two. Despite being seemingly apathetic, there was a strange spark in them. was it jealousy or just mere curiosity? Tims will tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Excuse...but what you just said?\" Ash smartly said as his rub comes to a halt. The smell must have started to mess with your eardrums. Suddenly you found your body being wrapped by the first two toes of her right foot. Making torso very wet in the process. You found yourself staring at the face of a pissed off Lynn loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I. said. you. are. gonna. be. my. boyfriend. you. cute. little. bastard!\" The frustrated girl forced out every single syllable with clenched teeth. Anger was presented in her voice, and the blush red reached a new shade of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh okay...\" Ash was simply shocked by these turn of events but didn't resist. Knowing full well she can do anything she wants with him. That, and he finds her adorable...maybe \"sexy\". But it, not just her big old feet he likes about. It was how spunky she acts and the way she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the way her body is shaped and growing into....he's a growing boy after all. And growing boys tend to noticed certain things about girls...and themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now for making your awesome girlfriend pissed off. You going have to be given a lot of <b>extra speical</b> kisses to her dainty little feet.\" The girl made an angry giggle as she releases the boy. Her feet began to rub against each other. The grinding sounds that made him all sweaty.\"Do a good job, and I...give you a lot of kisses little guy!~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the cheeky little wink, the boy walks towards the feet. Admiring the sun-kissed skin and lighter shade they possessed.

You turned around, leaving the smell of the giantess' feet behind for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you noted who called Lynn's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding by the doorway was a white haired boy wearing an orange polo, blue jeans and white sneaker; he was younger than you, and yet he had white hair. You wondered how that could be possible, but your attention was quickly drawn by the expression he carried on his face: shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimidly, wondering if he saw you, you looked back, wondering how fast you could hide in between Lynn's feet before he noted you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, as it soon became clear, the boy noticed you already, when an irritated Lynn commanded, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out of here, stinkin'!\" she exclaimed, blushing red once more,<br>\r\n\"Can't you see I'm busy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is he?\" Lincoln replied, pointing to your small body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... he's... um...\" Lynn tried to come up with something she could tell her brother so that she could quickly dismiss him and return to her fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before she could reply, a muffled voice spoke from the coffin,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is Lynn's new boyfriend.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instinctively looked at the coffin: it didn't take a genius to figure out that Lucy was the one speaking, though you could feel something in her voice, an indecipherable emotion between annoyance and jealousy. Perhaps, you mused, she was just angry Lynn snatched you during her turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch line of thinking made you feel like you were a pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, your attention went back to Lincoln the moment he stuttered,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Boyfriend?\" he asked, looking in direction of Lucy's coffin before he slowly turned back to Lynn and you,<br>\r\n\"Why is he... small? Where did you even find someone like him?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously, he was just passing when he saw his sister with a little guy; at first he thought the little fella was nothing more than a doll, albeit he had wondered what was Lynn doing with such thing; however, when he saw Lynn talking to 'it' and it began moving, the boy had no more doubts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe even thought he was simply hallucinating when he heard Lynn saying he was her boyfriend, but now Lucy gave a confirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt uneasy under the boy's bewildered gaze and looked back at the giantess whose bed you were on; however, your thoughts were interrupted when you were picked up by your new girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this guy?\" you whispered, staring at Lynn in the eye,<br>\r\n\"My brother, Lincoln,\" she replied, whispering as well, before shooting her brother another look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Look stinkin', he's just a lil' fella we found. He's tiny because... why are you tiny again?\" Lynn asked, having focused on her fun and her feelings so much that she had forgotten Lisa's words already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... shrinking energy or somethin'...\" you timidly responded, still nervous about this whole thing; you turned around on the brunette's palms to shoot her younger brother a flustered state, deciding to break the ice before this got any weirder,<br>\r\n\"Hi?\" you awkwardly tried, mentally cursing yourself for sounding so meek, like a cornered mouse. Not that you could help it, this situation was so awkward you really didn't know what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just hoped Lynn, Lucy, Lincoln and the other siblings in the other room didn't have any more siblings you had to be introduced to, because you weren't sure you couldn't handle this level of stress again. In comparison, your studying for your exam last night sounded like the easiest thing ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea what awaited you just out of this room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Lincoln asked once he noted you were able to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Ash. Um, nice to meet you.\" you hastily added, introducing yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln was still shocked but, offered an explanation, he calmed down a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Nice to meet you too.\" he awkwardly replied,<br>\r\n\"So...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you leave already!?\" Lynn yelled before her brother could say what he had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw Lincoln hesitating.</span></div></div>",

They were at least thirty times your size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA million questions began forming in your racing mind while your heart began beating faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your questions came to an end when you heard a noise slowly bringing you back to reality: one of the three giantesses, with blonde hair and wearing a light blue top and brown shorts along with azure shoes, was snapping her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you even there, shrimp?\" she questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course he's there!\" the second blonde titaness, who was wearing a light green dress and stylish sandals, chimed,<br>\r\n\"He's right in front of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Leni, that's not what I meant...\" the first giantess chimed with a hint of exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dudes, maybe he can't remember?\" the giantess with dark brown hair said; you noted she was wearing a purple shirt as well as a purple skirt and boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think there's one way to find out...\" the boy muttered; he inexplicably had white hair and wore an orange polo and jeans with white sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titan turned his gaze towards you, who remained in silence the whole time these giants debated, still trying to process what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, before your eyes, the giant began kneeling down, his hands touching the carpeted floor and his face stopping at inches before you, causing you to shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey little guy,\" he spoke, his voice ringing in your ears,<br>\r\n\"Can you talk? Do you remember who you are?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first instinct was to scream at top of your lungs, but you forcefully suppressed it lest that wouldn't make a good first impression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, telling yourself that your actions might change your near future drastically, you began searching for a proper choice of words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y... Yes.\" you stuttered,<br>\r\n\"... And yes. My name's Ash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, great,\" the tallest of the three girls behind the boy chimed as she too leaned closer,<br>\r\n\"Then you can start explaining what are you doing in this house shrimp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tone wasn't too hostile, but it wasn't one you'd call friendly either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I... don't know!\" you exclaimed,<br>\r\n\"I just woke up here! I was kinda studying for an exam back home when I drifted off... next thing I know is that I'm here somehow, with you guys. I don't how.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D'aww, you poor thing...\" the giantess with the green dress, Leni you heard the other giantess call her, chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is sad, dude.\" the third giantess agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps we should introduce ourselves before getting to the wrong idea, Lori...\" the boy spoke again, before once more turning back to you with a smile,<br>\r\n\"Mind if I pick you up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't wait for an answer and reached forward. However, his attempt to pick you up was foiled by the tallest titaness, 'Lori'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lincoln, he's probably literally really fragile.\" she scolded while pulling back the boy named Lincoln.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Lincoln, he's, like, super small!\" Leni agreed, before looking down at you with a smile,<br>\r\n\"I'll help you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>No!</b>\" the three other giants said at the same time, nearly deafening you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeez, these kids sure were noisy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily, Lori bent down and scooped you up in both hands while Lincoln stood back up as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we are the Louds.\" she began while looking at you,<br>\r\n\"I'm Lori Loud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Leni Loud!\" the second chimed cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine's Luna Loud!\" the third exclaimed quite loudly. Wow, in name and in essence, you mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Lincoln Loud.\" the boy properly introduced himself, before continuing,<br>\r\n\"Do you have any idea how you shrunk down to that size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, shrunk?\" Leni interrupted,<br>\r\n\"You mean... he's not normally that tiny and cute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt vaguely embarrassed at being called 'cute'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... definitely not,\" you answered, before turning back to Lincoln,<br>\r\n\"And I don't... I have no idea why I'm like this or why I'm here right now, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, perhaps...\" Luna wondered, moving a hand to her chin,<br>\r\n\"... Maybe Lisa could help you, with your size at least. She's a real brain-box...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Lori grinned sinisterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding right now?\" she asked,<br>\r\n\"This shrimp's gonna help us around from now on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze up at the statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did that mean...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Lori-\" Lincoln tried to argue, but was interrupted by his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you need some help with your... thing, too?\" she asked, silencing her brother, who adopted a pensive expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a matter of fact, he could use someone to help with homework and stuff...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to mention the... 'special stuff' he could do for us...\" Lori continued, her grin growing immense, just like the fear she was striking into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust what hell have you ended up in?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'd be amazing to have a rock buddy...\" Luna murmured, smiling from ear to ear. Leni too had her own smile, and you became aware that, at least for now, you weren't getting any help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, as the eldest, I get him first.\" Lori proclaimed with authority, beginning to walk with you still in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think so, dude!\" Luna chimed, grabbing Lori by her arm,<br>\r\n\"I want him first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, let go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of letting go, Luna hardened her grip, but it didn't help her to get you; taking the opportunity, Leni reached forward and snatched you in her own hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's coming with me first.\" she said, eyeing you with a gentle smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, she was pulled back by both her sisters as they started fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" you exclaimed in between three behemoths that tried to pull you towards themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, while you were caught in Luna's palm, a slap made you soar high in the sky and fall back down from a lethal height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Lincoln was still there and managed to catch you, breaking your fall; he couldn't believe it, he was usually terrible at catching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GIRLS!\" he cried, and immediately the fight ceased,<br>\r\n\"Can't we just decide who gets him first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sisters agreed with him and, as the four siblings began debating, you sighed to yourself, still startled by the chain of events that led you to this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts were however interrupted shortly after they began: it appeared that the siblings reached an agreement.</span></div></div>",

No one's gonna get him if you kill him first!\" Lori, who was still there, exclaimed while separating her two siblings by stepping in between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body was let go of and was left into Lincoln's hands, though not for long. In fact, Lori hastily grabbed a hold of you and scooped you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to proclaim her intention to get you first, but she noticed you were in pain... and something in her changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt pitiful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh, are you alright little fella?\" a caring voice you recognized as Leni's chimed in as she leaned over to see you better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah...\" you stuttered,<br>\r\n\"I think...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori sighed, then turned to Luna and Lincoln. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys... why don't you let the shrimp decide who he wants to be with first?\" she suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe statement hit you, just like it hit the giantess' siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid she actually say those words? Huh, maybe she wasn't so bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds fair.\" Lincoln admitted, scratching the back of his head while shooting you a sorrowful stare,<br>\r\n\"Sorry little guy, we got carried away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, didn't mean to hurt you dude.\" Luna apologized as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>They're caring in their own way...</i>' you mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you choose. Which one of us do you want to stay with, for now?\" the white haired boy asked you more gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou internally groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey still wanted to do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" you hesitated, wondering who was your safest choice between Luna and Lincoln since you didn't get to turn them down for obvious reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hesitation soon caused Lori to sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up shrimp. I literally don't have all day for this.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, and considered your options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna seemed older than her brother and that meant she was also more mature, but ever since she introduced herself, she's made clear she wasn't the quietest person in this house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she got too excited about the whole 'lil' dude' thing, you feared you were gonna be killed by accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, there was Lincoln, who seemed the quietest among this group but also the youngest, though he seemed to have enough common sense to say you needed to be handled with care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon dude, you're taking too much time!\" Luna scolded impatiently as she crossed her arms; he hid it very well, but Lincoln was impatient to hear your choice as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, you made a choice. </span></div></div>",

Before she could answer, the younger one was standing right over you reaching down. \"Hey what's this?\" you tried to get away from her only to run into Kuki's bare foot. Both girls laughed before Kuki picked you up and showed you to both of the new faces. \"This is my new friend. He's really tiny. We were just playing. He likes when I smoosh him between my feet!\" She says cheerfully. Of course this was NOT true, nor was it something you wanted her telling others, ESPECIALLY her own mother. \"I- THat's not true. I was ju-\" You stopped as Kuki pulled you into a tight hug forcing the air out of you. Peeking back at their mother, you expected to see anger or rage. But instead what you saw was a grin. You weren't sure if that was worse or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the younger sisters face appeared and covered your entire field of vision. \"COOOOOOOOOL!\" can I see him?\" you kept repeating no, but Kuki gave a cheerful \"Okay!\" The smaller hands grabbed you tightly as she inspected you struggling in her iron grip. She poked you in a few places before shouting. \"Let's play a game with him!\" Both girls seemed very excited by the idea while their mother simply grinned and watched. \"Oh lets keep teasing him like this!\" Kuki said as she gently pinned you under her foot. \"Nah Lets STOMP around and see how long he can keep away!\" Her sister said stomping her foot on the floor inches away from you with a deafening thud. \"Mushi, I don't think he'll like that game.\" Kuki said, revealing the little hellion's name. Mushi pouted and you let out a sigh of relief that your energetic caretaker seemed to be watching your back... that is, before Kuki added, \"You need to take your shoes off so you don't hurt him. Duh!\" You turned pale at this suggestion. \"W-what!\" you looked to the mother for help, but she seemed amused by her daughters having fun together. \"Now girls. maybe you should only play with him one at a time for now. Im sure playing with two giants will be a lot for him right now.\" Both girls looked back to their mother. \"But you could play with us too mom. Why don't we all play whatever we decide!\" You tried to protest, but Mushi' grabbed hold of you again, pressing you tightly against her as the three debated what they should do with you.</span></div></div>",

The last two girl's feet were certainly huge, but these were absolutely monstrous by comparison. And being stuck in those tight heels all day long did not do them any favors for the tiny boy. Even if he wanted to move, his legs felt like jelly. Up above, she looked amused by his reaction of course, she did give him a command and he was taking his time even getting started on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Ash felt a small (relative to the giants) hand wrap around him as the youngest grabs him tight once more. \"Here let me help ya.\" she says cheerfully before ramming him hard into the sole of her mother. Thankfully the skin was soft enough to cushion the impact. Of course now Ash was right against it, being rubbed roughly into the slightly sweaty sole to the amusement of all three. Compared to Kuki's, her mother's foot felt thicker and tougher. As Mushi grinned him up around the top, her mother's toes seemed to instinctively try to clamp down on Ash's arms and head. She was clearly enjoying this more than he had hoped. \"Okay Mushi, I think you helped him get started enough. Lets let him take it from here.\" her daughter looked a little sad, but obediently let go of the tiny boy, if only to avoid getting into trouble. \"Tell you what, why don't you stand to the side and make sure he doesn't slack off with his duties.\" And with that, that smirk returned. the one that sent chills down Ash's spine. \"Okay!\" She called as she stood over him watching him with an almost menacing expression. This was not going to be pleasant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time so that Mushi wouldn't have an excuse to take any action, Ash quickly started rubbing the foot on his own. The older woman seemed to hum happily as this resumed, clearly he was doing a decent enough job. \"I don't see any licking or smelling down there!\" Mushi called down tauntingly. \"She's right you know. I did tell you to smell and lick them. Better get started before she has to discipline you.\" Ash was dumbfounded by just how into this their mother was getting. \"What the hell, I thought she was going to be the responsible one, but she's more or less telling her youngest daughter that she gets to discipline a boy at least 2 or 3 times her age.\" this was all very silent so none of the girls heard him Though he still didn't get started on his actual task yet during his thinking out loud. He better get started fast.</span></div></div>",

Was it hatred? Curiosity? ... arousal? The thought of being this giant\u2019s means of experimenting with her foot fetish probably gave you the biggest chills. Unfortunately, what she did next would only confirm these fears. Hovering her foul foot overhead, Fanny wiggles her toes in a taunting manner. Ash wanted to flee, but he couldn\u2019t get his legs working. His body seemed to be trapped there, looking up at the impending doom above. Finally, she started to rub a big toe along your form, a loud and relaxed sigh signifying that she was enjoying this way more than you were. Ash squirmed under the bulbous digit, but Fanny kept it on top, savoring every rub and every futile escape attempt. You were her\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon she shifted her leg, now rubbing her entire sole against the tiny boy before her. Ash had given up at this point. He knew it was hopeless if he couldn\u2019t even escape one toe. He just laid there as the foot pressed down gently, rubbing all over and covering her new toy with sweat and dirt that was residing under her huge sole. He almost wanted to cry at how his life had suddenly been reduced to nothing more than this crazy brat\u2019s foot toy. As for her, Fanny exhaled even louder sounding even more relaxed. Though Ash couldn\u2019t see, there was a very noticible blush on her face as the sole gently grinded against him.</span></div></div>",

But at the same time, seeing Fanny looking so embarrassed, so flustered, so confused he almost felt bad for his tormentor. As if this wasn't entirely her fault. Granted it could simply be the fact that he was the one she was venting her frustrations on and simply wanted to help clear things up in order to make things easier for himself. Either way Ash felt he had to say something to the young giant, for at least one of their sakes (his own) if anything. Still, this was a very delicate topic, and this girl was clearly prone to some mighty big mood swings at the slightest trigger. 'Well.... here goes nothing.' he thought as he looked back up at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... miss... Fanny was it?\" he asked in a cautious tone. The giant looked back at him with a face that didn't seem to convey anger. So far so good he guesses. Probably still in the mood after that little \"game\" earlier. <br>\r\n\"Um... well do... do you...\" as the question finally reached his tongue, words would not escape. He was terrified of what would happen if he worded it wrong or if she the topic itself would simply freak her out. Of course his stuttering tried the girl's patience very quickly. \"Oh for- OUT WITH IT ALREADY YA WEE LITTLE BRAT!\" she went right back to shouting, giving Ash an even bigger scare. \"DO YOU LIKE FEET?\" he quickly yelled up before looking back at her, afraid of the reaction he'd see. To his surprise, Fanny didn't look angered, but rather in an extremely rare instance, she looked speechless. Her face was red as a tomato as she tried to get around the question. \"W-what kind o stupid question is that? What do you mean by liking feet. Who would even care about a foot?\" She was confrontational again, but her tone was still more flustered than angered. \"W-well, I just saw the way you were looking... and talking earlier when you were.... when you had me under them.\"<br>\r\nHer expression was completely stupefied once again. Ash dreaded that she would just crush him and be done with the embarrassment, but she didn't she just sat there. Trying to figure out the answer herself. \"I... I mean ya did feel good down there... b-but that was just.... I mean who can like?\" now she was stuttering mindlessly again. \"I... It's nothing to worry about.\" you chimed in. \"Lots of people feel that way about them... It might seem weird, but there's nothing wrong with it.\" That was probably the best Ash could do to help her with this. He certainly hoped it would suffice. It was very possible his life depended on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she leaned over so that her face was closer to him. There was still a noticeable blush on her face, but she was doing her best to maintain an intimidating glare. \"If you tell a soul about this, I'll grind ya into paste. Got it?\" Despite how cute her attempt to look mad was, the threat hit home. Ash nodded shyly. \"Good.\" she says standing back up.</span></div></div>",

They need some help cooling down.\" The command was enough to make you grimace. You remembered how horrible they reeked before and the big toe tapping you on the nose signaled to you that they did not get any better since that. Wiping the sweat off your face you tried to think of some way to get her to change this last \"extra special thing\" to something else. \"I... I don't think me smelling your feet will do anything to cool them down.\" you quietly spoke up, hoping that bit of logic would suffice. Fanny simply grinned again and wiggled her toes. \"Making' excuses right away. I almost think you DON'T wan't me to give ya a break.\" Your eyes widen as she makes it very clear what your choices are. She notices this, but seems to misread your reaction. \"Hmm? Starting to think I'm not the only one here who likes feet huh?\" Oh God, that is not.... well admittedly you do kinda like feet, but just a quick wiff from being near them was enough to tell you that you'd rather not spend much more time around her VERY stinky soles. \"N-It's not that. I... just wanted to mention that... I'll just do what you said.\" you nervously try explaining before simply resigning yourself to the initial command. Fanny smirked before laying back and pressing her feet right up against you. You hadn't even started to sniff and already your sense of smell was assaulted by one of the worst attacks ever placed against it. You started coughing while the odor wafted in the air around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you made your move, leaning in towards the left one first. Fanny watched you with an amused grin as you began to breath in deeply. That familiar smell of sour cheese and spoiled eggs hit you like a wrecking ball making you recoil, but you continued to sniff as commanded. \"No no no. Ya gotta get closer.\" she ordered almost making you cry in response... well cry more than the stench alone was already making you. Still, if it meant freedom for the night, it was worth it.... probably.... maybe. Leaning in closer, you were now less than an inch (by your scale) away from the putrid smelling wall of flesh. The smell was soon much stronger as you drew closer to the source. Your vision got blurry and you were struggling to stand up straight. Fanny giggled as she saw you, amused that a once mighty teenager was now being completely overpowered by nothing more than the smell of her foot. She doesn't even need to touch him. It was amusing and it gave her a strange rush. Of course this didn't last for too long as you continued your task. You could feel the heat radiating from her sole as you got closer. You really hoped she didn't actually expect them to get cooled off from you doing this. Who know what would happen if you fail your task because of that.The thought made you shudder, but hat didn't matter too much. You wouldn't last another 3 minutes before the assault on your senses became too much to bear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young giantess watched in amazement as the small boy passed out from her stinky feet. With an amused giggle she reached down for you. Much later you would awaken to find yourself...</span></div></div>",

You savored the smooth leathery texture of her foot against your body as you slid an arm along the sole, feeling the warm and damp flesh under your fingers. It's clear from the sweat and the smells that this girl was very active recently. Probably from her little samurai game or whatever she's dressed up for. You couldn't really explain why, but this experience just felt divine. You wanted it to never end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this was hardly your decision as the girl looked down in complete and utter shock, not knowing what to make of this situation. She blushed nervously as she suddenly felt you massaging the sole in your trance. Finally she regained her composure and with her stern expression back on, she looked down at you with a loud \"A-HEM!\" Snapping out of your trance, you were overcome with a mix of fear, embarrassment, and some remaining traces of the euphoria from earlier. Slowly backing away from the foot with a timid  \"S-sorry... I... I lost control of myself...\" You could barely keep your eyes up thanks to the overwhelming feeling that you were about to die here and now.</span></div></div>",

You noticed her big toe tapping impatiently as you were staring out into nowhere in your thoughts. Looking back up, the girl's expressions seemed to match. <br>\r\n\"Come now, Ashton. You said you knew what i wanted you to do. Were you lying earlier to mask stupidity or are you simply lazy? \" her monotone voice seemed to attack Ash with her very clear condescension for him. \"Father always told me how unruly kids grow up to be lazy teens and worthless adults. While you can no longer be considered a person, Perhaps it's not too late to fix that work ethic of yours. When I give you a command, I do not expect you to hesitate. I expect you to do as you are told.\" She raised her foot over him and lowered it until it was just inches (by Ash's standards ) above him, hammering in the point of what will happen if he defies her. \"Hmmm.... actually, why don't I help you out this first time. After all, new jobs can always be so scary on the first day\" there was a something sinister in her monotone there, and without warning, the pale sole pressed down, pinning Ash beneath the large, yet thankfully well kept, foot of this creepy giantess. Ash squirmed about like his life depended on it. For all he knew, it did. He tried to move, to get free, but she was pressing down just hard enough that no matter how much eh struggled, he's stay nicely in place. She savored the feeling of the older boy trapped under her foot. As she said before, this person could no longer be considered an older person or teenager for her to respect. He was nothing more than a doll, or perhaps a pet at best. But nothing higher. Things like him existed to amuse her. He simply needed to learn his place.</span></div></div>",

Somehow you had ended up on a steel table holding a lot of different scientific vials and tools. Not wanting to end up in an even worse predicament, you were careful to steer clear of them as you navigated around the table. Looking at your surroundings, it was easy to tell that you were in a laboratory of some sort. But whose? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as that thought passed through your mind, the laboratory's door flew open at such an extreme speed that the glass attached to it shattered in a instant. Frightened by the sudden motion, you covered your head in your hands, looking away as someone stomped their way into the laboratory. The footsteps sounded heavy, too heavy to be a normal person, but you were too afraid to look. The footsteps came closer and closer to the table you were on and stopped as soon as the person reached the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of silence, you decide to finally look up at whoever had barged into the lab. Tilted your head upwards, you see none other than the Incredible Hulk! And he was staring down on you! Scared out your mind by the green giant, you instantly run to the edge of the table to make your escape. But as you got there, you notice that the Giant Hulk isn't making a move to grab you. You stop and look up again. Hulk wasn't looking down you. He was looking down on his many vials, seemingly trying to find one in particular. You breathe a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this time that you noticed how close to the Hulk's waist you are. You could see the top of his tattered pink shorts. The button was undone, the fly was mostly down, and the Incredible Hulk has no need for underwear so it didn't leave much to the imagination. You could practically see part of the Hulk's penis bursting through the denim and you could definitely see the large tuft of pubic hair at the top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hulk leans forward to reach a vial and slams into the table in the process, breaking you out of your trance in the worst way possible. Being so close to the edge of the table when Hulk reached for the vial has caused to teeter over the precipice. Instinctually, you grab on to whatever may be near by which is, of course, the jeans of the Incredible Hulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo here you are hanging from the pants of a gigantic green well-endowed humanoid. You are too scared to climb or do anything other than hold on. <br>\r\nBut the Hulk has different plans.</span></div></div>",

Subconsciously, you immediately start climbing toward the green skin of Hulk's cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the easiest way to get his attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's what you kept telling yourself. But you knew exactly why you were doing what you were doing. And it only became more evident when your hands touched it, crossing the border from fabric to skin. It was intensifying. Feeling the blood rushing through the member of the giant hulk, enveloping yourself in the musk. You wanted to do nothing but get closer. You continue climbing upwards, hoping to get to the tuft of pubic hairs at the top of the penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n While you were climbing, however, you could feel the Hulk's manhood getting harder, as if your climbing was stimulating him. <br>\r\nYou didn't know how to feel about this, but you did know how to feel about the Hulk. Apparently you had gotten him so aroused that he was now fidgeting. He clearly didn't know exactly what was going on either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally reaching the Hulk's pubic hair at the top of his monolithic cock, something beautiful happens.</span></div></div>",

There's plenty of normal food around here for you to eat.... Hold on for a minute I got a pest control problem....\" As she stood up and put the person on hold \"Okay Slimer what do you got in your hand?

He might conduct the oddest experiments on you Ash just to figure out what you are  and that's really saying something not to mention Peter hates bugs and the last thing I'd want is to see you under his boot no I better hide you until they leave or get another assignment until then stay put okay I got some business to take care of.\" As business she was referring to asking the GB how their latest mission went all four got out of the car completely exhausted and the two ghost traps they brought with them were close to bursting \"Man I'm bushed I'm going to sleep for a week nobody bother me until then okay!\" Peter moaned as he took off his proton pack and the other three did the same \"These ghosts are getting tougher and tougher every time!\" Ray complained \"Well I don't know about the rest of you but I'm going to raid the fridge!\" Winston said \"Uh I wouldn't if I were you Winston remember the green floating  garbage disposal we got?\" Janine said popping up and acting like she wasn't hiding anything \"Oh yeah forgot about Slimer hey Janine any more calls?\" \"Nope so you boys for once can take a rest. Come on I'll store these ghosts in the containment unit for you!\" As she picked up both smoking and sizzling ghost traps and headed downstairs but not before she said \"Hi Egon rough day?\" \"Yeah a bit too rough if you ask me I'm with Peter far too tired to conduct any new experiments I'm also headed straight to bed.\" So Janine was free to head alone downstairs to put the ghosts in the storage unit once down there </span></div></div>",

I promise not to tell the boys not a single word it will just be your and mine little secret.\" She whispered picking him up and bringing him to her billboard face but before he could respond Egon looking incredibly tired came downstairs yawning \"Tell us what? Who are you talking to Janine?\" He curiously asked setting down a bunch of odd looking equipment probably for his next experiment Janine gasped out loud she had no idea he was coming down here and quickly hid Ash back in her pocket he screamed out disappointed as he at least wanted to meet one of the legendary GB in the flesh \"Who me? Er nobody just talking to myself Egon that's all!\" She whispered after shoving the boy back in her pocket Egon looked suspensive though \"Really? That's odd I could have sworn I heard someone else talking down here.\" \"Yeah that was Slimer yeah Slimer he....\" \"Slimer's upstairs Janine sleeping on Peter's bed covering his sheets in slime I was just there Peter was trying to convince us as usual if he could blast him! Is someone else here? I know I heard someone else.....\" Janine turned bright red as she usually did whenever she was in Egon's presence but this time with nervousness she didn't want to lie or hide anything from the man she had a crush on ever since she applied for this job but at the same time she didn't want to reveal the tiny boy not yet what should she do? </span></div></div>",

Sure it was harder on my feet but at least I was going much faster. As I continued running, I looked around at my gargantuan surroundings and realized that I was hardly making any ground at all. I was just too tiny. The wall  up ahead didn't seem to be getting any closer. It could have been no more than a few feet away, but to me it was like a hundred meters. As I carried on running towards that wall, my place of safty, I was soon out of breath, knew I should've joined a gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt a tremor in the floor.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThen another, stronger than the first. Then another, and another becoming stronger and stronger each time. I soon began to hear a Thud accompanying the tremor. They continued, THUMP.... THUMP... THUMP... THUMP. I knew what was coming I had seen enough Godzilla movies to reconize the sound of giant footsteps. I stood there feeling the tremors grow stronger and stronger under my feet. A part of me wanted to wait and see who or what was coming another half wanted me to run like the devil was chaseing me. That part of me finally won  and I started running towards the wall as fast as I could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Incredibly loud booms got louder and louder, the floor shook more violently. I was slightly bouncing off the floor from the tremors, and suddenly stopped, I heard the sound of a door being unlocked I stopped to see the door knob turn and the door opened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suddenly remembered where I had seen 'Higher for Hire' Before.</span></div></div>",

Then came the other foot. Ash could feel the wooden planks give a little to her incredible weight. This time he couldn't help but stand and watch. He looked up at her face for a few seconds, her eyes focused straight ahead, and then back to her feet. That was another thing that was different about her, though the light and dark brown fur patches were still there they looked like actuall bear feet. and instead of walking around Bare Foot she wore leather sandals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she took a step, the heel of her back foot would rise, then her leg would swing forward. With a slap, the leather sole of her sandal would strike her foot as she lowered it. A dull, thundering boom accompanied each step.

Stupid, definetly. But a part of him was still thinking this whole thing was a dream and needed convinceing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took three more steps, getting closer with each step. Just as she was only one step away from him  a flaw in Ash's brilliant plan suddenly struck him: How the hell was he going to get on her foot? He couldn't climb the worn leather sandal fast enough, and he sure as hell couldn't jump high enough. As luck would have it, Rebecca soon solved the problem for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh looked straight up into the air she lifted her right foot. It rose just  above his body and stayed there for a few seconds. Then it she stomped her foot down so hard on the floor right beside him that he flew strait up into the air. The force was so great that it would have been about 5 feet in the air on his scale. Ash's body started to turn to left in mid air. He landed so hard  he saw stars. His body finished falling over and he landed flat on his back. He could do nothing but just lay there looking up at her as she walked to her desk.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was worked rather well\u2026\u201d Ash moaned as he watched her walk past him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ash slowly got up so as to make his rise less painful, then turned toward the desk. At her desk, Rebecca sat going through some paperwork. He was in awe and just gazed at her for a few moments. This was going to be harder than He thought. He couldn't just run up to her and start jumping around at her feet. That would only get him killed, and there was know way to know if she could even hear him anyway. On top of that she was so massive that she could step on him before he even had time to get out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Even from where he was sitting on the floor Ash could feel a tremor  each time she tapped her foot.  He would have to wait for the right time. Standing up and carefully makeing his way to  far wall, which is were he should've gone instead of trying that stunt, Ash sat on the floor and watched her every move.

When he finally left to reluctantly make is deliveries, Rebecca  rubbed her temples while slipping her sandals off her feet. From his position Ash could see  her toes wiggle and flex from under the desk. One of many differences he had noted from the cartoon this Rebecca had actual toes and feet like a real bear though her claws were nowhere near as long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That' feels better,\" she said sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh studied her closely. When he was younger Rebecca Cunningham was his first cartoon crush, now this flesh and blood version of the character was big enough to crush him. There was something else thought, something he couldn't put his finger on. Whatever it was, it compelled him to get closer. The idea would've normally scared the hell out of him. You don't try to get closer to Godzilla you run. Yet the desire was there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca stood up from behind her desk and padded into another room. What was in there Ash could only guess. Maybe it was the washroom. Despite the risks Ash took this opportunity to move to a closer position. Of course to do that  he would have to  walk back out into the  middle of the office. It wasn't something he wanted to do but it was that or stay where he was. And he was sure he could get to where he needed to go before Rebecca---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn't even completed the line of thought for at very moment he heard an enormous toilet flush. The bathroom door swung open and Rebecca stepped back out. With her sandals off, if could see more of Rebecca's footpads as she walked -- and rather than walking back to her desk, she was walking straight for him!<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\"Shit!

She walked over, sat down on her desk and answered the phone.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nAsh got back to my feet and walked into the very same spot where her foot rested. The floor was still warm under his feet and he could smell the sent of lotion and foot lingering in the air.

I couldn't keep hiding, after all, and if I was going to get squashed, I'd rather do it trying to do something, instead of just constantly running in fear for my life. So thinking, I ran towards the edge of her sandal, and looked at it. The thing was almost as tall as I was, and I'd never been in the best of shape, but I had to get up there. Luckily, Rebecca kept her foot still as I climbed onto her sandal, so I was able to get up without too much of a problem. Unluckily, as soon as I was up, she decided to move again, scooting her chair back, and tilting her foot up, causing me to go forward, and fall right between her toes, which closed around me, hard, the pressure of it feeling like it was going to pop my eyes out of my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca didn't stay scooted back for long though, and rolled her chair forward again, her foot becoming level, and letting me drop forward onto it. Woozy, and barely awake after that vice ride, I just flopped down onto my stomach, and lay there, rolling over after a moment or two, to look up and find she was still scooted away from the desk she'd been at, so I could now look right at the bottom of her face. Well, I could while it was still, as she suddenly started tapping her foot, and with the first backswing up it, I was sent flying, unable to scream as the wind was moving faster that my lungs could take in, so I flew a silent little bug, just to the side of her head, causing her to turn, but by the time she looked where I'd been, I was already past that point, and sailing straight towards the counter behind her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the counter, which I hadn't been able to see from the floor, were two items that would make for a soft landing, but neither looked rather pleasant. The first was a cup of coffee, still steaming, and looking rather hot, but still, softer than the wood around it. The other was an open sandwich, with one slice of bread sitting to the side, looking inviting, since it was softer, but covered with some kind of condiment that looked like it was probably sticky. Neither option was going to be fun, but deciding quickly, you aim yourself towards....</span></div></div>",

Instantly I regretted the choice, as the liquid in the cup was hot. Not scalding hot, or hot enough to peel my skin, but still plenty hot, and I let out a cry, that let the bitter stuff into my mouth, getting me into a coughing fit, that only made it harder to breath. Remembering something from an old swim class, I go limp in the water, trying not to move, as my body's natural buoyancy carries me upward, and with another splash, I breach the surface, and then sit up and take a big gulp of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene around me is one of walls. Not high ones mind, I wasn't that small, and the cup was pretty full, however, they were still higher than I could get out, and looking smooth, with no handholds, meaning I was kind of stuck. Thinking on my predicament, I felt a shudder pass through the cup, and looked upward to see Rebecca again, as she walked towards the counter, looking around. Obviously, for me, though she still likely wasn't sure what I was. Her hand was reaching down towards me, and I started to shout up towards her, but before I could cry out loudly, the cup suddenly shot upward, and I was plunged beneath the liquid again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time I made an effort not to breath in the coffee, and so was able to, after the movement upward stopped, and I was suddenly moving horizontally, and slammed hard into the wall of the cup. This still proved to be lucky, as I could use the wall to climb up through the liquid, and soon was out in the open again, looking up at Rebecca. In one had she was holding the cup, and staring into the sky, I could see she was holding the sandwich with the other, and I sighed in relief for not having picked that as my landing point, as she opened wide and tore a rather large chunk off it, chewing slowly, while looking around for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shouted up, and the cup rose, and for a moment, I thought she might have heard me. Then I noticed I was heading towards her mouth, and I shouted again, but was drowned out as the cup tilted the instant it got to her lips, and I was having to fight a swift moving current that was flowing forward, towards her maw. It was impossible of course, and soon I was moving towards her, and within second, decided to grab one of her teeth, since it was the only solid thing I could see. So I reached out, and wrapped my hand around it as I passed, trying to pull myself towards it.</span></div></div>",

Will you be okay here by yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh watched her walk out closeing the door behind her. Looking around he decided to kill some time by exploreing the top of the dresser.  Everything had so much detail, more so than what Rebecca would probably even notice. From the wood grain in the Dresser to the strans of rope like hair in her hair brush. He looked up at various bottles of perfume and other products that towered over him. Reading the lables he reconized none of the brand names. Becided them was a framed picture of a Bear with tanned fur. Ash wondered who it could be, but he suspected it was Molly's father. A character that was never mentioned in any of the episodes he remembered watching. Course, he had to remember that this wasn't a Saturday morning TV show he was on. This situation was very real, and his coffee stained clothes comfirmed that as well as the slight burn all over his body from being in that hot coffee. Pulling his shirt up to expose his stomach he could see the redness of his skin, but it didn't look that bad. He was thankfull it had cooled down a bit and even more thankfull that Rebecca hadn't swallowed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh looked over the edge of the dresser and saw a pair of fuzzy slippers next to a stool. The biggest pair he'd ever seen. They looked very comfortable too. Maybe when Rebecca came back he could suggest sleeping in one. If not, he could always go with a matchbox with cotten. As he walked away from the edge of the Dresser, he heard and felt someone coming. The door opened and--</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the door opened, you notice Rebecca came back with doll house. \"Molly was kind enough to let me use this. What are you?\" she asked as she lowered her head so she could hear you better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou answered, \"I'm a human, our worlds are very similar, but the technology is more advanced in mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I've read in the newspaper recently about Shere Kahn having some humans who are helping him. I wonder if he might have anything that could make communicating between us easier. It's not that's there anything wrong with how we communicate now, but it would be nice if I could hear you from across the room,\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am worried about the possibility that he might take me away from you and use me for his experiments. I do hope for a chance to save him so he'll repay the debt without trying to take me away from you,\" you explained your concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll have to look for an oportunity to throw him a rope when he needs one. On another note, I'm taking Molly to the toy store, but I'm also going to get you clothes and I am considering getting another doll house for you to stay in. I don't want to have to rely on borrowing my daughter's doll house all the time. Also, the washing machine in the apartment building is broken and won't be repaired until next week, so we'll be going to the laundromat, too,\" she changed the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you considered asking Wild Kat to fix it?\" you suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good idea,\" she complimented, \"but I get the feeling no one would take Wild Kat seriously as a mechanic because he doesn't give off the impression he's intelligent when he talks. I could talk to my landlord about that idea, though. Now that I think about it, that sounds a lot like an idea from... Could it be? You seem a lot like... Nah you couldn't be, could you?\" she started muttering to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something is wrong?\" you asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and Molly's father seem very much a like. Like you, he was smart and knew how to put me in a good mood,\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's not too much to ask, I'm curious about what happened to him,\" you told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't really shared this story with anyone because I wasn't sure I was strong enough to relive that day, but with you around, I actually feel like I can. Cape Susette may seem like a good place to live, but it's not crime-free. We went to the bank to set up a fund for Molly's future when she was just over a year old. We managed to get it set up and were just about to leave when some gangsters came in to rob that bank. One of them tried to shoot me, but he shielded me. That heroic act cost him his life. I have been trying to not let his death get me down because I know he wouldn't want that,\" she explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still have Molly, that's one thing to be thankful for. I guess you two were the world to him,\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right about both of those things. The more I talk you, the more I feel like his spirit lives on in you. I guess that's why I felt like I could tell you. Maybe it's fate that I got to meet you,\" she responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really think his spirit lives on in me?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen some unusual things lately, so I think it's very possible. I feel like this could be the second chance I was looking for, which is why I will protect you. I do want to find out how well a date between us will go and how well you get along with Molly at some time. If things go well, I might tell you his name and marry you,\" she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll just have to see what happens,\" you answered trying not to get ahead of yourself at the thought of that possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want, I could put another pillow on the other side of the bed or arrange something else if you want to sleep in the same bed with me tonight,\" she offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou answered, \"I noticed your slippers earlier and thought about sleeping in one of them for the night, but I guess I will </span></div></div>",

A few seconds later, you could hear water running, and then you start to think about things. How she lost her husband and had to raise Molly alone. You don't remember the name of any bank in the cartoon series, so you imagine Cape Suzette only has one bank. You try to think of characters from the show who might have killed him. Trader Moe is the main one who comes to mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were thinking, you heard the door handles and the water still running. You were pretty sure it was Molly and decided to remain still and act like a doll until Rebecca returns. \"Mommy said she brought a friend home today. I don't see anyone here. I thought I heard her talking to someone in here,\" she said upon entering her mother's room. She turns her eyes toward you and curiously asks, \"Where did she get that doll? Did someone give it to her? What is it? Is this why she asked for the doll house? Did she get it for me and wanted to surprise me?\" Being only four years old, she had plenty of questions to ask when she saw you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for her, her mother returned not long after she entered her room. You noticed she had a pillow and was wearing a lovely pink bathrobe. Molly asked her questions to her mother as she placed the pillow next to hers. Rebecca turned towards her daughter and answered, \"I found the 'doll' while I was at work today, but he's not really a doll. His name is Ash. He's a human from another world. I asked you for the doll house to provide him with a place to stay for tonight, but I came up with another solution, so you may take it back to your room if you want. I was originally planning to keep his a pet, but I'm starting to think he might be more than that.\" She places her paw out and you walk on it. Then she lowers her paw to introduce you to Molly, \"Molly, this is my new friend Ash. Ash, this is my daughter Molly.\" You stick your hand out as Molly stuck her index finger out. You shaked it saying, \"Hello, nice to me you.\" She giggles then says, \"He's cute.\" \"I'm happy you like him. I'll let you hold him while I carry your doll house back to your room if he doesn't mind,\" Rebecca offered. \"I don't mind,\" you reply. Molly picks you and places you on her shoulder as her mother picks up the doll house again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm wondering, does Danger Woman exist in your world, too?\" she asked as the three of you were headed to her room. \"Well, not exactly. There are a few female heroes who you might like. If my theory about what Mr. Shere Kahn is up to is right, there is a chance you might be able to see them yourself,\" you answer. \"What do you mean?\" Molly asked with curiosity. \"If what your mother said was true, I get the feeling he might be wanting to see if my world's technology and stories will be just as popular in this world,\" you replied. \"I hope it is, I really want to know more about your world!\" exclaimed Molly as she opened her bedroom door. You noticed she has put all her toys away neatly, most likely because Rebecca has taught her that behavior or Kit cleaned it up for her. As Rebecca placed the doll house in the corner of the room, Molly asked her, \"Mommy, is okay if Ash sleeps in here tonight?\" \"I think it's best if we let him decide,\" she answered. You thought about this question. You felt sorry for Rebecca's loss, but you also thought about Molly wanting to play with you as a pet/doll and how she wants to know more about your world. Maybe you could tell her about Samus Aran, the intergalactic bounty hunter who fights pirates if you two got up early enough. After you have had a few seconds to think about it, you decide to stay the night with...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That answer was what you needed to stop trying to cover up. She brings you up to face to get a better look at you. \"Even though size isn't everything, I am curious about what you would look like if you were closer to my size. You don't look half bad. It would be nice if you manage to grow to my size sometime, but even if you don't, I'll still love you for who you are and not your size,\" she explains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means a lot. So where should we start? Also, do you have any ideas on what to tell Molly if she wakes up and catches us? I wouldn't want her to try the same thing if things go quite well otherwise,\" you asked with concern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I could use a foot massage, but you may explore my body if you want to do that instead. Or maybe one then the other. As for Molly, I'll just make something up. I actually can come up with some pretty creative ideas,\" she answers as she puts you on her knee, which allows you to decide where you want to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking at the clock she added \"If we leave now we can get the early show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That reminds me, how are you going to get me into the theater? Carrying me might draw attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got that covered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca held up a crystal locket for Ash to see. \"I have This locket you can ride in. It's see through so you'll be able to watch the movie and there are holes in it so you'll be able to breath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in the locket, Ash watched the film unfold. He hated not watching a movie without popcorn. A movie experience just isn't the same without Popcorn, but being in a dark room he didn't want to risk being accidentally eaten.Even if Rebecca put a kernel on her lap, he would never be able to see the movie. As the monster made his first appearance Ash had to admit the actor who played the monster wasn't that bad. He was no Boris Karloff but he did a really good job. He also liked how this film was nothing like the Karloff movie so it was a fresh experience for him. It was cool watching a film on a screen that put the ones used in IMAX to shame. He felt eyes on him, sometimes it was Baloo giving him a glance and sometimes it was Kit.He could understand why, after all he was an alien of sorts. There was a Yelp .The locket shifted as Rebecca jumped as the monster appeared out of nowhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't this great Baloo?\" whispered Kit. Ash looked over at the big bear. As he expected to see Baloo was crouched down under the seats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not scared, are yeah Papa Bear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, n-No.\" said Baloo. \"I just uh, uh, dropped a nickle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKit Laughed \"Ah, you big baby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far the scene had been playing out exactly like the episode. Now if his suspicions were correct, Molly would be leaving right about now. Turning his head to the right and looking past the fabric of Rebecca's coat he looked over to where Molly was sitting.</span></div></div>",

First, you knew Molly wouldn't like the experience. Second, you knew Rebecca would be worried sick if anything happened to her. You would be doing them both a favor if you could help them avoid it. You couldn't chase her down because of your size, which meant you had to plan to keep her busy. You remember Baloo wasn't really going to be of any help to Rebecca when she assigned him to help her with paperwork, you could ask him to help keep an eye on her and keep her busy. He might be inclined to help. You could also ask Kit to help too. If all else failed, you could try telling her a story yourself. You didn't want to alarm Rebecca to this possibility if you could avoid it. You wondered where Wildcat was at during the episode, you knew that the more help you can get with keeping her mind off that place, the better. You pondered what you could possibly do to keep her busy if it came to that for a while. You stopped trying to plan this out when Rebecca asked everyone what they thought about it back in the lobby. Molly and Kit enjoyed it, Baloo claimed he just wasn't able to watch it. When she took the locket off to ask you, she noticed you were deep in thought. \"What's wrong, Ash?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I please speak with Baloo alone?\" you ask. She hands you over to Baloo and then walks towards a corner with Molly. \"I need your help with something,\" you explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're wanting my advice on Becky, I am afraid I have nothing to offer,\" he replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's more like I'm concerned about Molly. I had a sense of Deja vu when I found out we were headed here. It grew stronger when I heard the name of the movie. I was worrying about the possibility of her running off during the movie. I feel we lucky this time, but something she said leaves me to believe that it's not over yet,\" you explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll be fine,\" Baloo tries to reassure you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't the first time she's done something like this, is it?\" you asked. Baloo starts to think about it and remembers a few incidents like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's happened before. Doesn't mean it could happen again any time soon,\" Baloo replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A child's curiosity can lead to trouble. I get the feeling she might see something that looks like it was from that movie that will set it off in the near future. However, it might be a possible to keep this problem contained. If you, Kit, and I can keep her busy long enough when it is about to happen, we can keep her safe. If you can get Wildcat involved, it might help the odds. Besides, it could be a good excuse to get out of paperwork in the near future,\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's say you're right, how will we know know when it is going to happen?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I am correct, her reason for running off is doesn't think anyone's paying attention to her. Of course, part of it is because things will probably be busy at the time with regards to important paperwork being done at Higher for Hire. I think it was something about taxes, but I can't remember the details about it offhand. However, I am sure the trigger will be a building she sees outside the window,\" you answer. You were hoping Baloo would help you, but you would let Rebecca know if he didn't help. You figured that she might at least take this possible problem seriously.</span></div></div>",

A few ideas came to your head. You knew she liked Danger Woman, so you figured she might enjoy hearing one of the Metroid stories. Samus Aran fighting pirates in the Metroid series might be something she would enjoy, and Metroid Prime might be a good place to start. You also thought that maybe something from the Sonic the Hedgehog series could make her not worry about what's going on there as much. The thought of the hyperactive hedgehog and his friends fighting Dr. Robotnik/Eggman might be enough to make her think that there is probably someone else out there making sure that any \"evil plots\" that the \"mad doctor\" might have are being foiled while you speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Molly approached you, she seemed a little upset that Kit hadn't taken her seriously, complaining about how she believed it was because she's \"small.\" You reply to her, \"At least you're not me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking about it for a few seconds, she says, \"I never thought about it like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now you realize how lucky you are.

The story is called Metroid Prime,\" you answered. \"Is that her name? What does she look like?\" Molly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, her name is Samus Aran, but her enemies call her the Hunter. She wears an orange suit of armor with a cannon for one arm. The suit can be upgraded with a variety of equipment. Metroid Prime is the first of a three part saga. Metroid Prime 2: Echoes and Metroid Prime 3: Corruption.  As for the name, its the name of one the most dangerous creatures she had to fight.\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes it so dangerous? Also, does Samus have a plane?\" Molly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Metroids are these things that resemble floating jellyfish that drain the life force of the victims they latch onto. The pirates try to use them as weapons, but they can't seem to control them. They also can't seem to figure out how they do it since their are no signs of injury. Surprisingly, metroids do have some beneficial capabilities like healing people who are hurt. As for her plane, well she does have a gunship, which is something like a plane. It was given to her by this race of people with highly advanced technology that took her in after her parents were killed by the pirates and trained her as a warrior. They also gave her the suit she has. As for the what the gunship can do, it can heal her along with traveling to other world. However, there's only room for one person inside it,\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing you bring that up, Kit seemed to have gained interest in the story and listen in. You imagined this might have been because he was an orphan who Baloo took in. In addition, he had a few dealings with pirates. Plus, he does have ambition to be a pilot. You figured that Samus actually fighting pirates was the icing on the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started the actual story with Samus boarding the pirates' over world base. You mentioned that there was an incident that left most of the surviving pirates injured before Samus arrived, which explained why they had trouble attacking her. You bring up the fight between Samus and this huge bug that was protected by a rotating shield. The base crashing and the confrontation between Samus and Riddley, who damaged most of her equipment while she was going through shafts to get back to her \"plane\" was the next part of the story you got to.

But that evening they were all at Higher for Hire. At the last minute Rebecca had remembered that there was some last minute inventory to be done, and it simply couldn't wait until tomorrow. Storm clouds could be scene developing all day, and as Ash sat in  Rebecca's locket a flash of lightning lit up the sky. Baloo as usual had conked out an Rebecca's desk, the account book on his chest. Ash thought to himself that Baloo really needed to go to bed earlier than his usual bedtime. Which he speculated was probably around four in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baloo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh Wha--?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to finish the inventory!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am, I am!\" Baloo insisted holding the book to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The account book is upside down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, creative accounting!\" replied the Big Bear.<br>\r\nShaking her head, Rebecca undid the locket  from around her neck and opened it up so Ash could stretch his legs on her desk. There was a whirring sound as one of Kit's whined up toys flew over head. At least he found a way to spend the time. Ash felt like a fifth wheel. He looked up at the stairs where Molly was staring out the window at the storm. He suspected he wasn't the only one who was feeling too small. That's how she was going to get into trouble, Something about that window was familiar. Ash couldn't quite put a finger on it though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another flash of lighting, Molly swatted annoyingly at Kit's toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" said Kit \"Watch it short stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, that's really going to make her feel better.'Ash thought. Then Ash noticed the same thing that Kit was now noticing. Another Flash of lightning lite up a building just behind Higher for Hire. Dr. Diablo's Lab. That's what was so Familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's someone in that building.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" said Kit. \"It's deserted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How very wrong you are Kit.' thought Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, uh. I bet the Mad Doctor lives there.\" said Molly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's not far from the truth.' Ash was really getting worried, but trying his best not to show it. Which wasn't hard considering no one was paying any attention to him at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I got the Sea Duck in my back pocket.\" said Kit, using the handle of a broom to retrieve his toy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What back pocket? You're not even wearing pants.' Thought Ash. Maybe it was a Figure of speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly sighed \"When you're little no one ever listens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis Ash knew a whole hell of a lot about. He felt sorry for Molly, it was no wonder the kid was restless what with the lack of attention from the adults. Then again, being a single parent couldn't be easy for Rebecca. He wondered how she'd be able to manage without Baloo or Kit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy! The Mad Doctor's out there! We should go see what he's Doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now, dear.\" said Rebecca looking through a stack of papers \"I have work to do and you're too small to go alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I'm not,\" the cub insisted \"I can--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly.\" Rebecca was using her Mother Voice \"I said No. besides, its going to rain Pumpkin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's not going to stop her' Ash knew Molly had a stubborn streak in her, a hereditary trait from her mother no doubt. Not to mention a strong imagination and a desire for adventure. Maybe, she'd grow up to be a treasure hunter or something. Well, it could happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Rebecca.\" said Ash. \"I sorta feel like I'm in the way, maybe I should hang out with Molly for a bit. Keep her occupied.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, if you don't feel it's too much trouble.\" said Rebecca as Ash climbed up into her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, it's no trouble at all.\" said Ash. Then thought to himself 'That might come later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly, be careful with Ash. Don't Hurt him.\" Rebecca told her young daughter as she deposited the micro human into her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Molly, What do you want to do?\" Ash Asked, then thought that was a very poor choice of words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy said I can't go out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

As you watched the movie you noticed there were a number of changes to reflect the way things were at the time. Among the changes were: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.)The lawyer was a role model to the child and a close friend to the his mother who was a widow, but wasn't being a good role model and having some strains on their friendship lately (a write around to avoid divorce)<br>\r\n2.)The pen scene (no way to tell the color, so they went with the brand of the pen instead, this meant that the brand of the pen was written on his face instead of the word \"blue\"), <br>\r\n3.)The court case was about a young baseball player accused of breaking into a bank after hours to empty the vault over financial troubles which were brought on by bad choices. (This did insure the court case still had some symbolism, even when combined with other changes to the movie) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty much everything that would have been unacceptable or impossible to pull off was edited so it would be the same movie, but set in 1940's. It did live up to the original and was just as funny, too. This did leave you wondering what was going on, since the movie was about 10 years old from your time. However, you just decided to write it off as a coincidence. For all you knew, the writer could have had a role model go bad and felt kind of betrayed by it. If that was the case, the script could have been a way of making fun of bad role models. However, you wondered if this might have caused the others to stop and think about things like being a role model.</span></div></div>",

She agreed though a bit disappointed, but she also understood his tiredness. Ash removed his shoes, socks and shirt but left his sweat pants on as he did need something to sleep in after all. He looked over his burns, the redness had gone down quite a bit since the last time he'd checked earlier that evening. Climbing into her hand, Rebecca carried Ash to her bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had two pillows, Ash chose to sleep on one while Rebecca would use the other. Removing her Robe Rebecca climbed into bed Her head resting next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night Ash.\" she said with a pleasant smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh returned the smile \"Good night, Rebecca\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after the lights were turned off Ash remained wide awake and looking up at the ceiling. He had a lot on his mind. Was it possible for him to be the Reincarnated form of Rebecca's husband? Though he believed in the spirit world, was it possible for a spirit to travel multiple cross dimensions from this world to his? That would be something his teacher Raymond Stanz would know more about than himself. But it seemed to be more than coincidental that he appear just outside of Higher for Hire. Even the smell of Rebecca's hair was familiar to him now that he thought of it. If he were her husband in a past life, he had no memories of it. Suddenly something heavy fell landed on top of him. It startled him at first until he realized it was the tip of Rebecca's index finger. In the gloom of the bedroom he could see she was asleep, rapid eye movement told him she was dreaming and had reached up and touched him.  Her touch was gentle, and she ran the tip of her finger over him for a moment or two and the finger moved to one side and rested next to him. <br>\r\nTry as he might after that Ash couldn't sleep. Maybe he should've took  Rebecca's offer after all. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You decided you should at least check it out, so you got out of bed and left Rebecca's room. It was rather dark, but you could see someone was there. It was too tall to be Molly. The person who was there turned on the lights and you saw who it was: the bear from the picture. You wondered what was going on. \"Come here, young lad. We need to talk,\" he said as held out his hand on the floor for you to climb onto. He then lifted you up and said, \"I've been looking out for my wife and daughter since I died. I've been taking a backseat approach, though. One of the guys she dated was just using her, so I actually gave Molly a subtle hint to not trust him. I wanted them to move on and yet still protect them at the same time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not trying to sound rude, but why are you telling me this?\" you asked with curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been wanting to find a worthy individual to protect them so I can finally move on. Someone who seemed enough like me that she'd believe was me. I couldn't find anyone close enough to replace me in this world, so I decided to look in other realities. That's why I brought you here. I was hoping I could show you what happened that day through a dream and give you my memories to make you and her both believe you're me. I have given you a few of my memories, but I guess I can't fool you now, though,\" he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure Rebecca might want to know about this,\" you suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, she might, but I want her to be able to move on to a better future and not live in the past wishing I was still alive. That's why I didn't want anyone to know. I guess I can still give you some psychic powers that I managed to acquire as a ghost and my past memories. Right now, I only have Telekinesis, Telepathy, and Levitation, but you might be able to learn more that will allow you and them to become harder to kill over time. You'll know you've learned a new power if you feel dizzy very briefly. I might not be able to do anything about your size, but I can at least offer you something to help you out. There might be someone in this world who can help with that, but I have no clue where to look. Now let's get things started,\" he said. He snapped his fingers and you felt a little dizzy for bit, but feel fine a second later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I guess you want me to use these powers to protect them.\" you say using your new telepathy ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I do. While I'd rather that they don't know about what I've been doing, I won't stop you if you do decide to tell them about me, but you might want to use my memories to convince Rebecca that she should be with you. She hasn't told you everything about me, so feel free to use things that only she and I would know from my memories as my blessing. Also, if you are wondering, yes, I was at Higher for Hire earlier today. I was hoping to guide her to you. Anyway, I plan to watch what happens from here on out, but I will not hesitate to step in to help you if you need it. Just use your telepathy to contact me and I'll see what I can do,\" he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do everything I can think of to protect them,\" you promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then goes to Molly's room and whispers in her ear, \"Sleep tight, my little angle. I'll be watching over you from a distance.\" He then goes to Rebecca's room and places you on the pillow and kisses her on the cheek. He turns to you and says, \"I'm counting on you,\" as he fades away. After a few minutes, you fell asleep debating on whether you should tell Rebecca about her guardian angel or just pretend to be him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, you make your decision as soon as you wake up.</span></div></div>",

But I do feel uncomfortable about one thing though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spirit raised an eyebrow \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have a feeling there's going to be a point where we might become...intimate.

Something that attacks anything it sees is really something to get rid of as fast as possible,\" Molly replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that still leaves three questions. How did they get here from your world? Why Khan Industries? And what did they give him?\" Rebecca responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not how I got here, but I know they have something that acts as a gateway between worlds. It's known as SCP-826. I'm guessing the reason why they made a deal with Khan is because he can finance such a effort. As for what they gave him, I'm pretty confident it's a computer. I don't know how to describe the device to you, but I do know how to use it. I could help you use it if you think it will help you make a deal with him,\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's worth a shot,\" she says as she places you on her ear. as she and Molly approach the tiger.</span></div></div>",

While doing this, you realize that you might have some limited control over things this way, but you wish could interact with things more directly.

As she did that, you leaped onto her head in hopes of helping them both. After landing, you inform Molly, \"I'm glad your here. I can't wake her by myself, but I think I know why she's sleeping. With your help, we might be able to do that.\" \"Who are you? Where are you?\" she started asking questions. \"My name is Ash. I'll show myself to you,\" you replied. You walk onto her nose, and she focuses her eyes on you. \"You're kind of cute. I might ask mommy if I can keep you as a pet instead of buying one once we wake her up,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but how do you plan to wake her up?\" you asked. Molly answered, \"She told me a fairytale about a princess who fell asleep and was awaken by the kiss of a prince.

You will need to know a few things: What's happened to your mother, where we are at, and what might have caused it. The answers are she fell asleep suddenly and you can't wake her up, we're at the Higher For Hire office, and there might have been something in her sandwich and coffee.\" you inform her. \"Okay, I got it.

Molly did as you told her and called for medical assistance. The ambulance got there in about five minutes. The paramedics took a sample of the coffee and bagged the sandwich so they can figure out what caused her to suddenly fall asleep. \"Even if the coffee was decaf, it wouldn't make sense for her to fall asleep like that,\" you informed Molly while they were doing that. One of the paramedics came up to Molly and offered to take her to the hospital with her mother. Molly accepted the ride and all of you were in the ambulance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSirens gave you a headache before, but they were torture to you this time. The reason was because you were in the vehicle making all the noise. While it only took five minutes to arrive at the hospital, those five minutes of thunderous ambulance sirens really did a number on your head. As all of you entered the hospital, you had a feeling your head was about to explode if you had to endure any more loud noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiting room was empty when you arrived, which meant that Rebecca would be getting treatment faster. It also gave you time to recover from your headache. After about 15 minutes, Molly starts to get curious about you. \"I've never seen anything like you before. What are you?\" she asked curiously. \"I'm called a 'human',\" you answered. \"Are there more humans around Higher for Hire?\" she asked. \"There might be others, but I haven't found any yet,\" you replied. \"How about we try looking for some more later?\" she suggested. \"If you want to, I'll help you find them,\" you offered. \"Great, I'll ask Kit if he wants to join us!\" Molly said with excitement. A second after she said that, Kit came in. \"I came from Higher for Hire. Wild Kat told me about what happened. He heard it from one of the paramedics. I suggested we set a trap for Don Karnage and his goons. It took a while, but we got it done. He stayed behind to watch over the place. We've also told Baloo what happened. I expect he'll be here soon,\" Kit explained. \"Baloo's coming back soon!?\" Molly repeated with excitement. \"Yes, he's returning. He's stopping by Louie's to bring you back a banana split as a reward for knowing when something didn't seem quite right and taking action to fix it. He's getting something for your mom, too. He also offered to take you to the pet shop since you wouldn't get to go today if he didn't,\" Kit told her. \"I'm not worried about that, I already found a pet at Higher for Hire,\" Molly responded. \"Really? What is it?\" Kit asked. Molly shows you to Kit. \"WOW! I've never seen a pet like that before,\" exclaimed Kit. \"His name is Ash. He's a human. Ash, this is my friend Kit,\" said Molly. You shake Kit's right index finger. \"When I came in, you mentioned you wanted to ask me to join you in something. What was it?\" Kit asked before forgot. \"I was wondering if you might want to help me find more humans around Higher for Hire sometime,\" Molly suggested. \"Sounds like it could be fun,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a minute later, a nurse came out from the hallway. Since things were still rather quiet, she just spoke in a soft voice, \"Molly, your mom is going to be just fine. She's awake and wants to see you.\" Molly and Kit follow the nurse through the hallways. She explained things to all of you, \"There were two chemicals that interacted with each other in her stomach. One in her coffee, while the other was in her sandwich. They created a rather powerful fume that put her to sleep and enough of it to keep her asleep for five hours if you hadn't called us. We gave a special anti-acid to counter it and help her belch the chemicals out. They are all out now, but the anti-acid still has her belching,\" she explained as she escorted you to room 117, where the three of you saw Rebecca. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly, I'm sorry...\" Rebecca began, but was interrupted by the anti-acid and belched, \"excuse me. It seems we won't be going to the pet store today.\" \"That's okay, I found one at Higher for Hire when I was trying to ask you about taking me there later. I originally thought to wake you up with kiss from him similar to that fairytale, but after it didn't work, he suggested I call the hospital and helped me to do that,\" Molly explained. \"Your pet helped you do that?!\" Rebecca asked with a hint of surprise. Molly hands you to her mom and says, \"Yes, he did. His name's Ash. Mommy, can I keep him, please?\" Molly asked politely. \"Yes, you can,\" she answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Baloo enters. You wonder if Rebecca would like a chance to talk to you in private without the others and ask Baloo to watch over them for a few minutes or if she'll allow them all to stay.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

May I have some time alone with him?\" Rebecca requested. \"Of course, but before I forget,\" Baloo began. He place a thermos, a bowl, and a spoon in front of her, then continued, \"I got this from Louie's. After I heard you were sick, I thought I'd ask Louie for something for you.

She starts to blush as she asks, \"Do you really think I'm beautiful?\" You nod your head. \"I was just about to ask why you helped me. Was that why?\" she asked. \"Part of the reason. I couldn't let Molly see you like that and worry about you,\" you answer. \"How about a date with me? I know it might not a typical date, but would you like to eat this soup with me?\" she asked. You nodded again. She opens the thermos and pours the soup into the bowl.</span></div></div>",

And it was quite effective in holding me in place. Lifting myself up as much as I could, I looked about and saw that I wasn\u2019t that far from the edge. It would be slow going but I was pretty sure I could make it to edge and get off before---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t even get the chance to finish that thought.

The fine wood grain of the desk seeming was nearly flat, even at his miniscule perspective, showing its craftsmanship. Worse, she had no phone or lamp on it, to have a cord for power that he might climb, the desk being right against a window that provided plenty of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaced with these obstacles, the human resorted to crying out to her, knowing her name because, despite her size, he recognized that face, one Rebecca Cunningham. Try though he might, however, waving his arms, screaming at the top of his lungs, his voice just didn\u2019t have the punch to reach her ears far above him, and defeated, Ash started to look around for something to help his cause of getting noticed by the giant bear woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, his only ideas were to start a fire, dangerous at his size, because if it got noticed, the first thing anyone would do was to stomp it out, and because if it didn\u2019t get noticed, no one was likely going to come back to rescue him from the inferno of his own making. That and he had nothing on him to make such a blaze with anyway. The other plan, of just shining a light, was similarly flawed, having no flashlight or the like on him at the time. All he had was a t-shirt, and some blue jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDejectedly, Ash decided to just explore for now. Getting noticed would have to wait till he had more information, and so he set out across the floor of the room he was in. It was, despite seeming large to him at his size, actually just a closeted away space, large enough for the desk below the window, and a small filing cabinet, but little else. Worse, the door was closed, and his stature was not quite small enough to fit beneath it, meaning that until Rebecca left the room, he was trapped her with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was, as he turned back towards the desk, that he noticed a pair of sandals sitting beside it. They were a shade of pink that, rather than being exactly like the suit\u2019s jacket she wore, were instead a shade or two lighter, complimenting rather than simply being the same as her clothing. The human knew little of fashion, but it seemed to be an interesting choice, </span></div></div>",

Of course, those few minutes, as Ash soon found out, were up. His first hint of that was a loud squeak sound, and he turned his head to find the ursine woman stretching as she pushed her chair away from the desk. His second was that her foot soon filled his sky, her pad coming directly towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne might call him silly for not leaping off the sandal, or otherwise trying to escape, but really, it was more, he was a deer caught in the headlights. His brain found it impossible to process that image, of a giant paw falling towards him at speeds that made sound look slow. So he was just standing there when it slammed heavily into him, his body forced down into the plastic, roughly, but not so rough that he was broken was one might expect of such an impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh found himself trapped, as Rebecca shifted her foot forward, his body sliding along the smooth plastic of her sole, and ending up almost dead centre of her front footpad. This meant that, as she walked, the sandal didn\u2019t let him go, and instead, he felt a sickening rising, and stomach-dropping fall, followed by massive pressure, with every step the businesswoman took. Trapped as he was, unable to even move, and barely able to breath, he had to look forward to hours pinned beneath her foot. Not that it was entirely unpleasant though, and he figured you really could get used to anything. Heck, at the end, she might even notice him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That was no problem for her of course, as she\u2019d been working in this office for years, and was used to it. The human trapped beneath her padded sole found the ride a bit less pleasant. Not entirely unpleasant though, considering he was having his stomach go up and down with each rise and fall of her foot, but then found himself surrounded by softness, her pad conforming around him, almost like a hug that was covering his whole body, as she walked downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sharp rises and falls soon ended, and Ash found the ride to be less bumpy as Rebecca made it to the ground floor, and began to walk towards the big double doors. Stuck between her pad and sandal, Ash only got brief glimpses of the world outside, little flashes of light, that then vanished as he was pressed against the pad, and then smushed between it and the sandal, the two soft surfaces sandwiching him between them, making him feel like he was safe, for some reason, before he was rising again, and got another flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw only a few snap shots of the world, a business center, it had to be, one of those places where small business owners rented tiny offices to help with their start-ups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride stopped for a moment, and Ash was allowed to breath, his lungs, though squashed between a giant bear lady and her footwear, were able to catch a breathe now, as he heard her melodious voice from above, trading pleasantries with some gruff voiced male that he couldn\u2019t see. Neither was intelligible through Rebecca\u2019s foot, though he heard her laugh, a rather calming sound, just before the ride started up again, and he found himself flattened against her sandal, before slamming into her pad, and then pressed down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis repeated until he was outside, the cool air that came between her paw and sandal making him feel cold as it blew against him, and made him all the more grateful that he was where he was, her paw smashing him down and covering him, keeping him warm against the chill as she walked. It was almost relaxing, really, now that he thought about it. This would make a great ride at some carnival, and he wondered if there was something like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon he stopped again, and heard the loud clack as something metallic moved over head, followed by her foot rising again. Ash got the impression of a vehicle, like a car or truck, before he was smashed down into the sandal once more, as Rebecca took the driver\u2019s seat, and then started her ride. The roar of the engine vibrated through the human, his body rubbing against the padded sole, almost like a gentle massage, and making him \"mmm\" with pleasure at the feeling as he lay there, unnoticed beneath her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As the car started to move, Ash felt her foot shift. At first, he thought it make be her using the foot he was on to work the pedals, but the pressure from above shifted to often for that, the pad scrunching up around him, picking him up off the sandal and holding him completely in the soft, folded flesh of it, before letting him go again, his body pressed against the sandal. It took him a few times of this to figure it out. She felt him, and probably without thinking about it, was moving her foot around him. He was trapped in some massive game of footsie with her, and oddly, he liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride continued as Rebecca made her way through the traffic, her foot pressing down against him, and then picking him up, her voice a soft humming sometimes as she wondered what it was that she felt, but then just ignoring it. It wasn\u2019t important after all, and it did feel good where it was, as she ran her foot over it, rubbing it into the sandal, and rolling it around her pad. It felt very good indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh felt his body roll with the pad, the motion against the sandal a slight pinch, but not more painful than that, allowing him to enjoy the heat coming off her paw as it flowed into him. It really was like he was being embraced by her, and he was enjoying it a lot now, as she played with him, pulling him this way and that, and then pressing him down into the sandal, her \"mmm\" of pleasure mimicking his own, before her paw finally settled, and she turned the motor off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother few clicks, and Rebecca exited her car, her foot pressing him into the sandal as she rose from where she\u2019d been sitting, and then stretched a bit, putting all her weight on her foot. That weight was massive too, and for a moment Ash thought it might make him pop like a grape. It didn\u2019t however, and after a few moments, she stretched her arms upward, and then felt the great popping sensation as the little knots in her back worked themselves loose, and she was able to start forward again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath her, Ash was still recovering from the pressure of her entire body on his. It had been, oddly arousing, to be that dominated by her. Her whole body focused on him, without her even knowing about it. He tried to move now, squirming and wriggling, either to get her attention, or just to work himself free, the former not working, but the latter achieved, just in time to get stomped by her ankle as she moved, the back of her foot coming down on him hard, and making him stuck to it. Where it was Rebecca was going, it seemed Ash would be along for the whole ride, not that he minded much.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Through a window he could see that it was nearing evening and through the faded light he watched her walking away, catching glimpses of the padded soles that he'd enjoyed. He was surprised that he wanted more of that feeling of soft bumpy sole against his body. Rebecca was quite attractive, for her species. And like all females of reproduction age she was producing pheromones as her body's way of attracting a mate. These pheromones ,unknown to the micro human, had a rather potent effect on Ash. He'd been under her foot, surrounded by pheromone producing glands and her foot play with him gave him such feelings of arousal that it almost effected his judgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost. Even though he wanted to be close to her again, he knew there would be a time and a place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing off the sandal into carpet fibers that were just over his head in height, he trekked forward in the direction Rebecca went.

He didn't stay stuck for long though as he fell back to the sandal.  He didn't have time to relax as Rebecca began to stand up again. Ash had just enough time to scurry away from her heel and under what little arch the bearess had before her foot became his world once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope Molly wasn't too much trouble Kit.\" said Rebecca as she reached into her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, she was okay Miz Cunningham.\" said Kit accepting his babysitter fee. \"I think I'm getting better at keeping up with her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca began to walk again. Where she was going Ash had no way of knowing. He could hear her talking to someone young, he guessed it was her daughter Molly. She stopped a few times and through the mountain of sole above him he was able to make out a few words. \"You go.\" \"enjoy\" \"work to do\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen more walking. Finally she stopped, the weight lifted slightly ,Ash could only guess she was sitting down. Closing his eyes he breathed in the smells around him. Why did he find them so attractive? Perhaps it was the pheromones being produced. Whatever the reason he wasn't complaining.  He ran his hand over the sole above him, the texture felt bumpy but soft. Suddenly he felt the muscle under the sole twitch, then the foot began to slide backward until he was directly under her toes. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This proved to be dangerous for Ash as Rebecca's enormous body weight began to bear down on him, her soft instep pad pressed down all around him making breathing impossible. He felt his limbs go numb as the blood flow was cut off, he thought for sure his last moment of existence had come. Then the weight eased off as Rebecca's foot began to slide out of the sandal. A sigh of relief escaped his lips until a toe slid over him it pressed him into the sole of the sandal, rubbing him all over and pushing the air from his lungs. Unable to breath he quickly passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? What's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toe was gone only to be replaced by a huge thumb and forefinger moments later. Ash was aware of nothing as the tips of the two digits grasped him and lifted him upward toward Rebecca's face. Limp and unconscious he was brought closer to those dark brown eyes that studied him curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it? A Toy?\" Rebecca asked herself \"I've never seen one so small. I've never seen Kit with it, and I know I didn't buy this for Molly. I wonder how it got in my sandal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca placed the toy in the palm of her hand so she could examine it better. For its size it was very detailed, but a bit funny looking. What kind of creature was it suppose to be? Alien maybe? She carefully touched it with the tip of her finger, it felt like it was made from a soft rubber but it also seemed to have hard parts as well. And it felt warm, probably from being under her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have things to do.\" said Rebecca finally \"I don't have time for toys, I think I'll give it to...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So he remained silent as Kit examined him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Where did this toy come from?' he thought as he looked it over. It was so small, and yet highly detailed. It had clothes. Who could make clothes that small? How did they do it? He rolled it carefully between his thumb and finder as to not break it. It didn't even feel like any toy he'd ever owned. Granted he hadn't had many in his life but it still didn't feel like any of the toys he'd handled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now I know what it's like to be toyed by a Bear.' Ash though. Being rolled between thumb and finger wasn't painful but it wasn't comfortable either. Fortunately, it didn't last long as he found himself deposited into the pocket of the cub's sweater. He didn't even know the sweater had pockets. Finally able to movie, Ash looked about his new accommodations. Not much to look at. A bubble gum still in it's rapper. Some coins, and a bit of lint. Kit began to walk. Out side the pocket the world was moving fast and the wide palm of the hand swung back and forth. Ash carefully considered is options.</span></div></div>",

With all these giant buildings Ash could only assume that someone very big was coming. It suddenly grew dark as a shadow fell over him. Turning around Ash looked up over the grass line. At first he saw nothing, then a tuff of brown hair and a baseball cap turned backwards then a face came into view. He soon found himself self looking up at the last creature he thought to see when he woke up this morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKit Cloudkicker was strolling towards Higher for Hire, the grass felt pleasantly cool under his feet. Normally on a day like today he and Baloo would be making deliveries for the boss lady but she had given them both the day off, as it had been a slack week. With Baloo over at Louie\u2019s Kit decided to have a bit of time by himself. He was totally unaware of the human only a few steps in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n``Holy Shit\u2026.``<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was as bout the only thing Ash could think off saying. What else was there to say? There was a giant flesh and blood version of Kit Cloudkicker from Tailspin, right down to the ball cap sitting on top of his head. Though from what  could be seen each time Kit lifted a foot to take a step, his feet were more bear like than what they were in the show. Ash quickly realized he should\u2019ve been running instead of looking at those feet because in less than two steps they were bearing down on top of him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh reflexively  threw his hands up as if to hold back the tons of flesh that was hovering over his head. His eyes were closed. There was no point in looking; Ash knew he was about to become a smear on the ground. The earth shook violently and he was thrown off his feet. Coughing up some dust Ash opened his eyes. To my amazement and relief he saw that Kit had decided to sit down, his back resting up against the side of the building and his two huge feet propped up right in front of him. Dirt and other debris rained down around Ash as the cub wiggled his toes and scrunched his feet up.Sighing contently Kit removed his had placeing it beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was only then that Ash noticed the Paper bag next to him. Judging from the smell coming from the Paper bag Ash assumed it to be the cub's lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, now what to do? From what he could recall Kit had a fairly level head for a twelve year old. He\u2019d have better chances of survival if he had his help. Climbing the giant bear cub would take too long so from what Ash could see he had three options: Climb up onto Kit's ball cap and wait for him to put it back on his head so he could get close to his ear, take the direct approach and climb into his lunch bag and get his attention when he lifted a food item to his mouth. A tad bit more dangerous but Ash figured that close to his ears Kit would  be able to hear him. At least he hoped so. His other option was to get his attention by tickleing one of his feet, since he was very close to them at that moment.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Covered in a layer of dirt and debris the pads of Kit's foot emanated heat and a distinct Earthy smell. In the back of his head a little voice was telling him this was a stupid idea, he chose to ignore the voice. With his heart pounding in his chest Ash reached out with one trembling hand and began to tickle a spot just below the toes of the cub's foot. At first all he got was a slight twitch, so he decided to be a little more aggressive with his tickling. That got a response, Kit giggled a little. Feeling confident from this reaction Ash held nothing back, useing both hands to tickle the huge pad before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo things happened. One, Kit laughed loudly. Two, Kit's foot Kicked forward sending him flying back. Hitting the ground and going for a tumble before stopping, Ash felt the Earth shake as the cub stood up. Rolling on his back he looked up at Kit, from the look on his face it was clear he was not amused. His eyes darted about looking for whatever had tickled him and finally his gaze fell upon Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH HA!\" said Kit with an angry look on his face.\"So you're the little bug who ticked me! I hate getting my feet tickled! Well I'll make sure you'll never tickle me again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Kit lifted the very foot that moments before Ash was tickling and prepared to stomp him into the dirt.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not much, there never was. He lifted his foot away and looked at his handwork. He frowned, the bug had bled red. Did it suck blood?

None of them had avoided his foot for as long as this one, that alone was enough to make him want to get a closer look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely exhaused Ash accepted his fate.

It was just sitting there as if it knew it had no place to go. It made Kit think that maybe this wasn't a Bug after all. Ash tried to read the cub's face, trying to guess what he was going to do next. Huge fingers came into view as Kit closed his hand into a fist, He made sure though not to squeese too tightly.

Do you have anything I could use to get a better look at it without hurting it?\" Ash heard Kit ask. He was glad Kit was doing what he said he would. It might be a chance for him to communicate with the cub, he just wish he could remember who Wildcat was. The name sounded familiar somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have to wait too long to remember. A voice that sounded like a grownup with a childish mind answered, \"Sure, Kit. I have a magnifying glass and a device to amply sound from tiny things from a foot away, which is handy for listening for loose parts. I suppose it could come in handy if it can speak our language.\" It came back to him. Wildcat was a lion and team's mechanic. He might not sound intelligent, but he was great at building and fixing things. You wouldn't be surprised if he built the sound amplifying device himself. Maybe he could help you become a bit taller if you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, I could use them both! I get this feeling whatever it is can understand speech.

It probably wasn\u2019t even the bug\u2019s fault. Got to close with its feelers maybe. He shouldn\u2019t have reacted that way even though he really did hate to be tickled.

This Bug wore CLOTHES! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh had thought for sure it had been the end. Out of fear he\u2019d curled into a fetal position and waited for the end.

He watched as Kit opened the bag reached in and took out a sandwich. Peanut butter and jam from the smell of it. Crumbs began to rain down on him as the cub ate enough food to feed a family for months, well that is if they didn't have an allergy to nuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKit ate his sandwich looking out over the water lost in thought. He didn't see the human making his way through the grass towards his ball cap.

It was like going back in time and watching a dinosaur, and just as dangerous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh climbed up onto the brim of the baseball cap. it smelled like it needed to be washed. The smell wasn't overbearing but it was definitely noticeable. Sitting down, Ash looked up at the Cub and, with nothing else to do but wait, watched him finish off the sandwich and start off on a slice of pie, followed by an apple. That was a lot of food, but you know what they say about growing kids and Kit was far from finished growing. Which made Ash wonder just how big the adults were. How big was Rebecca Cunningham or Baloo? Finishing off his meal Kit crumpled the paper bag into a tight ball and taused it into a nearby trash can. A three point basket. Ash braced himself as Kit reached for his cap. Huge fingers closed on the brim. Suddenly Ash found himself sliding off as the cap was lifted, he couldn't get a good grip on the material, Looking the Other way Kit didn't see a thing as Ash slid off the ball cap and<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>He was inside a school hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing odd about it, just a regular hallway. Ash looked confused as he swore there would have been something odd about his predicament. He looked around for a bit, the hallways were nicely kept, the walls were decorated with school announcements and projects, and the classrooms seemed to be fine with students. He took a sigh of relief as he was glad he was not anywhere dangerous or in some strange place. Still it did mark the question why the bright light, or whatever it was, brought him here. It seemed to be an awful lot of trouble just to send him to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again he still wasn't sure if this was the school he attended, or the right grade regardless. Nevertheless, Ash didn't have any more time to think as he felt a tap on the back of his shirt. Turning he was greeted with a girl with brown hair, a yellow headband, matching shirt-with a red skirt over it-socks and brown loafers. Ash didn't say anything as the girl spoke, \"Uh...are you lost?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few seconds for Ash to answer as he was a bit mesmerized, \"Uhm....kinda of...\" He responded as he was still confused at what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well do you need any help?\" The girl asked extending a hand, \"I'm Phoebe by the way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh shook her hand as he introduced himself, \"I'm Ash...I'm....new here..\" Telling a little white lie, as he wasn't technically wrong either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you, new you say?\" Phoebe said interested, \"Does that mean your the new kid our class has been hearing about?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh..sure, absolutely,\" Ash responded friendly, as it was a way to get some answers, or at least mingle for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, follow me,\" Phoebe clapped her hands as she lead the way to her homeroom class. \"You know I don't blame you, this school is pretty big for new students, but once you get used to it, you can find your way around.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be sure to do that,\" Ash responded as he was trying to keep the conversation going. It was still strange he was here, but it was also better to follow Phoebe then wander around the halls and possibly getting into trouble. This way, he was at least protected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here we are!\" Phoebe opened the door as she introduced Ash to the rest of her classmates. Immediately Ash took in the fairly small class, up to six students if he counted himself, and the really bizarre decorations around the place. Skeletons, dinosaurs, the periodic table of elements hanged like a flag, and some class pets here and there. What he took notice however was that the classroom, or teacher, was keen on teaching more about science over any other subject. Strange, but doable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there,\" a kid with a red cap and a green shirt, with a red R on it, greeted Ash as he shook hand, \"Name's Ralphie, class athlete and future NFL player.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Ash,\" Ash responded as the kid seemed to be friendly at least. \"Guess I'm the new kid then, and future classmate. Hopefully.\" He added meekly which only made Ralphie laugh. \"Of course you are gonna be, why else would you be here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No reason,\" Ash gulped as Ralphie slung an arm around his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on I'll show you to the rest of the class.\" Ralphie pushed Ash until they met up with an asian girl, wearing a red coat with a pink undershirt, who was busy with a phone in her hands. \"Ehm, Wanda meet Ash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up as she waved at him, \"Hey Ash, Wanda here. Hope you can stomach most of the class lessons. Unlike Arnold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" A kid with glasses, orange hair, and a white and yellow striped shirt interjected as he stood up from his chair, \"It's not my fault I get...nervous about the trips sometimes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does he mean by that?\" Ash asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you'll soon find out eventually,\" Ralphie said, \"Kind of hard to explain when Ms. Frizzle isn't around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well to be fair she isn't the most conventional teacher either,\" an African American girl wearing a magenta and light violet sweater appeared next to Ralphie as she introduced, \"I'm Keesha, nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise,\" Ash responded as he leaned forward to shake Keesha's hand, \"So this...Ms. Frizzle is....quite radical?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.....you could say that. Kind of hard to place a specific word after all the field trips we've been with her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" Ash whispered as he thought of that. Wonder what she meant by that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" Ralphie broke the silence, \"There's still three people left for you to meet.\" Turning Ash around, to face another African American kid, who seemed he was drawing, \"Over there is Tim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiya!\" Tim looked up as he continued to go on his work, quite concentrated on it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over there,\" Ralphie pointed to a girl with blonde pigtails, and a purple sweater, reading a very heavy scientific book. \"Is Dorothy Ann, or D.A., for short.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, sorry for being quiet, but my research is very important right now,\" She waved without moving away from the book as she continued to read, almost ignoring Ash if it weren't for her comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And finally, Carlos,\" Ralphie almost groaned as a kid with a blue sweater, sat with his arms crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, nice to meet you. Don't want to step on anything but, you seem to be a little out of place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Ash was starting to get a bit nervous, as he was scared if anyone knew he wasn't truly from here. However he had no time to explain as Carlos interrupted him, \"Could say that your... foreign?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was dumb founded by what he said, while the rest of the class groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to forgive him, he's a bit of a ..... joker,\" Phoebe informed Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, and all I need is my Harley next to me!\" Carlos nudged at Dorothy. \"In your dreams Carlos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhew, that was one Ash dodged. For a second his heart was gonna explode. Still he had to admit that wherever he was, it could have been a lot worse. Taking a seat next to Phoebe, the front door of the room opened as I very odd teacher walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair was orange, yet it was...well.....a frizzle-as it was tight up in a bum with some strands standing here and there. She wore a dark blue dress with some decorations on it, that Ash really couldn't see from his position. She had a lizard across her shoulders as she let sit on her desk as she spoke with a very eccentric voice, \"Good Morning Class!\"</span></div></div>",

Immediately she spotted Ash as she literally jumped in front of him. \"Ah, you must be the newcomer, welcome to our humble adobe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, indeed I am!\" Ash played along with the rouse as Ms. Frizzle invaded his personal space. He had to admit though, she was a very fine lady. She seemed nice, and well...she did look good, however, he couldn't get ahead-he really couldn't judge a book by its cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!,\" clapping her hands together, \"I see you got well acquainted with the class already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure did,\" Ralphie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite exemplary if I may say,\" D.A added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, you'll be a fine addition to my class, young....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash, hmmmmm odd name, but as science has proved, odd things are the basis of discovery!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to know,\" Ash gulped in relief as he was interrupted once more by the Redheaded Fritz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now class today's lesson involves much difference from the usual view of your regular everyday basis!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" groaned Arnold, but Ash just ignored it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that, Ms. Frizzle?\" Keesha asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, think about it. At your current state, you think of all the things accustomed to your liking and to your proportions, but what if it were different?\" This intrigued the class as most of them seemed excited to find out what their teacher was trying to imply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meaning?\" Wanda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Proportion, obviously,\" Tim added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right you are Tim, and with proportion comes perspective, and perspective can change your whole view of the world.\" Ms Frizzle added as a twinkle appeared in her eye. She winked at her lizard as it was busy rummaging behind the desk, looking for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So by changing our perspective, we would see everything else differently?\" Wanda continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But according to my research, that's scientifically impossible. Perspective, or even proportions, of a person can't be changed,\" D.A added, \"Even if you wanted to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never say never Dorothy Ann,\" Ms. Frizzle interjected as her lizard found a strange gun/antenna device and launched at her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this mean?\" Ralphie asked eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time to take chances,\" she said her oh so famous line as she twirled the device around, \"make mistakes and get messy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone cheered, as Ash looked confused and excited, while Arnold seemed scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you excited?\" Phoebe asked Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Ash seemed more confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we're going on a field trip!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Phoebe said with an almost, duh, effect in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well with Ms. Frizzle's Porta-shrinker of course!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what?\" Ash was about to ask even more, as he was cut off by the Frizzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...how to go around about this?\" She said as her class was in front of her.</span></div></div>",

Ash was nervous as he didn't know what he had gotten himself into, he thought there was going to be a normal lecture, a test, and then done. This was not in part of his plans!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I knew I should have stayed home,\" Arnold whined as his anxiety started to flare a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's gonna happen?\" Ash asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the problem, I don't know!\" Arnold responded, \"But all I know is that it's going to be bad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they continued to chat, Ms. Frizzle had finished her set up and now was aiming for her students. \"Alright class, It's Showtime!\" Before they could do anything, she had pulled trigger as a strange beam spread among them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe timing was almost instantaneous as one minute the whole class was facing Ms. Frizzle and the next they were in some strange white plain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we?\" Phoebe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't be sure,\" Wanda added, \"It's all so....white and..\" she was cut off as they all felt a massive tremor coming from out of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was th-\" Ash asked, only for they to feel it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey was it me, or did that one feel stronger?\" Phoebe asked scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother tremor, and this time louder and stronger as they were thrown off their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it definitely is!\" Tim shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were thrown around once more, as a darkness fell on them. \"Hey who turned off the lights?\" Carlos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhmm...Carlos....\" Wanda gulped as she turned her friend, \"I think....she did...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked up and up and up, and up, and up, until they're necks were craned enough, but it wasn't enough. A huge violet heel stood next to them, as another slowly made it's way towards them, landing next to them, creating the earth shattering quake once more. Connected to it, where Ms. Frizzle's long legs, covered by the the massive sheet of her dress as she squatted down, squinting to see where her class was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I THINK I MAY HAVE OVERDONE IT A BIT!\" Her voice boomed down below, as everyone covered their ears. Their excitement had gone to fear, but they were still hopeful that their teacher would still be the same. \"AH THERE YOU ARE CLASS! ENJOYING THE NEW SIGHTS ON PERSPECTIVE?!\" She laughed, sounding like an evil laugh more than her usual giddy one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class stood up, trying to get a sense of how diminutive they were at the moment.</span></div></div>",

This was far, far, far from what he considered normal but even then, he should have seen it coming, the portal wasn't just gonna drop him and leave him be. It had to throw even more crazy into the mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, the children stood up as their gargantuan teacher had stood still to allow them to move. They soon realized that the white plain, was the school tiles on the floor, it was a start. From then on they compared themselves to her heels. Giant was an understatement at this point, they were massive! As big as a cruise liner if they were to compared. This only added to they're stature, as they feel smaller now than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knew the Frizz would do something like this?\" Wanda whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never thought she was one for...\" Arnold gulped, \"...shrinking students.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we have been small before, just...never at this size, and...with her...only...\" Phoebe added as she was shaking a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on guys, it's not that bad,\" Ralphie added as he was feeling adventurous and wanted to explore more. \"Come on, let's see what else we can find at this view!\" Running ahead to the other side of the Frizzle's shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so,\" Wanda yelled as she chased after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Tim, Carlos, and Dorothy Ann were still trying to find an exact size that they were around. \"Never thought we be at the short end of the heel,\" Carlos said unattended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would normally groan, but this time you're right,\" Dorothy said as they looked up towards the massive heel that seemed to never end. \"Theoretically, this shouldn't be possible, then again, Ms. Frizzle has defied science and its laws dozens of times...yet I can never get used to it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been Frizzled,\" Tim added, \"Big time.\" Giving an unintentional pun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like Massive,\" Carlos interjected. Nevertheless, as the children walked near her, Ms. Frizzle couldn't help but have a smile on her face. Sure she loved being a teacher but as any person, she did have her secrets. Since a child she has had an affinity towards....well size change to be exact. She couldn't explain why, but she was in love with it. Even after her years of teaching science and studying it, she could never figure it out what attracted her so much towards the subject but it <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that knowledge, it would explain why the bus could magically shrink down to microscopic size, and the portable shrink ray that she carried around. However, she never really had a chance to use to their fullest, until Ash appeared. She knew he wasn't from around here, and not just location but dimension all together. Why? Well, learning science and creating earth shattering discoveries gave you a thing or two to pick up about people. Still, she did see this as an opportunity to shrink him to small size, her class was just a....added by product towards her desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down even more unto them, she couldn't really resist playing with her tiny pupils. Hurting them would not be a problem however; she wouldn't be able to live with herself if she did do something such horrible. Thus her science helped her in that. Shrunken down to where their molecules became more compact, thus more resistant, to almost anything. She had experimented before, so she was sure of that. But the question now was, what would be her first choice of playtime? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not sure how, but Ash knew that Jake was a protecter of magical creatures. So perhaps he could protect you, even though your a shrunken human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opens up, unknown to Ash, and Jake walks in listening to music on his phone.

Only one way to find out.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh is about to turn around and find someone to help him, when he id suddenly lifted off the ground and brought to Jake's face. \"Yo little man, how'd you get in my room? Where did you come from? And what sory of creature are you?\" Jale asked, Ash looked at him and responded \"I don't know how I got in your room. I was just walkimg through the forest to a lake, when a bright flash blinded me and I woke up here. Also I'm a human 'Crap, I forgot to lie'. Please can you help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your a human huh. Well guess something or someone decided to shrink you. I'd take you to my gramps, but he and Fu dog are gonna be away for awhile. Also my Mom And Dad have taken my little sis' out for camping. I have to stay here and watch over the creatures. Don't worry though, as the Am-Drag I'll protect you.\" Ash is grateful by Jake words, but asks (even thouch he knows the answer, however he can't let Jake know that) \"Why did you call yourself ' The Am-Drag?'

Before Ash could suggest something simple to avoid Jake figuring things out, Jake spoke first \"Yo Ash, ya know since I am a dragon my sense of smell is very keen. And right now I can tell you're horny.\" Ash looked down &amp; adjusted the bulge in his pants, hoping Jake didn't notice. \"Too late little man, I saw that before I smelled your hormones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry Jake. I didn't mean t-to disgust you.\" \"Naww don't worry man, I get it. Some of the magical creatures I save are turned on by me. And you'd be surprised on how its more men than women. Care for a little show?\" Ash's face is a deep shade of red, but nods vigorously. Jake picks up Ash &amp; sets him on his desk &amp; starts to do some muscular poses. Showing off his arms &amp; puffing out his chest. Revealing his red scaled 8-pack &amp; turning around to reveal his well musculared back. And then putting one of his legs on the chair &amp; allowing Ash to see the muscles twitch when Jake tightens the veins within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Ash, you are really horny right now. Even at your size your hormones are pretty strong. So tell me, what have you wanted to do with a sexy dragon like me? Don't be shy.\" Ash is stunned by what he saw and flustered by what Jake said. Hoping not to disgust or anger the great beast in front of him Ash said \"W-W-Well I've always h-had a fetish about being a micro to something so big. How he would casually toss me into his mouth and savor me. How I could be in front of him and worship his muscles. I can be his own personal living t-toy, to be used as he wishes. To be stuffed deep in his sack and please him and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh stops realizing he may have said too much. Ash looked up at the dragon to see Jake's reaction. Jake was looking at him for a few seconds and threw his head back laughing \"Ahhhhahahahahahaha, Wow little man.

He could see a slit where Jake's private area was 'most dragons could hide theirs and in this world, they would need to, regardless of age' Ash thought. And Jake was fingering himself to arouse and allow his most intimate parts to emerge. Emerging from Jake'a slit, Ash was shocked to see not one, but two dicks emerging, though mostly flaccid, they were still 4\"long. Eventually Jake's balls came out as well and Ash just stared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright little dude, go ahead and just go down whichever one you want.\" With Jake's permission Ash walked down Jake's stomach until he reached Jake's dick's. They were shaped more reptialian, instead of having round head's, both were slightly pointed. And had unusual looking bumps on the underside, starting small at the base (about the size of Ash's shrunken fist) and getting bigger. Until the 7th one was the size of Ash's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh put his hands on one of Jake's dick and rubbed the head, elicting a small moan from the beast. Ash then decided to start licking the head and biting the slit, causing Jake dick to fully harden and Jake to lurch and shove Ash head first in his dick. Both of them were surprised, Ash by his head plunged in sudden, musky darkness and Jake by feeling an object enter him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake looked down and saw Ash was in up to his stomach, inside Jake's dick. Grinning Jake grabbed Ash's legs and helped fulfill his fantasy. Ash felt Jake's claws grab him and lift him up, thinking Jake would bring him out. Instead Ash was engulfed further inside Jake dick. Jake stopped when Ash's feet were wiggling around and put his finger on top and slowly shoved Ash all the way in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh continued to struggle, thinking it would please the dragon. He was awarded with hearing a large moan and growling (although muffled). Pre continued to exit and lube Ash, furthering his descent down Jake's cock. And Ash could feel pressure from all sides, figuring the old dragon teen was jerking himself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake was in pure bliss, feeling the tiny human in one of his cocks was amazing and he couldn't help but masturbate from the feeling. Jake looked down to see the large bulge in his cock moving downward until it disappeared and his left testicle started to expand. Jake continued to jerk off, until he decided to lean forward and blow himself, figuring he would give the human a soft landing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Jake's left ball, Ash was having the time of his life. As soon as he entered, Ash began to move around and rub the inner walls, even swallowing Jake's natural essence. After a few minutes, Ash noticed that the balls were shaking wildly and knew aylhat was about to happen. Bracing himself, Ash was plunged back into Jake's cock and shot out, into a dark, warm, and moist cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jake had finished, he laid back in the after glow, tasting his cum, mixed with the flavor of the human. Jake was enjoying Ash's taste, constantly swishing him around and could soon hear his stomach growl. Now Jake had a decision to make. Should he spare the small human and protect him as promised or swallow the human and satisfy his hunger. Jake decided to...</span></div></div>",

As you make it to the edge of the huge furniture piece you look down to realize just how much of a all it is if you accidentally slipped off. The thought of you falling off was enough to make you swallow nervously, though upon further inspection you notice that there was a plethora of other objects adorned on the floors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"huh.\" you say to yourself with a raised brow as you began to think of some other way of getting downwards. As you gaze upon he sides of the dresser once more, you notice a rather intricate pattern design upon the side that would act as the perfect ladder downwards.

The alien was an unmistakable color of purple and cream colored body with his four eyes. He was wearing his usual Hawaiian t-shirt that barely fit him and stretchy blue shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well little girl, good-bye to you and 626.

When the dizziness stopped, Ash realized he was looking right at Jumba. \"Well hello little human, where did you come from?\" Ash responded \"I don't know, I was taking a walk, when i was blinded by a bright light. I heard you talk about a teleportation device and thought you might have teleported me here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my device is still new so I don't know if you were sent here.

Even one of Jumba's hands could not wrap around it fully. The main skin and his balls were purple and the head was cream color like his skin. You were astonished to figure it to be 10\" long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have had this for a few hours and it not go down.\" You told him \"Well this is easy for me, bring me over to your bed and set me in front of your dick.\" Jumba did so, letting you smell his musk, even though he was an alien, his musk smelled that of any male. Only stronger, you walked up to the fat head and started to massage the flesh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumba began to moan \"Oohh, that is new.\" \"I haven't even started.\" And with that you began to lick the head and nibble on the flesh near his slit. Jumba was moaning from this intense new experience and pre began to leak out. You knew he was enjoying this and because his dick was so big, you decided to climb inside and move, lick and bite his sensitive flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were rewarded with Jumba making some unusual noises, but they were joyous sounds. \"Oh, you are inside me. This is incredible, I don't know how I will last\" You heard it all and began to thrust your upper half in and out \"Ooohhh, GLIZZNAK\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got out just to see his dick twitch until the slit opened and purple cum came splurting out. Hitting you square in the chest and sending you flying back a couple of feet. You got out of the mess and saw that Jumba was panting, his dick shrinking until it was flaccid. \"That was amazing and my organ is no longer big, thank you. \"No problem and the name's Ash\"</span></div></div>",

The motions got him to fly and land on his stomach, causing the teen to laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis beat being alone and listening to music ten times fold, however she got an idea soon after. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm,\" She said to herself as she wondered, \"Maybe, maybe, I could do it.\" She reached down for Ash as he screamed as he was snatched up by her.

So he stood up and wiggled himself around to fully wake the rest of his body up. As he did so, his vision was just coming back. As his eyes focused, he couldn't believe what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like a regular, 3 person sofa. But to Ash, it was about 100 feet tall, at least compared to him. He then decided to scan the room, to see if his fears were true. He turned and he saw even more various, gigantic objects. It looked as though there were chairs, that stood as tall as the mighty oaks that were used to make them. There was a television set, in which the screen would be even bigger than a jumbo tron in Time Square. And Ash looked down to see a wooden floor, with cracks that measured about 2 tiny feet apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh began to seriously freak out by now. \"What the hell's going on?!\" he demanded out loud. \"Where the hell am I?! Why am I so............ small?\" He had to accept the fact that he didn't just land in a giant's house, but that he had shrunk, and ended up landing here........ where ever \"here\" is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, Ash was reminded quickly why everything is so big:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nboom...... Boom......... BOOM......... <b>BOOM</b>..........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was made for BIG people. The floor quaked with every step the giant took. Ash could barely stand with the vibrations in the floor. Until he noticed the door, that stood like a skyscraper, had a shadow creep up from the other side. The shadow though, didn't look like a normal human. Then again, a normal human wouldn't be hundreds of feet tall. But from what Ash could tell, the figure seemed to have....... big, pointy ears. Almost like a..... cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door creaked open, with a low, moaning creak. And Ash got the full look of the giant creature. It indeed was a humongous, anthropomorphic cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho did he see stomping his way?</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile, you are too shocked to move as Danny's footsteps grow louder.Right as you are able to compose yourself, Danny's gigantic paw crashes down right in front of you. The stench coming off of the paw makes you gag and you can see the dirt and sweat tangled in the fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paw begins to lift up again, causing you to duck and cover instinctively. You wait for the paw to hit the ground again but, nothing happens. Opening your eyes again, you see that the giant anthropomorphic cat has laid down on the couch to take a nap. His position has one foot hanging off of the couch, inches away from you, while the other is propped up on the couch. You had to get Danny's help so you run over to the paw that is hanging off of the couch and prepare to climb it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grip the auburn fur and begin to climb. The fur was wet from Danny's sweat and the odor was overwhelming. Both of these problems made the climb harder but you had to keep going. Danny has to be able to help you somehow, you just had to wake him up from his nap somehow.<br>\r\nYou were almost able to reach the fabric of Danny's pants when a sudden move caught you off guard. Danny swung the leg that you were on, up to the couch and landed it right next to his other paw. The entire movement discombobulated you. It was like the surprise roller coaster that you never wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to keep a grip on Danny's fur, you let go and fall onto the pants of the giant feline.Your landing makes a harsh sound, at least to you.</span></div></div>",

After regaining his senses, Ash was finally able to try and identify the location he was transported to by his strange light... and come to a conclusion that he don't know where he is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis whole place looked weird. It was like a bed. Big, gold, oval bed. Behind him was something tall, he assumed that it's a headboard. There was no pillow, but the mattress was soft enough to lie on it. But why would someone need a headboard for this kind of bed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh's stream of thoughts about furniture was cut short when a powerful tremor caused him to fall face first on the mattress. He noticed an odd scent coming from it. The mattress was also wet, but it wasn't water. It was salty and not very pleasant to taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around, trying to find the source of tremors, that were constantly shaking the area. It didn't take him a long time to find it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh's jaw dropped to the mattress after noticing something, that he should find in mere seconds. An enormous white pony was walking in his direction. But it wasn't just a normal pony. No, it had wings and a horn. Its rainbow mane was moving, as it was constantly moved by wind. It had an odd, gold collar-thing with jewels on it and a crown. Just is it. The pony's front leg moved over him, making Ash able to recognize it as her, if you know what I mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What am I looking at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the view of her reproductive organs was completely covered by the purely white underside of her right hind hoof... and Ash's going to be in the center of the place on which the hoof will fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the pieces were coming together: Ash has been shrunk, Ash has been transported to the world of gigantic ponies, Ash has been shrunk while being transported here, Ash is standing on a gigantic shoe, a pony queen/princess is about to put on this particular shoe, Ash is going to be crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a day.

Sure it was futile but don't tell that to someone who has a 300-foot Furry Grizzly Bear cub walking toward him. Ash wasn't even watching where he was running, nor did he care. A huge dark shadow fell over him. A second later the sudden blast of displaced air and the impact tremor of the furry foot touching down just beside him knocked the micro human to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoughing dust Ash looked on as the cub continued walking. He'd been complete beneath the giant creature's notice. Perhaps it was a good thing, but he had a feeling that it was not. He continued to watch until the cub stopped in front of a mountain size rock and promptly sat down on top of it.<br>\r\n'Now that's something to see.' thought Ash. 'A mountain sitting on top of a mountain.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bear cub sat, looking a little sad, the micro human wondered why. As Ash studied the cub it suddenly dawned on him that he somehow knew this being, and when he heard  <br>\r\nthe cub sigh he suddenly recognized him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little Bear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, not exactly little. As fantastic as it was, he'd been somehow brought to this strange world where Fictional Characters were real and he was incredibly tiny. Or were they just incredibly large? He had know way of knowing. It made some degree of sense as to why the cub was looking so sad. If he recalled the show there were times that his friends did go away. Whether it was the end of the summer, or hibernation. Standing back up and dusting himself off he decided to get a closer look. Naturally, he was frighten. But if this Little Bear was anything like his cartoon counterpart then He knew in his heart that there was nothing to fear. Providing he could get this Giant's attention.  Eventually he found himself standing in a bare patch of dusty ground looking up at the towering Cub. Little Bear's head was tilted toward the ground, this was good. Maybe when he started yelling he'd hear and see him. He took a deep breath, he almost didn't have the nerve to cry out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Bear's Eyes went wide. Sitting up straight he looked about, trying to find who had spoken to him \"Who said that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Did! Down here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Bear Looked down at his feet, it took a moment for the Young Cub to find the Human but when he did he smiled in amazement. He reached down with one furry hand. Ash had to steel himself to keep from running away. Huge clawed fingers closed around him in a surprisingly gentle grip and carefully lifted him upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He covered a great deal of distance, much more than Ash thought he would. Within a minute or two they were approaching a familiar stucco, timber, plaster, and brick house. Ash saw smoke coming from the chimney. One or both of Little Bear's parents were there, Ash was more than a bit nervous. He was just getting use to The young grizzly's size. How would he react to seeing one twice that size or bigger?<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs They stepped into the door both his parents were there to greet them. His mother wore a a pink shirt and a blue skirt with a white apron, his father a blue suit with a purple tie. Both towered high above Ash even from the height Little Bear was holding him. They both looked at him with curious looks on their faces.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What's that you have there Little Bear?\" Asked Mother Bear<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"This is Ash, He's a human.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I've never seen a human so small\" said Father Bear as he bent lower to get a better look at Ash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story. Y-you'll have to excuse my sometimes odd behavior\" said Ash \"I'm a little nervous\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"That's understandable. Being so tiny\" Said Mother Bear, she looked at Ash with wonder but gave him a warm smile. \"Do you live around here?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"No mame. I'm not sure how I got here and your son has suggested I....Live here. However if you feel otherwise--\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Nonsense.\" Mother Bear said with the wave of her hand/paw. \"You can stay here as long as you like.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"We're glad to see our son meeting new people.\" Father Bear added. \"This time of the year most of his friends are away until the summer.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Lets go to my room\" said Little Bear as he took Ash toward a closed door.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Be careful playing with your new friend. You wouldn't want to hurt him\" He heard his mother called out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid that just happen? They were pretty calm about the whole thing. But Ash figured they though he was too small to really couldn't do anything harmful even if he wanted to. Mother Bear seemed to have a curious interest in him, he found himself curious about her as well. Little Bear brought Ash into his bedroom, which despite it's size was pretty much like any kid's bedroom. A dresser on the left, a big bed and nightstand near the widow and a shelf and toy box in the corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could home thousands of people in this room.\" said Ash in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where would you like to sleep tonight?\" asked Little Bear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh looked about the room. \"Hmmmmm....\"</span></div></div>",

He remembered the day he tried to find a place for No Feet and ruled out his Toy box, high shelf and Dresser drawer. But there was a spot in his night stand. A little shelf. It had plenty of space but didn't look very comfortable. Then he was struck with an idea. He carefully placed Ash on the shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an Idea. I'll be right back,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Bear left and a moment later returned with a slipper. It was pink, well worn, but looked comfortable and warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh eyed it curiously \"Who owns the slipper, Little Bear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It belongs to Mother Bear.\" the cub explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't she need it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not until winter. We can make you a better bed later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, any port in a storm I guess. Let me take a look inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Climbing up into the Slipper the first thing Ash noticed was the smell. It wasn't strong, clearly it hadn't been worn in a very long time but it was there nonetheless. Overall, the more he thought about it, It really wasn't that bad. It certainly didn't smell like human oder, it was much more earthly. Lite only by the light coming from the opening he could see clearly where the cloth sole was worn in the places where Mother Bear's foot had settled into the slipper. He wondered what it would be like to be in here with such a massive foot. Getting down on his hands and knees Ash lifted up a bit a fabric that had been worn free from the sole. Though still attached to the slipper at one end it was big enough to crawl under it. This didn't look to be such a bad place to spend the night at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? What do you think?\" Asked Little Bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll do just fine.\" Ash called out. </span></div></div>",

Not because of his accommodations, It was surprisingly comfortable. The Earthy smell of the interior wasn't that bad either as the Slipper hadn't been worn for some time. It was just one of those nights when his brain was too active to sleep. If he were home he'd just brew a cup of herbal tea to relax himself but that wasn't the case. Thoughts of how he got there, the creatures who were once fictional cartoon characters now flesh and blood with  paws large enough to crush a house with a single step. That was just Little Bear, his parents could crush several houses at once. He obsessed over that more than anything, if he ever got back there was no way in hell anyone would believe his crazy story without hard evidence. At best it would be looked upon as fan fiction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut wait, of course! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh crawled out from under the flap of fabric and searched the pockets of his jacket. He found his cellphone (No service obviously) and his Go-Pro. The heavy duty camera was fully charged with an empty SD card, he'd planned to use it but in all the excitement he'd forgotten he had it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now, what to do next..' he thought to himself. He wasn't really tired and at the moment all the Giants were asleep, no risk of getting stepped on of he decided to go anywhere and explore. Still, he wasn't sure about the lighting. While the moon was bright enough to illuminate the interior of Little Bear's room he was concerned about the quality of the pictures even though the camera had a light/flash.</span></div></div>",

The well insulated and well stocked shelter sat on Little Bear's dresser and from what he could see out the window of the cub's bedroom it was beginning to snow heavy. he also noticed the wind had started to pick up. A winter storm was approaching. In his bed, Little Bear slept in deep hibernation. in another part of the House, so were Mother and Father Bear. They weren't always in this state, unlike their counterparts in Ash's world they only slept half the winter and only go into Hibernation sometime after the Winter Solstice celebration, their equivalent to Christmas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh, being human, could not hibernate. He was well stocked with food and water, but the biggest problem was combating boredom. For the first week or so he remained in the warm confines of his home, but after that he needed to find ways to entertain himself. So he started to venture out into Little Bear's bedroom. The First trip didn't go so well. Without a fire in the fireplace the temperature of the Bear's home had dropped, not too cold for the Bears but for a small creature like Ash it was like stepping into a freezer and he wore clothes meant for Summer, not winter. He learned his lesson after that and fashioned a poncho out of some warm material Mother Bear had given him to use as a Blanket. This made the trips more bearable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo get down from the dresser, a staircase had been build. Similar to a  fire escape it was a rather long climb back up to the top but under the circumstances it was the best that could be done. Likewise there was also a string ladder that was attached to Little Bear`s bed so he could climb up there if he wanted to. There was also one attached to Mother and Father Bear`s bed, it been put there by Mother Bear. Some nights when Father Bear was away and she sat up reading he`d visit and the two would talk. Sometimes if their talks went too long and the hour grew late Mother Bear would invite Ash to sleep with her, pointing out that there was more than enough room for both. Standing in his home and lost in thought, Ash admitted to himself that there had been nights when he`d been tempted to explore the sleeping Giantess. Out of respect he never did, he didn't want to destroy a friendship and more importantly he followed the Golden Rule :Don`t mess with another man`s woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Welp,' Ash thought to Himself 'Time for another walk'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting on his poncho and tying a piece of sting around his waist, he stepped out onto the dresser. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where to today.\" he said to Himself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He hadn't done it in a while and he thought he'd check up on a few things. the Biggest issue during the construction of the house he lived in was heat. A fire simply wasn't an option. Even a Candle lit in the center of the dwelling would not last the whole winter. Ash devised a method where heated air  radiating from the mattress under Little Bear could be brought into the home through a pipe from the Mattress to a hole in the center of the floor. Though the bears knew nothing of thermal heating, Ash assured them it would work. It worked better than he'd hoped, though the dresser had to be moved close enough to the bed so the pipe wasn't too long. This also made it easy for Ash to make his way onto Little Bear's bed if needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rope bridge stretched the chasm  between the dresser and the bed. It had been made by both Ash and Little Bear in case the micro human wanted to visit. Course the times he did, the cub was in deep hibernation and was not aware of him. But that was was just fine, after all deep sleep was very important to a growing cub's development. Ash had noted that the cub had grown slightly bigger than he'd visited last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the wind had begun to pick up. It was really snowing heavy now, and once he was over the bridge to the bed Ash made headed for the sleeping Giant. As he climbed up over the top of the blanket covered cub he made his way to where his head stuck out from underneath and slipped into the fur; thankful for the warmth that surrounded him. He'd started to catch a chill.  Little Bear rarely changed positions and today he was on his side. Making his way down from the shoulder, along the collar bone, along the jawline, he ventured out into the cold air again to look up into the cub's face. No matter how many times he did this, the site of a Sleeping Giant Bear Cub never got old. Today, Little Bear's mouth Hung open slightly. Hot moist air blew out upon Ash with every breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea came to mind. One a few weeks ago he'd never consider. The word hot tub came to him. Now the concept of climbing into the mouth of a sleeping Bear Cub  wasn't without risk, but the feeling of hot fluid on his skin was very tempting. Course he would have to stay within the safety zone of Little Bear's fur until he could dry off clothes and all otherwise he'd freeze to death before he made it back to his home. </span></div></div>",

Looking inside, his mouth was big for me to fit inside snugly. His tongue was big, thick and looked like a spongy bed. Sharp, young baby teeth, glistening with saliva, were very white. After staring for another minute I began to climb into the bears mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce my foot pressed into Little Bear's tongue, I let out a slight moan at the warmth, covering my foot and continued to climb inside.

His home was a wooden boat placed in a flower pot with green leafed plants towering above it like great trees. This was done on purpose. In the early weeks Ash had been plagued with dreams, mostly bad upon discussion with Little Bear's parents it was determined his dreams might have been the result of his brain trying to process the concept of  everything being so big. To combat this, He needed some form of Normality.  That's where the boat came into play. And whenever Mother Bear watered the plants in the pot, it sounded like rain roaring off the roof. It did remind him of the story of the Great flood each time she did it though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interior of the Boat was a one room structure with a pile of rags for a bed and not much else. Well, it wasn't like the tools were available for the giants Bears to build anything with great detail. It was the best that could be done given the nature of his size and he didn't complain. It did the job and it had given his brain a chance to adjust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the problem of clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only had the clothes on his back, and as much as he cleaned his clothes in water provided he knew they would not last him. The big problem was the cloth the Giants used for their clothing was too thick and too heavy. With some trial and error cheese cloth turned out to be the best option. On this day he was wearing a cheese cloth toga with a thread tied around his waist for a belt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spent his days within the confine of Little Bear's bedroom except when in the presence of  Little Bear or Mother Bear. In those instances he was transported from one part of the house to another. When it came to world that existed beyond the house, he dared not go.Not only could he easily get lost in the wilderness beyond, but there were countless predatory insects and arachnids who would make a quick meal out of the micro human. For those reasons alone staying inside suited Ash just fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't like he was bored, There was never a dull moment when it came to the giant bear cub , his parents, or his friends who would come over. He had to admit, it was uncomfortable at times to be stared at but at the same time he couldn't really blame them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through the bedroom window he watched Little Bear playing among the fallen leaves. He wondered what month they were in. The pumpkins in the garden were turning orange, so based upon that he calculated that it had to be at least October.  Damn, he was going to miss out on Halloween. Well, the Halloween he knew anyway. The Bears had a tradition that was similar which involved costumes and was very much like Halloween, but it was it's own thing as well. Well, if he couldn't be home for his Halloween, maybe he could introduce a bit of it here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd think about it later. He noticed drops of rain splashing against the glass of the window and he knew Little Bear would be inside soon. No doubt the Cub would want to play for a bit, or he might want Ash to tell him a story. He watched as Little Bear left his field of vision. A few moments later the cub bounded into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course this wasn't the first time he had been this close to the Cub's foot/paw. Ash had examined the extremity a few times since he'd arrived. After all, it wasn't often the opportunity to examine a Bear's paw this close comes every day. Though he did have a thing for paws/feet, the previous explorations were purely scientific in nature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Bear and his parents were not like other animals because they walked upright. The average Bear that he knew of could never do that for extended periods of time. The Muscle and skeletal structure simply couldn't keep the animal upright and supporting the bulk it's body. But here was a different story. Here there was a definite and noticeable difference. Even though the toes were still like a Bear, the overall shape of the rest of the foot resembled a human's. He wished he could get an X-Ray machine so he could get  a good look at the structure of the Bone's and Muscles but  if there were an X-ray machine big enough for to do the Job the radiation would  most likely kill everything within a mile radius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found it\" Ash announced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbedded in the brownish pad almost completely was a thorn, about an inch in diameter. The tissue surrounding it was swollen and dark red as the body reacted to this intruder. Enough of the thorn was above the pad to allow Ash to get a hold of it. Grasping with Both hands he got ready to pull the foreign object clear of the Pad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On a count of three. One.....Two.....THREE!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh pulled with all his might.

He was completely covered in fur of course, but it was the fur at his chest that seemed the thickest and longest. This also made it exceptionally harder to get through without giving away his position.

He even lost his balance once or twice. He was certain the cub could feel his movements but then he wasn't overly concerned about winning either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rising and falling subsided telling Ash he'd finally reached the expanse of  Little Bear's Stomach. The rise and fall was replaced with gurgling noises from beneath him.

Ash moved quicker, occasionally hearing a giggle. He didn't want to get caught right away so he forced himself to slow down just a little bit. Suddenly he came upon what he could only describe as a crater of sorts. A Belly Button? He didn't think Bear's had one.

Though that would make for a rather silly children's story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Nineteen....Twenty!! Ready or not....\" Little Bear paused for a moment.

There was a chance Little Bear did know which direction he went given the number of small giggles he heard come from the cub. Then again, maybe  he just might win. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Then a shadow fell over him, this time he did allow himself to look upward. Hovering above his spot was a huge hand/paw.

You don't have leaves where you come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not THAT big.\" Ash looked all the way down to the ground thankful that the cub had a firm grip on him. Sure he was immoble but at least he didn't have to worry about falling. He spotted the leaf near Little Bear's feet/paws, a maple leaf that had turned reddish brown. Looking about he noticed other trees that had leaves changing colors and falling away. It was fall here, but where Ash came from it had been summer and he'd dressed for summer. He'd begun to notice the chill in the air and was glad for the warm pads that pressed against him.  Looking around some more he noticed a house off to the distance. Thought it was far away it was still big enough to make out the stucco, wood, plaster, and brick. He could also make out a garden and clothes line with various articles of clothing hanging from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that your home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could we play in there? I feel a little cold.|\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Bear placed Ash in the palm of his hand/paw. Huge clawed fingers curled around him leaveing him in almost total darkness with the exception of a few beams of light that seeped in between the fingers. Then everything began to sway back and forth as Little Bear begain to walk. Ash listen to the footfalls amazed at how quickly the cub seemed to be move dispite his size. Most Giants he remembered reading about were always slow and lumbersome but not this cub who seemed to covering a great deal of ground in just a short time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, there was a pause in the movement he heard the sound of a door opening. Three steps Forward. The door closeing. More footsteps. Another pause. A door opening. Three steps forward. A door closing. Then  the fingers lifted away from him. Ash Blinked for a moment, then stood and looked about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a room fit for a giant, no doubt about it. You could fit a small town in such a room, or most of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incredible.\" Ash muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to play now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, Little Bear.\" said Ash \"What would you like to play?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow It didn't occur to Ash that Little Bear might suggest something dangerous, after all the cartoon version of the cub was gentle like. But this was a flesh and blood being, one that might think and act differently and not consider the danger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, how about--\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ash looked up, stunned. What was the cub doing?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Bear giggled \"Better Run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cub didn't have to tell him twice. At once he was up and running as fast as he could, but even he knew that wouldn't be enough. Not even an Olympic gold winning sprinter would be fast enough to out run such a giant. With a single stride Little Bear was upon him, his foot/paw slamming down on the other side of him. This time he was somewhat ready and didn't go off his feet.He stumbled but did not fall. He ran again, and after a few minutes Little Bear's other foot/Paw slammed down. This time Ash fell to his knees and got back up. He was loosing steam, he wasn't sure how much longer he could run. Finally he stumbled and fell on his face.He rolled over and looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Bear held one Paw/foot over him. He had to admit, with the smooth brown leathery pads the cub's paw/foot looked quite cute. He looked up into the cub's face and wondered how he could be so cruel. Then he saw Little Bear smile, wink, and lowered the paw down on top of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not as he expected. He had thought there would be a moment of crushing weight, maybe pain and then nothing. What happened was that the leathery pad of of his toes lightly touched down on top of him. Ash looked up, studying  the dermal surface for a moment before touching it. It had a soft texture to it, surprisingly so for a giant that walked about without shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrrrr! Got yah Bug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Bear lifted his paw away and crouched down on his knees \"I hope I didn't scare you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you were really going to step on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, I was only playing. I do this with No Feet all the time. Did you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid he like it? Well now that he knew that  the cub was indeed not a homicidal terror he had to admit that it had been fun.

I think that's doable. *Clear's throat* Well, then, Step into my office. Oh, wait. You already have. Well, I'm afraid I misplaced my Dentist chair, so we'll have to make do with the Dentist Bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Little Bear climbed up onto his bed and lay down, Ash couldn't help but feel a number of emotions. Nervousness, uneasiness, some excitement to be sure. He'd played the game before of course when he was younger, but not on this scale. The cub lowered his paw/hand to his chest and after sliding off the hand and making his way though a forest of brown fur the Micro Human stood a few feet away from the largest mouth he'd seen. Up to this point.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, okay. Say Ah\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHHH\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe great maw opened wide and a blast of  humid air shot forth with enough force to blow his clothing back. He felt droplets of saliva on his bare skin. And for a moment he stood there staring into a mouth that could've swallowed him whole as easily as one could swallow a raisin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, everything look's okay to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Bear frowned slightly \"That's not how you do it. You need to climb inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Ash a brief moment to recover from seeing a huge mouth produce words as close as he had been before it registered in his brain what Little Bear had said. Climb inside? Could he trust such a young cub to be that careful?Then again, there were probably people out there who would kill to get this opportunity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but I have to take some clothes off. I don't want to get them wet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat, and he didn't want to get them ruined. He wasn't sure how his shoes would do getting soaked in saliva. They were waterproof but Saliva was more than just water. A minute later he had removed everything but his jean shorts and underwear.  He wanted to keep a level of decency after all. Of course he's be shortless  when he had to dry them but he was sure his he could cover himself up with his shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more the maw opened wide. Ash climbed up the chin and up onto the dark bottom lip. He remembered watching a video of a Grizzly Bear eating a Go-Pro. The anatomy of the mouth before him was similar, but thankfully Little Bear's teeth were much cleaner and whiter. They were also small, sort of. They were all baby teeth. Baby teeth that towered over him but baby teeth all the same. Ash stood up on Little Bear's Bottom Lip, took one step on a lower tooth and landed with a splat face first on the tip of his tongue. So much for that graceful entrance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Little Bear lay there he felt the little human enter his mouth and was determined to be as careful as he could. He didn't want to hurt him, and even though he didn't know anything about digestion he didn't want to accidentally swallow him either. If he had, he didn't know  how to get him out. Unbeknownst to him, his body was already reacting to the foreign body in his mouth. The moment Ash splat down on his tongue, the thousands of taste buds registered the saltiness of his bare skin and decided he was food. Saliva glands under the expanse of Tongue began to produce more Saliva. At some point, he was going to have to swallow, or druel on himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh, of course, was oblivious to all this as he crawled his way up the length of Little Bear's tongue toward one of his back Molars. Standing wasn't an option, every time he tried his feet would slide out from under him. It was a shame, he thought, that he didn't have a high definition video camera with him. If he ever got back home he could've sold the footage to National Geographic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly</span></div></div>",

The muscle's of the throat were kneading and massaging him as he traveled down the throat, if Ash wasn't heading towards his stomach, Ash might've enjoyed himself. A final GULP sent Ash to Little Bear's stomach, hr began to sweat from the heat and banged on Little Bear's stomach, \"PLEASE, LET ME OUT, I DON'T WANT TO DIE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Little Bear he realized what he had done, but Ash beating the inside of his stomach felt So Good.

And Ash hoped he would pass out to avoid the pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo such luck, after about 5 minutes, Little Bear's stomach began to fill up and and knead Ash's body, his body was battered and bruised by the ravaged beating. Ash knew digestion began when he felt his flesh begin to burn, Ash cried out in pain and hoped it would all be over soon, instead he was slowly digested away. Spending his last 10 minutes being digested alive, with his last breath he let out one final scream and died. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Bear knew Ash was gone, since he couldn't feel the human moving anymore. Little Bear saw Ash's shirt and hid it away. Keeeping it to remind him of his friend who would stay with him forever, unaware that Ash was in agony for his final moments.

Carefully he slithered on his belly towards it. The texture of the tongue combined with the saliva produced a unique sensation. It was difficult to describe the feeling, almost like being licked by a German Shepard or some other big dog, only scaled up. It wasn't accurate, but as close as he could get to  what it felt like. As he got closer to the Object he realized it was a camera. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart skipped a beat. How did a camera end up in Little Bear's mouth? Had he eaten someone? A stupid question. It was obvious that he must have. But was he knowing, or unknowing? Ash looked at the way the camera had been lodged in between the Molars. It was battered, but it didn't look to be in not too bad a shape. It also looked to have been deliberately lodged in there. As though someone had slid past and shoved it in there as he or she went. The lens of the camera was pointed toward Little Bear's throat. As though someone wanted the last moments to be filmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriouser  and Curiouser <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh dislodged the camera and slipped it into his slimy pants. He would examine it later. He slid his way back up to the tip of Little Bear's tongue. As he did so he admired the view from inside the organic cave.  He thought at first that he was the only one who had ever seen this sight, but quickly remembered the camera. There was no point in letting on that He had found anything. He didn't want to upset the cub, so instead he would keep it to himself. For the moment. </span></div></div>",

His Shorts and underwear drying. This of course left him in the nude, but he made sure Little Bear was Asleep before stripping. He didn't know how good the cubs eyes were to pick up the little details of his anatomy, and even if he couldn't  Ash didn't feel comfortable about  wandering about like Austin Powers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Camera wasn't like most cameras he'd seen before.  It was built rugged so it could take the punishment. It wouldn't have surprised Ash if the casing was made of of magnesium like the military grade laptops he had read about. The paint was chipped away and worn but  it looked to be in working order. Experimentally, he pressed the on button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise the back screen lit up with the camera's brand logo. It still worked. More interesting than that, the battery looked to be half charged. Maybe there was a timer set up  so it would automatically shut off after a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera had dozens of pictures as well as video.  The first pictures were of dogs like German Shepards, more specifically their  open mouths.  A lot of close ups. Then there  were pictures  of this world.  Pictures of Little Bear's home, the interior, pictures of him and his family eating. Close ups of their open maws as they were about to eat something.  This person, whoever he or she was, certainly had an obsession with mouths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No,' thought Ash as it suddenly dawned on him. 'Not  mouths . VORE'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVore, the desire to be eaten. While he enjoyed exploring the interior of Little Bear's mouth Ash certainly didn't like the idea of being swallowed and dissolved. But he knew some people would relish the thought of  fulfilling that fantasy.  But could someone really take it that far? To willingly get himself eaten knowing that it could mean death?  The answer of course was yes, but why the cub? Why not his mother or father?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Answer was in the videos he began to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

He was surrounded by huge blades of grass and wild flowers \"Grass doesn't grow this big on Earth. That's not the only thing that's big around here.

Holy shit that had been close. And yet, it was exhilarating. Not at all scary. How tall was it? Two, three,four hundred feet? Putting the camera in his pocket he climbed up a flower stem until he could see over the grass. The Bear was walking toward a house. A huge stucco, wood, plaster, and brick house. It took a moment for his mind to register what he was looking at. Then he quickly climbed back down to the ground.  Opened the rear hatch of the car and started to collect his stuff together. He couldn't carry everything,  but he'd come back later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It had been completely unexpected. Up until this point he never would've guessed that there would be humanoid life in this world but there it was. He stood up and pointed the camera out of the thin door he'd just  made in the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's Taller than the Bear cub. From what I've been able to Gather her name is Emily.  She's probably not much older than 7. Maybe? I cant tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched as the cub and the girl played together as though it was the most natural thing to do. He had to remind himself that here in this place it was the most natural thing to do. Emily was dressed in a blue knee-length dress with short, puffy light blue sleeves and a dark blue-green trim. She also wore dark blue-green striped socks with  a light blue headband and brown ankle-length boots She smiled and laughed. Andy panned the camera up to zoom in on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Despite her size, she looks like a normal healthy Human girl. Cute too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe zoomed in on her laughing mouth noting  how her teeth were unblemished. All baby teeth of course. He held the camera for a few minutes to record how her tongue rose and fell as she laughed, then turned back to the interior of his camp. He wasn't even sure why he had recorded her. Out of habit he supposed.  He'd been doing a lot of mouth recording in the last few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned the camera away from the playing giants and pointed it toward a makeshift table. \"I've been working on something.\" He held up a length of makeshift rope. \"I've got almost enough to climb onto a bed. I need to get a closer look at theme. The Zoom on this camera can only do so much. The Grappling hook is almost ready too. Maybe another few weeks. Doesn't matter. I have all the time in the world. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe panned to a Solar Panel \"Setting up the Solar power tomorrow. If It works I'll be able to review some of this footage on my laptop.

He had pulled out the headlights from his car and had hooked them up to the car battery. Also connected to the battery was a converter he had bought to charge his laptop while he'd been camping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Solar panel has been working perfectly. I can charge my stuff by day and use it at night. McGyver would be proud.\" He pulled the carpeting away from his doorway to look out into the Bedroom beyond. \"Speaking of Night, it's night time here. Late too, around twelve. Little Bear is Asleep. Yeah, that's his name. The Girl called him that. I wonder if that's his real name or just a nickname? When he grows up will they still call him Little Bear? I'm thinking way too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over to where he had his rope and the grappling hook he had made from parts of his car jack .\"I'm all set to go up. I'm setting my camera to night vision so shouldn't be noticed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy collected his gear and stepped out into the vast bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the first time he had gone out into the open, oddly enough he wasn't afraid. Cautious, Yes, but not afraid. Putting together a lighting system and rigging up a way to charge his batteries would've seemed foolish and a waste of time had anyone knew what his intentions were, why go though all that trouble if he was planning to get himself killed? Andy however would not be the one to rush into it. If he had only one shot at this he was going to make it the best, and that meant careful planning and scouting. Which was why he was about to scale Little Bear's bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood at the foot of the bed listening to the cub's deep breathing. Confident that he was asleep, Andy uncoiled the rope he had made and held the hook. He swung it a few times and let it go in an upward arc. It took him several tries before the hook hooked into the fabric of the blanket. Not quite as high as he had hoped, but high enough. It took him longer than he had expected to scale the side of the bed, especially since he had to climb the rest of the way without a rope.  He panted and sat at the edge until he could catch his breath before making his way toward Little Bear's Head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a sight to beheld. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy remembered seeing a Humpback Whale while on a boat tour and he thought the fifty foot long mammal would be the most impressive thing he would ever see up close. That was nothing compared to this creature that wasn't done growing. Little Bear slept on his back and the human's heart raced in his chest as he climbed up onto the sleeping giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood before Little Bear's face and was disappointed at first that his mouth wasn't open. Then, as though on cue, The cub Opened his mouth wide as he yawned in his sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Andy began to take picture after picture even as the vacuum effect of the cub breathing in threatened to suck him into the very Maw he was admiring. The flash of the camera illuminated the interior with every picture revealing detail that he never would've dreamed possible. Then it was over, Little Bear's mouth was closed once again. For a moment Andy just stood there. He could've jumped right in at that moment. It would've been so easy, he would've achieved what others like him would only dream about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Little Bear's nostrils twitched. Then Flared as he smelled something. It took only a moment for Andy to realize the Cub was smelling him! He guessed he really  hadn't been keeping up with his hygiene like he should've been in the last week or so. He backed away and hurried back to his rope before his sent woke the Cub up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at base camp he reviewed the video and photographs he took. He paused at one perfectly shot photo of the interior of Little Bear's Mouth. He traced the ridges of the upper pallet and stared down a throat that seemed to go one forever, and wished he had some way to post it online. Well, online back home. If the guys at the forums would've loved to have seen this one. If they could see him now. They would be so jealous at the very idea that he had the opportunity to live out a life long fantasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy looked about at his hard work. Some of them would've wondered why would he even bother to go though all of this if he was just going get himself ....you know. The answer was simple, he needed the right time. The right opportunity. He only had one shot at this. Until that opportunity came, he had to live. Who knows? Maybe someone else could benefit from his hard work.  <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

None of that mattered to him. In the time since he had climbed up the cub's bed and taken the pictures things had turned for the worst. A spider had gotten into his base of operations and had made itself at home. He had managed to kill it but had decided to move to a better spot. In the process of moving he lost almost everything. He had waited until they were out of the house to make his move, what he hadn't counted on was one of them coming back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had moved his laptop and blankets to the new spot and was in the process of dragging over the rest in a makeshift cart when the door opened and the Mother walked in. He had just barely managed to dive into a crack in the floor before the colossal foot came down. There was an earth shaking THUD and a crunch. And just as quick as that most of what he had was crushed and pulverized. Without a means to charge his laptop and camera he had been using both sparingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things haven't been going well for me, lost my stuff. I won't go into why, I don't have enough power to go into details. That's not important. I think today's the day. I heard them planning a picnic, and the Mother's been baking a pie. That's how I'm going to do it. I'm going to use the last of the power in my laptop to charge my camera. Not saying anyone will ever find it but whoever wants it it's yours. Maybe you'll make a documentary out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome Back. I made it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy panned the camera around. He was standing on a colossal cherry pie. Above him like a canopy was the checkered cloth keeping the pie warm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bit tricky, but I made it just in time. I'm in a basket and it's being carried. So for those of you watching at home, I'm going to jump into this pie. One of the three are going to have an extra intermediate in their slice and it doesn't matter to me which one. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy walked to the center of the pie and held it up to his face one last time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm leaving the Camera right here. I'm not taking it with me. Maybe it'll avoid being crushed between teeth and maybe it won't. Maybe someone will find it, far fetched I know but then a few weeks ago so was this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was it. No last words. Andy had placed the camera still recording down on the pie and walked off. The last sight of him was jumping into the pie filling. What was recorded after was the pie being sliced up, followed by a fork and a shot of the inside of little Bear's mouth before the camera became lodged where Ash had found it as the chewing began.  He could hear Little Bear moan \"MMMMMMM\" and the recording ended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Andy, I hope you got what you wanted\" said Ash. He shut the camera off. He wondered who Ate Andy. </span></div></div>",

Scattered among the cherries were his clothes. He wanted to feel  everything that the giants had to offer. His heart pounded in anticipation. Then the cloth was lifted away, and then came the colossal blade of a knife as the pie was divided.  The slice he was in was placed on a plate and then lifted toward a face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes! It was the mother!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dark brown eyes were looking down toward him, but not at him. Her focused was on the pie she held in one hand. Then Andy saw a flash of silver as the fork came into view. Andy was a bit disappointed that as the fork dug into the pie and lifted it's first mouth full that he was not on it. He watched it disappear between black lips. Mother Bear smiled and chewed slowly. Somewhere beyond his field of vision he heard the cub go \"MMMMM\" Andy turned his attention back to the  Mother in time to hear her swallow. He couldn't wait to be apart of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fork came again. This time it buried itself behind Andy, he heard and felt crust give away and he was lifted upward. This was it! The Mother Bear's face grew larger in his field of vision, and then her mouth opened to receive Andy. It was a mouth that was twice the size of the cubs. Large enough to swallow twenty humans the size of  Andy. The tongue dipped in anticipation as the fork with it's payload passed the threshold that was the lower lip and teeth.  Andy took it all in, bathed in it's glory. Then it all became dark as the mouth closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard the fork scrap against teeth as he was pulled from the mouth, the bit of pie lay momentarily in the center of the tongue before chewing began. Aided by the occasional slivers of light between lips and teeth, Andy quickly made his way to the surface of the tongue even as it pushed pie between molars. He fell upon the tongue even as everything was turned to pulp. He pressed himself into it, burying his face among the taste buds.

Up there on the shelf.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cub turned in the direction the micro human was pointing. \u201cThat\u2019s a boat Father Bear gave me. Would you like to see it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting for an answer, Little Bear reached up and grasped the wooden sailing vessel with one hand/paw. With carefulness not expected from a creature on his size he placed it down in front of Ash. Ash could tell right away that this wasn\u2019t an ordinary wooden toy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWhere did he find this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dHe said it came up in his net. I don\u2019t remember what he called it-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSchooner. It\u2019s a schooner\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mast, sails, and rigging were gone but there was no mistaking it. The wood was old but he could make out her name carved into a plank .It was called the Alice May.  A sea faring vessel made by human hands, and had ended up in this strange land much like he did. Walking around the ship Ash didn't see any holes in the hull that might've caused it to sink, but compared to the scale of waves normally faced by such a crewed boat even a calm sea would\u2019ve swamped the schooner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you help me aboard?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh grasped the Extended a clawed fingertip and held tightly as he was lifted and deposited onto the deck. He was pleasantly surprised to find the wooden planks still strong enough to support his weight. It was in remarkable condition, all things considering. Little Bear watched Ash walk across the deck with great curiosity. He had imagined what it might be like to walk the decks himself but it was another matter to see someone actually do it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh came across the hatch that allowed access to the interior. The hatch itself was long gone leaving the square hole and a stairway. He looked over his shoulder at the dark brown eyes that watched him before descending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked about he breathed a sigh of relief, there were no bleached white bones of the crew. Nor anything else for that matter. This part of the vessel was completely empty aside from some rope and bare bunks. It seemed that when she sank the contents were completely flushed out. There were two doors, one on opposite sides of the ship. He may find something there. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He remembered a Movie once where a girl was being held by a giant Gorilla and she was screaming \"Don't eat me!\" The thought it was stupid, after all it wasn't like the big ape could understand her, and panic wasn't going to help her situation. Now, he looked up at the face and noted how big the cub's mouth was, no wonder she was screaming that. Unlike the actress, he was trying his best to keep his cool. No sense in making an embarrassing fuss if he didn't have too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a creature whose fingers were at least twenty feet long, his grip wasn't as bad as one would think. It was tight, but he could breath. He just couldn't move. Then the fingers loosened and with a yelp he slipped between them only to fall into the waiting palm pad. This was o Little Bear could get a better look at him.  The creature was small. Not much bigger than a beetle. But it looked like a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh felt the hand/paw he was on rise up closer to The cub's face, the huge nostrils flared as he sniffed at the human. The gust of suction tugged at his clothes. He did this as second time, a third.Did Little Bear find his aroma pleasant? No, it was most likely he was picking up his sent. A bear\u2019s sense of smell is 7 times better than a blood hound\u2019s or 2,100 times better than a human. They also have an excellent senses of hearing, which is probably why The cub could hear him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Bear's head tilted to one side, much like a confused dog. The creature smelled like a human too. Ash wondered what he was going to do next?</span></div></div>",

He had a strange look on his face, as though he were debating what to do, then he saw the dark lips part. It looked as though he really would be eaten. His heart pounded in his chest as the mouth opened and drew closer. He breath quickened, he was sure this would be his end. A scream was rising in his throat but he forced it down. If he was to die, he would die with dignity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tip of the tongue slipped out from between those lips like some huge serpent. It pressed him into the center pad of the palm and molded around him. Where his skin was bare, he could feel the taste buds tingle as they registered his particular flavor. When the tongue lifted away, Ash was covered in a thick layer of saliva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I've been slimed!' he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Bear pondered the taste of the tiny creature before him. A bit salty, But there was no doubt it was human, it looked like a human, it felt like a human, it smelled like a human, and tasted like a human. Who would've guessed that time he licked Emily on a dare would be useful. But where did he come from? Perhaps he should ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked about to make sure he wasn't being observed, then he lowered his face closer and whispered \"Hello.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Great.' Ash though as he wiped his face clean 'After covering me in goo NOW he wants to talk.' Well, there was no point in being hostile. After all, he wasn't the one who could crush him with one finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello yourself,\" said Ash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope I didn't scare you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scare me? Of course not.\" sure he'd been scared out of his wits, but no point in letting the cub know that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Little Bear. Do you have a name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Ash, and you are the biggest Little Bear I've ever seem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat confused the cub for a moment, until he realized he was a giant compared to the tiny. The more he thought of it, EVERYTHING was giant to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you come from? I've never seen anyone as small as you before. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Far away. I just woke up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are all alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could take you home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh chucked \"I'm sure you could, But I think it's too far for even you. I wouldn't even know which way to go.\" he shook the Saliva from his hands \"I've really gotten myself in a mess this time. By the way, why did you taste me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to be sure you were human. Sorry about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, it's fine. It's just not something that happens every day. Actually, once I got over my fear I thought it was kinda fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Little Bear think for a moment, the tiny human thought it was fun? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want me to do it again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh could tell from the look on the cub's face that he wanted to play. Playing with a mountain with fur could be dangerous. Then again, it wasn't like he had anything better to do at the moment. Heck, when was he ever going to get a chance like this again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have any friends around here do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Bear shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither do I. So, lets play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that , the cub gave Ash another lick. This time more playfully. Then he licked him a third time.</span></div></div>",

Especially when he considered that a single tooth was twice as big as the human he was holding. That puzzlement had not gone unnoticed by Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little Bear, I was in a Mouth. Your Mouth. No human has ever been in a Bear's Mouth before. A hand, maybe a face, but never a whole body!  And certainly no Mouth as big as yours.

A reminder of his current reality. Climbing out of his hastily created  bush camp he peered out into the world. He could see the cabin much clearer than he had the night before.

Bread maybe, or pancakes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, pancakes maybe fifty feet across. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh looked at the cabin some more, then made up his mind while he drank dew water off a leaf. He knew it was dangerous to go there, but he also knew it was even more dangerous where he was. If the sun didn't burn him up, the awakening predators would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took hours to get there. By then the smell of food was gone. There was the chance of crums though so all wasn't lost.

Like it or not he would have to hitch a ride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked about. To his amazement Emily was on the floor near the couch playing with her doll.

Not only from the Huge structure he was walking toward, but also from the sounds all around him. It was an instinctive fear. A fear not felt since a million years in evolutionary history. Despite not wanting to feel this fear, it helped him quicken his pace despite the soreness of his bare feet or the pain he felt all over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe approached the great door and noticed the gap underneath. It was quite wide, almost wide enough for him to walk under without hunching over. It would make the cabin drafty during winter unless something was placed under the door.

Inside was a sight like something out of Jack and the beanstalk or Honey I shrunk the Kids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh suddenly heard humming. It sounded like it was coming from a closed door. If his guess was right, that door would lead to the room that had the light. Ash could see the glow of ambers in a fireplace. The fire was going down but not out, and it illuminated everything in a reddish glow. It was just enough to light his way. With great caution he approached the door, at this point he could not only hear but feel the footsteps being made by whoever was on the other side of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No turning back now' he thought and walked under the door and into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was her, the one who planted him into the mud with a single step. There was no doubt that the girl who towered hundreds of feet above his head was Emily, though there were some differences considering  he was looking at a three dimensional being and not two dimensional one. Even from where he stood near the door he could see the weave that made up the  nightgown she wore,Every hair on her head, the dermal swirl pattern on the bottoms of her bare feet as she walked. It was not what he'd expected. Everything wasn't just big, it was scaled up, It was like seeing in high definition.  For a moment he thought about running toward her shouting and waving his arms, but he reconsidered. He was in no shape for running  and there was a very good chance She might not look down. The hard wooden floor would be far less forgiving than the Mud if her foot was to fall upon him this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched her blow out the candle and in the darkness he heard her climb into the big wooden bed.  He in tern spent the first few hours looking for a place to spend the night, which he finally did in the closet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of the next few days Ash spent his time gathering what food he could find and finding materials he could use. All the while observing Emily. Not in a voyeuristic sort of way, but to find out more about her, whether she was like her cartoon counterpart. He found out that more or less she was. He also noticed that she didn't look down when she walked, more that once he observed her stepping on an ant that had made it's way into the house. Ash wondered how she avoided some of the nastier things she could be stepping in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy week's end , Ash  decided he knew enough about her to try to get closer and get her attention. During the week he had gathered enough materials to construct a crude grappling hook made from the spiny shells of insects and a length of red thread to use for climbing. He knew the rope itself wouldn't be long enough to get him very far, but he figured it was long enough to hook the edge of her dress, or the edge of a blanket. For the rest of the journey he had crafted climbing hooks from the same material he used for the grappling hook. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he just had to decide, should be try to climb her while she was moving about or should he just climb the bed and wait for her. </span></div></div>",

He had studied her habits enough to figure out that she always stopped in front of the dresser for a few moments to collect her doll. He had to admit it was a small  window of opportunity. He didn't have to wait long as he saw her booted feet approaching. As soon as she stopped moving he ran out from under the dresser, spun  the grappling hook and released it upwards toward the hem of her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe Missed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit\" he muttered as he coiled up the thread to try again. Time was running out. He tried again. This time the hook stuck firm. Without giving a test tug to see if the hook would stay, he Immediately  started climbing the thread, and not a moment too soon as Emily was on the movie again. He held on tight as the thread swayed back and forth with every step. The whole thing had been a lot simpler in his head, to heck with climbing he was just barely managing to hang on for dear life! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely oblivious of the pearl she was causing ,Emily walked toward the front door of the cabin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when the 7 year old stopped to look at a bird in a tree did Ash have the chance to climb up the thread. His muscles burned with fatigue, but he couldn't stop until he was at least on the hem of the dress. Once he was there, he took the climbing hooks that he had hanging around his neck and slipped them onto his forearms. Emily was soon on the move again, but this time he was in a more comfortable position. Climbing was still almost near impossible, and Gods forbid it if she decided to skip, but he slowly inched his way upward. By the time Emily had reached her destination, the home of her friend Little Bear, he had managed to climb almost to her waist. Not bad considering her movement and the fact she was a good four hundred feet tall by Ash's scale. He was exhausted though, his muscles were almost like rubber. He wasn't an athlete by any stretch, and he was lucky to have made it as far as he had. If it were not for the hooks hooking into the thick weave of the dress, he doubted he'd have done it at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, without having to deal with the sway of Emily's Legs, it would be better. But, now which direction should he take? Should he go around the back of her, or her front?   </span></div></div>",

As he was about to find out, he really shouldn't have angered someone as big as Emily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked down at him, her brow frowned, her cheeks getting red. The fingers of the hand he was in began to curl Menacingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grant me my wish, NOW!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was one thing Emily lacked, or at least this version of her, it was patience. She waited long enough and she would wait no longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please!\" begged Ash, clearly terrified \"I can't grant wishes! I just wanted---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all he managed to say before the hand closed into a fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first he was safe in a pocket with only slivers of light shining through cracks between fingers, but soon flesh began to press in all around him making movement impossible. Worst yet, Emily was slowly increasing the pressure. He didn't know off hand the grip strength of the average seven year old, but he figured at his size it was more than enough to cause him physical harm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked at her closed fist angrily.  How dare he not grant her a wish? She caught him fair and square! She was too mad to realize whether she was hurting the tiny creature or not. She didn't realize she was literally squeezing the life out of Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't breath, air escaped his lungs but he couldn't breath in. Stars filled his vision as the flesh pressed harder and harder all around him. He thought for certain his rib cage would collapse and he'd hear the sounds of his own bones breaking before he died. As it turned out, it looked as though he wouldn't be conscious long enough to experience his final moments as he began to black out.</span></div></div>",

It's not like her stomach can really do anything to hurt me,she's only a cartoon for pete's sake and much like Looney Tunes,SpongeBob SquarePants what happens to a cartoon character can't happen to a....wait what am I saying.....this is supposed to be a little kids' educational show! So there's a very good chance I will end up digested....hey,hey get me out of here!\" He leaped up narrowly avoiding the pool of deadly stomach acid and began banging on the pinkish stomach walls and yelling as loud as he could does the seven year old hear his cries in time? </span></div></div>",

He doubted even experienced climbers would attempt it. So he went with the much safer option, and as he scaled the side of the heavy blanket that covered the bed he was sure he'd made the better choice. Not that it was any less dangerous. It was a vertical climb almost from the very beginning. If it were not for his primitive climbing tools he doubted he would've been able to do it at all. Once or twice he'd come close to falling to his death and would have had it not been for the hooks clinging to the fabric of the blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was never so glad when he finally reached the top. He rolled over on his back gasping for breath. To think, he had wanted to climb Emily, what the hell had he been thinking?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh had just managed to catch his breath when he heard and felt footsteps. From the sound of it, he could tell it was more than one. The door opened and Emily entered, but she wasn't alone. Emily and Little Bear walked across the room and sat on the bed, completely unaware  of the Tiny human near her pillows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want to do now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we Jump on the Bed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No, Not Okay!\" Ash cried out, but his voice was too small to be heard by the two young Giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take my shoes off, and you dust off your Paws.\" said Emily slipping off her shoes. Moments later she was standing in sock feet on her bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, they started jumping. For a young child jumping on a bed can be  a lot of fun, but not so much fun if there was a bug size person at your feet.  Ash had no control of anything as he was bounced about in what he thought was a 10 on the rector scale. He didn't even have control over which direction he was going. One  moment he was bouncing closer to Emily's socked feet and other times he was heading toward Little Bear's paws. If they didn't stop soon, he was going to get crushed under one or the other.</span></div></div>",

To be truthful climbing a giant or the giant's bed was a good idea in theory but it was frightful to execute. Not to mention life threatening. So Instead he put aside his climbing tools and decided to focus on surviving until a better time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDays turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months. In that time he had struggled to stay alive. Searching for the essentials was a constant problem. To avoid getting stepped on he had resorted to foraging at night. Finding enough crumbs to eat wasn't a problem, bringing these chunks back to his shelter was.He could only gather food so many times due to the distance between the kitchen and his shelter. He  did consider setting up a second shelter closer to his food source but there were no suitable locations. Collecting water was another problem that had to be solved. Without a bucket or something to collect water in he had to drink when he could and when the time was right. As a result he had gone for a day or more without a drink of water. A dangerous thing to do, which was made even more dangerous by the fact he had to climb up to the window via the curtain and drink the condensation from the window pane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing he noted, while the cartoon Emily remained seven years old eternal, the giant Emily did not. In the time he had been there Ash witnessed from afar the celebration of her eighth Birthday. She was growing too. He'd noticed that as well. Maybe more so due to his stature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while he kept his presence a secret, and probably would've continued to do so were it not for the change in the seasons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had noticed at first that it was getting colder in the nights. Almost freezing.Then when he looked out the window one early morning to drink the condensation off the window pane Ash noticed the change in the color of the leaves on a maple tree near the house.  A sudden realization chilled him to the bone. It was Summer when he was transported to this world, The change in the leaves indicated fall was beginning . After that would be Winter.  A winter here would be devastating to someone of Ash's size. It would be like witnessing the Ice Age. With temperatures he wouldn't be able to handle with his lack of winter clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plan he'd put off for so long raised it's head. Ready or not, he had to get a Giant's attention.       </span></div></div>",

To Ash it was more paw than hand with the exception of an opposing thumb.  He sat in the center of  the palm pad as standing proved to be impossible while the Grizzly Bear cub walked.  Ash thought quietly as they approached the back gate towards the back of the huge house. He could see the garden where the snake known as No Feet lived and were he saw enough food growing to feed a  city for a year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs  they approached the house Ash began to notice how big that door was, and as Little Bear stood before it he realized the cub barely stood half the height of the door.

A huge thick tongue extended outward pressing him into the palm pad  momentarily before he was carried upward on the tip of the tongue as it retracted back into the huge mouth.Ash tried to control his panic as he was surrounded by darkness for a moment until light shined in again through Little bear's lips as he began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought it would be easier to lick you up than for you to climb in.\"The voice came from all around him, he was thrown about on the tip of the tongue as the words were made<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you nearly sacred me to death!\" said Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Okay, but next time warn me first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, look.

Being inside of a Bear Cub's mouth wasn't all that bad. Granted he was soaked to the skin from the thick syrupy saliva that covered the tongue and dripped from above, but it was also really amazing. Looking out past huge slightly stained teeth and slightly closed lips he watched as Little Bear opened the Door to his house and stepped inside. Then Little Bear Closed his mouth sealing him in darkness. though the air was humid and stale it was breathable and it was a very interesting feeling of  moving as quickly as Little Bear was walking.

Fortunately he had a good grip on some strands if fur when the cub took his first steps into the house, otherwise he would've toppled forward and rolled down the length of his muzzle. Maybe even fallen off his nose. The cub had only made a few steps into the home when he was greeted by his mother. Mother Bear was a true giant compared to Little Bear who only stood just at her waist. The Cub's head tilted back as he gazed up at his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Little Bear. Had fun with Emily today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ash held on tightly to keep from sliding backward down the back of the Cub's neck. He looked up and his breath caught in his throat as Mother Bear lifted her Hand. A hand bigger than Little Bear's and Emily's combined. It hovered overhead for a seconded or two, then it was upon him. Huge claw tipped fingers gently ran through the thick tuff of fur on Little Bear's head, a gesture she'd done a hundred times before. Fur and fur collided among the pillars of flesh and bone and in his attempts to try to stay on Little Bear's head Ash was unsure as to who's fur he was grabbing hold of. </span></div></div>",

He felt like a mountain climber suddenly finding himself in the middle of an earthquake. As tired as his hands were getting from holding on so tightly a fall from his current height would be fatal, even if he survived he'd break every bone in his body and most likely be finished off by one perfectly placed foot fall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P--Please stop walking!\" he cried out in a loud voice. Well, as loud a voice as he could muster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMother Bear walked through the home humming a little tune to herself. She didn't hear the cries of  her tiny passenger clinging to her finger, nor did she even feel him. If she had she would've shown him some mercy and allowed him to ride in her huge palm. Instead she walked on to the living room and sat in her  favorite chair as was her custom when the daily chores were finished. Some days she'd knit, but today she decided to read a book she hadn't read in some time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved to be finally not moving, Ash looked about at his surroundings. The title of the book held in the hand he clung to was \"Gulliver's Travels\". Appropriate. Well, he saw two course of actions. He could climb down Mother Bear's long Dress to the Floor and find Little Bear, or he could climb upward to Mother Bear's ear and make himself known. He wasn't too excited about that one as he really wanted to avoid the Adults for now simply because their size scared him more than the Children. Little too late for that one though.</span></div></div>",

At least it made it easier to climb as  the material made perfect hand and foot holds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good thing too that he'd had some experience in mountain climbing, though he'd never tried a climb of this height without equipment.

He looked upward, Mother Bear was still reading away, it was then he noticed the name of the writer off the book. Odd, the Title clearly said \"Gulliver's Travels\"  but the author wasn't Jonathan Swift.  It was an Author he'd never heard of before. Ash wondered in this world who Had written \"20,000 leagues Under the Sea\"?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sudden movement and the leg that was under the long dress shifted. Ash looked down and saw Mother Bear's foot sticking out from under the edge of the Dress. It was right where Ash had planned to climb to the floor.

Emily had convinced him that  his clothes had to be cleaned,  but  she was having a very difficult time convincing him he needed a bath.  She didn\u2019t understand what the big deal was.  Everyone Bathes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEmily, it is simply not appropriate for me to be naked in front of a lady.\u201d Ash explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not gentleman like.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully, it wasn\u2019t appropriate  for Ash to be naked in front of  a 7 year old girl. No matter  that she was  about four hundred feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily  folded arms.  \u201cIt\u2019s  not like I don\u2019t know  what Boys have. If you'er worried about that, You\u2019re so small I can\u2019t even see yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh that makes things SOOOO much better.\u2019 Thought Ash. Then he said \u201cWhere did You learn about that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGranny  told  me. She  thought  I should  know. Now come on,  the water is getting cold.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t you  bring the water here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll spill it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh doubted   that very much.  There  was  a  moment  of Silence.  Then Emily said \u201cWhat If I closed my eyes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily repeated \u201cWhat if I closed my eyes?  I\u2019ll pick you up between my fingers with my eyes closed and open them when I put you in the water.  You\u2019ll still be covered up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t like the idea, but it was better than arguing. \u201cOkay. Let\u2019s do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily lowered her hand down.  As promised she closed her eyes.  When she felt Ash touch the tip of her index finger she carefully closed her thumb and index finger together and opened her eyes. Held securely, and with his dignity intact, she lifted Ash up to eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Ash the sensation of  his bare skin against scaled up dermal ridges of Emily's fingertips was different to say the least. Despite being covered up by the two walls of flesh  he was never so glad when he slipped between them into the thimble of soapy water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about your undergarments but i'm sure you're pants and shirt are clean.\" they just need to dry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later Ash was as clean as he could get without a proper bath towel. Grasping the thimble between her fingers she carefully emptied the water out of it and dumped Ash into a white handkerchief where she quickly covered him up with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't so bad, was it?'\" Emily addressed the cloth in her cupped hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I didn't mean to dunk you that hard into the water.\" She said with a cute giggle <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Cough,cough....</font> Yeah I.....I'm fine just cold!\" He admitted as the water was freezing a bit then again they must not have had indoor plumbing out here in the woods!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cold?\" Emily repeated arching a eyebrow \"That can't be right the water was just hot a few minutes ago. But anyway here let me get you something to wear hold on for a bit......\" As she left him still wrapped in the handkerchief trying to keep warm and went to her dresser drawer and opened up a secret compartment where she kept all of her doll Lucy's spare clothes and ironically she collected a few boy doll clothes and came back to Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go Ash I hope these can fit you I'll just turn away until you finish.\" <br>\r\nIt only took him a few minutes to put on the clothes which was old fashioned boy clothes from the early 1900s or 1910 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I'm done you can turn around now Emily.\" He announced she did gushing as she saw him <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh you look so cute in those clothes Ash! I'm sorry you can't put on your regular clothes but I'm afraid you'll ruin them with your wet soaked body.\" She explained <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Emily so what do you want to do now that I'm all cleaned up?\" He asked but she didn't reply instead she said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry my grandmother almost stepped on you Ash. I'd have cried out in time for her not to step into the room but I was distracted by that game we were playing I couldn't think of what to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that bad at least she didn't use her whole foot.

Don't you have.....\" He began but she nodded <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I do have parents Ash they live in the big city far away from here where I go to school  but during the spring and summer and often times winter I come here to stay with my grandmother and play with my friends Little Bear and the rest of them why did you think I was a orphan or something?\" She arched her eyebrows <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well to tell the truth yes I did no offense.\" He said truthfully <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem Ash Little Bear asked me the exact same thing when we first met but I'm getting a bit hungry.\" She announced unexpectedly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So am I! What I wouldn't give to have a hot steaming pizza right now!\" He said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pizza? What's that?\" She asked curiously <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...it's a type of food sort of like a pie you know round but has cheese,pepperoni,sausage.....\" But stopped as she looked even more confused <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay you know what spaghetti is right? The stuff with noodles and meatballs?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I'm familiar with spaghetti.\" Emily nodded <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well pizza is similiar to it but you can cut it into several slices or pieces and....what am I saying? This must be completely confusing to you! For someone as young as you you probably don't want to hear this.....\" Ash palm faced himself but she shook her head <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No this is very interesting to me Ash! Please tell me more.\" She pressed him <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Re-really? You find all this talk of food interesting?\" He asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes very interesting! It's actually making me hungrier than ever! And this 'pizza' sounds very delicious! But can you tell me more about food from your world Ash?\" She leaned forward even closer to the point where she practically was face to really,really big face to him <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er okay....\" He replied wondering what he should tell her first......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I would never treat you or think of you that way! You know that don't you? I only want to keep you safe and help you out if I can but since I don't know how you got that way in the first place...so for the time being I'm afraid you're stuck with me unless....unless you want to find someone else to keep you safe!\" Her tone got ugly again as she turned her back on him folding her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No that would be both really hard and I wouldn't be able to find a kinder....person like you.\" He admitted <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you mean that?\" Emily turned back around with a sweet smile everything she said seemed to vanish <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do.

There was one episode he fondly remembered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...The Heartless Giant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I've never heard of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, get comfortable,and I'll tell you the tale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily lay on her stomach on her bed with Ash cupped in her hands. When he was certain she was ready, he began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the whole, there's absolutely no need to be frightened by Giants. Giants are gentle souls, perfectly harmless, and very affectionate. Unless, of course, the Giant has no heart in his body. Think of all kinds of unpleasant things and add Giant to them and that's what you get when a Giant has no heart. Such a Giant once terrorized a county in the far north of the world, near the very top. He'd hidden his heart. It gave him too much trouble, all those Giant Feelings, too much pain. In its place was a wasps' nest. About to swarm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This Heartless Giant could shake a man and shuffle his wits. He could crack a skull with his fist like a walnut. And frequently did. Until, at last, the old King of that country, as good as the Giant was bad, trapped him in a giant trap and locked him in a cell. And there he would've remained, had it not been for a little boy. A young prince named Leo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued while Emily listened with great interest how the Giant had tricked Leo into getting the keys to his prison, how his two brothers had gone out to find the giant and never returned. How he himself had gone look for his friend the Heartless Giant, how he had mended a bird, saved a fish and befriended a wolf. How he had come across the Giant's house with a garden filled with people turned to stone by the Giant, how he'd found his brothers among those who were now stone. How he had tricked the giant into revealing where his heart was, and how he retrieved it. And what had happened when Leo's brother, upon being restored to flesh and blood, had killed the giant by crushing the egg that had held the Giant's Heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the Giant fell a hill grew. And in time, when much was forgotten, when many Kings had come and gone, the place was still known as the Hill of the Heartless Giant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, he would've changed that Giant.\" said Emily, a little sad \"He would've been kind,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, cruel. \" said Ash \" Prince Leo lived to be a great age, became King, had forty-two grandchildren, and told them all that tale. But in his story the Giant got back his heart and made amends for all his wrongs. Because, you see, despite all that took place, a little boy once met a Giant and they became friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh looked out the distant window,\"It's getting dark. I would imagine it's almost bed time for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily nodded, Then Asked</span></div></div>",

But the next thing he knew there was a super loud rumble in his ear along with a powerful gust of hot humid air. Ash shook the cobwebs of sleep away in time for another loud rumble and powerful gust. It took him a few moments to realize what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho would've thought a kid could snore that loud? It was like standing next to a jet engine with a cold. As his eyes adjusted he could see Emily had turned in her sleep and was now sleeping in an awkward position. Her mouth Hung open lightly and from there a rumble erupted rhythmicly . He shook his head. There was no way he was going to sleep like this. Anybody who had ever awaken to loud snoring would tell you how difficult it is to try to get back to sleep to that noise. Imagine trying to go back to sleep when the person snoring is bigger than King Kong? Down right impossible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought about hiding under the pillow but decided against it as the idea of Emily rolling over on the spot he was under did not hold much appeal.Perhaps it would be better if he were to try a different place on the bed other than that side of the pillow? That could work. Anything was better than where he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh surveyed the bed. The way he saw it, he had two options. He could go the long way around and avoid Emily's sleeping form, or he could simply climb over her head to the other side of the pillow. That was the quickest route, but also the most dangerous. Should he cause an itch Emily might scratch. Or worst, Swatt. </span></div></div>",

Wake up you're snoring far too loud and I can't get a lick of sleep or peace.\" But still in a daze she shook her head muttering a inaudible reply <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...huh what was that grandmother? No I don't want to go to school today....Lucy and I are too tired....\" Ash rolled his eyes <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great she's far too zoned out and talking in her sleep.

But He'd awoken abruptly to find himself pressed up against cloth and flesh buy the slightly sweaty palm of Emily's hand. He didn't realize what it was at first because waking up like that had been disorienting. But a quick touch and feeling dermal ridges confirmed where he was. The sound of breathing and the rumble of a heart beat also told him that Emily had him pressed against her chest as she slept on her back. Just how he'd slept though that he had no idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hand above him heavily pinned him to Emily's chest. She didn't seem to be holding him in place intentionally but simply by the shear weight of a hand that had a palm that was twenty feet across. The air was getting thick as he exhaled, that and the weight of the hand making it hard to breath. Worst still, he didn't have much room as far as movement goes. In fact he was pretty much rendered immobile.  His clothes were getting damp from the moistness of the palm. The moisture he knew was a combination of sweat and oils that produced finger prints. He was going to need to wash his clothes at some point, providing he could get out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to get out from under her hand. But how? He couldn't really do much other than move a hand and turn his head. When he did that his face was pressed into the flesh of Emily's palm. And then it came to his mind, maybe he could tickle her palm enough to get her to move it off him. It was his only option, if he stayed under this mountain of flesh he was going to smother to death. He had a hand to tickle, but he also had another option. He remembered when he was kids putting his hand over his cousin's mouth. His reaction was to lick the palm of his hand which grossed him out. It could work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to do both. With his free hand Ash tickled the palm while he proceeded to lick at the palm above him. He noted that Emily's skin had a salty taste from the sweat, and an unusual texture to it. Though he didn't think his affords were effective at first, it did eventually have an effect. The hand began to move. </span></div></div>",

It was as bad as that time he'd gone through the ice over lake Crystal when he was younger. He wrapped his arms around himself and walked to try to keep warm, but despite his efforts he was shivering uncontrollably.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe landscape was barren, completely deprived of life, except for him. Not even vegetation. Everything was white, and yet oddly enough the air smelled sweet. Like Vanilla. That should've given him a clue as to where he was, but he was too cold to think straight. All he wanted to do was find or build some kind of shelter and to get warm before ----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"MMMMMMMMMMMMMM\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound was so loud that even the very air vibrated violently. By all rights his eardrums should've exploded from the volume. He was bounced about and landed on his back. As he gazed up he was overwhelmed by the sense of Awe and absolute terror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily's face filled the sky above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as though he were looking into the face of a god. The look on her face was one of glee and enjoyment. He suddenly realized by he had been smelling Vanilla. In his mind he imagined Emily with an Ice cream cone in her hand, holding it to her mouth, anticipating that first lick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh saw the mouth begin to open, a blast of immense heat instantly warmed him but also melted the landscape around him. He sunk in surface, but was too awestruck to try to escape. Even if he could, escape was be impossible. He saw the great tongue extend past white teeth. As it grew closer he could see saliva run between every mountainous taste like rivers.The tip impacted hundreds of miles away but the \"Ground\" beneath was lifted  up from under him. He felt himself being lifted way and  the mouth grew larger and larger he was riding the tip of the tongue towards his doom. He screamed futilely as the tongue slipped back between Mountainous teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen everything grew dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat up and looked about. It was still dark, but after a moment he remembered where he was. Beside him Emily slept quietly. Her breath blew in his face in humid burst. He ran his hands through his hair. That was one hell of a nightmare. He knew it must have his brain's way of trying to process the idea of giants hundreds of feet tall, It didn't change how vivid it had been. Is this what it was going to be like for him? How many more such dreams would he have before he stopped having him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe instead of being afraid in his dream he should force himself to feel other emotions instead of fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lay back down and stared up at a ceiling that was too dark for him to see. After awhile he closed his eyes and went back to sleep. </span></div></div>",

If I tried really hard I could make them into anything I wanted them to be. So the next time I had a bad dream I found I could changed it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh considered the idea for a moment. Why not give it a try? The worst that could happen would be that it wouldn't work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll try it tonight, in the meantime though what are we going to do today?\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wh---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for Ash to remember where he was, his young but Giant friend was still asleep in her bed across the room. Looking out the window of the bedroom he could see the sun was just starting to rise over the horizon. Well, since he was up, he may as well stay up. climbing out of the bed and putting his pants and shoes back on, he reflected on his Nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had brought it on? Any number of things for sure. Maybe it was his brain trying to process the impossible, maybe it was something left over from an age when giant things really were trying to eat you. The more he thought about it though, the more he found the concept stimulating. If he had a digestive proof environmental suit and a camera he could get some amazing Discovery channel worthy footage. He could even sell the footage to Discovery. They could Call the special \"Eaten Alive\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, that would never work.\" said Ash shaking his head. \"I'd probably chicken out at the last minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the idea of being in a mouth that big was interesting. Who could say they were in something that big and lived? Too bad he didn't have a camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a minute, he did!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh reached into his pocket and took out his Go-Pro. He had planned to take pictures with it but with all the craziness going on he'd totally forgot he had it. Even had a fully battery charge.  Maybe something to think about later. Right now, he had other things to think about. Like the possibility of maybe not going home again. That was a possibility. After all, what happened to him might've been a freak incident that might never happen again, even if it did there was no guarantee whatever sent him here could send him to his proper world. The number of realities out there could be infinite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he'd have to just get used to being without technology, electricity, and dependence. Especially dependence. At the moment there was very little he could do for himself. As far as getting food and such he'd have to rely on Emily. In a way, the situation reminded him of the land of Brobdingnag from  Gulliver's Travels. Maybe he could write about it, or have someone else write it for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, now that he was up, what to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This was something nobody had ever seen before that that scale. Imagine the mouth of an average child scaled up to 15 feet wide. Imagine that mouth opened wide and accelerating toward you and closing just a foot from where you are sitting. Imagine as that same child held that spoon stationary as she chewed and swallowed enough food to feed a family and then some for a month. By the time She had finished the bowl, Emily was quite relaxed and even smiling at this little ride she was giving her little friend. Maybe this wouldn't be so bad after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it's time.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good a time as any.\" said Ash \"Pass me the end of the thread , please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing into the palm of her hand, Ash tied a climbers harness around his waist. It had been a few years since he'd done one but the thread was as flexible as any rope he'd used.

He took a deep breath of foul air and knew right away where he was. Taking out the pin light attached to his key ring he clicked it and shined the light around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the stomach was chaos. The walls flexed and churned the chewed contents of Emily's Breakfast. She had swallowed air as she ate so there was a breathable atmosphere, though the smell wasn't exactly pleasant. Knowing he did not have time to waste, Ash began taking pictures. Not particularly focusing on which area of the chamber. Looking down he watched as the milk mixed in with the  the dissolving sludge that was once been Emily's Breakfast. <br>\r\nHe was thankful to have tied that harness, had he only been holding onto the rope he was certain he would've lost his grip as he'd was rushed along by the milky rapids.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt the thread tug upward. Looked Emily wasn't willing to keep him in there any longer than she had to, not that it mattered as it was really becoming more volatile in her stomach. To stay any longer would risk permanent injury. As his back pressed up against the slimy valve that let him in, it looked as though it wouldn't open. There was a tug by Emily, but it didn't look like he was going to be able to get through. Then he heard the roar of liquid above him. Thinking quickly he closed his eyes tightly and held his breath as gallons of milk came down on top of him. It was enough to open the valve  to let him through. Going upward the walls of the esophagus tried to send him back down, but as before the muscles in the tube could not flex tight enough to force him back down. He saw light as he was once again in her throat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that.\" Emily's voice was all around him and light flickered as her mouth formed words. A moment later Ash was back into Emily's mouth. He took one more picture before he was raised away from her mouth and lowered into her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.

The sound of Emily's heart beating and her breathing resonated all around him. Down below he could hear the gurgling of her stomach. The walls of the esophagus flexed around him as he made his way down but did not come in close enough to hurt him. He took a few more pictures, it was like going down the shaft of a well and with the second or third flash he could see the valve that opened into the stomach chamber. As he touched it, the valve opened to accept him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the stomach was chaos. The walls flexed and churned the chewed contents of Emily's Breakfast. She had swallowed air as she ate so there was a breathable atmosphere, though the smell wasn't exactly pleasant.  He counted his time as Emily counted outside. Knowing he did not have time to  waste, Ash began taking pictures. Not particularly focusing on which area of the chamber. looking down he was thankful not to be in the dissolving sludge that was once been Emily's Breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugged and took a picture of that too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt the thread tug upward. Emily's count was faster than his, not that it mattered as it was becoming more volatile in her stomach. As his back pressed up against the valve that let him in, it looked as though it wouldn't open. Then there was a blast of foul air as Emily burped. It forced just enough air to open the valve enough to let him through. Going upward the walls of the esophagus tried to send him back down, but as before the muscles in the tube could not flex tight enough to force him back down. He saw light as he was once again in her throat, a moment later Ash was back into Emily's mouth. He took one more picture before he was raised away from her mouth and lowered into her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfectly fine.

She couldn't find her friend anywhere in her room. He wouldn't have left the room, it would've been too dangerous.

Imagine if you were the kind of giant from my old big blue book of fairy tales.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked to her left, remembering \"Be he live or be he dead, I'll grind his bones to make my bread\" She looked at Ash and lifted her palm closer as if to appraised him, then concluded \" You wouldn't make much bread\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh Laughed \"Lucky for me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of Bread, I could use some right about now. How about you wait here while I get some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily placed her hand on her Dresser and Ash climbed off. \"Be right back\" she said, then left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh watched her go. This was going to be interesting. He'd never seen Emily eat before and from the size of her she could eat enough food to satisfy an army. He just imagined what it would be like to see teeth bigger than him pulverize that much food. Guess he wouldn't have long to wait.</span></div></div>",

So I decided a personal favorite snack of mine would be more suitable for the both of us!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You like PB &amp;J too? Far out me too!\" Ash blurted out unable to help himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PB &amp;J? What's that mean?\" The 7 year old arched a eyebrow eerily confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's another way for people in my timeline to pronounce peanut butter and jelly sandwiches Emily.\" He quickly explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,. She muttered as she easily began pulling apart bits of the sandwich in really small bite size pieces for him. \"I never heard of that before:PB &amp;J...it is a bit easier to say than just peanut butter and jelly sandwiches all the time! And that other word 'Far Out' what does that one mean?\" As she began taking bites out of her own sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh it's just another saying for really neat or fascinating.\" Ash shrugged as he began gulping down the food like he hadn't eaten in days which for his part was mostly true ever since he was first transported to this gigantic world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey don't eat so fast like that! You'll make yourself sick!\" Emily said urgently as the tiny boy suddenly looked ashamed of his actions and muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah..sorry,it's been a few days since I had anything to eat!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they finished up Emily was about to take the now empty plate back downstairs when she turned back around to look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash,how would you like to meet my friend Little Bear? I was planning to meet him and his parents down by the stream for some fishing.\" As he looked up bewildered and a bit scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meet your friend,the bear cub? A-are you sure that's a good idea?\" He stammered over his own words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it is. You don't have to be afraid of Little Bear Ash,or his parents,they're not like the real live bears in your world. They're all very friendly.\" Emily said smiling as she paused for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you say Emily,but you don't really know wild animals' instincts do you? I mean sure they may seem friendly and pleasant to you right now but where I come from and in most parts of the world bears even trained ones or those kept in captivity are known to attack humans....\" Ash tried his best to explain to the giant girl but she merely shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little Bear and his parents aren't like those wild bears Ash,they'll never attack humans or try to eat them. I've been friends with him for two years now and he's never hurt or had any urge to attack me or any of our other animal friends like Hen,Duck,Cat or Owl. You have absolutely nothing to worry about.\" As she reached down and carefully picked him up and headed down the stairs informing her grandmother where she was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit later the two of them arrived to the small stream where dozens of fish were leaping out of the clear,sparkling blue water and Ash's eyes widened as he saw the three gigantic family of bears standing on the edge of the small grassy hill,the smallest one unlike his parents who were strangely fully dressed in convincing human attire clothing didn't have on any clothes at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh there Little Bear and his parents now!\" Emily announced happily. \" Come on I'll introduce you Ash.\" As she practically ran over to where they were and Ash's fears were suddenly intensified as he saw just how utterly enormous they really were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"If this were the Real World all of them Emily included were technically be like Godzilla to my world's population.....but those bears....\" </i> There was just something uneasy he felt about them even as they politely and pleasantly greeted the little girl with Little Bear standing on his hind legs and hugging her then Adh began to slowly think maybe he was just being paranoided about the whole thing,as Emily stated there was nothing dangerous about these family of bears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you too Father and Mother Bear!\" Emily was saying before she suddenly remembered the tiny boy she was holding onto and pulled Ash in front of them as expected all their eyes widened a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I just remembered this is my new friend Ash everyone, Ash this is my best friend Little Bear and his parents Mother and Father Bear.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...Emily what is that you're holding?\" Father Bear asked curiously as he slowly leaned in closer and the tiny boy actually shrank back a bit in fear at those sharp teeth of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Father Bear,Ash is a human like I am but...he's small,really small.\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear how did he get like this? Was he possibly born this way?\" Mother Bear asked looking confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I don't think so. According to him he said he traveled from his world somehow and winded up in ours. I really don't understand it myself but I believe what he's saying is true.\" Emily explained smiling at him sunnily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I please hold him Emily?\" Little Bear asked leaning forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure but be careful Little Bear.\" Emily said as much to his shock Ash was passed to the bear cub it felt like to him standing on the world's softest pillow as the giant bear's hand was surprisingly soft and warm just like Emily's was and for some reason he felt quite relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's so tiny Emily,are you certain he's not a goblin of some kind from the forest?\" Little Bear asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I believe he said he's from the Real World wherever that is and according to him if any of us were to go there with him all of us were be literal 'giants' compared to the people there. But he's also a very nice person Little Bear and we have been having a lot of fun together for the past few days haven't we Ash?\" She beamed happily at the tiny boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well pleased to meet you Ash,\" Mother Bear said bowing politely though he didn't understand why she would actually bow to him like that,apparently being incredibly generous and polite was absolutely important to these people in this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any friend of Emily's is a friend of ours.\" Father Bear chimed. \"Would you two like to join us in a fine day of fishing? I thought we should be enough to catch enough for tonight's supper.\" As he brought out a old fashioned fishing pole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes we'd love to!\" Emily blurted out happily before Ash could think to say anything after a bit of nothing but fishing in the steam Emily soon noticed her tiny friend's sudden mood change and decided to......<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was more uneasy though at the fact that he'd be around Giants of such size and power, especially when they happen to be Grizzly bears. On his world they were apex predators. Here, they appeared to be more civilized. He had to remind himself  of what Emily had told them about this family of Ursula. If she said they wouldn't harm him, that would be good enough for now. He just had to keep himself in check that's all. No point in ruining everyone else day over his paranoia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Father Bear had called a stream, Ash called a river. One of the Big rivers. Like the Mississippi. What colossal fish could be living in waters like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh found out some minutes later as Father Bear bated the hook and sat on a big rock. Ash watched from Little Bear`s Hand/Paw. No sooner had  the hook and it's bate entered the water that it was quickly yanked out again with a fish. Father Bear had thrown it back, deeming it \"Too Small\" . Too Small? The last time Ash saw a fish that big Captain Ahab was hanging off the side of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFather Bear lowered the hook again, this time when he felt the line tug and he pulled the hook out of the water there was a fish he was satisfied with. This one was twice as big as the one he had thrown back. Ash looked at the water. There was no way in heck he was going swimming in there. Not a chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh had become so fascinated by the fishing that he gradually got over his paranoia and began to enjoy himself. As he sat and observed this Bear family, he  couldn't help but wonder 'He's wearing clothes, she's wearing clothes, why is Little Bear in his Birthday suit? Is it a cultural thing?' He saw no privates but he knew the cub had to have them. Somewhere. Hidden by thick fur. Maybe that's why he could get away with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother splash and another colossal fish. That was Five so far. Six if you counted the one that was thrown back. </span></div></div>",

B-but you're a girl?\" As he nearly burst out laughing but stopped at her stern expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah so? There's nothing wrong with me wanting to play with toy soldiers is there Ash?\" She pouted folding her arms and giving him a angry stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I guess not okay so what exactly do you want to do with all these soldiers and me?\" He asked curiously there had to be over thirty or more wooden soldiers in all,she must have liked collecting them as every single one of them was in perfect condition not a single scratch or tear on any of their clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you'll love this Ash....I have been playing this game for days now and oh I almost forgot.......\" As she went over to same place where the doll house was at and brought down a huge plastic castle setting it on the floor beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A toy castle....so...so you want to play....Knights or King and Queens....\" He quickly caught on as she excitedly nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I always enjoyed pretending my toy soldiers are heroic knights protecting the castle from the evil dragon,Lucy is the princess and I'm the Royal Queen and ruler of the land  of course.\" She said merrily as she opened up the castle showing him the various parts like the outside moat,the dining area,the dungeons and throne room with two actual removable throne like chairs,there was even a small Round Table at the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay and where do I fit in with all this?\" He asked but wished he hadn't said it as she quickly reached into the small box she brought into the room pulling out a small purple outfit designed for a king or prince,it came completed with a small golden crown and staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't tell me. I'm going to be the-gulp King?\" He swallowed hard as she nodded excitedly even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep you guessed right! <i>Giggle</i> so Ash would this be a game you might be interested in?\" As she looked hopeful and he slowly nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah I guess so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hooray! Oh good thank you Ash,okay first thing you need to properly attired and dressed like a king and since I'm already wearing a dress,all I need is....\" As she pulled out a small silver plastic crown from her toy chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There now I'm Queen Emily,Ruler of the Magical Kingdom and this is Princess Lucy,the most beautiful person(besides me) in the land.\" As she picked up her treasured doll and sat her on a small stool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Ash aren't you going to get dressed? You're supposed to be the king after all.\" She said looking at him with a sweet grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh er okay....\" As he went behind the enormous bed to change and came back thinking he looked utterly ridiculous in this stupid doll's outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you look so cute dressed like that!\" The giant girl gushed unable to control herself as soon as she laid her eyes upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er thank you...okay so now what?\" He asked as she suddenly picked him up and set him in one of the plastic throne like chairs in the tiny throne room and one by one began setting the numerous toy soldiers and other plastic and wooden doll people around various spots in the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay now we're almost finished.\" She announced happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay so what happens now?\" Ash asked unable to sit properly in the stone hard throne so that his legs were sticking halfway out of the seat and his back was already aching from leaning too hard against the back of the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I almost forgot again...you need to read the Royal degree to send out your best knights to slay the dragon!\" Emily said handing him a tiny piece of paper with some equally tiny handwriting on it,he could tell it was hers as he saw her almost perfect type of writing before,for a mere 7 years old she certainly was way ahead of most kids in his timeline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I'll read it and send out...hold on where's the dragon at?\" He asked looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh! I completely forgot that too!

All was well in this kingdom until one day a man road to the castle bringing news that soon brought the whole kingdom in a state of panic and terror. A Giant was approaching the kingdom.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now ,for the most part, giants do not tend to be inherently evil. Oh you do have the occasional ones who would grind men's bones to make bread but that was a rare thing among Giants.

They don't mean to , it's simply a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. The Giant that approached  this kingdom was one of the biggest.\"</span></div></div>",

So, with no other option,  he began to walk in that direction. Word had spread of both the Giant and of Ash who had slain Seven in one Blow. He met many people as they abandoned their homes and were heading to the castle with their worldly possessions. Some viewed him with hope. Others didn't see anything that was even remotely impressive. But all greeted him and wished him luck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuck? He was going to need a Miracle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked for most of the day and  finally rested at an abandoned farm house. It was nothing Fancy. A house, a Bail of hay, and a wagon filled with Pumpkins. He sat on the step and pondered what he was going to do. How to you even slay a giant? He had only heard of someone doing that once, and that involved a giant beanstalk. Nah, that would never work. No beanstalk. He hadn't been sitting  for very long before he started to notice a tremor in the ground. He blinked.

A feeling of Dread fell over him. He knew what it was.  He stood and looked about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the giant. No question about it. The darkness was its shadow.Ash blinked. It was a Girl. Well that was unexpected. He expected a brute with a beard like the kind he had read about. With a single step she  flattened out a Hill, with two more she displaced the water of a pond. It was clear she was heading in his direction. With the ground heaving about him, Ash staggered and looked for a place to hide. He was not prepared whatsoever to do battle with a creature of that magnitude!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had three options, none of them were good. The wagon of pumpkins, the bale of hay and the farm house.

He'd never known the inside of a stomach before, but if he could imagine it this is what it would look like. Slimy wrinkly pink walls with a floor that was littered with chewed food stuff in a growing foul liquid bile. Instinctively he crawled away from the liquid. He wasn't sure what it was but he knew it was bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe match went out, burning his fingertips. He had to get out. Even if it were possible he didn't want to live in a stomach. He did the only thing he could think to do. With Both hands he began pounding on the nearest wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the stomach the Giant was about to finish off the wagon of pumpkins when she began to feel a queer sensation in her stomach. It was a tickling  feeling. Something was alive in her stomach.  She rubbed her stomach. whatever it was, it was determined to keep up this annoyance. That wouldn't do at all. She opened her mouth wide and began to gulp down air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn side the stomach, Ash's ears suddenly popped as the air pressure changed. What was the Giant doing? Then it suddenly occurred to him. Of course! it was something that he'd done countless times when he drank beer. She was about to----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><br>\r\nBEALCH!!!!!!</font></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he was thrown upward and there was blinding light. He didn't fall for long though and landing into something that felt soft and had a strange texture to it. His eyes were still not adjusted to the light but somehow he knew exactly where he'd landed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Giant had him in the palm of her hand. What was she going to do to him?</span></div></div>",

Ash climbed down from the giant girl\u2019s hand and approached a large gap in the stump.  It looked all the world like something out of An Indiana Jones movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Only the penitent man will pass.\u2019 He thought, then out loud \u201cWhere did you find them? Just out here? \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily nodded holding Lucy tight  \u201cBe careful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will.\u201d Ash too out the pin light he had on his key chain. As he walked deeper the little light  revealed a great many things. The ground was littered with items, most were still recognizable though rusted into ruin.  The Big surprise though was what he found just a little farther ahead. A wall of metal and concrete. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Ash only a moment to realize he was looking at a building. Buried under the roots of the tree.  There was a huge hole where the wall hard partially collapsed. He carefully stepped inside and looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Mall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor was uneven, as well as the ceiling. But what shops he could see looked intact.  Items shelved and on display waiting for customers that would never come. Something caught his eye. A newspaper on the floor. It was a newspaper. More importantly it was a Newspaper from his home town. It was dated 1987. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly it hit him. Of Course! This must\u2019ve been the Babel Mall.  They said it had been swallowed up by a freak sink hole.  It must\u2019ve appeared among the roots of the tree and was only disturbed when someone cut the tree down.  He looked at the stores through the glass barriers that were not broken. Beyond the glass wall  was like a time capsule. Everything was preserved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe there was something here he could find useful.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not all areas of the mall were perfectly preserved. Some places didn't stand the test of time and decayed badly. But there was enough so that he had the essentials.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition to the 80\u2019s style clothing and a bed, he was able to find camping equipment; sleeping bags , backpacks, portable stove with  propane cylinders.  There were flashlights, but after so many years almost every pack of batteries he found was corroded and leaking. Except for maybe the rechargeable.  If he could figure out how to charge them he\u2019d be okay. He made a note to himself to check out the radioshack  the next time he went back in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the chair and a collection of dated books and magazines.   All in all, he had enough to make sure he lived comfortably for a while. All he needed was a place to keep them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily provided that solution by helping him build a cabin. Well, a Box made from twigs and held together with glue. But if you live in it that makes it a cabin. It had two floors.  The upper floor was his living area, while down below he kept his supplies.  It wasn\u2019t exactly what he called perfect but for the moment he could call it home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe best part of it was that it was portable.

That's a odd name for such a place! What do they sell in there?\" She asked curiously <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mostly radios but they sell all sorts of things used for everyday mechanical work like spark plugs,fuses,batteries you know the works.\" Ash replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The works? What does that mean?\" The seven year old asked scratching her head \"And what is a radio?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...you mean you ridden on a train before but you never heard or listened to a radio?\" He arched a eyebrow utterly surprised <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I'm familiar with trains but not these radios or spark plugs things bug they look very interesting what can you hear with this radio Ash?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All sorts of things mostly music.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Music? Really you can hear music from these things?\" Emily asked her interest perking even further as she bent down and picked one up it was the size of a quarter in her hand but fortunately she was ever so gentle with the device holding it close to her ear as he instructed <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! You're right Ash! I-I can hear something,a type of strange song and musical instrument of some kind coming from it!\" She exclaimed happily <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah even at your well Godzilla like size you'd have no trouble hearing it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Godzilla? What's that-\" She began <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er never mind.\" Ash said quickly \"But in case you want to know he's a monster,a gigantic lizard from Japan who attacks cities.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A giant lizard who attacks cities? Ohhh he sounds very....mean!\" She frowned <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you could say that but he only comes from the movies so he's not real.\" Ash explained but Emily got confused again <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Movie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see that shop all the way over there with all the posters?\" Ash pointed towards where her right hand was Emily bent down and nodded \"That's called a movie theater and although it's completely ruined now we use it to watch...Er what you might think of as 'moving pictures' on a big screen thing there have been many movies or motion pictures over the years some are about romance,,others about the past,the future,horror,science fiction even cartoons basically movies can be about anything.\" Ash explained <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh it sounds very wonderful and fasicnating!\" Emily exclaimed happily \"I wish I were your size so we could watch one.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but like I said the theater's mostly caved in so even I wouldn't be able to enter without something falling on top of me.\" Ash reassured her though Emily's expression became gloomy and disappointed she quickly got over it and stood up to her full height she practically resembled a life size take on the Statue of Liberty to him <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh okay but do you have everything you need for your cottage Ash?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I should think so thank you very much for helping me build it.\" He replied as he walked back over it <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome.\" She smiled as she bent down again getting on her hands and knees watching as he entered inside.</span></div></div>",

Certainly not on the same level of intimacy or attraction like you would find with husbands and wives or girlfriends and boyfriends, or any combination such. Perhaps if she were older. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what was it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a friendship developing, that much was certain. An unusual one to say the least but a friendship nonetheless. One that's course of direction would be determined by what he said next. He could tell that she was hoping that he would say he had a crush on her too. Maybe he did. Deep down inside somewhere. If it made her happy, then a little half truth couldn't hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,  I guess I do have a Crush on you Emily--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh hadn't gotten the words out of his mouth before he heard a loud squeal of delight and Emily's lips were upon him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting kissed by a three or four hundred foot young girl isn't an experience one forgets. Ash Suddenly found himself pinned to Emily's palm by the warm soft flesh that was molding around his body. His upper half was pressed into her soft upper lip while his lower limbs were pressed firmly into her bottom lip. There he stayed for what seemed like minutes and his ears popped as there was suction and a Smacking sound.  Her warm breath gusted down upon him and her mouth hovered over him for a moment in a childish toothy grin. He though maybe he might be kissed again, but after a moment Emily pulled her face away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Ash gasped \"That was certainly different. I've been kissed before, but not like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily giggled and, stood up carefully.Then, picking up Lucy, she started to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going?\"Asked Ash </span></div></div>",

It was amazing the level of detail one really could see, it was as though the world had been magnified and everything was in clear definition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer complexion was clear. The hair that hung around her head were like thick strands of rope as were her eyebrows and eyelashes. Her eyes. He could see pulsating veins in the corners that were about as thick as one of his fingers. Speaking of fingers, or more specifically the palm he was sitting in, his own fingers easily fit between the swirly dermal ridges that laced across the palm and fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Ash, Emily headed for home, thinking of the fun she was going to have with her new little friend. A friend she would keep a secrete from everyone.  Not yet anyway. Maybe one day when the time was right she would show him to Little Bear, but for now No one must know about him. Oh what games she would play!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily opened the Door to the cabin and looked about. Not a sign of her Grandmother. She crept into her bedroom and set Ash on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I ought to change out of this.\" She said \"Will you be okay by yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so.\" said Ash. \"If anyone comes I'll hide behind your pillow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily picked up some clothes and announced \"Be Right Back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome one might find it odd that Emily would change in another room, but not to Ash. He understood completely. After all, it just wasn't lady like nor was it proper for Emily to change in front of him. Even if she had, being a decent human being Ash would've waiting behind the pillow until the okay was given. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he waited, he looked about the room. Immediately he realized that this was not the bedroom he remembered from the cartoon. There were changes. He expected that. He wasn't, after all, in the cartoon but in a gigantic interpretation of that cartoon. There would be differences. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Emily returned she was wearing</span></div></div>",

She also wore a black vest with pockets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" she asked spinning around \"Do you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's really nice Emily.\" Said Ash. No harm in being honest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" she said \"I have Sandals that match.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandals. Something else that was different. The Cartoon Emily wore only those heavy looking boots/shoes, and she only wore that one blue dress. He always thought that if they had showed her closet in the cartoon you would've seen four or more pairs of the exact same suit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily walked over and at first it looked as though she was about to hop onto the bed. Then she thought better and sat on the floor, her hands on either side of Ash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh nodded. He had no idea how long it had been since he had eaten last but now he was starving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have candy. Jelly babies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bit unnerving to be the same size as a candy jelly baby, so you can imagine Ash's uneasiness when the Jelly Baby given to him was a bit bigger than he was. Well, at least he'd have a supply for a while. He broke off a piece. Definitely not something he'd eat for a normal meal, not unless he wanted to deal with a case of sugar diabetes.   For now, it was something to fill the gap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of gaps, he watched as Emily taused five of the candied jellies into her mouth. Five candies, each bigger than him, now in the process of being chewed into a pulp and swallowed. Emily noticed Ash looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything okay?\" she asked, her breath smelling of strawberry or something along those lines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah everything is fine. It's just that I just saw you eat five pieces of candy bigger than me. I thought that was kinda amazing. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" said Emily nudging the candy she had given Ash to one side with her finger. She smiled \"Do you want a closer look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh swallowed \"How close do you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I was thinking....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Alright Emily where I come from is quite different than what you're used to in a lot of ways.\" <br>\r\n\"Like what?\" She asked curiously <br>\r\n\"Like you know that blue dress you're always wearing? Well where I come from most girls your age don't wear dresses like that every single day they wear what I have on now(he gestured to his jeans and T-shirt)although theirs is a different style compared to boys.\" He knew he wasn't making a lick of sense as Emily looked highly confused and he changed the subject \"Okay I'll explain fashion statements a bit later as I see you're quite bewildered hmmm how about I tell you how we travel? Have you ever ridden inside a car Emily?\" He asked she arched a eyebrow<br>\r\n\"Car? What is that? I never heard of it before.\" Ash wanted to it himself hard of course this was the earliest 20th century and had to be just before automobiles were invented take a few years \"Is that similiar to horses and carriages Ash?\" Ash nodded <br>\r\n\"Yeah kind of but its more like a horseless carriage powered by steam you heard of those right?\" She nodded <br>\r\n\"Yes I've seen these before tell me more about where you come from Ash! I want to know everything!\" She seemed very interested now the way she brought him closer and closer towards her gigantic face he forced a laugh<br>\r\n\"Everything?

Can you tell me what you do to have fun and if there are talking animals where you come from?\" Emily asked again she apparently didn't hear what he just muttered and he thought hard on how to reply<br>\r\n\"Okay how do I do this?

As she walked, and Ash instructed her, she began to notice that the direction she was going was an all too familiar one to her. And why shouldn't it be familiar?

And you can't go back!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh arched a eyebrow <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? You-you don't want me to go back? Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily shifted her weight and looked down at her feet for some reason it was impossible to tell her expression at this point <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'll miss you badly-I want you to stay here with me Ash!\" She pouted he should have expected this as cute and sweet as she was though he wasn't about to be discerned from going back home<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kind of expected you would say that Emily and believe as much as I would like to I can't! I don't belong here,the cartoon world is nice and all but I really got to get back home you understand right?\" The seven year old pouted even more folding her arms <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No not really! I don't understand why you would want to go back when we're having so much fun here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to go back Emily I don't really want to stay-\" But this was the wrong thing to say as her face became annoyed and she plucked him up with one hand <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what if I don't want you to go Ash? I want you to stay here with me please? Pretty please?\" But he still wasn't going to be sweet talked into staying he knew her being so young only wanted him as a friend,possibly a play mate didn't understand the reason why he wanted to go home he only hoped-Ping! He suddenly pulled out his cell phone again and saw it was another text message from Scott asking where he was and with Emily holding him so tightly he couldn't reply <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash was that another what you call it? Text thing?\" Emily asked curiously <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but I'm ignoring it for now okay Emily you win,I'll stay with you it's not like I have any other choice anyway.\" Her face lit up <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will? Oh thank you Ash!\" As she happy once more hugged him tightly \"Come on we're going to meet Little Bear and his family I'm sure they'll like you very much....hey wait wh-what is happening to you?\" Ash puzzled looked down at himself and was quite amazed:he was fading away and knew it could only mean one thing it was another time shift or he was about to travel through dimensions again <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash,Ash? What's happening to you? Why are you disappearing like that?\" Emily's voice kept coming in and out of focus and he saw she was no longer holding onto him in fact he didn't see her nor Little Bear's yard/house anywhere <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES! IT'S WORKING I'M GOING BACK!\" He cried out happily as that strange light from before engulfed around him and with a sigh of relief he found himself back in his own timeline but realized something was horribly wrong as he saw the gigantic very familiar shadow appearing over him and groaned \"Oh no don't tell me-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ASH,ASH? WHERE ARE YOU AT?\" Ash's jaw dropped as he witnessed the full outline of Emily's red and black bathing suit as it and she towered over his very home town  and with a prolong gasp he realized </span></div></div>",

Being much smaller than she appeared to be in her own reality, Ash was much more of a handful. In fact the palms of her hands that were once vast plains were now two feet wide. The fingers were equally smaller, but no less powerful  By now he was used to being lifted into the air, but this time he could see more of Emily's face. The feeling was mutual as the child examined her friend thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's what your face looks like.\" She said \"I could only make out your eyes and mouth before.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just about to say the same.\" said Ash \"This close all I used to be able to see was your eye, or your mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily giggled, then looked about. \"So this is where you live?\" she looked down at a metal object with wheels \"Is that an Automobile?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh looked down \"Yes it is.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash, who is your Giant friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh glanced down and watched a familiar face approaching. \"Not that any of us wouldn't recognize her anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott! I got your Text!\" said Ash \"Oh, Emily this is my best friend, Scott. Scott this is Emily of Bear Country.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott Waved \"Ash, we've got a big problem here. You know she can't remain here in this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily Frowned \"I don't understand. I'm not mean, I won't hurt anyone. I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that, Emily,\" Said Ash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kid, there are people in this world of ours who would do great harm upon you.\" Scott Explained. \"You might have friendly intentions but that doesn't mean people might not try to hurt you out of fear or hate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides that,\" Ash added \"It's going to be very hard to find clothing in your size, or collect enough food for you. Then there's other things you may need. Like a place to go to the bathroom or to bath. And what about your Grandmother, or Little Bear? What will happen with they can't find you?\" He looked past Emily to the space behind her. He could see a shimmer of distortion in the air. \"The portal is still open. You can still go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But,\" Emily began to speak. But she had to admit, if only to herself, that Ash and his friend was right. Her eyes began to tear up \"I don't want to leave without you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh knew he had a decision to make, one that would chance the course of his life. Emily would not leave without him, and they were running out of time to convince her to go. Armed police might show up at any moment, worst still the portal could close behind Emily leaving her to a possible fate worst than death. He closed his eyes, and made his decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott, go to my home and bring me my mobile home and the following things. And hurry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess than twenty minutes later, Ash's one man camper was at  Emily's feet and Ash was putting in the last of what he hoped would be what was necessary to live in a Giant world. Scott looked at Ash and shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are really going to go though with this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the only way, Scott. If she remains here with us, she'll be hunted by those who will want to study her. Do who knows what to her. Despite her great height, she's still a seven year old child. I can't let anything like that happen to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be different in her world. Alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will not be alone.\" Ash looked up at Emily. \"I will have companionship of a different kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment sirens could be heard from a distance. \"We'd better hurry. Emily! Pick up my new home as soon as I'm inside!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott grabbed Ash's arm in a firm grip, he looked back to his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take care of yourself over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh nodded and stepped into the camper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe locked the door and sat down on a chair among items that were thrown together in haste. He saw Emily's hands press against the windows on either side of the structure and he felt everything lift into the air. Emily turned and stepped back through the portal just as police and military arrived. there was a flash and the portal was gone. All that remained that indicated that a giant had been there was the footprints made in the asphalt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take care of yourself\" Scott whispered and turned to face the bewildered authority figures. In the days to come, videos captured by cellphone cameras were uploaded to social media. All were immediately debunked as fraud, because something like that was just impossible. Only those who were witness to it know the real truth, and it mattered not that others didn't believe. The great footprints pressed into the road were chopped out and put on display as a tourist attraction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what became of Ash when he arrived back to the world of Little Bear? Well, much to Ash's surprise he wasn't as tiny as he had been when he first arrived, though still very small compared to the world around him. Ash figured it had something to do with the fact he was inside his camper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well, an uncanny facsimile at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott looked up at the Giant before him. \"Well, I guess the scientist were wrong when they said nothing this size could live.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me Scott, They have been wrong about A LOT of Things.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily sat on the ground still holding Ash in her hand. As she did, the people began to lose their fear of this giant and slowly gathered around her. Her presence did of course raise concerns, concerns even Emily had to admit she herself had also considered. Taking care of Ash would've been easy in world. She could've made his life relatively comfortable with just a doll house. In her case, Just to gather enough food for her would be challenging. Not to mention clothing. She couldn't wear a Bathing suit all the time. She would get cold. Then there was her friends, her Grandmother. No. Staying here forever just wouldn't do.

But more importantly it allowed the fast food joints and other places to gather enough food to feed the young Giantess. The food bill would be costly, but they figured not as costly should she be the kind to throw a giant property damaging tantrum. Of course such a tantrum was beneath Emily. As her Grandmother told her, such a display was un-lady like.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily found herself in what Ash called a Play Ground. There were children there as well as concerned parents. Feeling a little tired, she sat down with her shins tucked underneath her. As the children gathered around her she mused that she must've looked as though she had climbed down from some beanstalk. In fact as she introduced herself one little kid, a bit younger than Emily, did ask if she had done just that and inquired where the beanstalk was. To which she smiled and played along with child. After all, the real explanation was hard for even Emily to grasp so there was no point in confusing anyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smell came to Emily's nostrils. Food. But she couldn't really tell what kind of food, it was a mixture of aromas.A moment later one of the mechanical constructs, Ash had called it a flat bed truck,  drove into the park and came to a stop in front of her. On the back was a back yard swimming pool filled with everything from cheese burgers to cooked rice and all things in between. Emily carefully sat Ash down and after thanking everyone for the food, contemplated how to eat it. There were no forks or spoons big enough for her hands. So she would have to use her fingers whether it was un-lady like or not.  She at least did so in a polite manner, taking only small portions at a time, rather than trying to shovel it in all at once. The mixture of foods gave everything an unusual flavor but not at all  distasteful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ate her meal, she felt something, lots of somethings, touching the soles of her feet that were sticking out from under her. Hands. Little hands. She turned and saw several children had gathered around curiously and were touching the soles of her feet, feeling the dirty skin with it's wrinkles and over sized dermal swirls.  Mothers whispered for their children to be careful not to tickle her, and when one child tried to climb up he was taken way by his concerned Mother. Years later that young boy would point to this moment in his life for his thing for feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily turned back to her meal, all things considering she probably would've been just as curious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meal wasn't near enough to fill her. But she dared not ask for more, she knew that to gather the food they had given her must have been a challenge. So she thanked them, wiped her hands clean in her bathing suit and picked Ash up. </span></div></div>",

Ash stood by making sure nothing was going to happen to her. He wasn't the only one there. By this point the local police had been involved and they too were keeping guard. They didn't understand how a giant kid could be sleeping in the middle of a park but they certainly understood the importance of keeping this a secret for as long as possible. A near impossible task in this day and age where everyone had a camera in their phone. Ash was worried, Emily simply didn't understand the gravity of the situation. Thoughts of her in a cage somewhere with scientists poking and prodding her came to mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at her peaceful face, noticing the rapid eye movement. She was dreaming. 'What could she be dreaming about?' he wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was holding Ash's hand as they walked through the Mall. In her dream anyway. Ash was taking here to see one of those moving picture shows he had told her about. Of course, in her dream, the Mall didn't exactly look accurate. She had only seen one from the outside and her mind recreated it as Ash had described it to her. Since she had only her own experiences to rely on, the results was a Mall interior that looked like something that would've been made a century earlier. Plaster and Wallpaper instead of gyprock, oil lamps instead of electric lights. Even the food they got from the refreshment stand was from Emily's own memory.

He was bearded, and wore spectacles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Shawn.\" said the man. \"Don't worry, he asked me to keep an eye on you while he was gone.

He's very concerned about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Concerned?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess a lot of us are. You might think this world is a nice place to visit, but trust me you don't want to live here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily didn't say anything, but silently she agreed. Sleeping outside when it was warm is one thing, sleeping outside when it was cold is quite the other. Even Gulliver in the land of Lilliput knew he couldn't stay there forever. She mused if what had happened to her, was the same thing that happened to old Gulliver. She was starting to think so.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know you talk in your sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily Blinked. She hadn't known that \"What did I say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what I was able to make sense out of you apparently dreamed that your friends were here with you. That caused some fear and concerned from some of us who were listening. I mean, the idea of having more than one giant walking around kinda scares people. I'm sure you'd feel the same if suddenly giant's appeared where you live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to reply when she noticed Ash running towards her. He looked concerned.

He really didn't know how Emily was going to react and the last thing he wanted to do was hurt her. She was looking down at him. Her hair dripped with water. She was expecting his answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. I'm very, very, sorry. As much as I like you....I don't have the same feelings toward you that you have toward me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reaction to this revelation was both expected and unexpected. Tears began to swell in the young Giantess eyes. Ash immediately realized she had been crushed by what he'd told her. Suddenly the palm he sat on tilted sideways and he slid/ tumbled off the edge to the ground below. Blades of grass broke his fall to the ground below, if they hadn't he had no doubt he would've been seriously hurt. Emily stood up as he lay there on his back, the wind knocked out of him. She looked down upon him, tears were already falling. She had an expression of anger and disappointment. She could've done anything at this point. ANYTHING. There was nothing Ash could've done had she decided to hurt him. Instead, she stomped away leaving Ash behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Emily!\" Ash managed to gasp out \"Wait! C-come back...don't leave....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched her stomp away,  disappearing over the horizon. He was alone. His one contact in this strange world, the one person who might've helped him was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh painfully stood up and surveyed his surroundings. What the hell was he going to do now? He regretted what he had said to her, but it had been the truth. The truth had hurt her, and that had cost him dearly. </span></div></div>",

I may be only seven but I'm smart enough to understand romance and love is! Why can't you see how much I like you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ash's air supply was already beginning to run out as he struggled to breathe why couldn't she punch air holes in this thing? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that but Emily you have to understand can you imagine what it would look like? I mean a tiny teenager like me and a gigantic 7 year old like you in a(gulp) relationship? It would feel weird people and by people I mean all your animal friends will talk and what about your grandmother.....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Emily still wasn't listening she was truly in love with him he could tell right off the bat,the look in her eyes when she first found him and watched over him and she screamed out <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why should that matter? they don't have to know Ash! It can be our little secret please? Pretty please?\" But again Ash had to let her down gently swallowing hard <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Emily I really am but....no!\" Then that stony face turned into pure anger and she almost dropped him on the ground as she folded her arms and turned in the opposite direction fuming <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then since you want to be that way you're not coming out of there until you say you like me Ash! And that's final!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She honestly,truly is in love with me!

In it's place she placed cheese cloth held in place by string. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll just have to stay in there then.\" she said coldly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis world went sideways as the hand holding the jar went to Emily's side. Then it began to sway back and forth as she started to walk. He was glad to be able to breath, but at the same time he wondered just what was going to happen next? He looked at the palm and fingers that were pressed against the glass of the jar. She could've done much worst to him. Instead she had only taken him prisoner.That's not saying she still couldn't do something to him, but if she had wanted him dead she would've kept the cover on the jar and let him suffocate to death. He forced that image out of  his mind as he didn't want to dwell on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily headed towards her house, still fuming. But not wanting anybody to know about Ash, she decided not to show it. She wiped away her tears and composed herself. Not an easy task considering her age. But her efforts were fruitful. She walked past her grandmother who took no notice to the jar she'd been holding and headed for her bedroom. She placed the jar on her dresser and glared angrily at Ash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back.

The ground shook with the impact of her giant steps. behind him he could hear her humming a plesant tune completey unaware of the danger she was causeing. He had to dodge and weave as he navigated the uneven ground . She was of course under no such limitations. Her barefoot lifted from a strand of flatten blades of grass, swung forward gracefully as she took her next step. A shadow loomed over him.

The earth shook tremendously after the titan foot slammed into the ground. A huge dust cloud came up and he opened his eyes. Her foot had just missed him. Ash watched carefully as her claw tipped toes splayed as her foot tipped forward and her heel lifted, rising back into the air for the next step. Dirt and debris rained down all around him as she walked away. Ash stood up, checking to see if he still had clean underwear. In his mind saw himself right in the middle of a gargantuan crater of a footprint, crushed and forgotten. An idea came into his mind. He had often fantasized about something like this happening, How often does one get to live out that Fantasy?<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAsh could tell the the giant bearess was also heading for the house and followed her. He couldn't keep up with her of course, but he easily followed the footprints she left behind. A few hours later, he was standing before the House. Ash got a lump in his throat and swallowed hard knowing that before him was the one thing that could allow him to experience his deepest fantasy; to be shrunk down to a tiny size and explore a whole new world!<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs he drew nearer to his destination many thoughts went through Ash's mind. He had to admit, He'd always had a curiosity for wanting to view the world from the floor up, like a bug might do before ultimate getting squished by a giant foot. He couldn't say he enjoyed the though of getting killed in such a way - He really was not big on getting killed - but he thought it would be an incredible experience to view the world from that perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh had no idea how she was going to react to his appearance if she saw him. She was an incredible Macro Furry. If he was unable to get her attention she could easily crush him under foot before she even knew he was there. If he got squashed here it would be for real and he would die for real. Ash had a good idea how big she was and she was fully capable of doing permanent damage to his body. On the other hand, if he somehow survive this, it would have been an unforgettable adventure. Ash also began to wonder what would happen if she did see him. How would she react to him being so small, what would she do. Ash began to try to imagine how she was going to look like and what it would be like to sit in her huge palm. Ash was afraid and strangely excited at the same time.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSuddenly there was a huge groan as the door swung open.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Damn, That's the second close call in a matter of hours, He didn't want to try for three. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back in about a Month.\" Ash heard him tell his wife. He felt the step shudder as she stepped out to say her good bys.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Have a safe trip dear,\" she said kissing him. She stood there for a few moments watching him walk away.

Traveling over the wood grain wasn't a problem but getting over the gaps between took a running leap in places, Fortunately if he missed and fell it was only five feet deep with dust and other stuff on the bottom. Finding the kitchen wasn't hard as all he had to do was follow the sent of what was being cooked. Stepping through a vast opened door, Ash found himself finally in the kitchen.  He saw  Mother Bear standing in front of an old wood stove preparing a meal. And someone else. A cub was also sitting at the table, unlike the Mother this new Bear wasn't wearing clothing, That seemed odd. Why was she fully clothed while he was in his birthday suit? Maybe the cub wasn't old enough for anything to be showing through the thick fur. Well, he could think about that later. Right now he needed food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking about Ash saw a cupboard slightly opened near where Mother Bear was cooking what smelt like Oatmeal. Inside the cupboard was a cloth bag that was slightly open. Assume that the bag contained uncooked oatmeal he headed of the cupboard. Taking the Direct route was a huge risk, if Mother Bear happened to turn around and saw something scurrying across her kitchen floor there was no telling what she'd do. He didn't recall much about her but she didn't have a problem with snakes, bugs might be another matter. But he didn't want to waste time going the long way so praying to whatever deity happen to be  listening he made his way as quickly as he could. Once he'd made it to the cupboard he rested for a moment before using the wood grain of the cupboard to climb up inside it. Thankfully it was the bottom shelf or he would never of made it that far. Another moments rest and he was climbing up the side of the cloth bag. Not looking at the contents Ash flipped himself over the top of the bag and landed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of a mound of sugar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sugar? Damn.\" he muttered to himself. Well, it would give him quick energy but not much in the way of sustenance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Mother Bear took the pot of oatmeal away from the stove and served it up into two bowls for herself and Little Bear. Setting the bowels on the table she noticed the glass sugar dish was empty. Walking back to the cupboard she took out the bag of sugar and a couple of spoons. Returning to the table, she sat the bag down. Then, without looking inside,  she opened the bag up all the way and proceeded to:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Taking his spoon she stirred the grains of sugar into the warm oatmeal and gave the spoon back to the cub who hungrily began to eat his breakfast.  After having fallen into hot oatmeal and having tons of sugar dumped on top of him and then being buried alive in the oats it took every bit of effort by Ash to crawl and dig his way up to the surface even as the oatmeal was eaten all around him. Reaching upward with a hand he was relieved when it broke the surface. That relief turned into fear as he felt himself lifted upward. Still fighting the grip of the oatmeal he managed to get his head up out of the oat meal in time to gaze into Little Bear's opening mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite only having seconds to cry out  Ash found himself not being able to and stared at the open mouth as it got closer and closer. Saliva dripped from Carnivorous and Omnivorous teeth, the tongue extended out slightly with bits of Oatmeal still sticking to it, and a throat that seemed to open up bigger as though inviting him. The wooden spoon slid over teeth and Ash was engulfed in Darkness. Feeling the spoon being withdrawn under him, he was then pushed upward and about by the cub's tongue. Because it was oatmeal there was little chewing involved. He'd been spared from being grounded into bits between Little Bear's teeth, but there was nothing to prevent his approaching doom. He felt himself sliding backwards towards the Throat and the tongue lifted up toward the roof of the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GULP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slid head first into the cub's esophagus, muscles rippled and pushed him along with the oatmeal. He could hear the beating of a heart and the bellows of air breathing in and out from massive lungs. Eventually he had arrived and was pushed out into open space. He fell, landing on his back on a pile of partially chewed oatmeal. The smell was horrible. This was a place were very few organisms would call home. In the pitch darkness Ash fumbled for the little light he had on his key ring. The little pinpoint of light illuminated the Organic chamber he was in. The walls of the stomach were in motion, already moving food about into rising pools of digestive juices. What a horrible death he was facing, He couldn't believe he was brought to this reality to become part of a growing Bear Cub's breakfast. </span></div></div>",

He could see every speck of dust, every hair, every wrinkle in the broad brown leathery pads. The Heel made contact with the floor, sending a vibration through the floor. Like a  warm mountain of flesh the broad pad on the ball of the foot was on top of him. For a millisecond it felt comforting, then pad pressed down around him.

It had been a long day and with Father Bear out fishing and Little bear outside playing all she wanted was a little time to herself. A nice relaxing rest on the couch would do her good. As she walked toward the couch completely unaware of the little creature that was standing there looking up at her with awe. Nor was she aware of the creature running under the couch as she was about to step onto the rug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>FOOOM!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Huge foot came down just seconds after Ash  he ran under the couch. A moment later there was a loud groan as Mother Bear Settled down onto the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had been too close. If he'd stayed out in the open instead of hiding---No, He didn't even want to think about it. For the moment he was safe, and on the plus side he hadn't soiled his underwear. It suddenly occurred to Ash that he remembered very little about these characters. It had been a long time since he'd had read those books, and he only vaguely recalled the show. Did any of them have a fear of small creatures like bugs or mice? Did they own a Cat? Damn it, he just couldn't remember. How the hell did did get here in the first place? More importantly, how was he going to get back home? Would he ever get back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well, when life gives you lemons, you make lemonade. And this was a unique situation. It wasn't every day this sort of thing happened and who knows it might even be enjoyable if he was lucky. One thing he was sure of, he couldn't very well stay under the couch. While it was safe for now that could change, especially if someone decided to vacuum under there. Ash looked toward the door Mamma entered through. Beyond that was the rest of the house, and more potential danger but also a better chance for finding food and shelter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh stuck his head out and looked up at the Giant above him. A very real danger, and she wouldn't be the only one in this house.

He would've fallen had he not been so close to the first step. For a moment he couldn't tell who or what it was as it was too close and all he could see when he looked up was a leg and a bellow of fabric like a colossal tent. Not exactly enough for a positive ID. But as the foot lifted and the individual began to move farther away Ash could see more of the body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the girl....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow dressed in her blue knee-length dress  and brown ankle-length boots, the giant known as Emily was walking away from the house at a pace that would've been impossible to keep up had he tried to follow her. It had been hours since he'd first encountered her when she was dressed in her bathing suit. Even though he hadn't seen her come back the way she had came it was most likely that she had come here taking a different road. He watched her as she walked beyond his field of vision and was brought back to reality by the sound of someone closing the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn, if he had been quick enough he might've been inside the house by now. Then he looked at the steps and thought otherwise. He'd be almost halfway up the first step if he was lucky before that door closed. Just as well, he supposed. Ash examined the wooden steps. They were rough with plenty of hand and foot holds. That would make accent easier. There was no time but the present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing isn't as easy as it is in the movies. You see macho men climbing up the sides of cliffs as though they had the abilities of a Spider. The reality, as Ash was starting to figure out,  was that it's tiresome. By the time he reached the top of that first step his muscles ached from use. Thank the maker he didn't have to deal with more than one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was beginning to set as he approached the door. As he had hoped there was a gap just wide enough to crawl under and into the interior beyond. This was it. Any thoughts he might've had regarding turning back were pointless now. No doubt there were night time terrors that would just love to have him for a meal and he had not allowed himself the opportunity to set up a shelter.  This is what he had wanted all his life. He took one more deep breath and dipped under the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoices is what greeted him as he came out from under the door. He found himself in the kitchen. At the table were three Giants. Mountains with fur. The Bear he'd encountered earlier , a second dressed in a suit (no doubt her husband or mate) and a cub who was talking about what he'd done today. They sat at the table eating their evening meal of what looked like cooked fish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCooked fish. Ash could smell it from where he was standing. He hadn't eaten all day and the smell made his mouth water. of course it was up on a table beyond his reach. Still, there might be scraps falling to the floor below. Could he dare chance it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Under one arm she held her Doll, over her other shoulder was a knapsack containing her bedclothes and a few goodies. Little Bear left the table to greet her and show here where to put her stuff, while the Parents of the Cub finished their meal and and in tern collected their dishes and after depositing all in the sink , followed the two young children. Leaving only the Cub's unfinished meal on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what had happened to Ash, you might wonder? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn't been struck with the door, not exactly. As that immense door swung forward there was a huge displacement of Air. Being so light in that enviroment, Ash had been propelled forward and up. Tumbling though the air he'd passed over Little Bear's head as the cub approached his friend, his downward arc sent him toward the table. The odds of where he landed had to be a million to one, nevertheless he had landed smack dab in the middle of Little Bear's unfinished supper. More precisely, he'd landed into the interior of the half eaten fish though a hole made by a fork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had taken him a few moments to recover. When he did though, Ash couldn't believe his luck! Up through the hole, he saw the giant parents of the cub stand up. Taking their plates they had walked out of his field of vision. After a moment he felt their footfalls receded to another part of the house. It was only then that Ash began to feed. The fish was delicious, though the flesh itself was of a different texture as he was eating muscle fibers much larger than he normally would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Emily was removing her nighty from her knapsack when Mother Bear informed her cub that he had to finish his supper before the two did anything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Bear groaned, \"I'm not that hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help you finish it.\" Emily volunteered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Bear looked at his mother who nodded approvingly. The fish would not go to waste at least. The pair ran past  Mother Bear who just smiled and shook her head. The energy of youth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh had halfway shoved a piece of fish into his mouth when he felt the tremors and heard the giggles and voices of children. A shadow fell over the hole. Gazing out from it Ash found himself face to face with the Cub. He was looking down and holding a fork in his hand. A moment later the face of the Girl appeared. She too held a fork. A moment later the fish shook as the forks were drove into the fish and came away with chunks of fish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh began to panic. What was he going to do? He had only planned to enjoy the meal, not be part of it! He saw an opening, the mouth of the fish was opened in a gasp for water that never came. There was no way these two would eat the head of the fish.  The prongs of a fork sliced down just behind him and Ash let out a startled cry that was unheard by the two giant children. He didn't wait to watch the chunk of fish rise way but immediately began crawling through the emptied cavity of the fish to freedom. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ash had missed his target but still slammed into the cloth of her dress about twenty feet or more from his intended target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he started to slide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fabric of Emily's dress was like rope weaved together. There was nothing he could grab hold of. At that same moment Emily was beginning to move to follow Little Bear. As she did so, the front pocket on her dress opened up slightly. Just enough to allow a tiny human to slide right in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind was knocked out of Ash when he landed. He gasped and looked around in confusion. He had landed in a pocket. He could tell that, but he had also landed in something else. The walls were brown and reminded him of fiberglass. Of course! It was paper! He had landed in a brown paper bag, and on top of what looked like old fashioned gummy candy. Strawberry from the smell of them. Hell of a way to break a fall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world outside was moving. As the girl walked the fold of the pocket would open and he would see glimpses of  her face high above. As he made a move to get to a sitting position, Ash noticed how sticky the gummy candy was. Probably left in the warmth of this pocket for too long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly it seemed as though Ash was in an Earthquake. The contents of the bag, that included him, were bounced about. He was half buried under the gummy candy by the time it was over.

Diving off the plate he made a dash for the bear cub. If this crazy stunt worked and he lived, he would be hanging onto fur at around his chest. Running as fast as he could he waited until he was just at the edge of the table to jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't go as well as he hoped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh found out the hard way that he was a lousy jumper without a spring board. He missed his target but continued his arc toward Little Bear. At that moment, the Cub decided to climb off the chair. As he began to do so, the huge body shifted toward Ash and he was able to grab fur. He though his arm was going to be wrenched out of it's socket and he almost lost his grip, but he managed to cling to the strands of fur. Instead of his intended Target, the fur on his chest, Ash found himself  hanging just above where the cub's belly button should be. He could hear gurgling as the cub began to digest his meal of fish. He wondered if his other shoe was in there somewhere floating about in a lake of digestive fluids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle bear grasped the plate with both hands/paws and walked over to the sink followed by the girl Emily. With every foot fall Ash's grip became weaker. It wasn't just the tremor that he could feel even where he hung, gravity was pulling him down just as strong here as it would've been if he were hanging off a cliff back home. His hands were beginning to cramp and tire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter depositing what was left of the fish into the waste basket and placing the plate into the sink, the two young giants made their way to the bedroom. Little Bear climbed up into his bed while Emily went behind an erected curtain to change into her night gown. So far as he lay there, halfway under the covers, he wasn't aware of the ant size human that was resting near his belly button. Ash was certainly thankful not to be hanging anymore. He hoped he would not have to do that sort of thing very often. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like a Jelly Baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh looked up and beyond the skyline of fur. Emily was dressed in her night gown and holding a paper bag. <i>\"Would you like a Jelly Baby\"</i>. Now where did he hear that before?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jelly w-what?\" The cub looked almost horrified. Ash was confused by this reaction until he heard the girl giggle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not REAL babies, silly. They're candy.\" She dumped a couple into her hand to show him \"See?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Little Bear held out his hand/paw. Ash watched as the girl dumped a handful of the sweet candy into the hand/paw and watched the two friends from different species consume them with great enjoyment. He couldn't stay where he was though. He had to movie on and get somebody's attention. If possible </span></div></div>",

Frowning, he tickled a little more intensely. Nothing, not even a toe twitch. The cub and his friend continued to point to clouds and make out shapes as though he wasn't even there. What in Blazes was going on? Curiously, Ash reached out and touched the great pad. It felt like leather and had some give to it but not much. It didn't appear calloused but he could tell the skin at the heal was quite thick. Of Course! Little Bear walked without shoes all the time, it was only natural that his foot pads were less than sensitive. He kicked himself for not realizing sooner. He was going to abandon the idea when a though occurred. He backed away from the foot until he could see all of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pad stretched the whole length of the foot, and he could tell in some areas there were places that were of a lighter shade of brown, places where the foot did not make contact with the ground on a daily basis. There were enough wrinkles and ridges to making climbing possible. Ash ran back to the foot, placed the piece of grass in his mouth and began to climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd think Little Bear would've noticed or felt something out of the ordinary, but he was either completely oblivious or just didn't care.

It was like being in a city but you were the only one who lived there.  He rolled over on his back and tried to get to his feet, his body wouldn't allow it. Despite being out in the open and despite the extreme danger, his muscles were still too exhausted to support his frame. whether he liked it or not, He had to wait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when he heard the first thundering foot falls and the tremor through the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to be kidding me.\" Ash said to himself.

That was the plan until he saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he had thought before that Emily was the biggest being he'd ever seen (As she was much taller than Little Bear) her height and size was dwarfed three times over by the living mountain that stepped into the room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother Bear,\" whispered Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was her, no mistake. Mother Bear in her pink shirt, blue skirt and white apron. Mother Bear, who had walked into the kitchen from another part of the house and was now shaking Ash's world with every foot fall. He didn't know where she was going, but he knew it was way too dangerous to be out in the open like he was. Even though his muscles protested, he forced himself to crawl to the only safe place he could get to. The closest wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was doing that, Mother Bear had made her way to the stove and was currently boiling a kettle for tea. She had just taken her cup down from the cupboard and had opened up he jar of tea, when something caught her eye. A little something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh thought for a brief moment that there was a chance he was going to make it, then he heard and felt the foot falls approaching and stopped dead. A dark shadow fell over him and with a deep and pronounced feeling of dread, he rolled over on his back and looked up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was looking down at him, and Ash knew he was at her mercy. He couldn't run, even if he was well rested there was no way in hell he could outrun her.

Trying to slow himself down, he grasped at the thick coarse hair that grew all around him but it wasn't until he'd was hanging off the tip of a claw that he finally stopped.  But just as he was about to breath a sigh of relief the clawed toe twitched causing him to lose his grip and he landed on the leather insole of the shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFather Bear looked about for the \"Bug\" a few moments after he'd lost sight of it, then shrugged and looked at Mother Bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guessed I must've got it.\" he said and began to sit down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had an effect on Ash. For as Father Bear sat down, his foot/paw went from horizontal to vertical. Ash slid down under the claw and landed on the very tip of the toe pad. The pad felt wet at the touch and it was than that Ash became aware of the smell. How to describe it? It wasn't like the smell of a human foot. He could've guessed that it was the smell of a bear's foot mixed with leather if he knew what a bear's foot smelt like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was really dark in the shoe so he couldn't see much in the way of detail, but he did have a good idea how big this foot/paw  was. He remembered reading that a Grizzly Bear, on average, was seven feet tall on it's back legs and had hind paws that were fifteen inches long. In the cartoon Father Bear was not nearly that tall. Maybe six foot five. Sill, if his Foot/Paw at Ash's scale was 12 inches it would still make it almost a hundred feet long.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh tried to climb further up onto the toe pad, this turned out to be a mistake. Whether it was a muscle twitch, or Father Bear felt something Ash really didn't know but the results were the same. The toe twitched and moved away from the insole. Because everything was so damp, the tiny human had nothing to hold onto and slipped downward only to be pinned between the toe pad and the insole of the shoe when the toe relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinned against the Leather and flesh, and finding it hard to breath, Ash wondered what he could do. He couldn't move without giving himself away, and that would only lead to his immediate death. If he didn't move, he most certainly be dead the Moment Father Bear stood up. His only chance was to slid further down and hope to get to the space under the toes. In theory, he could hold on to the fur growing there until Father Bear eventually took his shoe off. </span></div></div>",

As hard as he tried, Ash couldn't keep his grip on the gray fabric and was sent rolling down Father Bear's backside. Eventually, Ash found himself falling a great height from Father Bear's waist to the ground below. So great, that as soon as Ash had made contact with the dirt floor he fell into unconsciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was startled into awakening by an awful and incomprehensible stench. He slowly lifted his face off of the dirt to search for the source. Though, it didn't end up taking up much time, as the source was practically surrounding him. Ash looked up to find that Father Bear, who decided to take his shoes off, had kneeled to the ground, most of his body being supported by his knees. <br>\r\nFor Ash, this meant that, because of his condition behind Father Bear, the two paws of the giant bear were at his sides and Father Bear's massive behind was looming over him, his cheeks bulging through the thin material of the dress pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFather Bear's rear end, combined with his dirty and sweaty paws, created a stench that  made Ash anything but comfortable. Though, he was grateful that Father Bear's rump was hanging over him rather than crushing him, though Father Bear's terrible hygiene would most likely do Ash in before anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Ash had to get Father Bear's  attention if he wanted help.

It was cute, but at the same time was capable of leveling a house with a single step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe should've been getting away from the giant cub and his family, but instead Ash found himself approaching the foot/paw. With great caution he reached out and touched the leathery sole. It felt hot, like blankets fresh out of the dryer. There was no reaction from Little Bear. That should've been the end of it, but Ash decided to be a bit more bold and ran his hand over the bumpy brown surface of a toe pad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toe twitched. The Cub had felt that. Upon compulsion Ash stretched out and pressed himself against the toe. The heat penetrated into his bones and felt good. Relaxing. This time the toe didn't move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole foot shifted, knocking him backward. Looking skyward he gazed up at Little Bear expecting a retaliation, but there was no indication that the cub had felt him. Instead it seemed he had simply shifted position as he'd been handed a sandwich. That was a reality for the micro human. To Ash, Little Bear was a young god, and to Little Bear Ash was an insect. One that could be killed without effort. So why was it that after brushing off the dirt, Ash once again approached the Bear Cub? A part of him was telling him to get as far away as he could, but there was another part of him. One that knew that no matter how dangerous a giant of this size was, it was safer to stay closer to him than to go out on his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething white and slightly damp landed not far from where Ash stood. Upon picking it up he realized it was a crumb that had fallen from Little Bear's sandwich. To survive he must live and to live he must eat. He took a bite. It was a strange tasting the saliva of another species but once he got past that he actually enjoyed the meal. More crumbs rained down around him. If he had a backpack he would've collected some for later. Instead he decided to do something that would probably turn out to be a big mistake.</span></div></div>",

Instead he was in a complete shock when the roof of the structure was torn open with a loud cardboard sound and light streamed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking he looked skyward for a moment, not seeing anything. Then he felt everything being lifted and then everything tipped, the contents of the structure, along with Jon tumbling like an avalanche out the opened roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight into the largest bowl he\u2019d ever seen in his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoughing up dusty sugar but thankfully unhurt, he looked skyward and if he wasn\u2019t so congested from the sugary powder would\u2019ve scream up at the giant creature above him.

Huge white teeth large enough to grind him to bits, a wide quivering tongue ready to taste him and a vast throat opened up to accept whatever would be left of him.

The creature, which Ash concluded was a girl was looking down into the spoon. Looking down at him in fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing he knew he was firmly grasped between the tips of a huge finger and apposing thumb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooooh, I wonder what this is..\u201d he heard her say as she continued to eat her cereal. Ash\u2019s limbs were warming up thanks to the comforting warmth given off by this what ever she was, but they were pinned between her finger and thumb. Not that he could move even if he wanted to. He was too frightened to move. Still he couldn\u2019t help but watch in personal interest as she ate mouth full after mouth full.  In fact he found himself strangely enjoying watching her eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also was looking him over, no doubt wondering what he was. She had probably never seen anything like Jon in her life. He was totally at her mercy, and he wondered what she\u2019d do next.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While Chamametchi had no idea what it was and probably thought it was a strange toy, Mametchi knew exactly what kind of thing it was.. A human from the other planet far away. He wanted to inspect that human later, and see how he ended up in a cereal box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Chamametchi was all done with her cereal. \"I'm done, that was yummy Mametchi!\" She smiled at her brother, before grinning back at her new toy. \"So, Mametchi... Can I pleeeeease take my new toy to school today? I'm sure no one has one of whatever this thingy is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, not today Chamametchi.\" He said, not taking his eyes away from the 'toy'. \"I'll leave him here, and I'll let you play with him when you get home though..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, fine big brother...\" She whined. She suddenly slowly put the creature onto the table. \"You'll take good care of it, and not get a single scratch on it, right brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Chamametchi. It'll be fine.. Now, you better get going, I think the school bus should be here any minute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh looked up at the being addressed as Mametchi. He was looking back at him. Probably wondering the same thing he was, where had he come from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember big brother, not a single scratch!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promise, Chamametchi.\u201d Said Mametchi \u201cNow hurry up before you miss the bus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Chamametchi left, Mametchi looked more closely at Ash. \u201cI know you\u2019re a Human, and I\u2019m pretty sure you can understand me. I\u2019m not going to hurt you, I\u2019m just going to take you to my lab. I\u2019m going to pick you up now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMametchi\u2019s fingers were larger than Chamametchi\u2019s and when they closed around him only Jon\u2019s head poked out from between the tips of his thumb and finger. \u201cI hope I\u2019m not holding you too tightly\u201d he said as he carried him a short distance to his lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMametchi placed Ash on a table then placed what looked like a microphone next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, This could be very important. Tell me everything you know, from the beginning.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Most of them are complete failures sadly. Mametchi wasn't much of a proficient inventor, he barely makes his money back on the stuff he invents. He sat himself down on a chair, and looked at the little human he was interrogating all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't seem to get a answer from the human at first, which made him grow a frown. Perhaps he needed to try harder to gain his trust. \"Don't be afraid to answer me human. I'm a scientist and inventor of this planet. My father owns a big laboratory, and they study your own planet, Earth.\" He explained. \"That doesn't explain how you got to our planet though, and I think you would like to return back to home, so please listen to me little human... Tell me what happened the last night before you came here. Please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know.\u201d Ash finally said. \u201c The day seemed normal enough, I ate that evening I went to bed just like I normally do, only this time I woke up in a cereal box! The next thing I know I\u2019m almost drowned in a ocean of milk and almost became a part of a balance breakfast!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy sister didn\u2019t mean to\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no. I\u2019m not blaming anyone. Accidents happen. Even the more bizarre ones.\u201d Ash looked up at Mametchi. \u201cI want to go home, but I also have this strong desire to explore this world of yours. It\u2019s a \u2018boldly go where no one has gone before\u2019 thing. I\u2019m sure you can understand that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMametchi nodded. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll run a few tests . Nothing physical just scans. And then I\u2019ll leave you in the care of my sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that a little dangerous? She thinks I\u2019m a prize out of a cereal box.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, she\u2019s very careful,\u201d Said Mametchi \u201cYou\u2019ll be just fine.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everything seemed fine so far to Mametchi, but he did notice something that seemed somewhat off... He noticed that his size was not correct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I notice one thing that's off. Your size.\" Mametchi said. \"You are not normal sized to humans right now. You are below a inch tall in human scale. And at my people's scale, you are a inch tall. You see, I'm not a giant. You just happened to have shrunken down somehow. If you were normal sized, we'd appear to be three or so feet tall. This is strange. I need to investigate how you shrunk. That's a even bigger mystery..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And by the way.\" Mametchi started. \"there actually is a way to get you back home. But I don't think you'd want to return home at less then a inch tall, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I guess not.\u201d Said Ash. \u201cthough the prospect is somewhat fascinating, I highly doubt I\u2019d survive long. I\u2019m not even sure how I\u2019m going to survive here. Well, at least we\u2019ve established that I\u2019m shrunk and your normal sized, however unbelievable that may be for me. Any Idea how this happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot yet, I won\u2019t have the results until tomorrow.\u201d Mametchi replied. \u201cat least all your vitals appear normal\u201d He frowned at the scans \u201cthere\u2019s something here that\u2019s familiar but I can\u2019t put my finger on it.\u201d He looked down at Jon \u201cYou\u2019re a real mystery, a human who appears in a place he\u2019s not suppose to be and mysteriously miniaturized.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, If you do manage to restore my size, How are you going to send me back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's simple.. Once you are hopefully returned back to normal, I'd have to use a invention of mine.\" He pointed towards a strange looking machine with a door. \"That's my transporter machine I've been working on lately.that's just the beta version of it. The real more improved version of it is in my father's main laboratory. With a simple use of a button, I could just zap you right back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked back at Ash. \"School will be over soon for Chamametchi you know. Today was a early day for her. She might even bring a few of her friends with her. But don't worry, she's careful like I said. She's very protective of her toys, which is what she considers you to be...\" He explained. \"I might also have a few of my own friends come here to inspect on you as well to figure out what are you truly doing on here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d asked Ash. \u201cI\u2019ve told you everything I know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you claim,\u201d said Mametchi \u201cI\u2019m not so sure you\u2019re telling the truth. But since I don\u2019t see how an inch tall human is a threat, I\u2019m going to take you to my sister\u2019s room. That\u2019s where she\u2019ll expect you to be.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Mametchi slowly picked up the small human the same way he had done before, maybe a little more soft this time. \"Now then, let me take you to my sister's room.\" As he left the lab, he took the human to a very colorful looking room. It looked like any pink obsessed little girl's room, only a thousand times bigger. \"I'll leave you right here...\" He said, slowly placing him onto a small pink tea table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door suddenly knocked. \"That's probably Chamametchi. I have to go open the door for her..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh sat down on the table thinking about his current situation. Not only was he marooned on another planet, not only had he been miniaturized, but he wasn\u2019t trusted either. He had done nothing wrong, he hadn\u2019t asked for any of this. Well, no sense in crying over it. He might as well make do with what fate had given him. Which was at the moment being a toy to an alien girl. He hoped Mametchi was right about his sister being careful. He\u2019d hate to be accidentally crushed by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard squeals of delight; Chamametchi was coming. Ash hoped he was ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the door to Chamametchi's room was suddenly slammed open, Chamametchi had finally arrived home.</span></div></div>",

It looks just like one of those alien things I keep on hearing about. Only, like a lot smaller and stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh eyed the new whatever she was with caution.

The alien girl slowly started to walk up to the small playset, and then dropped the little human in the middle of what looked to be a toy city. \"Aww, it's really cute how it looks like he belongs there.. Heh!\" Imotchi laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Chamametchi started to place toy people into the city. \"I know, it's really cute! Heh heh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen little lego men are bigger than you, it kinda brings things into perspective. Ash felt smaller than he\u2019d ever felt since he\u2019d shown up there. And despite himself he had to admit these kids were right. He did look like he belonged there. He looked up at Chamametchi and Imotchi imagining the two giants towering over the town he lived in, it would look no bigger to them then this little play set. He wondered what they had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, anyway.....\" Chamametchi suddenly picked Jon up again, before placing him inside a little toy blocky helicopter. \"Your little toy is gonna be flying in his personal private helicopter, flying above the city, looking down at all the people.\" She grinned, suddenly lifting the helicopter, and making it look like it was flying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImotchi grinned. \"That is until it crashed!\" Imotchi suddenly took the helicopter from Chamametchi, hastily swiping it away from the other child. \"Hey!\" Chamametchi cried. \"It wasn't your turn yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo things came to Ash\u2019s mind. One, seatbelts save lives. Two, the blocky Helicopter didn\u2019t have any. He tumbled out of the toy, squeezing his eyes tightly.

She gasped, right before quickly putting her hand down towards it, safely saving it. \"You could have hurt it!\" Chamametchi yelled at her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could I have hurt it?

You look so amazing!\" She told the toy, giggling as she suddenly poked at him. \"No wonder why Imotchi wanted you so bad! Your the best toy out there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018And I will hug him and squeeze him, and pet him, and name him George\u2026\u2019 Ash thought. That poke had hurt a little, but not too much.

I wonder what you\u2019re made out of.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh had to admit it felt good. Almost like a full body massage, rubbing out all the tension from his limbs. He began to relax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChamametchi however was starting to become more and more curious of this little guy. She had spent the entire half hour examining him, and looking all over the little guy's body. Just like her brother, she was curious about everything, and this toy seemed very life like..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Chamametchi!\" The door suddenly opened. \"It's time for bed. Put your toy away.\" Mametchi said, stepping into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Chamametchi putting Ash back into the container.

She climbed back into bed, pulled the covers up and placed her toy on the pillow next to her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodnight\u201d she whispered kissing the tip of her finger and pressing it onto Ash.

In another he was running for his life as Mametchi lifted a foot up and slammed it down on top of him crushing him like a bug, and yet another with Imotchi forcing him to wear a polka dot dress. That had been the weirdest one off all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was awaken by Mametchi coming into the lab. \u201cYou okay?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine,\u201d said Ash \u201cJust more weird dreams. It\u2019s like my mind is trying to process all the recent events. So, you said you had some news to tell me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah. I do have something to tell you.\" Mametchi looked down upon Jon with a curious expression. \"I'm going to have to take you to my lab to show you what I found out.\" Suddenly, Mametchi picked up the little human like he had done before. He really hoped Ash didn't mind the way he grabbed him.. It seemed a little harsh, and made it seem like he was just a tiny object of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe arrived in his lab. As soon as he did so, he placed Jon right beside his computer, and Mametchi continued to do his work on the human. \"Well.. If you look here on the screen, I've noticed something.. Kind of odd, but really interesting and useful for you...\" He turned the computer screen towards Ash.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Really something.\" He shook his head. \"Apparently, somehow.. You are a mix between both a human, and a tamagotchi.\" He explained, hoping Jon wouldn't be too shocked. \"Don't be alarmed... Um, that has nothing to do with your size changing but.. In a way, you could possibly mutant to look more like my kind of people.. I don't know when that will happen, or if it even will happen.. That's why, I'm gonna need to take you to a friend of mine, Tensitchi. A scientist who happens to be a expert on humans and space travel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m a hybrid?\u201d Ash was dumbfounded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, a simplification term of what you are but correct.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow the heck can that be? I can tell you right now both my parents were human, so it didn\u2019t happen that way! Wait, what about some sort of genetic transference?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMametchi thought for a moment, \u201cPossible, but I don\u2019t see how---\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been handling me since yesterday.\u201dAsh explained \u201c Your sister was rubbing me between her fingers, now it all sounds sci-fi but what if I\u2019ve been in a state of flux since I\u2019ve arrived. Somehow your DNA has become integrated in to my genetic code.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMametchi rubbed his chin for just a moment, perhaps that was what was beginning to happen to the human... If so, Mametchi started to feel a little guilty for letting that happen. Like he had said, it is possible for the human to mutant into a creature that is just like them.. He sighed sadly. \"If you do not mind, I'll be taking you to my friend so we can further research this issue...\" He nodded to himself, before picking up the human again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked outside of his home, and entered a strange UFO like object. \"That's my automobile.. I know it looks different from your planet's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, So long as it gets us there that\u2019s fine with me.\u201d Said Ash \u201cI just hope I don\u2019t go Brundlefly on you before we get there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrundle what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s from a movie,\u201d Ash explained as Mametchi climbed into his Auto, \u201cA scientist named Brundle gets his DNA fused with a flying insect during a teleportation accident. The resulting creature was called Brundlefly. In the movie Brundle mutates into it in a very brutal and painful way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds horrible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is, Lets hope that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Mametchi had climbed into his strange automobile, the machine started to float, and started to fly. Mametchi was controlling the automobile rather easily, just with a single joystick like object. \"My friend, Tensaitchi actually has been to your planet before.. (Link for info: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://tamagotchi.wikia.com/wiki/Tensaitchi\" target=\"_blank\">http://tamagotchi.wikia.com/wiki/Tensait...</a> )Pretty much all of his years of research is related to your kind of people.\" Mametchi went on and on about his friend, before he finally stopped his machine in front of another house, where Tensaitchi was already waiting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Mametchi?\" Tensaitchi said, walking up to the automobile. \"Where is the human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight here.\u201d Said Mametchi holding his hand up so Tensaitchi could see the human, if he could be called a human at this point. Ash wasn\u2019t so sure anymore. He didn\u2019t feel any different. Not yet anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm, at lot smaller than they\u2019re suppose to be. Some type of miniaturization process?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMametchi nodded, \u201cThat was my conclusion as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLets get him inside and see if we can\u2019t figure this out.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The bad news is that the damage is done. I\u2019m afraid our tamagotchi DNA has taken root so to speak. It\u2019s very aggressive, and it\u2019s overwhelming your Human DNA.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long before I begin to feel the effects?\u201d Ash sounded like a man who has just learned he had a terminal disease.

Thank you for your help.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMametchi rubbed one of his very large fingers on Ash, he really understood how terrible this was for Ash. Having been shrunken down, and now becoming a completely different kind of creature in only a matter of hours. \"Tensaitchi?\" Mametchi looked at his older friend with a curious look. \"How will the change be? Would it be painful for him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I expect so.\" Tensaitchi sighed, rubbing his glasses while growing a frown. \"He'll just have to tough it out. I believe it will be seriously painful.. Because after all, his entire body is going to have to be mutated into one of us.\" He looked down at Ash \"Or if you want to compare this to your Doctor Who program, regenerate into one of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Mametchi sighed slightly. \"I guess we shall be going now.. I should also reveal the truth to Chamametchi..\" Mametchi picked up  Ash just like he had always done before. Saying goodbye to his friend, Mametchi left his friend's home. \"Ash, I'm very sorry about all of this.\" Mametchi said. \"Your going through so much pain right now I know..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c There is no need to be sorry, Mametchi. There\u2019s nothing that can be done about it now. I think it\u2019s starting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow does it feel?\u201d asked Mametchi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt feels like a dull ach all over my body,\u201d Ash answered. \u201cit feels like it\u2019s slowly growing in intensity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish I could give you something for the pain, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll even be effective.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.

Most people would give anything to be turned into something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMametchi stepped into his strange vehicle, and started to fly away back to his home. While he was driving, he had a frown on his face as he thought about what was happening to Ash now. \"Though remember this Ash.\" Mametchi started. \"Since that you are now becoming one of what I am, I believe Me and Chamametchi shall be caring of you.\" Mametchi started. \"We'll take care of you, because after all, it is completely our fault for what Is happening, and I think that's the only way to make it up..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMametchi parked his flying vehicle outside of his house. He also noticed that Chamametchi's bus was coming already. The school bus stopped near Mametchi's house, and Chamametchi walked out. \"Mametchi?\" Chamametchi curiously stepped up to her brother. \"Why are you outside.. And why are you holding my toy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Well, I need to explain something to you Chamametchi..\" Mametchi frowned. \"You see, your toy isn't a toy, it's a living human. His name is Ash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat?\" Chamametchi looked up at him with a confused look. \"so... He's a human? Not a toy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes... But not for much longer... Some complications have happened, uh..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat your brother is trying to say is, I\u2019m going to change.\u201d Said Ash.

Not like this,  not with this daft old face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChamametchi, looked at Ash. She didn\u2019t understand. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, everything is going to be okay.

Had she all this time been treating this person like it was some kind of object? That made Chamametchi feel so guilty inside. What if she really did end up eating the little guy in her cereal if she never saw him? That would have made her a murderer, even if she never knew!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Ash, that was your name?\" Chamametchi asked. \"No wonder why you felt so real... So lifelike.. You were always real..\" Chamametchi still was confused, she wasn't sure what to say to the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s my name.\u201d Ash looked up at Chamametchi, \u201cSomething\u2019s bothering you I can tell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that, I treated you so badly, and I almost murder\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop right there, Chamametchi. You didn\u2019t know I was in your breakfast. If you had eaten me it would\u2019ve been an accident, not murder. You didn\u2019t intentionally try to eat me. You may think you treated me badly, but you didn\u2019t. You saved my life when I fell out of that toy helicopter, and you handled me with great care and gentleness. You have nothing to feel bad about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChamametchi smiled, placing the tip of her finger on Ash, he did his best to return the affection by hugging the tip of her finger. Or at least as much as he could get his arms around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMametchi came back, with some sort of gadget in his hands. \"Alright, Ash, I need to tell you something, very, very important.\" Mametchi started, looking at his strange device with a serious look. \"As soon as the pain from the change starts to become unbearable, tell me. I'll use my sleeping gas on you so you could sleep through it. I don't want you to be in pain, so that's why I'm doing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChamametchi then looked back at Ash. \"It's gonna be okay, I'm going to take care of you for the rest of your life!\" Chamametchi said happily, smiling down at her new friend. \"No matter what!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Chamametchi, continued to hold her little friend, stroking his back with the tip of her finger. Mametchi, monitored Jon\u2019s vitals. His heart rate was up, but that was expected for the level of pain he was in. He admired the human\u2019s pain threshold, but he knew it was only a matter of time. Chamametchi was worried but Ash reassured the best he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly it Hit Ash like a ton of Bricks. Pure agonizing pain. His sudden outcry of pain startled both Mametchi and his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt-it\u2019s time.\u201d Ash managed to say. Chamametchi gently lowered him onto a mat in the middle of the table.  Mametchi quickly administered the gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Ash was asleep. Mametchi and Chamametchi started to watch the unconscious human's change into a tamagotchi. At first, it appeared that nothing was happening again, but all of a sudden, the changes started to appear suddenly. It was incredibly weird and disgusting, seeing a human's body morph into one of them. Chamametchi couldn't bear to look after a few moments, it was just so strange for her. Mametchi however, kept on watching the change in complete fascination and horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe change made Ash become a little shorter, and his skin became just like Mametchi's. He ended up growing the rabbit like ears that Mametchi and Chamametchi had.. It was amazing, this man only a few moments ago looked nothing like a tamagotchi..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMametchi checked Ash\u2019s vitals. They were all normal, for a tamagotchi. Other than his size, he looked completely like one of them. Mametchi let Ash sleep; he had gone through so much he felt it was best to let him recover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPacking him up in a cloth Chamametchi carried Ash into her bedroom. Sad, that this had happened but relieved it was over. They went to bed that night and in his induced slumber, Ash didn\u2019t dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChamametchi was the first to wake up the next morning. She went over to Ash with anticipation. Slowly he began to stir. His new eyes opened and he looked up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello\u2014\u201c His voice sounded different. He paused noting something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMametchi, come quick!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMametchi ran into the room looking at the new Ash wondering so many things, was he mentally the same? Did he have control of his new body? Finally Ash spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNew teeth, that\u2019s weird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Mametchi sighed, shaking his head slightly. \"Your going to notice that a lot of things are different you know. Why don't you try to walk, and get used to your new body?\" Mametchi asked Ash, closely examining the human turned tamagotchi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Mametchi?\" Chamametchi looked up at her older brother with a slight smile. \"I think Ash looks so cute now.. He looks kind of just like you, hee hee!\" She giggled loudly, before looking down at Ash again. \"Maybe.. Maybe of you don't mind, I can show you to all my friends. They wouldn't hurt you if they know your a Tamagotchi just like us now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah, wait a sec, let me get use to this new body first!\u201d Said Ash laughing as he began to take his first few steps in his new form. \u201cI feel like a kid trying to walk for the first time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh did eventually meet Chamametchi\u2019s friends. All surprised to meet a tiny Tamagotchi who used to be a human. Being a fan of Earth TV shows Tensaitchi gave Ash the Nickname \u201cThe Doctor\u201d, even Ash  agreed it seemed appropriate, even went so far in sleeping in a \u201cTARDIS\"\u201d made from Chamametchi\u2019s Blocks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis old life on Earth was over. His new life with Mametchi and Chamametchi was just beginning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The End</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nor<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
