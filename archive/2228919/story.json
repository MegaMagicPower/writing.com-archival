Please use comprehensible spelling and grammar to the best of your abilities. I don't want chapters full of nonsensical gibberish that no one can understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) don\u2019t make characters OoC without a reason for them to be OoC<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6) I will not give any points for choice chapters, and if you add a choice chapter and it has not resulted in a story (other choices don\u2019t count) after 1 week it will be deleted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7) size-difference should be the focus of the story(giant and/or shrunken guy/girl and or animals) but all transformation(age increase/decrease, animal and body-part) are okay      <br>\r\n<br>\r\n8) after having chosen a franchise please choice between a canon or alternative story line. Where canon would be a exact(or nearly) copy of the franchise story line, while alternative would be more free         <br>\r\n<br>\r\n9) to have as help you can use this  <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mrinitialman.com/OddsEnds/Sizes/compsizes.xhtml\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.mrinitialman.com/OddsEnds/Sizes/compsizes.xhtml</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n10) please have fun :)          <br>\r\n</td>",
