You smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo anyways, you were walking along minding your own business when you happened to absentmindedly step into another dimension! Dang dimensional portal! You had to tell your nerdy brother to stop inventing these things! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, the portal recognized the series on your dvd case and decided that it was going to send you there. So it transported you to a whole other world! You were so dizzy when you stepped through, you toppled over onto the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up, you thought you recognized the colours and style of this world. The more you walked around the more confused you got. This was the world of Yugioh! But-but it couldn't be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing all the people with duel disks on the streets, and their crazy hairstyles, you realized that it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was impossible! Overwhelmed with emotion and confusion, you fainted right then and there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up, a familiar person loomed over you, reaching out his hand. He had a kind smile. Somehow, you knew you could trust him. He helped you up, and you asked him his name, even though you knew it already. It was the protagonist of your favourite show! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before we continue, what's your favourite Yugioh show? (Or which one do you feel like today?) </span></div></div>",

You just know you'll get along great. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you talk to the girls you find out they're more mischievous than you thought. They were planning on ambushing one of their male friends with tickles later on in the day. You chuckle nervously, glad you're on their side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns out they can't decide who they're going to ambush. Which one of their friends needs to smile more?? They let you decide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it for as long as you need to, and then blurt out the name of one of your favourite boys. Truth be told, you've always wanted to see him get it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey agree with your decision. Later, at dinnertime, the plan is set in motion. But first! What name did you blurt out?

That haughty tone, his beautiful toned body, his exposed midriff, all of it called to you and said \"tickle me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently he was at a dinner table. He sat in his chair unsuspecting. He twiddled away on a piece of wood, carving something. Suddenly, the knife in his hand was gone. The piece of wood he was holding had been set on the table. Akiza was standing there with her arms crossed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't have you holding that. You might hurt someone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you...?! AAAaaahhh!\" he screeched as Luna got him under the arm. Everyone grabbed him and went for their assigned body part. \"Let go of me! EEEeeeeheehee! Y-you'll pay for this! GYAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! AHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAAHA! HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAAA! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA! AHAHAHHAHAAHAHAHAHHA! hahahahahahahaha... Hahahahahaaa... aha... ha... ha...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon it was discovered that Kalin was way too ticklish to survive a 5v1 attack. He was out of breath within a few seconds. You let up on him and let him catch his breath. With your team, you discuss the problem. You decide if he's to get properly tickled, without passing out after a short while, you'd have to take it easy on him. They decide you should get him first, with your <i>choice of weapon</i> and <i>area to tickle</i>. You agree to this, with everyone else playing rock paper scissors to decide every subsequent turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you choose?</span></div></div>",

You let up on him, but it's too late. He's passed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well. It was fun while it lasted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your friends are a bit disappointed. But you enjoy a nice dinner afterwards. After Kalin wakes up, things are a little awkward with him. You decide to apologize, and he accepts. He says he's okay with being tickled; just that you should warn him next time, and to please not use feathers. You nod. He gives you a hug, and then everyone enjoys a nice walk outside. Then the sun sets and you all go home to bed. </span></div></div>",

It only happens when he goes to bed angry. But his friends feel confused and betrayed nonetheless. They told you about that, and you felt for them. You told them you'd see if there's anything you can do to stop him from doing that again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kneel down on the floor, and pull his beige shirt up, tying it in the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad you aren't wearing your red crop top. Your tum-tum is too cute...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blushes and looks away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get his attention by running one finger up and down on his belly lightly. He giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this okay? I don't want to overwhelm you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods, but says, \"Just a little more pressure. I can't stand it when it's too light.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou understand, and do as he asks. He breaks into full blown laughter. It's quite adorable. The other girls smile and giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're enjoying this, aren't you...? you tease, now using both hands. He only giggles in reply. As he wiggles in his seat, his blue-white hair is strewn across his forehead and some of it sticks to his neck. His cheeks are flushed pink and his eyelashes glisten with tears. Perfect teeth sparkle as he smiles wide. (Such a pretty boy no matter what.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lets out a panicked shriek as you circle his belly button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Is this a sensitive spot?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you poke it, he immediately wraps his arms around his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe! D-don't...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow is he this cute? You smile fondly at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is fun, isn't it? And the fun isn't over yet. But first, you need to assess the feelings in your heart. Do you want to start a romance with Kalin, or would you prefer to just be friends...?</span></div></div>",

He looks around at the other girls. Something tells him if he doesn't say yes, there'll be hell to pay. He looks back towards you, considering. Then he smiles. \"Sure. We can give it a shot!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hug him and kiss him on the cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's get out of here,\" you whisper. He looks at you questioningly. What about the others? \"I'll just tell them to get Yusei later on. Looks like you've had enough.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go out to dinner together to a restaurant and order your favourite food. Kalin orders his. You spend some time in silence, occasionally looking up into one another's eyes. After dinner, you go for a walk. Kalin wonders if he'll ever be the same since he was a Dark Signer. You assure him that he can conquer the evil, and get better from it. Kalin has doubts, but he smiles politely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the way home, Kalin comes across a hungry-looking jackal. It's a beautiful creature, but looks malnourished. Kalin takes the leftovers from his backpack and feeds them to the animal. It seems to smile up at him happily, the way a dog would. Then it scampers off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile at Kalin's display of kindness, linking your arm with his. This could be the start of a beautiful relationship. :) </span></div></div>",

Six months later, the two of you were in bed together after solidifying a strong, healthy relationship. You'd think Kalin would be used to the morning tickles by now. Six months later, his stomach is as sensitive as ever. \"HEEHEEEHEE! STAHAHP! PLEASE! NAHAHAHAAHAAHAHAHAA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggle, letting up and rolling off him and flopping beside him on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, you're not getting away with that!\" Kalin said teasingly. He grabs you around the waist and tickles. You scream, more out of surprise than anything. He laughs in his adorable way. You manage to roll away and fall on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I deserved that,\" you moan, getting up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure did,\" he says, crossing his arms. You huff. Suddenly, you're in bed again, on top of him, getting him all over his exposed midriff. He giggles up a storm. Then suddenly, he's on top, your shirt half-pulled up, getting you on your stomach. You laugh and wiggle around (whether b/c it tickles or to make him feel better is up to you). You squeak as he pokes your belly button. Then you start laughing even more as he wiggles his finger all around inside. \"This is revenge for what you put me through all those months ago!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't long before you start begging. He goes slower, teasing you a bit more, and then he lets up. You smile up at him. Noticing he's wearing his beige long shirt again, you reach up and tie it around himself so it looks like a crop top. He smiles back, and does the same to your shirt. After he's done, he pokes your navel one last time. You squeak, a bit softer this time. Then he slips out of bed to make breakfast. You follow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you wear the \"crop\" shirts for the rest of the day. </span></div></div>",

You don't want to brush anywhere delicate or you might hurt him. Then your eyes rest on his feet. He still has one shoe and both socks on from the previous session. You smile mischievously. Too bad they have to go now... As you take off his shoes and make preparations, you talk to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you remind me of someone. Blond hair, blue eyes, actor, and complete cinnabun. I don't know why you remind me of him exactly... Maybe it's your laugh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKalin's eyebrow perks up. You whisper the name of the guy into his ear. Turns out Kalin's never heard of him. You wouldn't expect him to, given the universe you're in, either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't keep up with modern media,\" he says. \"But he sounds cool. I'm glad you're friends with someone like that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou admire how chill he is in a situation like this. Before you use the toothbrush, you put his feet in a tub full of water. It's both to clean his feet and to make them a bit softer. You use a towel to dry them off. For a moment you wonder if he's ever had a pedicure or if he'd enjoy one. He certainly keeps his toenails clipped beautifully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your feet are healthy. It's good to see that,\" you say. You get the toothbrush ready. \"How do you feel?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Kalin admits. He wasn't expecting you to care. When he feels the toothbrush make contact, he breaks into a giggle fit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good!\" You smile cheerfully. As you clean his toes, you go on with your thoughts. \"You know I had a dream recently. Did you know dreams are usually more reflective of how you feel than what actually is? Interesting, no? Well, in my dream, I tickled you, and you enjoyed it quite a bit. But I can't be sure if that's the true reality of it. Are you enjoying yourself? ... Would you like me to stop?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEHEHEHEHEEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEEE! Stop! HEHEHEHEEHEHEHEHEE! Please!\" he blurts before he could process anything. You stop and look at him curiously. He realizes what you said. \"Oh. Yes, I am enjoying myself. I just can't handle it for long periods of time...\" He blushes and looks away. \"As you already know...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" You eye his feet. The toes are perfectly clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ask him if you should get the rest of his feet or if he's had enough for one day. He answers...</span></div></div>",

Her personal favourite method is using magic to make cards real. That way, the cutest monsters could nuzzle up to Leo, making him giggle and practically die of cuteness.
