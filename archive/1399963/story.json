The trolly as if sensing your intentions drives down the road disappearing behind a few cars, all of which seemed to be driving themselves. You soon realize that technology in the future has advanced to such a high degree that people no longer need to drive cars. You look around your surroundings and see other advancements when it comes to technology, advancements like holograms resting on top, or on the side of buildings, all with a different image. Their were also children riding hover boards, that hovered only a few feet off the ground. You even saw a few robots assisting and aiding people throughout their day. The future has changed a great deal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, still sitting on the wheelchair decide to take a slow ride down the sidewalk. You looked amazed for a number of reasons, one you couldn\u2019t believe that you where in the future, two you couldn\u2019t believe that you could time travel, and three, you where amazed at the advancements the future made over the years. Honestly all these surprises could kill a old man, which you now  where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster, May I ask the reason, you have decided to expose yourself to the contaminated outside air, instead of staying in bed for much need rest?\u201d You hear SC-021 ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I just need some fresh air SC-021, staying in bed all day isn\u2019t a good thing you know.\u201d You say trying to come up with a good excuse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI seem so you going outside will help you feel better?\u201d SC-021 asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, of course it will.\u201d You say with a little old man laugh, that kind of reminded you of you grandpas laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see than proceed.\u201d SC-021 says before going quite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile riding the wheelchair down the sidewalk you see a man leaning against a wall reading a news paper. The man had no hair and looked to be somewhere in his 60s, he had on a brown jacket with a green shirt underneath, he also whore tan khaki pants with black shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh they still have newspapers in this era?\u201d You ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course master.\u201d SC-021 says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still looking at the man, sees that the man wore a angry look as he looked at the newspaper, you wondered why. The wheelchair responding to your thoughts goes over to the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMourning.\u201d You say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looks at you and his anger seemed to melt away, replace by a genial smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMourning sir.\u201d The man says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMight I inquire what\u2019s got you so angry my good man?\u201d You ask trying to sound as old as you could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh it\u2019s really nothing, I was just reading about how their was another conduit found in Mexico, a few days ago.\u201d The man said returning his gaze to his paper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConduit? What are you talking about sonny?\u201d You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know a conduit. A person with super powered abilities.\u201d The man said, looking at you a little weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh of course a conduit, sorry my memory isn\u2019t what it use to be.\u201d You say, pretending to understand what the man was talking about, but in truth you had no idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh it ok, or happens to the best of us.\u201d The man says with a little laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t know about you old timer, but I for one am tired of this conduit business. I say just dump them all on island X and be down with it already.\u201d The man said balling up his newspaper and throwing in the trash.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight I\u2019m with you, I\u2019m sick of these conduits as well, island X to every last on of them.\u201d You say still  pretending to know what the man was talking about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t know what this island X was, but you where going to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I should get going, I have old man things to do.\u201d You say, the wheelchair turning around and moving away from the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf, of course it was good talking to you old timer.\u201d The man says waving good bye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to go back to the hospital, on the way you decide to get answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSC-021 what the hell is a conduit?\u201d You ask <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA conduit is a person that has the ability to willed supernatural power, master.\u201d You hear SC-021 say in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere do these conduits come from?\u201d You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConduits are born, when a human eats Ambrosia.\u201d SC-021 says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is Ambrosia?\u201d You ask getting only more confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmbrosia is a special fruit that when eaten gives some people strange abilities or in some cases kills them, master.\u201d SC-021 says <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou at that moment thought back to the fruit you ate at the house. You remembered how the fruit had tasted funny, the weird feeling it gave your stomach. You knew without a shadow of a doubt that, that fruit must have been Ambrosia. And sense it didn\u2019t kill you, thank god, it gave you powers. The power to time travel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSC-021 please tell me what is island X?\u201d You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsland X is the location that all Conduits go to live out the rest of their days. Located in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, master.\u201d SC-021 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are conduits sent to live there, sense when?\u201d You ask shocked by the news SC-021 revealed to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEver sense the Conduit War master.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, what is the conduit war?\u201d You ask a little scared of the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Conduit War was the biggest war in history between conduits and human beings. It all started when a small group of terrorists threatened the United Nations. That small grew continued to grow until a hole army of conduits declared war on the world.\u201d SC-021 says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to cry, was this your future, war. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA treaty was finally formed between the conduits and the humans after a great loss of life, the conduits would have their own island to do with as they please, but the only condition was that no conduit could leave that island, and in return no human would interfere with the conduits. The conduits would be free to go about their lives in peace. This agreement is called the superpower accords\u201d SC-021 says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBullshit, the conduits are fine with that stupid deal?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTheir is a faction that disagrees with the accords, they call themselves the rebellion, they devote themselves to causing trouble for humans and conduits everywhere, and then their are the Conduits that awaken later on, and are forced to move to the island. The system even though flawed still works.\u201d SC-021 Says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it does.\u201d You say with defiance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis situation was best for everyone, especially for the conduits. Before the war had ended, humanity had pushed the conduit raise to the brink of extinction, their are very few conduits left alive, only a few thousand, master.\u201d SC-021 says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t believe it, it was more like you didn\u2019t want to believe it. So many things have happened, so many lives lost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to go back and stop this.\u201d You say with conviction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt any cost necessary.\u201d You concentrate on your time period, and with a flash you return to your bed laying down as if nothing had ever happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a lot of things you needed to do, you had a war to stop after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

'Brit' had been discharged, and her boyfriend was still missing. The news reporters would have a field day if they found out about your ability. Still, if Brit didn't get help, she would die. You decided to wait with her, and make up some story for the reporters.</span></div></div>",

These and more thoughts race through your head as you try to figure out what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Brit and her Uncle start fighting, and it gets out of hand. Pretty soon, all kinds of things are flyin through the room, and as you go to investigate, a knife is flung towards you, by accident ofcourse, but it strikes you in the chest nevertheless. You first feel an agonizing pain, then, after about a second, you feel better already. Curious, you pull out the knife, only to see the wound heal within a second in front of your eyes!

This kind of reminds you of that old fairy tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou decide to look upstairs, and climb the large staircase in the middle of the room. The halls upstairs are bare, mostly empty bedrooms that hadn\u2019t been used in years. Thinking back to that old fairytale, you wonder how such a creature could have come into possession of a castle like this. After scouring the hallways, you go to return downstairs, and find that there\u2019s a second staircase next to the one you came up. You didn\u2019t notice it before. Unlike the first, which is large, wide, and draped in a red carpet; this one is tight, stone, steep, dirty, and winded up and up a tower. You hold your ragged dress up over your knees so you can run up the seemingly endless flight of stairs as quickly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnce you reach the top, you\u2019re stunned to see a glowing, green light. The walls are covered in a green, emerald-like substance that was reflection light from somewhere. The room is almost empty, except for a small pedestal in the center, with a crystal atop it, covered in a glass case. Additionally, the walls are almost bare, except for small indents around the perimeter of the room. Each houses a small fruit inside, and there are nameplates below, possibly naming the fruit, or describing it somehow. A single indent had no fruit, but instead, an empty stand. The plate beneath it reads \u201cStrength.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYour stomach begins to growl. This fruit all looks so delicious, and you haven\u2019t eaten in a day. Who knows what types of food that beast might have in the kitchen? What does a beast eat? Instead of making the long trek back downstairs, you decide just to eat one these fruits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhich will you eat?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Although you don't notice, you don't actually fall to the ground; you simply float down.</span></div></div>",

You knew that voice too well. Fevroir. \"I'm not going to report the escaped prisoners. That would take away my two latest test subjects, wouldn't it?\" You're being blackmailed. Do as he says, or it's back to your cell. Maybe even execution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFevroir points to a desk across the greenhouse. On shelves behind it, dozens of black fruits are lined up in small glass cases. Protected from outside harm, as they rest on mahogany pedestals. \"Each of you, eat one. Then you may go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all?\" Eduard asks, doubting Fevroir would waste this opportunity with something so... simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.

Not as if he expected anything else, but it was always depressing to find himself in this place, all alone. He sighed and stood up, getting changed and walking to the forest. The forest was one of his favorite places, seeing as no one ever went there and it was quiet enough for him to think, imagining the life he could have had if he had been a little less ominous looking. He sighed, coming to his favorite spot and leaned against the trunk of a tall tree. He closed his eyes and smiled, thinking up, yet again, the life of his dreams. He saw himself, slicing the head of a powerful knight in black armor off in one swing and saving a beautiful princess. He saw her smile, kiss him and hug him, thanking him for his help. They went to her room, receiving cheers all the way. In her room, he smiled at her and she did the same to him, both slowly climbing closer in bed, until fin-<br>\r\nHe jumped as he heard a noise, opening his eyes and looking around. He saw nothing, and was about to close his eyes and get on with his fantasies when he noticed a solid silver bowl in front of him, containing fruits with small notes attached to their surface. He looked at them enviously. They looked good, better than anything he had ever had before. Finally, his sense of greed overcame his kindness and he shouted for anyone in the area to hear:<br>\r\n \"Whoever gave me these fruits, thank you!\" He reached down, grabbing a fruit in each hand and looking down at their labels.</span></div></div>",

He screamed again, looking around. He vaguely saw the black forms of people, almost as if they were shadows. He saw them speaking, but while he couldn't hear what they were saying, they seemed to be referring to him and the fruit. He screamed a third time, this time making the shadowy figures jump and rush over. He thought they were going to help, yet all they did was grab the fruit and the bowl, shouting silently to one another and running away as quickly as possible, fruit bowl in hand. Only one stayed, a girl of about fourteen. The shadow girl seemed to take pity, walking over and placing a mirror in front of him without a sound. She turned, apparently having heard something, and ran after the others. Sirius screamed a fourth and final time, falling face first to the soft forest floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSirius opened his eyes, looking around. He was laying in the forest, his head throbbing and his back aching. He moaned and stretched, looking at the world through one eye...<br>\r\n...and finding his other eye giving a similar, albeit very shadowy, image. He gasped, feeling something, or rather two somethings, move on his back. He looked back, not sure if he wanted to know what the things were, to find two black, bat like wings. He could feel that his teeth were sharp like fangs, and he had a long tail that resembled the tail of a scorpion. His skin was a dark red, almost black, and he saw his demonic features easily in the mirror. His left eye was black, the whites of the eye having become orange like flames and the center of the eye a bright red. He had a long, curved, bone white horn on the right side of his head, right above his green eye. He screamed, the sound like rough metal scraping and he heard the sound echo in the forest, where it shouldn't have, followed closely by screaming.<br>\r\n \"No, I can't have been that loud!\" He gasped as he ran home, planning to grab what he could before the townspeople came looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had grabbed a cloak, some food, his notebook, a few pencils, some ink, a quill, and some water. He looked around for anything else, and his eyes aligned on the note from his parents, the only memento he had of them. He grabbed it and put it in the back of his notebook and ran for the door even as he heard the mob of angry townspeople arrive. He stopped, put on the cloak, put the notebook and writing tools into the hidden pocket he had found in the back of the cloak, and left. He walked into a crowd of frightened and determined townspeople.<br>\r\n \"Sirius, do you know what caused that unearthly screech earlier?\" The mayor, Kyle, asked. Kyle was strong, tall, and noble, what every boy in the town aspired to. He had a tremendous hatred of anything unholy after his mother was killed by a demon.<br>\r\n \"No, I have no idea.\" Sirius responded in a voice that he barely recognized as his own. It was deep, rough, and had an unmistakable evil to it. Unlike the rest of the villagers, Kyle seemed to notice.<br>\r\n \"Hey Sirius, what's wrong with your voice?\" Now that he mentioned it, most of the villagers noticed as well.<br>\r\n \"Why are you wearing a hood? You always said you hate hiding your face.\" One of the villagers said, reminding everyone of the fact and convincing Kyle that you were hiding something.<br>\r\n \"Sirius, pull down the hood.\" He said, reaching for the hood of the cloak. Sirius backed out of reach and responded with a simple no.<br>\r\n \"Why not? What are you hiding?\" Kyle asked, sending a wave through the crowd.<br>\r\n \"I'm not hiding anything.\" By this point, no one could hear him, and someone managed to get behind him and pull down the hood. The entire clearing silenced instantly as everyone got a good look at Sirius's new face. Kyle seemed particularly unhappy, his normally peaceful and kind features twisted into the most hideous scowl Sirius had ever seen. Finally, Kyle spoke.<br>\r\n \"Kill the Demon!\" The cry was taken up by every person in the crowd, spreading and becoming louder every second. Sirius turned and ran just as the crowd surged forward. He ran for the forest, sure no one would follow. Unfortunately, nearly everyone was caught up in the excitement and anger of the chase and simply ignored the trees and lush foliage. Sirius ran as fast as he could, wings and tail trailing behind him. He felt someone dive and grab his tail, slowing him enough for the others to catch up and grab him. Kyle walked up and stood barely a step away, looking Sirius in the eyes, green and red alike.<br>\r\n \"We will not tolerate demons among us!\" He yelled to the crowd, electing cheers.<br>\r\n \"We will not allow the demon to hurt innocent citizens!\" The crowd shouts increased in volume.<br>\r\n \"We will kill the demon, using whatever methods we need!\" The shouting reached a peak, hitting pitches that no one in the group but the newly transformed Sirius could hear. The people reached for Sirius, trying with all their might to tear him in half.<br>\r\nHe screamed with rage, fear, sadness, pain, and more, putting all his strength into staying together. He felt the hundreds of people beginning to, quite literally, tear him in half. He reached deep inside himself for some kind of deep reserve of energy, sure he would find nothing and die by the hands of people he had once known.<br>\r\nYet he did find the strength and, shouting with determination above the screams of the crowd, pulled in with his arms, his legs, his wings, and his tail. The people tugging on his limbs screamed in terror as they were pulled off the ground and slammed into one another, many falling unconscious and the rest too stunned to stand. Sirius bellowed with all the air in his lungs, releasing a horrible sound somewhere between an animal growling, a human screaming, and metal being scraped with a second piece of metal. Many people collapsed in pain, the noise literally scratching their eardrums. Those who remained standing ran, leaving more people than Sirius could count laying on the ground, unconscious. Kyle was the only one still standing, his face red with pain and anger, his blade raised. The sword was a beautiful thing, a mixture of holy silver and the hardest steel in the land, it could seriously hurt any unholy being it touched, even with only the slightest touch. It was called Silverfang, and was the most powerful holy sword in the land. Sirius turned and ran a second time, trying to escape to the cave that all the people seemed to think contained some sort of monster. He had gone inside countless times, memorizing the tunnels and searching for this so called monster. He had never found anything, but perhaps he could lose Kyle in the tunnel systems. He reached the entrance and dived inside, barely avoiding a deadly sweep of Silverfang as it whizzed through the air. The blade smashed against the tunnel wall, knocking loose a small avalanche of pebbles. Sirius ducked under a second swing of the silver sword and tackled Kyle, pinning him to the ground and knocking his blade out of reach outside the tunnel.<br>\r\n \"Why can't you just leave me alone?\" Sirius shouted, a tear in his human eye, a spark in his other. Kyle glared up at Sirius and punched him in the face, hurting his own hand.<br>\r\n \"Because you are a horrible, unholy creature! My mother died to one of your kind, and I will never allow that to happen to someone else!\" He reached up and grabbed Sirius's horn, pulling hard. It felt as if he were about to loose his horn! He growled an animalistic growl and pushed Kyle back, scraping the man's back on the rough stone of the cave. He backed deeper into the cave as Kyle grabbed his sword.<br>\r\n \"What have I ever done?! Nothing!\" Sirius dodged to the side, barely avoiding Kyle's murderous overhand swing. Kyle shot him a look of pure hate.<br>\r\n \"But you will do something!\" He screeched, swinging his sword and barely missing Sirius yet again. \"Your demon blood will compel you!\"<br>\r\n \"I only gained demon blood today, and that was by mistake!\" Sirius jumped over Kyle's sweep and hit Kyle's hand with his palm, forcing the hand open and causing the sword to fly across the room, embedding in a wall. Kyle dived and rolled, standing and pulling the sword with all his might, yet it didn't budge. He growled and pulled his steel dagger from his hip, swinging at Sirius. Sirius dodged blow after blow, the moves fast and perfect. If anyone had seen the fight, it may have been described 'as fluid as any dance', yet no one was watching. Eventually, Sirius did a back flip, knocking Kyle's dagger out of his hands with his feet and stopping next to Silverfang. He grabbed it in both hands by the leather handle and pulled, grunting with the effort. Finally, the blade came free and Sirius pointed it straight at Kyle, who froze.<br>\r\n \"Just leave me be!\" Kyle then proceeded to do something Sirius would have thought insane: he grabbed the sword by the blade and pulled it out of Sirius's hands. He flipped it around, brandishing it expertly.<br>\r\n \"The blade doesn't cut the skin of a holy being.\" Sirius narrowed his eyes.<br>\r\n \"But you are getting tired, and I'm not, probably because of my new demon blood. Face it, I was a better fighter as a human, and I'm doubly so as a half human. You can't win.\" Kyle growled angrily.<br>\r\n \"I may not be able to kill you, but I can bury you!\" And he turned, running to the exit and slashing at the walls with his blade as he went. Sirius began to follow, but the tunnel collapsed before him, trapping him inside and Kyle out. Sirius sighed deeply. He would be left alone, probably until the end of his days. He walked back, moving to the deepest part of the caves, and lay down on the rocky ground. He ate the food he had packed and drank the water, then began writing in his journal. Eventually, he lay down the journal and went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Choice 1: Many years pass, Sirius only conscious enough to write in his journal on occasion, his demon blood giving him extremely long life and no need for food or water. He remains mostly asleep until he meets a girl named Myra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Reader's Choice.</span></div></div>",

It's already a No.<br>\r\n3. Keep Characters consistent within their own story. The character can develop differently as the story progresses, but radical changes shouldn't occur in a single chapter.<br>\r\n4. Try to make the choices at the end of each chapter a choice that the character could make, as opposed to something that happens. The choices can be really simple, but within each chapter, you could bring the story in an entirely different direction. <br>\r\n5.
