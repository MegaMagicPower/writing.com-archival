Your heroism earned you a ring with the yawe symbol on it, a symbol which named you 'elf friend' You had also been shown the elven city, Ellesmera, one of the few humans that had set foot in the city except the riders. You had been given one of the old elven swords, crafted by their forgemaster, Rhunon before the fall of the Riders.

The battle of the Burning Plains was about to commence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magicians readied their wards and spells, while, you and other fellow \"commoners\" prepared your armor and weapons. You marched along with the other Nighthawks, which was the group established to protect Lady Nasuada from danger. You see the mass of troops the Empire gathered. They looked like a swarm of bees. A chorus of horns and trumpets thundered over the plains, and the battle started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the other soldiers charged, you stood your ground, looking around for any hint of paranormal activity. You are the center of the army, the very rib cages that protect the delicate heart. Your duty was to protect the most important organ, even if it meant breaking yourself in half. Things were started to look bad, since the enemies refused to die, even when suffering severe cases of hemorrhage. You tightened your grip on your sword handle, preparing for the worst case scenario. Your weapon was surprisingly light. You named it \"Draumr Maela\", or Quiet Dream in the ancient language. Actually Eragon helped you name it, but it's still the same, since it is your sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, an arrow flew out of nowhere and accelerated towards Lady Nasuada. One of the Urgals reacted quickly and tried to block it with his shield, but the arrow flew with such force it ripped his arm off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arrow was flying fast towards Lady Nasuada...

Nasuada overheard your conversation. \"One of Eragon's spellcasters is named Yaela\" said Nasuada \"Perhaps it is the same person\" \"Perhaps\" you reply \"There's nothing we can do about it now, let's continue the battle\" You turned, slicing a soldiers head off, then jumped on another, wrestling a second sword from him. Leading with your elf-made sword, you charged into a group of soldiers, disposing of them in quick succession. You looked up as Saphira dived out of the sky and shot fire at a group of soldiers. \"What's that?\" you asked, pointing to the sky. A large, winged shape was coming through the smoke of the Burning Plains. As the shape neared, you realised it was a dragon. A red dragon, a rider astride it. Saphira, noticing the new threat, flew up to meet it. \"That dragon is red, it's not Galbatorix's dragon\" you say \"Who's the rider?\" \"I don't know\" said Nasuada, straining her eyes to see. You were distracted by a group of soldiers rushing at you. \"Brisingr!\" you shouted. A fireball engulfed the ground in front of the soldiers. Unable to stop their momentum, the soldiers ran straight into the fire. As soon as they get into the fire, you shouted \"Letta!\" The soldiers froze on the spot. You watched as they were burned to asphyxiation, then released both your spells. Exhausted, you refuelled your energy with the energy in your sword. \"That was an impressive display of magic\" said a voice to your left. A few yards away, Trianna, head of the Du Vrangr Gata, was fighting with a soldier. You ran over and dispatched him. \"You might have a place in the Du Vrangr Gata\" said Trianna. You shake your head. \"I prefer to work independantly\" you say \"Thanks for the offer, though\" You turn and slash at another soldier. You looked up to see both Saphira and the red dragon falling out of the sky, still fighting. Eragon and the rider were clashing swords. Suddenly, the red dragon broke off and dived at a contingent of dwarves. \"That's Hrothgar's unit\" said Nasuada. You heard the cries of dismay from the dwarves. Eragon jumped from Saphira and knocked the rider of the red dragon off his dragon. They continued fighting on the ground.   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You flung Nasuada on the ground as the rest of the Nighthawks dropped. You all had a narrow escape as the dragons clashed right over your heads. Spittle flew. Claws thrashed. \"Jana\" you said \"Get Nasuada out of here\" You then stood up, took out your elf blade and jumped onto the back of the red dragon. You got ready, steadying yourself, and then stabbed downwards. The elf blade punched through the red dragon's wards and into it's hard scales. The red dragon roared in agony. You felt a moment of pity for it, before it started rocking, trying to throw you off. You held onto your own sword, the only thing anchoring you to the red dragon, but to no avail. Your sword flew out of the red dragon's flesh and you started to fall. Your mind was blank. You could not think of any spell that could save your life. You heard the beat of wings and something closed around your waist. You heard Saphira's voice in your head. \"<i>That was a reckless and dangerous thing to do, (your name)</i>\" \"I know, I can explain...\" you started. \"<i>No need, you did well</i>\" said Saphira \"<i>You need to help Eragon</i>\" Saphira flew over Eragon and the red dragon's rider. \"Saphira, when I say, drop me as close to the rider as you can\" you say. \"<i>This is a bad idea</i>\" said Saphira, reading what you are going to do in your mind. You were directly over the other rider. \"Now!\" Saphira dropped you. You positioned yourself so that as you crashed into the rider, you came from the side, bringing the full force of your fall down upon him. He was knocked over. You stood up, unharmed by the fall, but the red dragon riders' wards were depleted deflecting you. You felt Eragon engage the rider in a battle of minds. Paralysed, he could not stop you as you stood up off him. He managed to break free and ran to his dragon. Using an item in his tunic, the red dragon rider healed his dragon's wounds and took off. As the dragon flew off, Galbatorix's army charged for one final assault. Eragon was panting. He was in no position to fight. You quickly looked over his wounds from the fight with the red dragon rider. You placed your hands on one of them and muttered \"Weise heil\" The skin healed. Immediately, Eragon looked better. What he really needed right now was rest. \"Saphira, take him back to the medical tent, he needs a better healer than me\" Saphira gathered Eragon in her claws, gently, and carried him back to the tent.  </span></div></div>",

I pushed the door open and saw horst's son, Baldor. \"Hello, Staurk. I got that knife you asked me for.\" he walked over to the tools and pulled a knife in a sheath out from behind a sturdy looking hammer,\" It would be easyer to fightr an urgle than to keep a secret from Marn, how old will he be?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" six,\" you say smileing, \" You didn't have to get a sheath, I could buy one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell him its our present.\"  I handed Baldor some meat and headed out of carevel toward my house. what does your family do.</span></div></div>",

Only to find it burning. You ran towards it and forced your way in. You saw your little brother on a table, cowering against the flame. You quickly jumped over the fire and threw him over it to Brom. You tried to look for your parents. There wasn't anyone else in there. \"Come on\" said Brom \"It's your dragon we need to find\" You, Brom and your brother, Reece run out of the house. \"See if you can hear your dragon\" said Brom \"Dragon and rider are telepathically linked\" You quickly reach out with your mind, trying to find your dragon. You sensed something, then heard a female infants voice \"Help me\" \"Where are you\" you asked in your mind. Suddenly, your vision changed. You were inside a box, looking out into a clearing with several men in red cloaks and armour. You pulled out of your dragons mind and told Brom what you had seen. \"I don't know where they are\" said Brom. \"I do\" you say \"It's a clearing in the Spine\" You led Brom and Reece into the Spine and by a known path. You held up your hand to stop them and then pointed to smoke coming up from a clearing to the right. You pull out your bow, which you had on your back when you went to Carvahall earlier and fitted an arrow inside. \"Are you crazy?\" asked Brom \"There are too many of them\" You aimed the arrow for your dragon's cage.
