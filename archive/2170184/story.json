These grape would then be brewed into communion wine. This hard and long work would help keep the souls of the people safe. He sung hymns whilst he worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he heard a thud. He looked around and found the source. A raven had fallen to earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was he a very bad state. Many of its feathers had came off. The flesh beneath was scared scabbed and burnt. It was very very thin. It left eye was sealed shut by bruises. He felt a heart beat, very slow and very faint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering tales of saint Cuthbert Friar John knew he had to care for the bird. He moved it into the guest quarters. He made a bed for it in his clothes chest. He then made some herbal poultices for its many would and a brother containing dormouse, small beer and a few drops of holy water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he noticed a pouch tied to the ravens left leg. It was made of a very fine cloth he couldn't identify. He opened it. In it was an acorn sized side and faintly glowed the green of spring sunshine through leaves. There was also a scrolled, tied with even finer thread. He carefully unknotted and rolled out the scroll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the scroll was short message. It was written in runes so he couldn't read it. However the abbot was he frequent correspondence with north men, he could translate it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later the abbot your see him. After he explained was had happened, showing the pouch, thread, seed and scroll the abbot was earner to know what the note said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plant this, that is all the note says\" translated the abbot. \"Do that, I think that their is some divine planning behind this. Plant it on the grave of our founder, we did all the spiritual help we can get.  Now is the crow well enough to be seen,\" the abbot then asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said friar John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then take me to it,\" asked the abbot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe abbot then saw the raven. He looked over it for some time. \"I think this raven is a servant of god, see the iridescence of the feature and the light in its working eye. Look after both his raven and the tree. You are freed from all other duties. Actually I have something that may help with that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe abbot went to the reliquary. He came back with a piece of parchment. It was written by saint Cuthbert himself and explained the tale of go he nursed a raven back to health and how it later saved his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn needed some convincing but eventually agreed to study the scroll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn planted the seed and look after it as such prudent. The rest of the time he looked after the raven. Some day passed and then.   </span></div></div>",

The whole area around it just felt dreadfully, dreadfully wrong. He new that if he stayed long that he would die. 4 of his seven eyes were blinded. The other 3 where on the opposite side of its head they the explosion. He feel his body slowly getting weaker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first tried to go straight to the nearest big down. Then he rumbling of tanks. The league forces were attacking, he was pretty sure they kill him if they found him, if he was lucky. Otherwise it would be straight to the labour camps of the rest of his life, which would have been short there even if he was completely unharmed. He'd go through the woods, he was a experienced woodslizard he could hide out there indefinitely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe broke under the tree cover, the sounds of war faded away as he got deeper. It was strange to only see half the world now. Having 180 degree arc were things could move up to him with ill intent and he could see them scared him, he constantly turned around as he made his way deeper into the forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a groundswrat stopped in front of him. It was a small creature, only 8 inches tall. Like all advanced animals on this planet it had 7 fold radial symmetry. The jaw was in the middle at the very top. It was fluffy and red. At base was a long fluffy tail. Longer then the creatures body. It was very flexible and was used to help it balance amongst the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts moved like a puppet it usually agile movements jerky and angular. It grabbed a stink and started to write something in the soil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me, the penitent can help you.\" it wrote. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrust knew of the tales of the Penitent. Mysterious and needed aid would be granted and only clue was a note that it was from the Penitent A lost child would be suddenly returned home. A starving family would find a animal walk right up to their house and suddenly die. A notorious criminal would be found tied up. They were many tales, some were certainly true. Nobody knew what the Penitent was. A mysterious monastic sect, the mayor in disguise, aliens, friendly ghosts, angels in training. The idea of possibly meeting Penitent thrilled him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe followed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast then returned to normal, ran up the tree and ate some nuts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere seemed to be nothing special about were he stopped. They was nobody around, no buildings or caves or anywhere a person could hide. It just looked like any other piece of forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grust, welcome\" said a voice said a voice that seemed to from a tree <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you,\" asked Grust<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am quite, where disguised here, I'll move a bit so you can see which one is me,\" said the voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a root burst from the ground and then hovered a foot or so from Grust's chest. This three working eyes, stared at it opened wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your a tree then . All this time wondering and I've probably walked right passed you\" joked Grust<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'll answer your questions. But first I will heal you. Just grasp my root, I will do the rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrust did so. Grasping it with 3 hands at once. He felt warm spread through his whole body. The weakness left him, he was a good a new, better actually. The warm reached his eyes, he could see the full circle again. Some sort of glow as pulled out of his body and into it's root. It then flowed down the root and was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go back a few paces,\" asked the tree<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrust did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirstly the trees roots thickened and lengthened. Then the trunk got wider and tall. The major branches then reached out further. Lesser branch and leaves then grew to fill the gap. Once it was done the tree had reached from 40 to 60 feet tall. Its trunk was 8 feet wide. It was now one of the largest trees in forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was slightly more potent then I expected. No matter, I already was systems in place to prevent damage once I become truly enormous. Being huge will make somethings easier. Secrecy will be impossible, but things are dire enough to risk cultural contamination,\" observed the tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt then address Grust, \"Do you think there are any other people in your village in need of help?\" it asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I saw them,\" Grust then paused \"I just left them and ran, I didn't he check if I could help. I'm such a coward,\" denigrated Grust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was nothing you could have done, nothing any of your species could have done. You as a species don't know what sort of horrors you've brought back. If you tried to say you would have died. But now you've found one of the few beings on the planet that can help not just your village, but your whole species, it fact the entire biosphere,\" reassured the tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I bring them here? I might be able to get a few over in time, assuming they can survive the journey,\" suggested Grust<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help you\" said the tree<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were having a small tournament. 50 Koopas, 50 cheeps and 50 boos were all going against Jinx at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone who can get a single hit against me will move up to the next belt,\" declared Jinx. \"Start in 3, 2, 1, Go\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they all rushed forward.  Jinx blurred and disappeared. More and move the attacks ended up on their backs. In two minutes they were all down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goomba knew that every single one of them was several times stronger then him. Yet Jinx beat them all flawlessly. He was both nervous and excited. If he could even be one percent as strong as that, that would be brilliant. But he was to nervous to actually ask for help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead he made up a sign saying \"please train me to be stronger.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited holding the sign whilst they spilt into twos to train against each other. Jinx circled around giving advice. A few hours later the meeting ended and people started to go home. The Goomba kept holding up its sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinx then came over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your persistence has got my attention, I will give you one lesson,\" offered Jinx<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th..Th...thank you\" stuttered the goomba <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Firstly I what so she how you attack, Hit me, use your best move as best as you can. I will use by weakest stance I will not try to dodge, parry, block or counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinx stood there in a very open stance. The Goomba waddled towards him and gave him a headbutt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big zero appeared, no damage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attack his block instead,\" a single block appear. The goomba went to headbutt it, repeated. It kept doing zero damage but then it did 1 and the block dissolved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goomba then glowed and grew from 2 feet tall to 2 feet 2 inches.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel stronger,\" said the awestruck Goomba \"what just happened.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just levelled up. Every time you defeat an opponent, even a block, you gain some experience points. Gain enough of those and you get a level up and become stronger, and in your case bigger,\" explained Jinx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if I defeat enough blocks I be able to get really big and strong,\" deduced the Goomba<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not that simple, each level up needs more experience they the last. If you fight something much much weaker then you get less and less experience the more you overpower it, but never zero. For example I would have to disolve 17 trillion blocks to get to my next level up, and I'm most of the way to it. To level up quickly you have to fight the strongest things you can definitely beat. If you get defeated they amount of xp you get goes way down for a time, that why even those few times you beat mario you never levelled up from it,\" further explained Jinx<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if I flight blocks for now I'll still level up pretty fast.\" checked the Goomba<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but soon you'll have to fight stronger things, things that can hit back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where can I find lots of blocks to fight\" asked the Goomba<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a special training room for that,\" he then pressed a secret switch revealing a stair case going down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goomba went down the staircase and found there were hundreds of blocks. Some were even floating in the air. It destoryed the first block with a 2 damage attack. It respawned a few seconds later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goombas destroyed 3 more blocks and leveled up again, growing to 2 feet 4 inches. Encouraged by this it then defeated 9 more blocks and grew to 2 feet 7 inches tall. Its attacks were now doing 7 damage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goomba would spend a very long time level grinding on the block. But how long. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One was another of those \"romance\" novels staring Mr iron, which consisted of Mr Iron having complete control over a series of interchangeable women but somehow this is romantic. Another was by a tiger, it was hard to tell if it was dating advice or a cookbook. Finally there was a series of risqu\u00e9 descriptions of ankles, good thing Mr Pages never heard about that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good day, traveller\" whistled the contact. \"We have a safe house in the sewers under a very low budget theatre in Veilgarden.

They can in so many different shapes and materials it was very hard to tell what was alive or sapient, leaving to lots of awkwardness. Doing a lot of study with all of the aliens they discovered they found that all sapient beings distort a universal field, a distortions that can be measured and located. When trying it on the planets of solar system they first through their was bug, there was sapience everywhere. They when discovered that all the planet were alive. However they seemed to be dreaming, they had dream like patterns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPluto also had this pattern. They decided to start with pluto as it was small and distant enough they'll have chance to do anything if it went wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlanets had very big broad brains so could learn very quickly. They downloads the full dictionaries of all the languages they knew of into pluto so it would be able to talk to everybody. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian spacestroller was decided to do the first meeting, he had a lot of experiences with first contacts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings to Pluto, I bring word from all the beings of galaxy and the thanks of the millions and live upon and within you\" greeted Brian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So there are other beings in existence they me,\" pluto pauses \"I like that, I like that a lot. So what are now made of and what shapes are you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian sends and huge stream of data about the basic physiology of thousands of different alien species. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually what am I,\" asked Pluto<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian shows him. Starting with images and basic measurements and then moving on to orbits composition moons and all the many millions of things there had learned by then.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh I'm huge, I'm a million times bigger then most of the people you've showed me. Is there anything around about my size,\" asked Pluto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there's the planets, we are going to start talking to them soon, they are even bigger then you, some more then the hundred times bigger,\" explained Brian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they're all planets like me,\" checked Pluto<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Technically your a dwarf planet,\" corrected Brian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I'm going to talk with all those planets I want to be a planet too, how do I do that,\" asked Pluto<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian explained the official definition of a planet, that it can't be changed without making all the text books in the galaxy wrong,  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that I could reach the definition if I got bigger. So I will,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly everyone living on, in and in orbit of Pluto got message. \"Brace yourself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what is Pluto doing  </span></div></div>",

Eris would soon have a few quintillion more friends to her upon here million of lightyears across (and still growing) surface. It would only be a couple of week until she fills the whole universe, she will surely find something to grow into then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought back to when he first met Eris, she was less then hundred metres across then. He would have passed her by it he hadn't looked over the sensor readings again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6 months ago<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe asteroid had complex organic molecules on it. The only know methods to produce them were living things. He went to investigate it, the least interesting reason would be in was knocked off earth by the meteor strike or super volcano in which case it could be the oldest palaeontological site ever found. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old thing was it should have been flagged up and lot sooner. He checked the older records of the this asteroid, in the first those it was just a boring nickel iron rock, one of billions like it, not even worth mining. In later readings it kept changing, in one it was made entirely out of gold. He requested data from earth, all the records of it were of it just being a regular rock. It only started to change when he got near, it was like it was trying to lure him in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was way to big from just a one man mission. It would need biologist, mineralogists, xenologists, mathematician, linguists, ethicists and all the ologies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of respect he decided to beam a signal to it. \"I'm very impress. We will send loads of people soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a reply came back \"I've waited far to long, I want you and I want to as fast as you can safely do it. I will not risk being alone for another 4 billion years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe asteriod was now being narrow beam scans to get lots of data in real time. It shape, colour composition was changing constantly. The readings were changing too fast to read. One thing was clear, its size, it was increasing, fast. It started out at 47m across and was already 60m across. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad realised he didn't want to leave her alone any more. He didn't even realise he just given the rock a gender. He was already making up offical reasons in his mind as he piloted his craft towards her. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
