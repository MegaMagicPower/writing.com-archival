Inside this box, which displayed colorful images of scantily clad women and strong warriors facing off against demons and dragons and other fantastical beasts, was a game, one much like the famous Dungeons and Dragons. The name of this game isn't important to our story at the moment though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that matters is what happens when this box is opened, when the game is released into the world. Mundane reality will start to corrupt and change into a world of fantasy, adventure, and danger. And things have a good chance of getting a little sexy along the way as well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn but a moment, a group of friends would descend into this dungeon to release the magic kept inside this box. When they do, however, in what form will the corruption take?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGradual change: As soon as the box is opened, changes will start to spread outwards from it, first affecting the players and those around them before moving out across the world in a rolling wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstant change: In a flash, the players are transported into a fantasy world as their characters, recognizing the various other characters they meet as people from their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGM is God: The player who takes the roll of Game Master will find themselves able to influence all of reality. They, naturally, immediately begin abusing this power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they Play: The game operates on Jumanji rules. Changes will only occur to match things that happen in the game.</span></div></div>",

Almost immediately after opening it, they find their reality shifting to be more like the fantasy world of the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrimary focus is on transformation and story, but other fetishes are welcome as well, as long as they don't break the rules below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOT ALLOWED:<br>\r\nGraphic gore/violence, snuff, toilet/slob fetishes, foot fetish, underage sex. (Some of these may be allowed just for story content, but they cannot be fetishized. And absolutely no to the underaged stuff, we're not going there.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnything that isn't listed as not allowed here can be used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPut effort into your writing. This may be fetish stuff, but have some pride in your work, please. I may edit chapters for minor grammar and spelling changes if I feel the need to, as well as adding extra options to chapters with few of them (just because I can).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there is a path you want expanded upon but don't feel like writing, you're free to ask me to try and fill it out. I make no promises.</td>",
