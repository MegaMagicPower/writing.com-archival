This did not bode well for your little human self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night had fallen it would seem, the lot of the Horde mostly asleep or gone elsewhere, but it was clear that the city was still very much alive, stamping feet, boots, and other forms of motion all around your little self.

Whether that meant you were safer was a question of its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need to find shelter and have a few options.

Big ones. Most of them were clad in plate, but the ones that weren't training were mostly nude, save for a cheap piece of cloth to hide their modesty.

It's a high-traffic area, but it's the easiest place to get some food and shelter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Financial District is immediately to your right. The auction house and bank are here, and this is where Boss Mida has set up shop, although she doesn't seem to be in right now. This is another high traffic area, as Goblins parted with their money and worldly possessions don't tend to be parted for too long. Imagine if you managed to grow back and you got a gold coin to grow with you! You could buy Azeroth with that much!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Industrial District is at the back. The slums are filthy and grimy and the Industrial District is the worst of it. Oil from the derricks have spilled into the pond and washes up on the shore. This is where the miners, blacksmiths and, ironically, the shamans have set up. This is the lowest traffic area, but its further out than the other two districts and the way would be treacherous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere will you go?</span></div></div>",

The standing troll had his cock slipping in between the lips of the blue giant, going through the gap between the large tusks to fill that maw. Closer down to your position between those green feet was the throbbing erection of the blue troll and as you looked in terror one of the green feet lifted up. You could only watch as those two toes, that were far larger than your own body, wrap around the cock of the blue troll to help him along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith disgust and terror at the actions of these members of the horde, you start moving along the wall in an effort to escape from beneath the trolls.

While distracted by this you failed to notice the fingers reaching down to swipe you up off the ground without a care as to how much it hurt you as they clamped around you tightly. Blood rushed from your head as you were lifted towards the blue troll's maw even while he never stopped in his ministrations on the shaft between his lips. His glinting eyes looked over your tiny body, your head being the only thing sticking out of his grasp. Even though your distracted by the massive shaft being slurped just feet from your position, you were wondering what was in store for you now.</span></div></div>",

On the horizon, a slow moving continent of fat and muscle fills your entire view and only gets larger as it set its sights on you. This beast seems different from the other ogre you encountered however, the last ogre was large by all means (after all, it nearly obliterated you underfoot without even noticing) but this one looks as if it struggles to stay contained within the walls of this mound. It was not merely just large in frame either, the behemoth carries a belly that looks large enough to contain every man, woman and child of Stormwind within and still have enough space for dessert afterwards. Every fiber of your being, every bone in your body, every cell in your brain is telling you to run and to not stop running but your legs refuse to move an inch, preferring instead to stand in the presence of this titan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the mountainous ogre lumbers over to your makeshift abode, with every step threatening to make you cry out in fear.

A single hand, dwarfed by the blubbery mountain but still enormous compared to your insignificant size makes contact with the mammoth gut before you. Each rub of that belly seems like an assertion of dominance from the ogre. You are nothing to him. Just a speck of dust in the presence of a giant. As if to further that point, the hands of the colossus reach underneath the towering bulge and raise it high, showing you the tattered loincloth of the giant and the previously obscured underhang of this hand crafted masterpiece. Just as quickly as it was raised, the hands release their load and allow the stomach to spill forth like a tsunami, creating massive tremors when it makes contact with the table, sending you tumbling onto your backside. The belly is now almost in contact with you, achieving the impossible and somehow looking even bigger this close. At this range, it's very tempting to walk up to it and touch it - to feel merely a fraction of the power this god had, but what's left of your fractured senses decide against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventually manage to avert your gaze upwards towards the face of the being who had  taken you captive. You lock gazes with the beast before you, his stare piercing your very soul with an uncaring grimace. His mouth opens wide to reveal a cavern lined with marble and release a long, crimson monster that licked along his pebbly lips. The more you look at the ogre, the more you realise that he has an intense look of...disinterest in you. If you didn't know any better, you would think that he was looking straight through you. Is what you are standing on really more important? Then it hit you. That smell... it's the smell of cooked meat. This whole time you had been standing on a slab of meat. The ogre hadn't seen you, he'd seen the delicacy underneath you. Just as you made that realisation, the behemoth reaches forward with one of his pudgy hands and starts lifting the meal skyward towards that dark cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's too late to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maw of the ogre approaches ever closer. Your situation is dire, but if you think this through you could still escape relatively intact. You could try shouting up at the ogre; you don't know if it can hear you at your disturbingly small size and even if it could, whether it would be willing to help you but anything is better than the stomach of a hungry ogre. Another option would be to head towards the hand of the ravenous giant, it's quite some distance but the fact that he's eating barehanded makes this much easier. Again, risky but it might be necessary.</span></div></div>",

After all, a dwarf may understand your dilemma better than most in this world. This situation is a little more extreme though, as at this pitiful size the dwarf could crush you underfoot without even noticing your pleas for help. You decide to take the smart option and hopefully wait until approaching the dwarf has a lower chance of obliterating you. Hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nearby table towers over you, and you dash to one of the large wooden legs. Feeling a tad bit safer, you let your gaze wander over to the behemoth standing at the entrance to this abode and proceed to observe every feature of this menacing being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom your elevation, two large walls of cracked leather round and stretch skyward to form a pair of well traveled boots, eventually meeting a field of scales laboriously stitched in to some sort of vast kilt, held in place by an equally vast belt. Atop the strained belt sits an absolute monster of a gut, bare and covered with an expanse of hair, it's no doubt this tank was constructed to spend many a night in the local tavern. Further up, a thick grey beard stretches up across the wide chest like a dense jungle, rooting itself in the rotund face and hiding the jaw from view; evidently a lot of care has gone into its presentation as four glimmering gold rings adorn the landscape, fracturing the forest into five distinct territories. At the summit of this peak, rests the distant eyes of the beast, clearly exhausted and still unbeknownst to your presence. Still remaining stationary, the dwarf lets out an ear splitting yawn and stretches out his arms to his sides which, to him, was merely to relieve the stress of a long day but to you, instead looks like a show of power meant to intimidate you into submission, as mountains of muscles expanded to show you how easy they could crush you and the cavernous maw displayed how it could consume you as easily as a keg of ale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to put this day behind him, the dwarf kicks up whirlwinds of dust and dirt as the leather continent fast approaches you. Every step shoots a loud quake throughout the landscape and rattles you to the core, which only increases in intensity as the footwear seemingly travels miles in seconds, edging closer to your minuscule form. One final shockwave violently throws you backwards, causing you to land in a heap further under the table. The titan then stops. Had he spotted you? Perhaps you should pray at this point and just hope to survive? No... he was only stopping to grab a chair to sit on. A sigh escaped your lips as the giant spread himself upon the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he had stopped moving once and for all it was time to get his attention? You highly doubt he would hear your cries for help over the creaking wood and typhoon like breathing. The boot resting directly in front of you could be a good start, at the very least getting off the ground would hopefully lower the chance of you getting squashed into a paste. Hopefully.</span></div></div>",

They seem a little different this time however - more erratic, a tiny bit less powerful than the earth shattering booms that threatened to crack the world in two from only a few moments ago but far more persistent with no breaks between the quakes. You look around for the source of this noise, noticing that the dwarf sitting in his throne above you had remained stationary, however you notice the boot directly in front of you has begun to shake violently. This could mean only one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the top of the worn footwear, a distant yet still vast wall of flesh starts to ease its way out of its den. The process is a slow one, every second more of the beast escapes its restrictive prison, the skin reflecting in the dim light and showcasing a thick layer of sweat that had built up over a day's hard work. This, combined with the dwarf for some reason choosing to forgo socks leads to the air around you suddenly becoming a great deal more humid, starting to feel more like a rainforest than the middle of a dwarf's house. That is nothing compared to the pungent stench that begins to grip the air though  as the area began to adopt the smell of the reclining behemoth. The fact that the giant before you could create a new microbiome simply by removing his footwear is yet another painful reminder of your pitiful size. Even thinking of yourself as a speck of dust would be optimistic right now, this dwarf was more like an uncaring god at your size, capable of reforming the landscape around himself without even being aware of the effect it may have on you. Moping around however will not get you anywhere - you still need to get this being's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fleshy expanse continues to grow until it blots out the dim light above you, casting a grim visage over the landscape as if to forewarn that a great event was about to alter the very fabric of this world. You knew that even if you ran at full speed, you had no chance of escaping the recently emerged monster but perhaps if you were lucky, and stood in the right spot the beast might spare you. Hopeful that fortune would give you a break, you watch the callused ceiling approach like a distant meteor with the ravines and hills that defined the foot's ragged underside only becoming more noticeable as time goes on. Soon, the ball of the foot smashes to the ground with an earsplitting boom, kicking up a storm of dust so strong that it knocks you backwards a considerable distance with you landing flat on your back. The last thing you see before darkness overtakes you are the momentous digits of the dwarf's foot crashing down upon your battered body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to your surprise however, you aren't quite dead. Yet, anyway. Before your senses even begin to process your surroundings though your nose is outright assaulted by the stench; it was overwhelming before but now it infiltrated every corner of your nose forcing you to gag and attempt to hold your breath in this musky prison. That out of the way, you slowly rise to your feet, surprised by the amount of free space you had to move around in this dark cavern. Very little light leads to an almost pitch darkness but you are just about able to make out walls that almost seem to luminesce against the inky blackness - surrounding you from seemingly all sides. You reach out and touch one of these expansive walls, your hand becoming enveloped in a viscous mass of fluid several inches thick that like the walls, almost glows against the dim light. Reaching further in you find that the wall is slightly pliable, responding ever so slightly to your touch. You were rather confused as to your current location, if the foot had come down upon you, why were you still alive? Why could you move around freely without the sole restricting your movement? What is this thick layer of fluid you collected? It was then at this point you realize there was only one place you could be. Between the canyon like toes of the gargantuan dwarf. You were still alive because the foot narrowly missed you; you could move freely because there was no sole above you and this fluid... a thin layer of sweat that had mixed with the dirt of the dwarf's foot, unnoticeable to him but creating an unbearable stench for you. Shortly after you make this conclusion, the canyon surrounding you begins to quake and contract, greatly reducing the amount of space you have to move around in. The dwarf merely rubbing his toes together had wedged you between the great barrier of skin, with thick syrupy sweat being massaged into every orifice of your body, completely drenching the robes you are wearing with the distinct scent of dwarf foot sweat. As the two surfaces anatgonise each other and battle for possession of you, the humidity increases to a level so high that you are barely able to breathe. Battered, bruised and choking on the dwarf's essence consciousness starts to escape you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventually come to, but you realize that something is off about your surroundings. Clearly, you have been moved in your forced slumber.</span></div></div>",

His smiling affable face seemed almost godlike and cold as he took no notice to the insignificant pipsqueak who was about to get caught under his heavy-footed tread.  Each time those impossibly huge bare paws would smack the ground it sent booming shocks through the wooden floor that made your knees buckle, and in just a few strides the giant had closed the gap between you and the door. You stood still as you saw the colossal bear's paw peeled off of the floor a distance away, before dramatically swinging forward and sailing overhead. Everything seemed to slow down as the shadow of his wide foot was casted over you, you saw the filthy underside of his massive paws in great detail as every bit of dirt and grass that stuck during his walk was on full display overhead.

The idea of testing your luck underfoot one of these colossal tipsy bear giants when you've already almost been stomped on was enough to shut the idea down. The blackout drunks also didn't seem like a very good choice though, sure you could climb them if they stay asleep, but how were you going to wake any of them up once you needed them? Besides, you can't guarantee they would even understand what's going on. What if they were so drunk that they just plucked you up and popped you in their mouth like a bar olive when they notice you? No, out of your limited options neither of these seemed very wise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen your attention was drawn back to the hulking behemoth that had almost stomped on you earlier. He was still sitting at the bar and it looks like he hasn't moved since settling down. He was sitting rather silently, and he wasn't fidgeting or stomping his feet, at least not enough to really be a threat. The colossus has sat relatively close to you, and you had to crane your neck to see his expression. It seemed that he had been served while you weren't paying attention, he was sipping away what looked like gallons of ale with every gulp from the massive tankard in his grasp. Not seeing much of another option, you started heading across the floorboards towards where the towering patron sat. You scuttled across the floor as fast as you could, passing by each of the wide muddy prints that the behemoth had stamped onto the floor on his way to the bar.  After a few minutes you arrived, you were beside the bar and close enough to the gigantic paws of the bear to smell them. The scent of the bears immense paws coated with sweat and earth was indescribably bad, enough to make your eyes water even at a distance. Gazing upwards past the rank paws and huge belly of the beast, you saw the kind smiling face of the patron that had almost squashed you earlier. When you were about to be crushed by him that expression had seemed almost cold and dismissive, now the giant's wide friendly smile was the only beacon of hope in your world of towering beasts and thunderous footfalls. The giant brought a pudgy hand to his king sized gut and clutched it as he took another massive swig of his ale, while you watched below and pondered what to do next...</span></div></div>",

It quickly became clear however, the paw was not finished with its loving embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paw did rise but with you as a passenger, the thin layer of sweat adhering you to the rough surface of the pawpad as the paw accelerates ever faster with the wooden floor you once called home growing ever more distant. Soon the foot reaches the precipice of its stride and starts to descend once more, leaving you in the uncomfortable darkness once more. The process repeated over and over, seemingly never ceasing and you began to wonder if you would be doomed to be lint stuck to a paw of a gargantuan pandaren for the rest of your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pondered this, your captor up above was having some much nicer issues to consider.

You just thanked the light that the worst you had was a few minor bruises and scrapes at this point, but there was no telling when or if your luck would run out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the paw started to raise you noticed something was off as the paw was clearly lifting higher than before. Something that the pandaren above probably didn't even notice was a massive hint to you as you looked down to confirm your suspicions. A wooden step, which could only mean one thing. The pandren was heading upstairs to one of the inn rooms, perhaps to get some sleep? You did not know, but you steeled yourself knowing that the end of your ordeal was in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did however forget one thing, which became immediately apparent as the pandren made his first step up the stairs. Walking up the steps would require him balancing on one paw as he brought is immense frame up to the next step. Again, this was something that was nearly imperceptible to your captor, but something that threatened to break bones or worse if you were unlucky. As the paw came down the pressure was even more immense than usual, so immense that it almost felt like you were about to become one with the paw itself. All the air was squeezed out of your lungs and the pain in your limbs was immense for a few long seconds but you survived as the paw started to raise again. You had survived the first step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey did not get any easier as the odyssey continued, with each step coming dangerously close to breaking something but miraculously being saved at the last second each time. Soon enough, the hardest part was over as the titan made it to the top of the stairs and began to make the last leg of the journey, which while certainly uncomfortable was nowhere near as bad as your ordeal on the stairs and you were thankful to the gargantuan bear for that. It was unusual but you almost had a sense of kinship with your captor, a sort of appreciation for surviving the unusual journey together - even if he was completely unaware of your existence. It was then you remembered that this beast was more than an inanimate paw and just because he was unaware of your plight did not mean he wished it upon you. The pandaren above that was simply that, a pandaren, no matter your difference in size. You just hoped you could get his attention and he could hopefully help you out of this predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your mind wondered you failed to notice that the pandaren had stopped to open the door to his room, walked in and had shut the door - sealing you in the same room alone with the beast. He took a few more steps before sitting on the base of the bed, it groaning in immense protest beneath his gargantuan frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paw sat just above the floor, resting on its heel and giving you a chance to get a breather if only for a few seconds as the pandaren...</span></div></div>",

It comes to a surprise then, when the light of the room is once again blotted out by something large. Is he getting up again? No, it doesn't look like it. Looking up, you see the large pudgy hand paws heading towards you or at least the feet you're on. While it looks like the pandaren hasn't noticed you specifically, he has noticed the mild irritation you have been causing and he intends to do something about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chubby fingers crash into the ground and start vigorously rubbing against the sole, the loud sound of skin rubbing against skin omnipresent to you.

The process was surprisingly painless, if a little uncomfortable - hells, you even think if the pandaren was aware of your perilous situation you might enjoy it but that would be something to worry about another time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pandaren continues to massage the paw and you along with it, pushing you a little deeper into the crevasses of the pawpad and making you smell just a little bit more like paw musk every time he does so.

The entire frame of the bed groaned in protest as the gargantuan Pandaren settled onto the mattress. The trip through the air on the side of the huge clawed hand was terrifying and made worse by the Pandaren settling into bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got the courage to open your eyes again you saw that you were moving over the fur covered surface of the giant's immense and ever active gut. The impressive rounded paunch of his huge belly steadily moved up and down with the giant's breathing as you were carried past his hairy chest and stopped directly over his huge sleeping face. Your huge unwitting captor's eyes were closed tight, and you could only cling frozen to his hand for safety as the giant's massive maw stretched open directly below you. Your gaze was locked in horror as the wide mouth of the massive beast opened at an agonizingly slow pace. As his jaws and lips parted, you caught the full view as strands of thick saliva stretched and snapped between the bottom and top of his mouth. His teeth glimmered in the dim light his room and his slimy tongue sat underneath you, slick with saliva. As a crumb sized human you couldn't be in a more terrifying position, if you lost your grip and fell into the Pandaren's cavernous mouth he would likely gulp you down without any notice. The hand that you clung to moved ever closer to the giant's widening maw as the sleepy titan started to take a huge yawn. You wish you could cover your ears as the massive mouth below you started to inhale very deeply for a few seconds, the few long strands of saliva still unbroken shook violently and his tongue quivered as the oversized mouth you hung over inhaled with a terrifyingly loud sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you that was the easy part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the huge bear started to exhale in a massive yawn you could only hold on for a few moments before losing grip and being flung off. The gale of hot breath that the Pandaren behemoth unleashed onto you stung your eyes and shook you around as you clung to his hand. The hot and humid wind blew hard on your tiny body and covered you with the beast's spittle. The overpowering breath of the giant beast also carried the unmistakable scent of what it had for lunch, fish and sharp cheese with bread and ale. You didn't want to end up as a small side to what was brewing in this mighty Pandaren's stomach, but you had very little control over what happened next as the blast of hot breath bellowing from his mouth forced you to loosen your grip and fall...</span></div></div>",

You hit the surface and sunk below, instantly fighting to swim upwards lest you drown in the slobber of the uncaring oaf. Your head broke free of the liquid and gasped for breath, instantly recoiling at the intense foul smelling breath that you sucked in. Gazing upward, you see the tongue that you were on raised upward towards the wide open jaws of the beast. You were uncomfortably close to the back of his throat, and you were going to have to climb vertically on his long slimy tongue to reach the distant lips of the bear. Then you were going to have to somehow get by his huge gnashing teeth, each dwarfing you in size, before exiting through his lips. Not like you were ever going to get the chance however, as the Pandaren was withdrawing his hand from the front of his mouth as the jaws slowly closed and the lips sealed you in. The dim light that was flooding into his open mouth was slowly shuttered out as the wide maw of the beast clamped shut. Sitting in absolute darkness with nothing but the heavy breathing of the sleepy Pandaren to keep you company. Next thing you knew you were tossed into a world of chaos as the giant tossed you around in his tongue as he gathered up all the saliva in his mouth.

You had a hot cup of tea brewed just the way you like sitting on the table and the sun shone directly over the bustling streets of the city. The scene was absolutely stunning, and for a moment you closed your eyes and let it sink in. You felt so relaxed and peaceful that you could just fall asleep right in your chair without any worries. Nothing could ruin such a perfect day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you felt it coming. At first a little bit, then a little bit more. Your eyes peeled open and the first thing you noticed was that the streets that were once crowded with active citizenry and commerce were now deserted and dead silent. No signs of anyone even being there. The next thing you noticed was the tea in front of you. Every few seconds the perfectly smooth surface of your drink would jostle and ripple, as if someone was elbowing the table. It kept happening, and you could definitely feel something shaking the ground now, almost as if something really big was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were too unnerved to stay idle any longer. You shot up, knocking your chair over in the process and sprinted through abandon streets and alleys towards Stormwind's main gate. That recurring tremor in the ground continues under your feet, and was getting worse each time. It seemed something big was coming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size3\" style=\"\">BOOM</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot just big, gargantuan, and the entirety of the city has left you to fend for yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">BOOM</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">BOOM</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">BOOM</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting difficult to stay on your feet as each passing quake threatened to trip you up, but you gunned it and eventually reached the bridge leading to the main gate.. What you saw in the distance when you got outside the city made you want to run back inside the walls and find as deep a hole as possible to hide in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff in the distance, past the bridge and main doors of Stormwind was a behemoth that was taller than anything he had ever seen in all of Azeroth. It was an impossibly massive Pandaren, taller than any surrounding mountain was stomping through the Elwynn Forest towards your fair city. The hulking giant sported an ample gut, and it shook up and down as the beast approached. Each thunderous step was now forcing you to your knees, and more and more of your vision was dominated by the approaching god as it loomed ever closer. Finally you could see the underside of it's massive black bear paws as they crushed everything in their path. The final devastating step from the beast swung forward and dropped directly onto the heavy main door of the city in the loudest crash yet. The reinforced tower walls and gate crumbled like sandcastles under the impossibly heavy weight of the colossal panda's wide sole. The three enormous toes on the giant monster's wide paw settled their weight into the ground as the sole sunk in and left a nice heavy impression, the only escape from the city was now sealed tight under the sole of the massive domineering bear god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant stopped, and your gaze followed the massive foot that was resting where the walls to Stormwind used to be upwards towards the owner. The godlike oaf's wide smile was barely visible beyond the wide curve of his sizable gut. You shuddered as you thought about the fate of your city now. Stormwind was either going to end up smashed under this beast's massive paws or stuffed inside it's greedy belly. The looming behemoth didn't stomp towards the city or slurp it up however. It actually seemed like it was looking down at you, despite the fact that you must be smaller than a grain of rice from the colossal bear's perspective. Your suspicions were dreadfully confirmed as the enormous got onto one knee with a quake and settled his weight onto his foot that stood on the ruins of the gate. The giant's intent stare was focused on you as he leaned down and extended one pudgy hand towards your tiny helpless body. The thought of running wasn't even present in your mind as you submitted yourself to the whims of this towering monster. The shadow of his massive hand cast you into darkness, and light was brought back once you were being (rather gently) pinched between the behemoths thumb and forefinger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster lifted you as he rose back to his full height, and even though you had ridden the griffins plenty of times in your travel nothing could prepare you for the vertigo of being lifted to this towering creature's full height so quickly. The beast raised you past it's gigantic belly which it was now rubbing with an unmistakable eagerness, and in front of the monster's wide snout. The large eyes of the beast were focused on it's tiny catch, and figuring this was your only chance to somehow change the giant's mind you made your bid of screaming your puny lungs out and praying to the heavens. Seems the heavens and the beast weren't going to listen to you however, as maw of the hungry giant slowly opened and his wide slimy tongue came out to lick his chops before his meal. The mouth opened wide, and whatever puny pleas you were shouting at the giant were drowned out as the giant gave a large exaggerated hungry sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">Aaaaaaaahhh</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling was hopeless, as the massive hungry mouth of the monster eagerly opened you were raised directly over the big slobbery deathtrap. Each massive fang of the monster glistened in the sun, and its tongue shook and stirred in his mouth with anticipation at tasting its tiny snack. Finally, after the cruel giant dangled you there for awhile between its thumb and forefinger, he decided to finally to release you from his grip and gobble you up. You fell past the hot breath of the beast as its widening maw came closer. You fell into the giant's mouth, it's jaws snapped shut behind you and you were enclosed in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                           ************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke with a fright as you struggle to grasp your situation. That was all a dream? It was pitch black where you woke up, the ground you were on felt wet and slimy, and by the gods the smell of this place. That's when the events leading up to this hit you like a truck as you remembered everything. Being shrunken and transported to foreign lands, looking for help from the massive and oblivious locals, getting quickly caught underfoot, and then somehow topping that by being unknowingly eaten by the same mammoth sized oaf. That's right, you were the size of a crumb, and you had ended up in this hulking giant's busy stomach. With a bit of elementary magic you manage to illuminate your surroundings, and you almost wish you hadn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside of the Pandaren's stomach was filled to the brim with its last meal. Large hunks of decomposing bread, half melted bites of cheese and heaps of fish fillet all poorly chewed were stewing in the vast ocean of his grumbling tummy. Looking down you could see that the piece of solid ground that you were standing on was actually a fish head from the beast's meal, swallowed whole and bobbing sideways on the surface of the bubbling chyme. The walls of the stomach were always shifting and mixing the contents of the bear's tummy, and you dropped flat onto the fish head and clung for dear life as they jostled you and threatened to knock you off your only bit of safety and into the churning digestive ocean. The sound of gurgling and deep bowel movements was constant and incredibly loud. The bubbling contents of the bear's digesting meal was loudest of course, but you could certainly hear that lots of food was moving through deeper inside the bowels of this beast too. By the time this behemoth gets up his stomach will be empty too, and it was almost certain that he was going to be stuffing it full again as soon as he woke from his slumber. You were gonna be a small part of that, a very small part of that. Stuffed in between one big meal and the next, you were gonna be packed in like another tiny morsel and pushed with his food all the way through his guts. What was even going to be left of you when you come out the other side?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least Stormwind is safe.\u201d You thought as you clung for purchase and considered your fate. The same giant that obliviously stomped on you and tracked you to his bedroom on the bottom of his paw had also managed to unwittingly swallow you whole. Now you were just another bit of protein that was going to be mixed in with the rest of his meal.</span></div></div>",
