After a few hours with your friends Hiro Hamada, Jack Frost, and Hiccup, you finally managed to set up the wrestling ring you won in a contest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack smiled, \"Great! When are the others supposed to be coming?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your watch, \"Hmmmmm. About an hour or so. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked at the group and smirked, \"Wanna break in the ring? We have time to do a few matches before the others get here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your face heat up a bit due to his suggestive wording. You always suspected that the white haired boy had a crush on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think before shrugging, \"I don't have a problem with that.\"</span></div></div>",

What are the stakes?\"<br>\r\nYou tilt your head to the side, \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack wraps a arm around your shoulder, \"Well we could do the traditional match, where the winner is determined by pinfall, or submission. OR we could do something even more interesting. We could do a match where you win by making your opponent cum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen. What will you pick?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>But....on second thought, it might be better to wait to see who would get here. Before too long, you saw Rapunzel Corona, along with Astrid Hofferson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone else coming?\" You asked, knowing you invited a few more people.<br>\r\nRapunzel thought, \"Yeah, but i hear it might be a while. After all we did get here early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRapunzel was a talented gymnist who liked to dance in her free time, but she was known to dabble in some training in the gym with the punching bag.  She had her gymnist outfit on, a skintight one piece outfit with lavender color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid, on the other hand, was a fighting maniac, who had a tomboyish charm to her. She was always looking for a chance to spar, and once she heard you had a ring, she jumped at the chance to fight. She was wearing her usual viking attire with a blue shirt minus the sleeves. She had metal studded shoulder pads and a studded leather skirt over her dark pants that hugged her legs quite nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" you say, \"who wants to go first? We can do guy vs guy, girl vs girl, or guy vs girl.\"</span></div></div>",

Leaning over to you, he whispered, \"Punzie has ZERO chance against Astrid. Just you watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Astrid walked to her corner, Rapunzel strutted to the ring, a look of confidence on her face as she snaked her body between the ropes. You called out the rules, going over the basics, what with no permenant injury and weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls met in the center of the ring and shook hands. \"You ready to lose blondie?\" Astrid joked with a competetive smile, which Rapunzel reciprocated, squeezing Astrids hand, \" I'm ready to <i>fight</i> if that's what you mean.\"</span></div></div>",

Astrid wasted no time, wrapping an arm around her opponent and excecuting a perfect DDT, driving the lavender clad teen's head into the mat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe viking stood up and looked down at the girl, \"Awwwww what's the matter cutie? Are you done already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe marched over, grabbing a fistful of Rapunzel's skintight bodysuit and dragging her to her feet, where she stood, a bit dazed from the attack. Astrid lightly tapped her opponent's cheeck with her hand, \"Snap out of it Punz, I got so many more moves to practice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRapunzel shook her head, clearing the stars in her eyes, and Astrid smiled, leaning in and pecking the girl's cheek, \"Good girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing her arm, Astrid flung her into the ropes, where the long haired blonde bounced off, running right back at her opponent.</span></div></div>",

She was more than ready to squash this pretty face and make a statement among the women and men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBending over to meet Rapunzel on the rebound, she scooped the dancer up onto her shoulders, using the momentum to bring the pair of them into an impressive spin! The dancer's arms flailed, desperate to get free, but it was not to be! With a final push up, Astrid brought the blonde up only to crash down with a devestating F5 facebuster! The impact cut Rapunzel off mid scream, her body flopping to the canvas with a limp bounce, rolling onto her back. Her face looked oddly serene as the impact nearly knocked her out cold, chest rising and falling deep as Astrid lazily hooked a leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYOu slide in, slapping your hand against the canvas as Astrid winked to the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1.....2........3!\" you call, signalling the end of a one sided squash that placed Astrid firmly as the biggest threat of the girls!</span></div></div>",
