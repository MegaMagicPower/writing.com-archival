So many of my fellow journalism grads were still living in their parents' basements. And yeah, I'd applied to some bigger papers and was shot down, so what. <i>The Stepford Gazette</i>, or whatever this rag is called, will be a nice stepping stone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople described me as a young 22. I have no idea what that means besides older, gruffer men treating me like a kid, older, single women acting all cougar-y on me, and women my own age finding me fairly irresistible. I have dark hair and what some have called a cocky grin. I'm on the short side for a guy, and am almost painfully thin. For the most part I dress like a hipster I suppose, in skinny jeans and plaid shirts, with expensive shoes and a fondness for books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quaint, the town. Not terribly small but pretty in a small town way. I had no idea how they had enough news to print a paper, but whatever, they had hired me so I wasn't complaining. I'd heard the paper was rather new, like brand new, so I wondered if there were other new hires here like myself. Hopefully my same age. Always nice to move to a new area and find some friends right away. And maybe some females, you never know. Ashley and I were technically only on a break, but its not like she had agreed to move out here with me. Needless to say I wouldn't be turning any dates down, that's for sure. No such thing as cheating in a different zipcode and all that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I drove through the 'downtown' area I spotted the 3 story building where the paper was located. I wondered if I should go straight to the apartment building they had set me up in, just a few short blocks away, or the office first. There was a nice looking diner down the street, too. Maybe a bite to eat before either one?</span></div></div>",

If it hadn't been for the sign outside, people might have been able to mistake it for just another single-level ranch in suburbia.  Birds chirped, the sun was high and the air was remarkably clean.  A testament to the fact nobody in this town seemed to drive much of anywhere, preferring instead to walk or jog, ride a bike.  As a consequence, there were seemingly few people in town who might be described as fat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the driveway, though, is a rather nice old Aston Martin.  If there were any Bond aficionados present, they might recognize it as the DB5 from Goldfinger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk in, you see a pretty, young secretary.  VERY pretty...sexy even.  Long blonde hair arranged in a loose bun behind her head with an excellent display of cleavage on perfect E cupped breasts if they were an inch.  She smiles and nods at you, \"You must be one of the new hires.  What's your name, please, sir?\"  She whizzes through a bunch of screens on her very impressive desktop.  For such a bucolic town, you almost might have expected them to still be using pen and paper!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name?\"  </span></div></div>",

Usually these kinds of women flee far and fast from towns like Stepford. What was she doing here? Besides handling her job with calm reserve, which I have to admit made her that much sexier. She inquires after my name and as easy a question as that sounds, it momentarily defeats me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes wander down from her pretty face to a stupefying amount of cleavage. My internal bullshit detector was thinking 'Those have got to be fake' when I remember out here these girls are raised on milk and butter and lord does that do a body good. As my mind is memorizing every scrap of decolletage it is also involuntarily comparing what I'm seeing to the girl I left behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley is a lovely girl, sweet and naive, devoted, the whole nine. She's also an A cup on a good day. I'd gotten into plenty of arguments with her after not clearing my internet search queries, Ashley having found certain sites with certain how shall we say well endowed individuals. \"Why do you like me if these are the kinds of women you're pleasuring yourself to?\" she had scolded me, making the word pleasure sound like something you'd find rotting on the side of the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond asks me my name yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paige. Paige Lauren.\"</span></div></div>",

Not bad for only just arriving in Stepford.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interview with Old Man Weathers was a mere formality. Paige had the job, but everyone had to get the old man's nod of approval. Basically, if he didn't come off as some drooling mongoloid, the job was still his. Oh, and he'd get his assignment of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld Man Weathers looked to be roughly 1,000 years old. Everything about him was old and wrinkly, his skin, his suit, even his hair had a kind of crimp to it, what little remained. Only his eyes defied his age, they were bright and lively as if he knew something everyone else did not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, Mr. Lauren! Glad to have you aboard!,\" the old man stood. Even with a stoop he was taller than Paige. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to meet you too, sir,\" Paige said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, none of that Sir stuff. I may be your boss, I may take home more than you on my paycheck, but I'm also your friend.

There's fire in you, yeah, which won't go to waste here in Stepford, might eventually make some man very happy, but not me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you firing me, sir?,\" Paige asks.

I think you'll find it isn't all that terrible after all,\" Weathers says. \"First game is tonight. Big crosstown rivalry. Varsity Soccer. Be at Winthrop Field at 7:00pm sharp.

Tasty enough, but there's something not quite right about it. Paige shrugs it off by just assuming he's used to the more familiar taste of name brand Coke. The bubbles tickle his nose. The stuff must be super carbonated because he has to restrain himself from belching. He does his best to ignore the bloated feeling and gathers enough material for his 'silly little assignment.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the game is over, and the home team was celebrating (even though they had built an unassailable lead by halftime) Paige wasn't hungry any more.

One of Weathers's old leathery hands digs into the long tresses of hair on Paige's head, pushing him closer and closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige frees the zipper on the old man's pants and manages to say, in a cool soprano, \"I'm not sure I can do this.\" Not sure? Not sure!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then there's the more traditional approach. Come sit down on my lap and make an old man happy.

He hikes up his skirt and starts to squat, and that's when he feels it, that aching void. His entire being feels like it is opening up, and yet still wonderfully tight and ready to be filled.

Told me I was 'unusual' and that 'He was surprised I got hired here in Stepford.' I mean, what the hell is that all about? Anyhow, good luck, Lauren,\" Brian says with a hearty thump on Paige's back.

His fitful sleep?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine. let's just get this over with,\" Paige says. Reynolds starts with height and weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"5' 5 and 3/4 inches. And 149 pounds. You're a compact man, Mr. Lauren,\" Reynolds says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can't be right. I topped out at 5' 7\" in the 8th grade.

If that's what you say I'm sure it's so,\" Reynolds says not correcting what he wrote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the physical is pretty typical. Paige put on a gown and the doc listens to his heartbeat and lungs. Took his blood pressure (\"Wonderfully calm\") but did spend a lot of time prodding his lower belly and telling him to cough. Reynolds was particularly fastidious when checking his genitals (\"Just checking for tumors.\")<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Mr. Lauren, I can see why the Gazette hired you.

Ashley steps back and pulls off her blouse, revealing an expensive bra which doesn't hold up much of anything but still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later Paige has Ashley bent over his kitchen table, humping away as if this were the last conjugal visit before his execution.

One of his hands is gripping Ashley's short blond hair, holding her head and torso down on the table-top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, what's gotten into you!?,\" Ashley says, her breath ragged. Usually it her that does the rough play. \"Well don't just tease me, let me have it, all of it!,\" she says, squeezing her behind for emphasis.

To him it felt great, almost super-sensitive, but for Ashely the penetration was shallow at best. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige comes in a flurry of expletives leaving Ashley hanging in the balance and slightly miffed. Oh well, more where that came from later, she thinks.

He could see where this one was going and wanted Paige for his own. Hank was neither rich nor very powerful. Whatever money the paper brought in was consolidated under the Old Man.

The man is handsome and well-dressed, and is reading a paper, the camera zooms in on the name and of course its the <i>Stepford Gazette</i>. Mom is younger, but stunning, with the same hourglass figure Paige has seen everywhere in Stepford. She is helping to make their two clean cut kids some lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir idyllic lunch is interrupted when Suzy, Paige's redheaded advisor, appears in the film and steps into frame. The movie must have been made a few years back because she is younger and somewhat less busty, but still quite the looker. She lectures,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here at the Stepford Gazette, we pride ourselves on being a family business that upholds family values. Our beautiful town might not be the biggest or most exciting place in the world, but there are stories here, happy ones.\" Suzy drones on about respect and responsibility, the founding tenants of the paper and its surprisingly long history. Paige kind of tunes out. His eyes sweep over from the video Suzy to the flesh and blood woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to his embarrassment he finds himself getting an erection. Strange thoughts pass through his head. Thoughts about a family he never knew he wanted. There is more than just lust hardening his body, almost a biological need to procreate. He wondered if this was what women felt like when their 'biological clocks' went off. What he didn't know was that there were subliminal messages coded in the film. Messages that had begun to subtly alter his mindset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige blinked and mumbled, \"Marriage? Kids? Blech!\" But it feels kind of forced now.</span></div></div>",

For example he waited 6 days before he called Ashley back after their first date, long enough to cause her to hate and adore him right off the bat. The sex had been amazing ever since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe parks the car and undoes his seat-belt, feeling the odd way it retracts over his chest. The little mounds he has are sensitive and he is alarmed when he looks down and finds his nipples are poking into the fabric of his dress shirt. They look... too big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride over was short, but Paige had the heat on full blast and as a result had started to sweat. His shirt sticks to his lower back and some of his hair lay plastered to his forehead. He runs a hand through it and decides he is overdue for an appointment at the barber's. A disturbing guttural sound issues from his lower belly even though he isn't at all hungry. Paige chugs a bit of the special antacid he found at a local drugstore and that seems to help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExiting his car Paige puts on his suit jacket and tightens his tie. He wobbles on his legs, his balance feels off. As he walks over to the door he sees that he is treading on the cuffs of his slacks. He'd just had the damned things tailored, too. The front door opens and a giant gorilla of a doorman answers, towering over Paige with a thick neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I recognize you?,\" the gorilla says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I'm new in town. I was here yesterday...,\" Paige says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sponsor?,\" the goon asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry?,\" Paige asks, he's distracted by an odd sucking sensation about his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who. Is. Your. Sponsor?,\" the guy asks. He is getting annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, John. John Anderson,\" Paige replies. The goon raises an eye-brow as if to say, 'Oh, really?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait here,\" he says, leaving his post. Paige stays put, popping some aspirin for the sharp pain in his hips. In a moment the door-man returns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John isn't here, and there's no admittance to non-members without their sponsor. He did leave this, though,\" the gorilla says, handing him a box before closing the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the car Paige opens the box and is horrified to find what amounts to a kind of cup-less brassiere. There is a note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paige, don't be alarmed by the gift. Some new residents have odd reactions to the local water. If you are suffering from anything, this will help. It is tight and will help bind your chest flat, making you less... noticeable. It is practically invisible under any kind of shirt. I just want you to be comfortable. I'll be away on business this weekend but I am looking forward to seeing you on Monday.\" -John<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the gift is both embarrassing and intimate, Paige is flattered. He heads home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere he undresses in the bathroom and studies his body. The water around here must be something else. Among the long list of odd changes Paige finds:<br>\r\n<br>\r\na) He is shorter, but he has no idea how much.<br>\r\nb) He has lost an indeterminate amount of weight particularly about his upper body.<br>\r\nc) His hair looks longer, even longer than it did in the car.<br>\r\nd) His skin feels softer.<br>\r\ne) Part of this is due to a kind of fleshy, fatty feeling almost everywhere but especially his hips, bottom, thighs and chest.<br>\r\nf) He doesn't need a shave<br>\r\ng) There is a noticeable indent between his chest and hips, a mini-hourglass look.<br>\r\nh) His hands look smaller and finer<br>\r\ni) He keeps having to clear his throat and his voice cracks from time to time.<br>\r\nj) His junk is in a constant 'cold' state, shrunken and tight<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut mostly it is the odd proto-boobs that worry him most. Maybe even as large as 'A' cups featuring dollar coin sizes areolas and thimble sized nipples. He'd slept with women with smaller racks and smaller nipples but then again he'd slept with a lot of women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige wraps the 'bra' around his chest and is happy to see it all but obliterates his 'breasts.' He throws on a t-shirt and boxers and relaxes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround 10:30pm his girlfriend calls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paige, hi!,\" she says. \"Got your message. Would love to come up, can't let that stipend go to waste. Hope you're ready to get black-out drunk and let me have my way with you!\" She goes on to say that the three Ds, Devin, Derek and Duane had agreed to come along. The four of them would arrive sometime after work tomorrow and would spring for a hotel if there weren't enough couches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you then,\" Paige says before laying down for the evening, his Audio Relaxation Therapy CD on, his mind thinking of John and how he couldn't wait until his girlfriend and her buddies were gone and it was Monday and he could see John again and his guests hadn't even arrived yet. As he drifts off to sleep he has an unusual mini-dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige is at John's mansion and has entered a kind of nursery. There's an empty bassinet to one side and out in the hall he hears John's voice say \"I'm just so excited.\" Paige turns his head and sees another bassinet, keeps turning and they multiply.

Even though he is naturally full of himself, Paige is instantly suspicious. Why was this man John Anderson paying so much interest to him? Paige was the new guy in town, a nobody in Stepford. He had nothing to offer John except for perhaps publicity? Were John Anderson and his boss Old Man Weathers in this thing together? Were all those gifts from John just some way of winning Paige over so that he would write glowingly about the Club's 'Playboy-esque' transformation and grand opening?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, if Weathers and Anderson thought Paige was just some stooge and would write some puff piece for the Gazette as free advertising they had another thing coming. Paige would attend the party and ask all the right questions, get all the right quotes, but his real mission was decided. He was going to find out just who John Anderson was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige sat at his desk and frowned. His life was suddenly very full. He had this assignment. He had his secret assignment. He had the grand opening to attend. His girlfriend and her friends were driving up and would need to be entertained this weekend. And there was the fact he still felt really really odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sending Ashley an email about tonight, letting her know that she should let herself in to his home and that he might not be able to get out of his assignment until very late (he kept the details to himself), Paige went to the mens room.  As he approached his colleague Ken stepped out and blurted \"What are <i>you</i> doing using the mens... oh, right. Sorry Paige, I um, mistook you for somebody else.\" Ken tried to play off his slip, they weren't supposed to explicitly treat the new arrivals as women until the new arrivals realized their new genders for themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige walked in and sighed. Some of the painkillers he took were starting to wear off. He had bad cramps and his shoulders hurt. Using the urinal, Paige was mortified at the small member in his hands. Maybe he should see a doctor. Yet another thing on his plate. Paige washed his hands and then felt a hot flash sweep over his body. The 'bra' John had given him felt tighter. Paige took off his tie and unbuttoned his dress shirt. The bra was still doing an excellent job of 'masculinizing' his allergy but the flattened mounds seemed larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige delicately took it off and thats when he felt them jiggle for the first time. With the bra in his hands he turned and stared at his reflection. He could kid himself all he wanted but those were tits. Not even big enough to be measured as 'B' cup tits, but tits nonetheless. He'd seen and held and licked and palmed enough boobs to know what they looked like. But why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He should have heard from them by now, the trip was long but they should have arrived at this point. He hoped they were all okay but figured they had just stopped for dinner somewhere. Or maybe got pulled over for speeding or something. They had indeed been pulled over, just not for speeding, and were currently well on their way toward getting quite drunk. The officers were no help when they said they were visiting a young man named Paige Lauren. No such <i>man</i> was registered in Stepford.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige was about to leave the office and head over to the Men's Club Grand Opening when a delivery girl arrived at his desk with a large parcel. She was just spilling out of her skin tight brown uniform, Christ, even the UPS drivers in this town were center-folds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just sign on the line,\" she said, while snapping her gum and sticking out her abundant cleavage. <i>Hmm, to have something like that to offer</i>, Paige thought, then shook his head and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe parcel ended up being a Hugh Hefner style robe. All of the men attending the grand opening would be wearing them, and all of the girls would be in, well, considerably less. A note from John, who else, explained everything. Paige changed in the bathroom, putting the robe on over his bindings and boxers, slipped his pass into his pocket and left for the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe took one last look at himself in the rear-view mirror of his car before walking up to the club. His face was more full, his cheeks seemed round with health and vitality. His chin was less broad, his nose too delicate. And most visible of all was his hair. It was down past his ears. A part of him knew perfectly well it was impossible for it to have grown so fast, but another part of him merely shrugged. He just needed a trim more than ever. He batted his eyes and giggled. He'd better watch out, or else someone would confuse him for a woman!</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, there's something wrong with his own plumbing. As in he can't quite get things up. In fact, when he goes to see what the problem is he's alarmed to find not much of anything at all. His balls are long gone and his member is thimble sized, it barely resembles anything male. A spongy, soft area is forming between his legs as if its about to cave in. For some reason all of this doesn't frighten him in the least. No more than getting hair on his body did when he was in puberty. Something about it even seems right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what to do about the lust? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Paige decides to pleasure Ashley. He gets her out of her jeans and she's half-awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must be dreaming,\" she mumbles at the androgynous beautiful boy-girl in front of her wearing these silly bunny ears. She takes them off and runs her hands through Paige's lengthening hair as he brings her to ecstasy with his tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut things don't stop there. Everyone in the room is similarly serviced. Paige is blind with lust and with bringing others to climax. After a long evening he winds up in his own bed, alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the door locked he removes everything. Last to go is John's binding and when it falls from Paige's body a growth spurt hits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!,\" Paige says, hands flying to his chest as the firm, warm fat fills his palms. His hands feel small, his breasts surge into C cupped size stunners, the envy of most women. He imagines even the binding will have a hard time covering this up. He flops into bed and his hand wanders down. His little nub of a penis is sensitive but he avoids it and starts fingering the area just under it. His finger-tip sinks in, the flesh is warm and wet. There's no cleft yet but muscles are forming under there that react to his touch. He can even squeeze them, the first traces of his new lady parts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he draws his hand away and slips into sleep its John's name on his lips.</span></div></div>",

Her hair was now the same length as....well, his.  And she now had B cups...definitely.  He felt more sure of it than he had as a guy.  Her hips had also taken on a more rounded shape to them.

But isn't it the weekend?,\" Paige asks. Suddenly her jeans and small top feel unprofessional. To say nothing of her nipples poking blatantly out, her naked breasts unsupported and jiggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The paper still comes out on the weekend, dear, and as a new hire you don't get much say on your schedule,\" Suzy says. Paige looks up at the much taller woman, clicking along in her high heels. Her confidence, her bearing, the way she smells, the way she commands the attention of everyone around her... Paige is envious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the office the weekend skeleton crew putters about. Paige recalls that Old Man Weathers had given her an assignment to cover the Grand Opening of the Playboy-Themed Men's Club. She'd written absolutely nothing for it, worse, she couldn't recall much of the party. She did remember being confused for a woman, but then again she <i>was</i> a woman... wasn't she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige sits down at his desk and feels Suzy hovering about, talking to somebody else for the moment. Suddenly Paige's delightfully full D cup tits feel horribly wrong. <i>What are these doing here</i> he thinks to himself. <i>My body feels all wrong, like I've been dipped in fat and all my muscles have been torn away</i>. He looks down at his own proud chest and starts to hyperventilate. The rapid deep breaths only make his jiggling worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suzy, what's happening to me!?,\" Paige says in a barely audible whisper. \"This isn't who I am at all! Tits like these,\" Paige says, gripping his pert melons, \"I'm supposed to be sucking on these. Slipping my nice big dick between them and coming...,\" Paige says, getting turned on. Unfortunately he has nothing to harden any longer and being turned on is merely a flush of blood to his nethers and some accompanying wetness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush, darling. This is a place of work. You can't talk that way in here,\" Suzy says, laying a calming hand on Paige's shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're just so... out there,\" Paige says, referring to his breasts. He sits up straight and feels his back arch, his posture changing, his butt sticking out, his chest high. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and you shouldn't be trotting around with them unsupported. Come with me, you can borrow one of my brassieres,\" Suzy says. She leads Paige to the ladies room which Paige looks at warily as they enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm <i>not</i> a chick,\" Paige complains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it walks like a chick, and jiggles like a chick...,\" Suzy says, helping Paige out of her shirt. <i>Amazing</i>, Suzy thinks, gently cupping Paige's breasts. <i>Not even 5 days in and already so big. John is a lucky man</i>. \"Hope this fits you,\" she says, helping Paige into the bra. Paige's breasts lift and look spectacular. She borrows a work appropriate blouse from Suzy as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I'll get... bigger?,\" Paige asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, for your back's sake I hope not,\" Suzy says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suzy, what's happening to me?,\" Paige asks. Suzy has to tread lightly. She can in no way talk about 'the process' or even suggest Paige is changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, darling? Nothing is happening to you. You are Paige Lauren, you always have been,\" Suzy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But who is Paige Lauren?\" Paige asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Those plans are John's and John's alone, but suffice to say he was an only child and was terribly lonely as a boy. After making a fortune and finding out about Stepford's unique, er, attractions, John moved here and took his time, waiting for just the right opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would have a family, oh yes, and it was going to be a large one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige grimaces, her lower belly cramping fiercely. She can still feel John's fingers pecking away at the buttons on her blouse. His blouse, Paige is so confused. After a particularly devastating cramp, Paige excuses himself and ducks into a unisex work bathroom. The pain won't subside, and after a moment Paige lowers her jeans and finds spotting in the stolen underwear of Ashley's. It is her first period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm dying,</i> Paige thinks. <i>Something is wrong with me and I'm dying.

Why didn't you say so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzy hands over a sanitary napkin and watches as Paige puts it to use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It may be uncomfortable but it beats ruining all your undies.

Oh Geez, John Anderson. What on earth have you done to this pour soul.' Suzy leads Paige back out and whispers into John's ear. Tells him Paige is bleeding. Already. Asks him if he's worried there's such a thing as hyper-fertility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn merely whispers back, 'Well I'll just use a condom once or twice.

Not that the maids and cooks will be doing any less work, perhaps more, just that they will be reporting to someone new. Freeing up John to, well, men need their free time,\" Alice said.

The upper half of her areolas are showing. Her hands fly around back and off comes the bra. Her large, full breasts pour forward, they are gorgeous and still have a full day's growth ahead of them. \"God, these things are <i>killing</i> my back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want me to draw you a bath?\" Ashley says, not without ulterior motives. Paige smiles and nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later Paige climbs in. Ashley peeks in and sees that her former lover is very feminine indeed down below. She doubts what Paige has would be of use to man, at least not without tremendous pain, but Ashley might be of service. Ashley steps into the steamy room and sees Paige's underwear, and sees the telltale signs of 'a curse.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paige, are you... on your period?\" Ashley asks, dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, er, I was.

There are so many nooks and crannies to be washed, so many curves and tucked away places. She shaves her legs and armpits, washes of, towels and dresses, the process taking almost an hour and a half. When she looks at the clock she is amazed to see how long it has taken for her to wash, dress, and make herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone rings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lauren, Paige?

There are many cabinets lining the walls along with plants overflowing their pots and an assortment of small sculptures. The very good looking and surprisingly young man looks up and clucks his tongue. \"Hmmm, they did a particularly fine job on you,\" he says a bit louder than he should have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?,\" Lauren says, placing a hand on her bosom like an old pro. It is yet another feminine tick she has assumed in the last few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said you are a special case, Miss Lauren Paige,\" the doctor says, purposefully inverting the order of her name. \"I'm Dr. Feagelson. I'll be assessing your one-week transition.\" He motions for her to sit down. She does so with class, crossing her legs deftly, her mid-thigh skirt scrunching up slightly. Her stockings are just a shade darker than her creamy pale skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm different, aren't I,\" Lauren says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In many ways,\" Dr. Feagelson says. \"For one thing, I imagine that brain of yours is a bit muddled, yes? This is because your sponsor decided to allow you to retain, um, some semblance of your former self. He's a strange man, that John Anderson. Most of these big-shots want your typical, spineless barbie Doll wives. Completely expunged of their old ways. John wants a little bit of intrigue. A little bit of fight left in you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Feagelson, I feel like I'm not supposed to look like this. At the same time I love the way I look. And the weirdest thing is, I swear I get prettier every day,\" Lauren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well, that is all healthy. I'm not allowed to discuss what you are 'supposed to look like' but you're not wrong. And as far as your prettiness is concerned, you are almost done. A few tweaks here and there. But the boys in the lab will be able to tell how far along you are,\" Dr. Feagelson said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm not going crazy? Some of my friends are acting like nothing has happened, but something really has! They were boys, I'm sure of it. Now they are voluptuous supermodels. Was I a boy, too? Is this why I feel so not myself?\" Lauren asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't answer that question. But I can help you get to know yourself by asking you a few questions,\" Dr. Feagelson says. \"I am going to say a few charged words. Tell me how they make you feel.\"</span></div></div>",

Not spineless but she would be a giggly thing.  A total Playmate.  The Doctor wrote this all down satisfactorily.  \"Now I'll send you on to my wife, Nurse Feagelson.  She'll take care of the final checkup.\"  Before you get fucked and knocked up, my dear, he thought with amusement.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the Nurse''s office, Paige was struck by how many girls were 'showing'.  EIther bumps or full fledged bellies, these girls all seemed happily pregnant.  Tonight, she would join them.  She didn't know that yet but while she was waiting, she went around to the girls and felt their stomachs, giggling happily when she would feel kicks.  She wanted that feeling, she decided.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughts and worries about what were happening to Bree and Danni slowly settled back down in the wake of all this maternal bliss.  Hell, Paige...Lauren...that was sexier...was even getting a bit turned on by the thought of joining these girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut first, they had to make sure she could.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is why Nurse Feagelson wasted little time in getting her naked.  Being a girl herself (this was the ObGyn office, not that Paige would have been able to put those pieces together), the Doctor was quite pleased to see her development...but she knew her orders.  Being a good girl meant following orders, as Lauren would soon learn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, leaning her big tits near Lauren's face, \"Honey, we need to make sure your body's as perfect as perfect can be.  Don't want you to make non-perfect babies!\"  The mantra of her office.  She nodded and started taking measurements of the bride to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"36EE, my, you are healthy.... 26, 34.  Hair?  Dark.  Lightly wavy, down to midback.  Decent physical condition, need to continue working out to keep peak physical condition.\"  She said all this into a bright pink recorder.

To spoil yourself,\" Nurse Feagelson said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren blinked stupidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He wants you to go out and buy something to wear tonight. Some THINGS to wear tonight. A sensible evening dress for your dinner with him at Stepford's most exclusive night spot and then something completely NOT sensible for... afterward.

Tell her I sent you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren put the card in her tiny pink clutch, smoothed her skirt (which felt shorter and skimpier for some reason. some last minute roundness plumping out her behind?) and walked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeagelson tore off a print-out and tapped a pen on Lauren's results. Her hormones were off the charts. This could make for some... unpredictable behavior. An insatiable libido. Petty crankiness. Mood-swings. Airheadedness. And what it signaled for the poor woman's reproductive system was a mystery. The nurse guessed Lauren would be 4 to 20 times more fertile than your average healthy adult woman and 10 times as likely to conceive twins. She might even gestate faster than 9 months and would certainly 'rebound' and be ready to get knocked back up faster than your average mom. She hoped Mr. Anderson liked big families...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell above the door tinkled and in walked Lauren. She didn't even have to open her pretty little mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranny saw her and said, \"Your Johns' girl, yes? I have just the thing. A cocktail dress, right? Oh, and something for later.

A wedding band is around her finger, she is a newlywed like Lauren, though Lauren had a 3 month head start in that department. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren sighs and remembers the first few weeks of her marriage to John Anderson fondly. Her hubby took a week off from work and they fucked like animals all day, barely pausing to eat, going at it until they passed out in the early afternoon from fatigue, then waking up around dinner for a meal and more fucking. It was a surprise to nobody when Lauren found out she was pregnant soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnny thinks it might be twins,\" Lauren says. To the casual observer she would appear to be about 15 weeks along. Her breasts and behind are feeling the bulk of the changes so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Upton doesn't want any kids,\" Ashley says, referring to her new husband and local Club big-shot. \"He says when the sex is no longer fun, he'll just trade me in for a new model. Isn't he a riot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren doesn't say anything. Her friend is so naive. Lately she and John haven't been making love quite so often. Once or twice a week. Dispassionately. She is starting to be convinced he's seeing somebody on the side. Or more than just one somebody. She is very jealous of Ashley and her throes of passion, but hides it. \"I'm going for a swim,\" Lauren says. The water is warm and as she wades in her enormous breasts loll on the surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll join you,\" Ashley says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two swim a few laps that devolve into some playful flirting and tickling. They are laughing when somebody coughs at the pools edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, Mrs. Anderson. I was wondering if you needed anything? My name is Banks, Samuel Banks and your husband has taken me on as a butler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamuel Banks is quite the dish. He is lean and young and dressed immaculately. What Lauren and Ashley don't know is that John hired Samuel after a maid ran off and got married. Samuel is about to pass through a very interesting apprenticeship. He is also something of a gift to Lauren, as John is indeed carrying on with women behind his wife's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo here is a little sex-toy for Lauren to take her frustration out on (at least until Samuel no longer possesses the proper equipment), and simultaneously 'mentor' through the changes ahead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yummy,\" Ashley says, sidling up to the pool's edge and looking the man up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Anderson?\" Samuel says, repeating his question. But Lauren is lost in thought. She is already even now imagining what she'll do to this young man. She snaps out of it and says,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, Nothing. I'm alright.

Inside Ashley has dressed and left. Good. Lauren lets her towel fall. \"Oh, I must have dropped my towel. Could you pick it up for me?\" It lay puddled about her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamuel approaches and stoops over. He takes in Lauren's plump thighs, her bikini bottom, the slight bulge to her belly. Down on one knee he gathers the towel but before he can stand Lauren advances and presses her groin right in his face.

He's wearing only an apron, the strap around his thick neck, his chest and rippling abs bare, the apron covering the most unsettling part of his nakedness.

Opening the door, which caused a loud squeak of rusty metal, Steven walked in and saw the dusk and cobwebs that littered the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I really don't think anyone set foot in here for at least a year\" Steven said to himself, as he knew his Aunt passed on just a little longer then that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Walking around inside, Steven saw the damage of the years of improper maintenance. The drips of the pipes, the cracked tiles in the kitchen, even the sight of outlets that were begging to be replaced. Nothing Steven could not do on his own, but nothing that could be finished in only a weekend of work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So Steven headed upstairs to the Master bedroom, he walked into the restroom to check if the water still ran. Finding it still on and looked clean, Steven looked up and into the mirror. The mirror was dirty, but Steven still saw his face behind the grime. Short dark hair rested on the head of the twenty eight year old man as brown eyes looked out weary from the drive into town. He was an athletic build that was hidden behind the collared button up shirt tucked into the dress slacks he worn often enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"what to do now\" he asked himself as Steven tried to get up a game plan for how to start.</span></div></div>",

Once he locked the place up and stepped outside, he realized one thing immediately:  the girls in Stepford were all amazingly sexy.  Hot, even.  Nuclear hot more likely.  They were all dressed in skimpy Sunday dresses which flattered their figures and gave the whole town an air of a perverted Norman Rockwell painting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the main restaurant there, he found the people to be very friendly, happy to see him.

Had that really happened?</i> Steven could remember nothing about the meal itself, only that it had been delicious and over too fast. And then that bizarre exit. She'd just run off, just like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven got up and wondered if he could find something, anything of Karen's to prove that it all wasn't a dream. But the woman had been naked, it wasn't as if he'd find a bra hung over the back of a chair or something. He scratched at his chest absent-mindedly. It caused his nipple to stiffen and with it came the recollection that he'd spent much of the latter part of the night, how much of the night? Taking care of his own needs. Other than a little soreness everything seemed in order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven showered, dressed and ate breakfast, though by now it was mid-afternoon. The dreams he'd experienced had burnt off, though he could remember a cute blond woman, the mental image of which was almost enough to make him blush. He was going to do something to that woman, but he couldn't remember what. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about this time that the doorbell sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven answered and too his surprise he found himself staring into the face of the dream girl, albeit her hair was not as long and it was a dark chestnut brown. Her soft, curvy body was the same, and she was much shorter than he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I help you?,\" Steven asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman brought out a pen, pad, and a tape recorder. \"Hi! My name's Paige Lauren. I write for the Stepford Gazette. My boss tipped me to a lead, the old prodigal son returns to Stepford and makes good, fixes up an old family house. Our readers eat this crap up. Mind if I come in and ask you a few questions?\"</span></div></div>",

Paige knows she must look like a fright, what with her body experiencing all these changes and her clothes so ill-fitting. Several times on their short walk to the coffeeshop Paige picks at the places where her bra is pinching her shoulder, under her arm, or her boobs themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they sit she feels all her cleavage welling up and has absolutely no idea what to do about it. Steven doesn't seem to mind. In fact he doesn't seem to much notice. Compared to the other 'exotic creatures' on display here in Stepford Paige doesn't quite yet compare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are those glances at her ring though, and with them her pride. This sense of pride has quickly taken over and replaced all Paige's former machismo. Before he would strut or flirt. Now, he just lets that ring dangle a bit too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter shimmying away from giving exact answers to her love life, she's still not sure if she should openly discuss it, especially with perfect strangers, Paige inquires after Steven's love life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's this one woman,\" he responds, and gets that dreamy look on his face. It is more of a crush than true love. And this might be more due to the woman in question and her damn mysteriousness. The nerve of Karen to just get up and leave him in the lurch like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterward they get up to leave and Steven notices that Paige's pants are very tight. Perhaps even tighter than when they arrived. Paige winces a bit with her first step and curses under her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you get enough for your article or whatever?,\" Steven asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure. I mean, I don't want to diminish your aunt or you or anything, but this is a puff piece. It might not even make the edition,\" Paige says, heading off. Her work ethic has waned lately. Her job little more than something to pass the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you round?\" Steven asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have my card,\" Paige replies.</span></div></div>",

Only looking like an A-cup, Steven did not notice this change that marked the first sign of his new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Karen opened her eyes and looked over at Steven. She smiled brightly as she noticed the change quickly. Thinking to herself how nice Steven will look when it was all said and done, she said \"Glad to see you up...hope you don't mind I stuck around\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not as all Karen, I am kind of embarrassed I passed out\" Steven replied as he wondered why his chest felt off,  bit more pleasant, but it did feel different.</span></div></div>",
