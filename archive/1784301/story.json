Amber wished she didn't have to ride the bus, but since the accident, her car was still in the shop. It will take another three weeks before she could have it back, so in the mean time, public transportation was her only option. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Sttsssss* Amber heard the familiar sound of the air brakes and the door swinging open. She got up from her seat and exited the bus at Jefferson and Kline St. A few other people, one woman with her daughter, a man wearing some very nasty sandals, and another man wearing a very worn our blue shirt. 'What else could I have done with my life,' Amber reflects. She could blame herself, it was her decision to move to to the city. She'd always wanted to escape the small town, to get a big paying job, and live the good life. The college told her that the world was looking for people with a degree in math; couldn't get enough of them. Now that she's got it, though, it seems that the world could certainly get by without her expertise in functions and formulas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd taking that first step, she decided to get a second job. Her first job was working at John's Deli, and she liked working there, but she couldn't afford anything other than essentials. So Amber lifted the classifieds and perused her circled options. \"I guess I'll try applying at...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Radioway Electronics Superstore<br>\r\n2. Chemtech Applied Chemicals<br>\r\n3.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWell, Amber, I\u2019d have to say I like your resume. The college degree is good, but you don\u2019t have any sales experience. Are you driven enough to sell electronics?\u201d \u201cOh yes, Mr. Grams. I\u2019ll sell whatever I can to whoever I can.\u201d \u201cGood. I\u2019ll tell you, the base pay isn\u2019t great, but the money is in commissions. You sell enough cell phones and warranties, and you won\u2019t go hungry.\u201d Mr. Grams smiled at Amber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d make it, but Reggie Grams liked giving people their shot. Customers needed their shot to purchase what they need, and young college graduates needed their shot to make it in the real world. He couldn\u2019t say right away, but he knew he was going to give Amber that shot. \u201cThat\u2019s all the questions I have for you today. You\u2019ll get a phone call if we need anything more, alright?\u201d Amber smiled back, \u201cOk, thanks a bunch. Have a nice day.\u201d She walked out of the office and through the store. Amber had never been in a sales position, but how hard could it be? She\u2019d just have to get to know the equipment, and be as courteous to the customers as she could be. Of course, that\u2019s if she even got the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile on Amber\u2019s face slowly faded. She hadn\u2019t thought that she wouldn\u2019t get it, but what were her chances? She\u2019d never sold anything before in her life, except sandwiches. She hopped onto the next bus, taking her to John\u2019s Deli. Her shift started in an hour, so she had some time before she had to begin work. The bus reached the street corner after John\u2019s, and Amber stepped off the bus. She walked down the street and turned into the familiar deli. \u201cHey Amber, you\u2019re early?\u201d A man in his late 20\u2019s waved to Amber from behind the counter. Chris was on and would be working with Amber for her shift. Chris had been working in John\u2019s for as long as Amber had, and they had a pretty good friendship established. They could take orders, turn out meals, and ring people up faster than some three, or even four, person teams could. That\u2019s why they always worked the evening shifts; fewer people coming in, and the owner could save money by having two experienced employees working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber walked behind the counter and picked up her apron. \u201cHow\u2019s everything, Chris?\u201d Amber asked. Chris furrowed his brow and formed a very deep, thoughtful pose. \u201cWell Amber, with the bad economy, pollution, and conflict going on, everything is pretty bad,\u201d he throws his arms wide and with a bright expression, \u201cbut as for me, I\u2019m pretty fantastic!\u201d Amber chuckles at his remark. Chris could always make her smile. He was a really sweet guy, nice to the good customers, a dick when he needed to be, but always looking out for Amber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours into the shift and Amber receives a phone call. \u201cHello?\u201d \u201cHey, Amber, it\u2019s Grams.\u201d \u201cHey, Mr. Grams. What I can do for you?\u201d \u201cWell, you can come in tomorrow to pick up your shirts, you got the job!\u201d Amber\u2019s face went blank, then a smile. Chris was concerned because Amber didn\u2019t usually stop her sandwich making, even with a phone call. Chris asked, \u201cAmber, are you alright?\u201d Amber stared jumping up and down, ignoring the burning steak for the Philly cheese she was supposed to be preparing. \u201cWell that\u2019s great Amber, but we have orders to fill.\u201d Amber settled down and returned focus, \u201cAlright, when can I come in?\u201d \u201cBe here at noon. I can take you out to lunch, go over the paperwork and give you your uniform. Sound good?\u201d \u201cSounds great, Mr. Grams. I\u2019ll see you then.\u201d Amber hung up the phone and returned to her cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Amber showed up to Radioway Electronics. The store looked different, as though she wasn\u2019t viewing it as a customer, but as a sales person. Mr. Grims emerges from the back with a briefcase, passing people in matching polo\u2019s. \u201cHello Amber, congratulations on getting the job.\u201d Mr. Grims shook Amber\u2019s hand. \u201cShall we? If you don\u2019t mind Italian, I know this great place just down the street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some very tasty fettuccine, Mr. Grims pulls out his briefcase. \u201cNow, I\u2019ve just got some standard paperwork for you to fill out, standard boilerplate. Here\u2019s your I-9, and W-2\u2026\u201d He started handing her paperwork to fill out, \u201cOh, and there\u2019s this one, it comes down from the higher ups. Mostly just covering their and my rear, promising you won\u2019t steal anything or kill anyone.\u201d Mr. Grams laughed as he handed Amber what seemed to be a book. It was almost a hundred pages, filled with words and legal phrases. \u201cYou just need to sign the back. Of course, I can\u2019t let you take it with you, but you just need to sign the back copy, and I can turn it in today.\u201d Amber is a little wary. She knew she shouldn\u2019t sign anything if she didn\u2019t know what it was, but the amount of paper in here, it seemed like they were hiding something. Amber looked at the stack and then at Mr. Grams. Biting her lip, Amber\u2026</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This is an attempt at a more authentic \u201cchoose-your-own adventure\u201d. What do I mean by that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost fetish based adventures on this site are more selective of what happens, and not, what you do. So then, those stories support choosing the effect, then writing cause. This story will be choosing the cause, then finding the effect. Get it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo? Ok, think back to the old CYOA\u2019s we used to read. You could choose the room to enter, but you didn\u2019t know what was in that room. You could decide to take the bus or stay in the hotel, but you didn\u2019t know what would happen. That\u2019s the style we\u2019re going for in this story. The main character doesn\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s going to happen, and neither will you. You can suggest she put on the ring, but you don\u2019t know what will happen to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when adding, create situations such as: (go to the house, stay in the pool, rubs herself)<br>\r\nie. Immediate actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvoid creating situations such as: (C cup, 5 feet, even bigger)<br>\r\nie. Size choices, or knowledge she wouldn\u2019t have in the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few other rules:<br>\r\nGood grammar.<br>\r\nWeighty additions. No one-liners, paragraph at least.<br>\r\nAny expansion/inflation allowed (breast, butt, body, belly, other body parts, giantess).<br>\r\nNo vore, no gore, no scat, no waste stuff.<br>\r\nPopping allowed as a reset, remember, no gore.<br>\r\nKeep growth reasonable, nothing too big too fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel free to email me if you have questions or ideas to make this a better story.<br>\r\n</td>",
