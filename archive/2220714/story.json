Everyone was sharing, no one was being disrupted and everyone was working peacefully \u201cit\u2019s almost as if they don\u2019t need me to watch them\u201d the teacher thought to herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she finished helping one of her students with something two more of her students approached her. A boy named Jack and a girl named Molly. \u201cWe got you something Miss Abbi\u201d they said in unison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really, for me? Thank you!\u201d She gratefully accepted what they offered her. It was a fancy looking envelope with a wax seal and everything. \u201cOh wow, this looks good...really really good. Did you two make this yourselves?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two kids just looked at each other and giggled \u201copen it, open it!\u201d Molly cheered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well alright\u201d she relented, breaking the seal. The inside of the letter read-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDear Abigail,<br>\r\nIt is our honor to inform you of your impending promotion. From here on your status as a kindergarten teacher will be raised to that of a baby with all benefits and responsibilities there in, effective immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKiz, whad id dis?\u201d Abigail asked before removing her pacifier so she could speak more clearly. Wait, pacifier? Looking down not only was she holding a pacifier with a bulb covered in drool, but the letter was gone, along with the clothes she was just wearing. In their place was a short orange sundress with flowery patterns and what looked like a pair of light up sneakers with fluffy pink socks. And a weird feeling between her legs gave her an idea she didn\u2019t want to believe was true, but sure enough when she pulled up her skirt without even thinking sure enough there was an oversized baby diaper looking back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay Miss Abbi\u201d Jack asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I... I\u201d was all she could stammer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you seem kinda upset\u201d Molly chimed in \u201cI know let\u2019s get you-</span></div></div>",

Abigail tried to fight against the little boy, but all she could do was squirm ineffectually. Eventually the baby adult and mature little kids arrived at the teacher's lounge. Molly opened the door and Jack set Abigail down, then patted her diapered butt and said, \"Go play, we'll pick you up later.\" The door closed behind them and Abigail was confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around and did a cute little baby gasp. The entire faculty was a big baby of some variety. She saw the gym teacher try to match shape blocks and fail, earning some pouting from the strong man wearing a diaper and toddler shirt. She saw the principal laying on her back, her large breasts on display. Judging by the cloth diaper she wore, she was nothing but a newborn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a familiar voice rang out, \"Abi?\" Abigail turned and saw her friend Rachel crawling towards her, wearing a diaper and a dora t-shirt, and her head was adorned by a baby bonnet. But her eyes held the same determination as ever. She got on her knees and asked, \"Do you member being a tetoo?\" The cute lisp Rachel had suited her current appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail took out her pacifier and said, \"Yes, Rachel. Why we in diapy's?\" Rachel had tears of happiness and hugged her friend. She rambled a bit, \"With out combinded smartiness we can fix everything.\" Then she stopped and whispered, \"Poopy.\" Her diaper sagged, conforming to Abigail that Rachel, a PHD holding woman, a proud mother of two, had used her diaper like a baby. </span></div></div>",
