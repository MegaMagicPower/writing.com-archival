He silently muttered to himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'd do anything for a glimps of life on the other side...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden the family photo album begun to glow a satanic red Richard jumped up and ran over the the mysterious tome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard pulled open the album and was confronted by equally satanic coloured images, the first a picture of his sister's on holiday in the South of France all of his sisters were posing on balchony looking as if they were getting raedy for a night in town. This was the most recent photo taken only half a year ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second picture was of his parents on their wedding day 22 years ago his mother wearing a stunning white dress, his father wearing a quite dapper suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard then spied a picture in the courner of his eye the satanic colours shone from a secret pile he kept under his bed. This was a picture of Richard's Ex-Girfriend one of Richard's most viewed upon images a semi-nude photo of his ex covered barely by a matching panties and bra combination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fourth photo shone this time from Richard's wall it was a picture of Richard and his friend mack with ex-girlfriend Amy travelling to a Motorhead gig in Cardiff 2 years ago Raichad was wearing his Motorhead t-shirt and usual blue jeans, Mack was wearing a bright green punk t-shirt with tarton trousers, and Amy was wearing a short leather skirt and small heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard heard a voice in his head:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You have been given the chance to recreate the lives of one of these photographed people, choose wisely my friend'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard started considering without hesitation he thought it might be cool to see the south of France with his sisters a holiday they they insisted who wouldn't join them on. He knew he wasn't going to recreate his parents wedding night although he did apreciate the trippiness of th ordeal. He considered assuming the life of his ex-girlfriend as who was always to see what it would be like to live on the other side.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Richard looked down at himself and saw he was wearing the yellow and white sun dress his sister was wearing in the picture he was previously holding. Richard was surprised, he didn't expect this trick to actually work! Richard then noticed who it was holding the camera, it was Ashley's French boyfriend Pierre. Amy quickly walked over to him and planted a kiss on his lips and thanked him for taking such a 'cute' picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh my God Macy you look so precious in this picture!' Gushed Ashley 'If only you were old enough to come clubbing with us later, I bet you could turn some heads even at your age!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard blushed, he felt a bit weird being called 'precious' but he would be fooling himself if he didn't admit it did make him feel a little good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh yes, plenty of my friends would love to show you a good time around the city young Macy.' Added Pierre 'I can maybe find you a fake I.D if you would be willing to take the risk?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Jenna got outraged at this idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'There is absolutely no way you are getting my little sister a fake I.D!! She can make some friends in the teen club run by the hotel tonight' Jenna turned and faced Richard and said 'There will plenty of time to go clubbing and find boys when your old enough, we can have some fun together at the beach together tomorrow.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why do you have to be such a party pooper Jenna?' Questioned Amy 'If your gonna treat her like a kid why don't you both put on your nighties and watch Disney movies all night!?' Amy and Pierre laughed to themselves and left together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna was still angry but she didn't respond to Amy's latest jab she just turned to Richard and told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If your gonna go to the teen club you better get changed you've been wearing the dress all day!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh of course I'd better go get myself ready' replied Richard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard scurried to what he assumed was Macy's room and analysed the situation.....</span></div></div>",

Upon thinking of the image he blinked for a second and when he opened his eyes he was in his ex-girlfriend's bedroom wearing her pink floral strapless bra along with matching underwear. He was in a very compramising position also an all fours on the bed with his behind raised from the rest of his body. To Richard's suprise these articles of clothing fit him rather well even though they were not designed for his masculine frame. He also discovered that his hair wasnow curled at the ends and he was completely shaven all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Jesus' Richard spoke to himself he never imagined that this would actually happen he just thought it would fail and he could live his everyday life as normal. He quickly stood up from the bed and made a dash for the full length mirror in the courner of the room. Sure enough he saw exactly what he could already feel on his body. He even noticed the matching pink nail polish now present on his fingernails and tonails. He spotted many pictures stuck on the side of the mirror which also shocked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw a picture of his ex-girlfriend wearing his plain black t-shirt and baggy jeans with a smile on her face. It was obvious now to Richard that he had somehow assumed the life of his at a time when they were still dating. He had gathered from the many pictures around the mirror that Amy must now be living his life. One picture around the mirror stood out for Richard it was the picture of him and Amy going to their high school prom. Amy was wearing a very smart suit and Richard was wearing a rather low-cut short one-stap purple dress complete with matching high healed shoes. He remembered how beautiful Amy looked in this dress and he found it fascinating but udmittedly weird seeing himself in the outfit. He could also see quite clearly that he was wearing quite alot of make-up on his face from mascara to lipstick it was all there just like Amy did her make-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came to the conclusion that in this reality it was as if he had always been Amy. Richard decided to continue Amy's day and try to live her life as full as possible, afterall how often do u get this type of opportunity?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept the underwear he was wearing on and decided to look in Amy's wordrobe for something to wear. He desided to wear a pink strapless top and a denim mini skirt. He checked the clock and saw that it was 4.30 so he knew he didn't have to go to school, he then remembered that on this day he had gone over to Amy's house to fool around a bit. He suddenly heard a Paramore song playing so he bagan looking for Amy's mobile phone he picked it up from the nighstand and said-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hello Amy speaking.'.......who is on the over end?</span></div></div>",

He never really thought about what it would be like to be anybody else but he was finding this very interesting. He looked in the mirror and saw that he didn't need to do anymore to his appearance he alraedy had make-up on and his hair was already done. He decided to leave her room and look around the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked to the kitchen where he saw Amy's father washing dishes he knew that Amy and her father didn't get on the best so he attempted to avoid him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What do you think you are wearing young lady?' Asked Amy's father 'That boy is coming over again isn't he? I'm not having my daughter operating a brothal out of her bedroom do you understand?' Richard attempted to ignore his shouting but it was too hard he found himself replying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's my body and I'll so what I want with it!' He didn't know why he said it but it felt natural to say. He could see Amy's father getting mad. So he apoligized and promised that he wouldn't let any man touch him before he's 18. This was the oddest conversation he had ever held in his life but he needed to say it in order to get Amy's dad to approve of Amy to come over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's my girl you to delicate at this age to be experimenting with that type of thing' He kissed Richard on the head and said that he needed to get some rest. He was working nights so he would be sleeping for the rest of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting himself some toast and coffee Richard heard the doorbell ring, he answered the door and sure enough stood Amy wearing his clothes she immediently placed her hands on Richard's hips and began kissing him. Richard responded by putting his arms around Amy's neck. After the kissing Amy said<br>\r\n'Do you know how beautiful you look today?' Richard was flattered but he new she was just trying to get in his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both went upstairs to Amy's room and they both lay on Amy's bed.

Richard opens his legs so Amy can get in between them she slowly rubs herself agaist Richards man parts and starts taking off Richard's shirt. They both kiss topless for a couple of minutes untill Amy removes her jeans so that she is only in her boxer shorts. Richard then removes his bra so that he is completely naked. Amy speeks 'You looks so beautiful my darling' She then grabs Richard's chaest and starts squeezing, this makes Richard feel weird but he got a strange sensation whenever Amy rubbed his nipples. Richard gave out a short gasp which made Amy smile she felt Richard's member and said 'looks like your wet enough to recieve me' she then pulled down her boxer shorts and grabbed her vagina. She also grabbe dRichard's head and put it into her vagina, Richard started licking and sucking the vagina untill Amy told her to stop she then imformed Richard that she was 'hard enough aready' sh reached over to the bed sed table and got out a codom she then applied it inside her vagina and climbed aboard Richard. Richard opened his legs and presented himself to Amy. Amy grabbed Richard's cock and placed it inside of her. To Richard's suprise this started to hurt he had never felt like this before Amy kept humping her vagina around Richard's cock and after a while Richard started feeling a sensation throughout his entire body he couldn't help but screem. This only made Amy even more eager ramming her hard vagina around Richard's wet cock. After a a while it started to die down and Amy suggested for Richard to get on top. Richard then spred his legs around Amy's waist and positioned his cock into Amy's vagina he then started going up on down with his cock inside of Amy. Amy grabbed hold of Richard's hips and helped him move up and down Richard could see that this was really pleasing Amy so he did it faster and faster untill Amy gave out a large gasp and suddenly stopped. 'That'll do for now baby' she said. She removed the condom from inside her and threw it in the nearby bin. 'How was that for you?' she asked. Richard was still trying to gather his breath and he was genuinly hurting in his lower parts like he'd never been hurt before he found that crossing his legs helped the pain. Apart from th pain he felt quite good like he had never been closer to Amy his entire life.<br>\r\n'I feel good' Replied Richard while still trying to catch his breath, 'You really hit the spot there.'<br>\r\n'Well I'm glad I didn't hurt you too much I lasted much longer than I thought I would' Richard started putting his clothes back on 'What's the rush babe? why not stay like this for a while I love seeing you in all of your womenhood' Said Amy still completely naked. Richard answered quite honastly.<br>\r\n'But I'm cold' he could feel his nipples getting harder.<br>\r\n'Here put this on' Amy threw her t-shirt to Richard, Richard tried it on and was shocked to find it was far too big, the end was just touching the top of his leg.

Amy answers her bellowing phone whilst completely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Mack what up? We still kegging tonight bro?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard scurried off to the bathroom to clean up while Amy continued the conversation with Mack. Richard thought to himself he remembered that he asked Amy to go to this party a couple of weeks before the ultimately called things off for a while. He had always wondered what things would have been like if he could have persuaded Amy to go with him to the party and cut loose around his friends. After slipping on a fresh pair of pink silk panties under the enormous shirt he was now sporting Richard returned to the room only be flanked by a question. Amy now modestly dressed in her boxer shorts coyly asked Richard if he would like to come to the party with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Hey you know how we never spend much time with each others friends?\u2019 asked Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Yeah I guess I remember that but aren't we supposed to go clubbing with my friends tonight in the city?\u2019 Richard reluctantly recalled. He always hated clubbing with Amy\u2019s friends they were all so bitchy and snobby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Ah damn babe I completely forgot about that, I guess you\u2019re just looking so fine my memory just went blank! I tell you what its up to you we can either go clubbing with your friends or we can go to this super awesome Kegger at Stevie\u2019s place? Your move princess.\u2019 Amy confidently remarked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard contemplated for a moment, he was caught a little off guard by being referred to as \u2018princess\u2019 but that was far from the weirdest experience of the day! Richard decided to go with his gut and agree to the keg party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Well its bin like forever since I've seen any of your friends so I guess its fair for us to go party with them. Just promise me you won\u2019t leave me alone for too long I get nervous around all those people!\u2019 Richard replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018For real babe? Aw that\u2019s great, you've got a deal! And don\u2019t worry enough Jagermeister down that pretty little mouth of yours will relieve all the nerves you\u2019re feeling.\u2019 Amy strided over to Richard on the last line and laid a kiss on Richard\u2019s lips she even got a squeeze of Richard\u2019s satin clad behind for good measure. \u2019Party starts in about two hours I know how long it takes you to get ready for parties so I\u2019ll pick you up about 20 minutes before showtime!\u2019Amy got dressed and hastily sped out to locate alcohol and other party tricks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard was left in his neon pink room to get himself ready for the party. He was all made up before Amy got there and now he\u2019s got to start all over again. He started arranging outfits when suddenly a familiar song starts playing, its his phone ringing again and its his friend Jessica undoubtedly ringing to arrange plans for a night on the town!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Richard do?    </span></div></div>",
