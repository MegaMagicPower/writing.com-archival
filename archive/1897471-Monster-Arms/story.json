Oh well, it's just another day. As you get up, you let out a sigh. You wonder how you as a human wound up in Horrorville, the city of monsters. From day one you've had a hard trial. Most humans would've been stomped or eaten by now but you got lucky. You found this apartment for shelter. Sure you have to share it with a giant zombie girl since you're too small to pay the rent yourself but there's always gotta be a compromise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember how dangerous and chaotic this apartment could be. Lupa has nearly had you in her mouth more times than you care to remember and that fat mummy Nefernina is always threatening you with eviction or worse. When is she going to realize you're not vermin? It's really doing a number on your self esteem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder where Cadence could be. Sure you may not know what goes on in that decaying head of hers, but you like to keep track of your own three hundred foot zombie roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out another sigh. You can't keep tabs on that girl. Well, it's the beginning of the day. What do you do?</span></div></div>",

You begin to furiously bang against the door to her apartment, shouting as loud as you could.\"Mavis! Open up! It's R.L., I've got something to say to you you overgrown bat!\"From within the apartment, you heard her singing cease. After a little cluttering noise and footsteps, the door opened to see a very annoyed Mavis looking down at you, clad in nothing but a flimsy nightgown. She must've been up singing all morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, dahling?\"She questioned.\"Can't you see that I'm extremely busy? I have a recital coming up, and I can't afford to waste time dawdling with the likes of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your screeching about woke up the entire building!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe it's just you, dahling.

You turn your head to see Lupa of all people holding her ears in pain and gritting her fangs. She didn't like the sound any more than you did. \"Blast that Mavis!

So you duck back under the door and into Mavis's apartment, her shrill voice still screeching through the air. She was singing some opera tune that you had no idea what it was. It was simply noise to you. Loud, annoying noise. But you could bear with it, through gritted teeth and held ears. She had been singing all morning. Mavis couldn't possibly keep it up forever, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you were wrong, so horrible wrong. Nearly an hour and a half later, her lung power hadn't reduced at all, and you could still hear Lupa's pained whining out in the hall. What you had forgotten was that Mavis was a banshee, a creature known for their incredibly painful shrieks and lung capacity. You figured this girl could go for hours and barely be out of breathe. No wonder she was an opera singer, she probably filled the entire auditorium with her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaned against the wall with a grimace on your face, hoping that you wouldn't be deaf by the end of the day. Her loud vocals echoed throughout the entire building, and you knew you weren't the only one suffering. Why was Nefernina allowing this?! Maybe the mummy was tone-deaf or something. Or, she liked to annoy others than just you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd for one peaceful moment, blissful silence fell. You could hear the relieved sigh from every resident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for a quick break!\"You heard Mavis say, only for her giant form to come walking towards! You looked around, and you were directly in her path towards the kitchen. You scrambled around for anywhere to hide, but it was a small apartment, and the closest furniture to hide under was blocked by the banshee woman. Before you knew it, she was standing in front of you, gazing down at you with a sense of shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...hi Mavis...\"You waved up at her slowly.</span></div></div>",

Right now you got a Lupa who is coming to eat you, and you needed a place to hide, and now you decide to explain the truth to Mavis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... I will admit this right now. I really like your music, except when it's loud, and it woke me up to be honest, and I am sorry if I was rude at first.\" you admitted to her, and then suddenly... Mavis realizes that you complained about the noise level. Mavis sure understands quickly, and she decided to make amends. \"I understand, but I wish you brought it up when you did. Sorry... let me hide you from Lupa, just in case.\" Mavis offered, and then you quickly accepted the offer she gave you. Lupa was now knocking on Mavis's door, and you pray that she doesn't find you, so you decide to hide behind one of the pictures she had on the table as she answers the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lupa.... get the fuck away from my apartment, or I will seriously kill you, man you are the worst neighbor I ever had!\" Mavis yelled at her just when Lupa answered her. \"Have you seen him?\" Lupa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is Mavis's answer?</span></div></div>",

Perhaps if Mavis lied about \"killing\" you, which you hope it works, but you don't like that lie in your opinion, but maybe it will work, then Lupa would be drove away for good. Mavis knew a good lie to tell, because she was a sneaky gal when it comes to honesty. There were records of her cheating at her school, etc.... and she was never caught doing that at all, so this was no problem for Mavis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I just ate him, he's gone! And you better be as well, or I will make sure that this is your final day here on Monster Arms. I got human fans who like my music, and I won't let you just eat them for your own gain.\" Mavis said as she stood up to Lupa, and for you. Lupa was just downright shocked that Mavis told her that she took R.L. from her, and as a result, guess there is no more chasing you for good, as she was now in complete tears. Lupa was now crying like a big motherfucking baby that she is, and she was now running out of the building with her stuff. Mavis then came back to you, and you are good as she now smiles at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" you replied to her. \"You're welcome.\" Mavis added just as she prepares to get back to singing again. \"If there is anything I can do to repay you, I will do it.\" you said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMavis replies....</span></div></div>",

Well at least you were able to get away from Lupa for good, and thankfully she is gone, and as you walked out of the room, you replied. \u201cThanks.\u201d You said to her, and then you walked out of the room, perhaps to find your next adventure in life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, there a few options for you right now, as you need to find a job. The first job for a human opening is a movie director for a monster movie in the human world, and you actually have a talent with movies back in your days. In fact, your first job was a director for a few commercials, and you got the job for a big movie, however for some crazy reason, you had to pull back at the last minute due to family issues, and so you went away to Horrorville to settle them. It was a Cadence and her family, and while they don\u2019t have any issues with you or Cadence, it was an important matter. Maybe you can finally go back into directing. Thankfully it\u2019s nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother option you got is to maybe, and unbelievably, work here at Monster Arms as Nefernina\u2019s right hand man, and maybe doing that could maybe help pay your bills to stay at the apartment.

Nefernina said that this particular wallpaper was discontinued and if you damaged it anymore than it had already been, you'd be in serious trouble. You hear Lupa whining loudly in pain from Mavis's singing. She wasn't the only one though because you heard hissing from down the hall. Izzy must've gotten a rude awakening too. It had to be the weekend for her didn't it. Even other monsters hated Mavis's singing. Well, at least the ones in the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you hear footsteps. Lupa is walking down the hallway with her ears plugged. But then she sniffs the air and you look out the crack in the wallpaper just a tad to see her doing so. This was not good, Lupa had a nose that could rival a bloodhound's. She memorized your scent and if she picks it up, she'll tear through the wallpaper to get you. And with your luck, Nefernina will hold you responsible for the whole thing. You hope and plead that Lupa doesn't find you.</span></div></div>",

It would make sense for them to hate each other with the whole feline canine thing going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your two monstrous roommates are fighting, Chel walks in the room in her nurse's outfit. \"How are we all feeling today?\" You let out a groan and Chel inspects your wounds. \"Poor R.L.

I was going out riding with the Firecats today.\" \"Those fashion faux pas?\" asks Lupa with a scoff. \"Even I couldn't make those jackets look good and I design clothes for a living.\" Patsy hisses again. \"You wanna start something Lupa!\" \"Go ahead and try Patsy! I'll wipe out seven of your eight lives!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eight lives?\" asks Chel. \"I thought Cat siths had nine lives.\" \"It's a long story.\" Says Patsy with a sigh. You let out a sigh yourself. \"Why did I get stuck with them?\" After Chel has given you all your medicine, she decides to leave. \"If anybody needs me, just press the button by your bed.\" She says. With that she's gone. After Chel leaves, you hear a growling noise and turn your head. Lupa is still glaring at you and then you realize that Chel left crutches by her bed. \"Oh great Chel,\" you mutter. \"Real smart. Leaving her crutches. Weren't you supposed to give those to Patsy.\" What were you saying? Patsy was a cat and she probably was just as dangerous to humans as Lupa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a groan and hope for the best.</span></div></div>",

Louise brings you to her eyes and studies you. \"I think you're right, he's looking kind of mimsy.\" she says dreamily. She sets you down on the floor and you begin to walk. You don't even notice how slowly you're going. You wander around the apartment as the monsters above you ramble on about snarks and such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouise eventually notices you're behavior. \"Hey Alicia? I think you're friend can't take this stuff.\" Alicia snickers. \"Well he is human.\" That is true, the drug seems to be affecting you more than them. It was made for monsters, and your small body was feeling its effects. You meander around the room, feeling as if the environment is shifting. Even though they aren't as susceptible as you, Alicia and Louise are still pretty buzzed, so they're of no help. How does your experience go from here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Its Petra, the gargoyle police officer, who was easily the largest monster in the building. She stops in front of you, but you continue to walk forward and bump into her orange clawed foot. This causes you to fall back onto your behind, which causes you to laugh, which in turn causes her to look down at you. She looks for the source of the noise and finds you. You soon find yourself being picked up between two of her clawed fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the human thats living here.\" she says, as if simply stating a fact. \"R.L., I believe?\" You snicker to yourself. \"Yeah, it stands for Really Lovable.\" you say while trying not to crack up. You fail of course and once again have a fit of the giggles. Petra gives you a curious look. \"Are you on something?\" she asks with a suspicious tone. She's slipping into cop mode. \"No, cause your holding me in the air!\" you respond and resume laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gargoyle brings you closer to her face and smells your body. When she gets a whiff her eyes narrow.\"You're definitely under the influence of something. By the smell of it I'd say that its not meant for a human like you.\" You're not paying attention at all, but while you're close to her face you lean in and kiss her right on her mouth. This actually catches her off guard and causes the normally composed cop to pull her head back in surprise. \"You're a pretty orange lady.\" you tell her with a dreamy smile, which isn't wrong. Petra shakes off her initial shock. \"Normally I wouldn't let that slide but clearly you don't know what you're doing. We need to get this stuff out of your system.\" Where does she take you to detox?</span></div></div>",

She's decided to make sure you get through this okay. When she reaches her apartment she sets you on a table and sits down in front of you. \"Okay R.L., I'm going to sit with you while you work this out of your system.\" she tells you slowly, trying to make you understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" you say slowly, mimicking her way of talking. With that you begin to walk around aimlessly. To keep you from hurting yourself Petra blocks your path with one of her claws. When you bump into it you rub your hands along it. You then proceed to hug her finger. \"You feel nice...\" you announce as you embrace her tough, but warm skin. Petra remains serious, but is clearly not used to being touched like this. She can't help but feel a little awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gargoyle woman lifts her claw off the table, but you maintain your grip. You find yourself being raised along with her finger. Petra brings you to her face, but not too close as to avoid another kiss. \"R.L., I need you to try and settle down. You're not well, and you could hurt yourself.\" she warns. You scoff at her and chuckle a little, but also find yourself getting a little drowsy. You let out a yawn and accidentally lose your grip, causing you to fall from her finger. Falling through the air, you see that you're headed for Petra's cleavage. Upon landing on the soft pillows that are her breasts, you begin to roll around and enjoy the feeling. Eventually though you find yourself drifting off to sleep as Petra lifts you out of her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up you feel groggy and your body feels heavy. As you try to shake off this feeling you spot Petra. \"Are you okay?\" she asks. You slowly nod your head. \"Yeah, just a little beat.\" you answer. Petra sighs in relief, with the tiniest hint of red on her face. She sits with you a while, letting you rest. Once you're good enough to talk, she asks how you ended up like that. Should you rat out Alicia and Louise, or keep it to yourself?  </span></div></div>",

And think hard.\" Eventually you crack and spill the beans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was Alicia and her friend.\" you tell her reluctantly. The giant policewoman nods her head as if confirming something. Guess it didn't surprise her that Alicia was behind this. Hey if you suspected she was a stoner, a cop like Petra must have. After you tell her this Petra lifts you up and places you on her shoulder. She leaves her apartment and heads down the hall. \"Uh, where are we going?\" you ask. She glances down at you. \"To catch them in the act.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Petra reaches Alicia's apartment she knocks on the door. It opens to reveal Alicia who, upon looking up to see Petra, immediately tries to shut it. Petra stops the door however and takes a whiff of the smell coming from in the apartment. Jeez, you mostly recovered from this stuff and they were still smoking it. \"What's that smell?\" she says. Alicia steps back and Louise is trying to act casually. \"Just some scented candles.\" Alicia replies nervously. \"Would you mind if I took a look around?\" Petra asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey could've handled the situation better, but in their current state you guess their judgement isn't very good. Louise takes off for the door, but Petra grabs and restrains her. In the confusion you are knocked off of her shoulder and into her cleavage. Petra picks up one of the joints they had been smoking and takes a sniff. \"Looks like you're in trouble.\" she tells the two monsters matter of factly. \"Aw man.\" Alicia groans as Petra slaps the handcuffs on her. Meanwhile you're still in between the gargoyle's breasts. Does she remove you or are you tagging along to take the two stoners to the station? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey Cadence, Can I talk to you and R.L.?\" Lupa asks straight away without waiting for a 'hello' back, or an 'Uhhh' in Cadence's circumstance. She then held up a copy of the new book and Cadence understood then went to fetch R.L. <br>\r\nNothing bad would happen along as she was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're sitting on the kitchen table when Cadence comes through with a worried look on her face. Your stomach immediately drops as though you've just hit the descent on a roller coaster and for good reason. There's only two instances that immediately spring to mind when Cadence makes that expression; When there's 'Anti Dead' supporters around or when you're in danger, which probably means Lupa or Nefernina are here to give you a cardio workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our Landlady is at the door I presume?\" you ask with an expectant expression and slowly increasing heart rate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence starts switching between gesturing to her teeth and stomach. \"Lupa.\" you sigh. Cadence nods, then lays her hand out. \"Let's just get this over with\" you say as you climb on and settle your self in her great blue palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walks through you notice her fingers are arched and look as though they're about to just close over you. You have to admire how protective Cadence gets around you. Why can't Lupa just be like her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both arrive at the door and Lupa is still there waiting, you make eye contact with her and before you can look away she blurts out \"Hey R.L.\". This instantly struck you the wrong way as she usually refers to you as 'snack' or 'breakfast', you know those totally normal terms of endearment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's it going to be today? you gonna wrestle Cadence to get me? Or are you trying to pull a quick one? Why do you have that?\" you point to the book. \"Woah! Slow down! I just wanted to come and say thank you. It's so cool you used me as the main character! Cadence gave you credit in the acknowledgments. I never thought you'd do anything like that for me\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would nev!- wait...\" - \"You gave me a writing credit?\" you say surprised turning to Cadence for a moment. She looks down at you with a faint smile and gently brushes the side of your face with her tremendous index finger and mumbles something unintelligible that sounded vaguely like 'Course I did'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sharply drawn back to Lupa when she starts to speak again. \"I'm so glad you actually like me enough to do that! I've been trying to get your attention ever since you moved in!\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnough of this nonsense you think. You have no time for her games anymore. \"I will NEVER like you Lupa! You're ferocious and self centred! And Trust me you definitely have my undivided attention, considering if I take it away from you whenever you're close by, I'll probably end up in that fat gut of yours!\". Almost as if in defence, Lupa's left paw instinctively went to rest upon her titanic belly and she looked at you in the same way she did when Cadence first saved you from her. It takes a moment for her to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've had a few close calls but I thought we were just playing?\" she eventually answered. \"PLAYING!?\" You bark at her. \"I've never known someone so cruel, greedy and gluttonous! I mean just look at the size of yo-\" you stop when she suddenly runs off, appearing to be crying before she dodges out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to Cadence in a manner of confusion and depleting exasperation. \"What just happened?\" you say scratching the back of your head. Cadence looked at where Lupa had run off before tilting her head back down at you and proceeded to groan and mumble broken sentences. You manage to catch the drift of what she's saying. She thinks you should go and talk to Lupa alone and try to patch things up. \"Yeah that'll be the day, 'Me wandering around Lupa's apartment alone with no back up', This could just be another scheme to eat me!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grunts something back quickly that was clearly meant to mean 'And if not?'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then...then...\" you stutter trying to think of some devious way she is trying to deceive you when it, all of a sudden, hits you like lightning. \"Then I just hurt someone really badly that only wanted to be my friend and didn't know how to go about it\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence nods her head in the direction of Lupa's apartment in a 'Do you want to go?' fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was ever a time to end all the hassle that you have with Lupa, it was now. But Cadence really outdone herself in those last ten minutes. She really deserves a treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You arrive at Lupa's apartment in Cadence's hand and she kneels down to set you on the floor near the door. She mimicked something to you that was her own way of asking if you wanted her to go with you. \"Don't worry Cadence, I've had a lot of experience dealing with Lupa and the obvious advantage she has over me\" you chuckle, semi-confidently. Cadence Laughs and leaves to wait nearby and listen for any commotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to face the door. Lips pressed together into a blank expression, you straighten your jacket and psyche yourself up as you proceed to knock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA towering Lupa answers the door very slowly. You can see she's still been crying and she was wiping her eyes as she opened the door. \"Down here Lupa!\" you yell, bracing your legs incase you need to run and let the 'Karate Cadence' do her thing. \"R.L.! what are you doing here?\" she queries sobbingly. \"I'm here to talk. I don't understand some of the things you said back there. I'd like to hear you out before I make my mind up about you\". you reply back as dignified as you can sound. After all, if this little facade turns out to be true then you've just insulted someone who might potentially end up being your friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can come in if you want?\" she said trying her hardest to wrinkle out a smile through her 'Post-cry' face. \"Uh, um yeah sure\" you accept still weary. She bends down and offers out her hand. This was it, moment of truth. You quickly sneaked a glance over to see if Cadence was still there whilst climbing up. She smiled as if to say 'I'm right here if you need me', which was reassuring to the lingering doubt in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupa lifts you up, smiles right at you and retreats inside with you in-hand. She sets you down on a table and sits down on the couch in front of you. You look around casually for a moment, briefly taking in your surroundings. Then you turn to Lupa. \"The stage is yours. Convince me you're not evil\". you demand with calm conviction. \"Stop calling me evil!\" she starts to sob up again but this time more argumentative. \"I would never have eaten you for real!\" she proclaims. \"You're lying through your teeth Lupa! I've literally been seconds away from being in there!\" pointing to her stomach. \"You have to explain that!\" you exclaim, justifiably exasperated. \"I was just trying to get you to like me! I swear! I kept noticing how close you were getting with Candace and I thought you might find it attractive if I started acting a bit unpredictable and I got a bit out of hand\" she tries to explain staring at the ground. She almost looked embarrassed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't really cut it Lupa. What about all the people you've boasted about eating? what about them! Was that part of 'the show' too?!\" you fire at her. She glances up at you for a few seconds and sighs as she lowers her head again. \"I want to be honest with you R.L. Yes I have and still do eat humans. But you never stopped to think about who I was eating. Some of those people were horrible human beings. Humans who had wronged me in some way. Yes a few of the reasons I ate them were petty, but some of them wanted to be eaten, if you can believe that\" she dressed in a subtle pleading tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I can't believe that. That is total horse! What human beings wanted to be eaten alive? Give me some context here\" you call over folded arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupa takes a breath, lifts her head and holds eye contact with you for a few seconds before she speaks again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There were people who were close to death that just wanted to pass away somewhere quiet and peaceful. They saved a fortune in funeral costs, and they even had the service on top of my stomach. There were others who just wanted to be swallowed whole because they were in love with the thought of being inside my big belly, some of them were even young male and female humans. They would always ask to lie on my stomach and listen to my gut gurgle before they went in. I even managed to regurgitate a few of the ones who wanted to go in for a while then come out, so even if I did accidentally swallow you, I probably would've been able to get you out\" she said with a wink and a few pats on her stomach but still remaining respectfully quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run your right hand through your hair and stare off while you try to regain your breathing. You're beginning to have thoughts you never thought you would. You look back and link eyes again, \"You have to understand this is difficult to believe but I don't think it's impossible. Someone was that willing to give up their life to spend whatever amount of time they did. Digesting inside you?!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupa nodded and took a breath in. \"That's right, for some reason or another they all wanted to end up inside here\" she shakes the dormant, gargantuan pot belly with her left paw which leaves it jiggling as she prepares to speak again. \"I caught you glancing at it when you first came here. That's why I thought you would like that stuff\" she says on an exhale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at the colossal bulk of fat that is, Lupa's stomach and muster up the ability to speak again. \"I mean its big, really big! Compared to a human being anyway. I have to admit, it <b>has</b> always looked good on you whenever I've seen it from afar. I can see why people might like lying on it. I mean I guess it looks comfortable\" you piece together in a slightly steady tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupa's eyes gently widened a little. She looks down at her bulging gut to take a hold of it then begins to rub it while she lifts her eyes back up to look at you. \"Do you want to come and listen to it? Maybe have a nap together?\" she says with a quick upward nod and a winsome smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou subtly gasp for the tiniest flow of air and look to the ground for no less than a moment before relaxing your shoulders and regaining your dwindling stance on all that makes sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't do that Lupa. How could I possibly lay there without thinking about how many of my kind have lost their lives to form this?\" you repel. \"Well R.L. All I can say is I'm a monster and I do what monsters do. Maybe you could adjust to that the same way you've adjusted to the way Cadence smells. I can't imagine that was very fun for you when you first moved in. Now you ride around on her shoulder without a care in the world\". she earnestly replies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't ever eat you unless you ask me to small fry\" she adds with a chuckle after a pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just breath and nod, taking it all in. you look up when she starts to speak again after a minute or two. \"So you wanna nap on here?\" she beckons to her towering plump soft belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Would you be able to regurgitate me if I let you swallow me?\" you say exhausted behind closed eyes. You hear a small gasp and a loud rumble. When you open your eyes you immediately realise that Lupa has moved a bit closer to you. You lift your eyes up to meet hers. She's staring back at you in what looks like shock and disbelief. \"Do you really mean that?\" she whimpers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if I know I'll get to come back out again\" you say failing to blink now. \"Well I haven't had a lot to eat today so it'll probably be easier to find you and push you back up so I can start hacking you back out\" she informs you happily. \"But doesn't that mean when I go in, I'll get digested quicker?\" you quickly counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't worry. I'll just drink lots of Minotaur milk after I gulp you down and then the acids in my gut will water down a bit. You'll be safe with me R.L. I promise\" she says gesturing to her podgy mass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start walking towards Lupa. You can tell she knows why as she's already laying her hand out for you to climb on. She lifts you into the air as she stands up. You can see that Her belly truly is gigantic from this angle. It's just so plump and inviting. You never thought you would be trying to get 'into' Lupa Howler's stomach. But here you are clenched in her titanic paw, eager to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the spirit of telling you the truth R.L. I am really going to enjoy this\" she grins endearingly. \"So am I Lupa\" you respond simply. Her grin then relaxes into a sweet smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe begins to lift you when her expression changes. \"Hang on, there's something coming\" she quickly follows her statement by holding you tight against her fur coated monumental pot gut. There was just enough pudge to let you sink in a bit. As blissful as it was you wondered what the reason for it was. Then as if to answer you heard a small rumble come from deep within Lupa. All of a sudden her belly started to inflate against you as she let out a mighty thunderous belch. As her stomach bloated more she increased the pressure with which she was pinning you to her. The belch ended and Lupa's stomach returned to where it was before. As everything was shifting back into shape inside she still held you close against her behemoth mid section so you could listen to the gurgling explosions and hungry rumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then brings you up to her face. \"Hear all that? Your going to be fixing that for a while small fry!\" she said whilst licking her lips. \"You ready to go down?\" she asked eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. You are utterly speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifts you up a bit higher and tilts hers head back. She opens her maw with an audible groan. Her tongue extends a bit to accept you when she lets go and you stat plummeting towards her mouth. Instantly Lupa starts to roll you everywhere. Against her gums, on the roof of her mouth and under the tongue. She was really savouring you and enjoying it by the sounds of the noises she was making. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright R.L. I think it's time we get better acquainted\". With one loud gulp she sends you down her gullet. You squeeze through her with moist ease. Then you land into her warm, waiting, cavernous gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after the Minotaur milk Lupa promised arrived, in waves. To mix it up with her acids, she began to shake her belly around. You got sloshed around fantastically and hit off the pink walls of her stomach just to glide back down and rejoin the waves. After a while Lupa stopped and her gut  jiggling. You settle nicely into the acid/Minotaur milk bath and just lay against the stomach walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupa sat back on the couch with her hands on her content belly and her mind on the little passenger inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder to yourself if Cadence might still be waiting for you when you get out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soothing gurgles and soft rumbles send you to sleep. Lupa sits watching television whilst gently rubbing her stomach within where her new friend now lays fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do when Lupa wakes you up an hour later?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Cadence holds out her hand and you slide down her decayed arm before looking up at Lupa who looks more than a little mad. \"Human by Night,\" said Lupa reading the title of the book. \"Best seller. Of course, why am <i>I</i> the werewolf in this book?! You put Cadence up to this you crumb!\" \"Well it serves you right,\" you say. \"You're the one who's always trying to nom me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupa gives a growl but then she smiles smugly. \"Speaking of which, I'm changing tactics.\" You blinked in confusion. \"What was that?\" you ask. Lupa then takes out what looks like a deck of cards. \"I've been watching <i>Shocker Tales</i>. Ever heard of an episode called <i>Dead Man's Hand</i>?\" You give a gulp. \"That's the episode where a man plays cards with the grim reaper right?\" Lupa nodded her head. \"That's right. And just like in that episode, I've got a deal for you. We'll play a game of chance. Well, chance for you.\" Cadence blinks and bites her lip. \"Here are the stakes,\" said Lupa. \"You win, I don't try to eat you for a year. I don't think I need to tell you what happens should you lose.\" Lupa licks her fangs and you gulp at the werewolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, R.L.? Do you accept my challenge.\" Cadence moans and shakes her head to try and get you out of this and dissuade you from accepting Lupa's challenge, but you begin to think. Perhaps this isn't such a bad idea after all. If you literally play your cards right, Lupa will leave you alone. Of course, Lupa might cheat. But maybe you should.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tick, tock, tick, tock,\" says Lupa. \"Do you accept, my little snack?\"</span></div></div>",

She had tried to tell you, but you really weren't that great at understanding groans and moans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeidi handed you a small photograph. It was a picture of Heidi and Cadence outside of what looked to be a football stadium. Cadence was smiling from ear to ear, showing a mouth full of pearly whites. If she smiled that widely her jaw may fall off now, you think dryly. her cheeks had glitter and face-paint in her school colors on. What surprised you the most was that she was nearly a head shorter than her mother. You looked at Heidi and saw that she was shorter than you. Cadence must of been really small. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like she's...grown,\" You said awkwardly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp ahead you heard a groan. You looked up to see Cadence looking down at you. She let out a groan that you could have sworn said \"Oh, god, mom!\" She was embarrassed. If zombies could blush, you imagined there being some red in her lifeless blue cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp ahead a door opened and loud, thundering steps could be heard. You looked up to see Lupa walking towards the three of you. She was licking her lips and her eyes looked directly past Cadence, not to you, but to Heidi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, Cadence,\" Lupa said, licking her lips, \"I didn't know you were bringing me two morsels today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou prepared yourself to run and take Cadence's mother away, on for...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The audacity of this move halted everyone for a moment, including Lupa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupa looked at the gun and laughed. \"A gun? Really? Lady, you're a little grub and I'm at the top of the food chain. What do you seriously think a little piece of lead could do to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lead? Nothing,\" Heidi replied, cocking the hammer of the gun, \"But high purity silver on the other hand? That could even bring something as large as you down to your knees. And at your size, you are an easy target to hit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupa backed up slightly. You wondered how much damage silver could do to a giant werewolf. You knew that silver could hurt or kill a werewolf, but would a few bullets be enough to take Lupa down. Apparently Lupa thought so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll go out to eat then. Maybe there's an orphanage or something outside of town.\" Lupa growled menacingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shuddered at the thought of her attacking children, but realized it was an empty threat. There were no human hospitals or orphanages anywhere near this city. Lupa stormed away in a huff and Cadence bends down and picks you and her mother up. She probably didn't want to chance another encounter with a predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo they make it back to the apartment without any interruptions?</span></div></div>",

This was a shocker. As far as you knew, there were three undead monsters in the apartment. It would be understandable if this new neighbor had a problem with Mavis's obnoxious singing and Nefernina was, well Nefernina, but why would anyone have a problem with Cadence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Cadence, there's no way she can hate you. You're true blue.\" Cadence let out another moan and then shook her head again. She made a few gestures and acted like she was wearing glasses and even stuck out her tongue. Looks like Cadence was playing shades. \"Izzy, Izzy told you...\" Cadence then gestured to herself like she was wrapping bandages around herself and did an Egyptian style dance. \"Nefernina?\" Then Cadence rubbed at her eyes and you give a look of surprise. \"Izzy told you she brought Nefernina to tears.\" Cadence nodded her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, if this new monster could make Nefernina cry, she must really be anti-undead. You let out a sigh. \"I have an idea. I'll speak to...\" \"Amy.\" Muttered Cadence. You take it Amy was the new monster's name and are actually somewhat shocked Cadence spoke clearly for once. You can't remember the last time she said anything coherent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll talk to Amy and sure enough you'll be friends. Cadence bit her nails and then you realize something. \"Amy wouldn't happen to be a monster that eats humans would she?\" Cadence shook her head and you breathe a sigh of relief. Amy must've been an herbivorous species or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell soon, Cadence had walked you down the hallway and pointed to Amy's door. In no time she places you on the welcome mat. You read the mat to reveal it said \"Knock Once for Free Asskicking\". \"Sounds friendly enough.\" You say. Cadence knocks the door and runs away fast, hiding behind the corner. You kinda worry about Cadence being alone but just because Amy was racist against the undead, that didn't mean she didn't like humans. Suddenly the door opened up and you look in surprise at what type of monster Amy was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was a giant chubby, violet skinned gremlin girl with slicked back spikey hair and huge ears that rivaled that of an elephant. She also had a devil's tail and was wearing an aviator's outfit with a large tool belt. Made sense considering she was a gremlin. Of course, Amy had to look around. She obviously didn't expect an insect sized visitor.</span></div></div>",

You had to sell it, Cadence's sake.\"I live just down the hall, and I wanted to be the first one to welcome you to the apartments!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for that.\"The violet monster gave you a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I was wondering, as a neighbor, I think I should get to know you better. Mind if we had a chat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed happily, slapping her knee.\"Well come on in!\"She waved for you to enter her apartment. You looked over your shoulder at Cadence still hiding behind the corner, giving her a thumbs up right before you entered. Inside the apartment, a wonder greeted you. Already, Amy had made herself at home. The entire apartment was suited up with machinery of all kinds that aligned against the walls, a testament to a gremlin's prowess with parts. Cog screws and gears were scattered here and there, but for the most part, the apartment was clean. Amy hung her tool belt on a rack and clapped her hands, the sound of a few gears grinding, and a metal chair popped out of the wall for her to sit in. She more than readily plopped down into it, her heavy weight causing it strain a little with a rusty sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what did you want to chat about, R.L.?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, I have a roommate who's a little nervous to meet you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, shy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she's actually pretty social, it's just that...she's heard your an anti-undead...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would she be afraid of me for that?

We have at least four or five living here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen here, human.\"She stood up, towering over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those rotters are nothing but space-wasting, disgusting, atrocities that should be lying dead in a grave somewhere instead of walking around like they're still alive.

Any landing you can walk away from, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElle winced. As a rule, harpies didn't like that saying. No natural-born harpy would even repeat it since it implied they were grounded due to a broken wing as far as their kind was concerned.

You smash into the wall and slowly slide down it to the floor, completely stunned and disorientated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the floor shake in r booms that drew closer and closer to you before they abruptly stopped directly in front of you. You recovered enough to see clearly as you felt something large, warm and covered in fur start batting you around before it rested on top of you and started undulating up and down against your body. It was her foot paw. Pasty was playing with you before she killed you. You never liked that about cats...seemed so sadistic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you know...guess from your body that you really ARE a Harpy! Ho well...\" Patsy said, flipping you onto your back before she reached down and grabbed you, lifting you up as she stood so you were in front of her smiling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got you, widdle birdie! Now you're num-nums!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding you in her fist, she opened her mouth wide, exposing a mouth full of fangs and a wiggling, saliva-covered tongue that seemed to beckon to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOO! Please Patsy! I already have enough trouble avoiding that bloated, flea-infested, tree-pissing, full moon whore! Don't eat me!\" you scream, not at all ashamed of how high pitched your voice is, you couldn't even tell if it was because of your transformation or your natural fear of the feeling of being slowly eaten away, bit by bit, while you were still alive to feel it happening to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Patsy stopped dead and stared at you. \"Bloated...flea-infested...tree-pissing...full moon whore?\" she repeated, then her eyes widen \"Ho God! R. L.! It IS you!\" she hugged you and you wince, bird bones were hollow, after all, and a giantess was crushing you against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patsy...air!\" you gasp. She quickly released her hug and brought you to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You poor thing! What happened to you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got hexed into a harpy by Nefernina...she could have at LEAST let me stay a guy! Glad you didn't bite off my head...\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry! Its just I'm a cat...you're a small bird...ho man! I can't tell you how sorry I am! I really messed up!\" you felt a twinge of pity for Patsy, sure you usually try to avoid her because of her hyperactive nature and your fear of what a cat would do if she caught you, but her guilt over being about to eat you was driving her into a panic attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey, hey! You didn't know and you were just being a cat, you didn't kill or eat me, so its alright. Calm down. Nothing to cost you one of your nine lives over worrying about.\" You say soothingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatsy seemed to calm down at that. Then she leered. \"So the mummy, huh? Don't worry, I'll convince her to turn you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatsy convince Nefernina? Ho...this you've GOT to see! Patsy set you on her shoulder and you gripped her leather jacket with your talons, making you feel like a parrot on a pirate ship almost. She marched through the apartment and stopped in front of Nefernina's office and started banging on it like a SWAT officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, the door was opened quickly, Nefernina looking surprised at first, then annoyed at who was standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patsy? What the hell do you think you're do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R.L., change HIM back!\" Patsy snapped, cutting Nefernina off, getting right to the point. Not one for beating around the bush, was she? Still, had to admit you liked how she said what she meant and didn't waste time with things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNefernina frowned, \"You found out about that, huh? And didn't even eat him first by the sound of it. Well then...give me one good reason to do that. Don't tell me you're a vegetarian, Patsy.\" she taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatsy bristled at that, fire blazing in her eyes and her claws extended a few inches, then she suddenly relaxed and smiled smoothly at the gauze-wrapped landlord, \"Fine then, I suppose the Firecats being here for a month-long biker party would...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right! All right! I'll fix him!\" Nefernina shrieked. \"Just DON'T bring that down on my head! Last time you had one of those bike parties, I had the cops here to see if I was hosting an illegal event! I had to let Petra move in for free to keep an eye on things to make sure the police didn't shut down the apartment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheesh...just how bad was it if Patsy's motorbike friends stopped by?  Wait...seeing as you had that incident with Patsy trying to eat you earlier, you didn't want to know...not as long as you were part-bird, anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnatching you and setting you on her desk, Nefernina waved her hands over you and muttered an incantation. When she stopped, you were still a small bluebird harpy with feathered wings for arms and hands, talons for feet, but now you had your human face as opposed to a beaked one, and you lacked breasts, and your crotch area was back to being a male's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. Made him a guy again. Even kept him a Harpy so Lupa leaves him alone now too.\" the landlord told the biker, then turned away. \"...And I thought it was BLACK cats that were supposed to be bad luck...\" the mummy grumbled, to which Patsy just smirked at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, good news: you were a guy again. Bad news: you were still a bluebird harpy. Still, Lupa leaving you alone was an added bonus. Final score is Catgirl: 1, Mummy: 0...Go Patsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNefernina muttered something else in Egyptian and you fell on your butt as the surface under your talons raised a bit, causing a concentrated earthquake for you as several rods rose up around you with a creaking, groaning sound, all of them bending inwards and joining together at the top. Your eyes widened at what Nefernina had conjured. This was...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bird cage?!\" Patsy said, then broke out into a fit of giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From now on, R.L.'s YOUR problem, Patsy. You're keeping him if doing this was so damn important to you. Hope you choke ten times over on your new bird-brained roommate!\" Nefernina snaps, holding out the cage to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant Siamese cat sith girl hissed, her fur standing on end, even as your cage exchanged hands \"I'd never eat R.L.! NEVER! Even if he would taste like chicken now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" you shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Sorry.\" Patsy said to you, embarrassed at what she'd just said. Then she perked up. \"Well come on, my little birdie-boy! We're gonna have lots of fun now that you're mine!\" She walked out of Nefernina's office carrying the cage you were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Patsy....How did you know who I was?\" you asked as you were carried through the halls, that had been bugging you, weren't gonna complain about it since it saved you from being eaten, but you were curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatsy laughed \"You sure you don't have some Dodo bird in your new body? How did I know...are you kidding? Who ELSE hates the Poodle-slut as much as I do? It was the way you described Lupa that tipped me off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes and smile haplessly. Figures. Cats and dogs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both arrived at patsy's first-floor apartment and she sets you and your cage next to a stack of magazines about different types of motorcycles on a coffee table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait here, my birdie. I'll be back with Cadence and we'll explain everything to her. Don't worry R.L., I'll take care of you.\" She said, then left, shutting the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, feeling restless and bored already. There was nothing to do but pace your cage. You wanted out! Sheesh...no wonder caged birds always wanted to get loose and fly free in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes the door to Patsy's apartment opened and you looked up to see who entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was...</span></div></div>",

There were four of them and they were all feline monsters that were wearing black jackets with bright red flame decorations. On the backs of their jackets were the words \"FIRE CATS\" written in studs. \"Oh no.\" You say. The first to walk in was a Calico neko who was carrying a large tank of what looked like beer and was shaking her brown hair from side to side. The next girl to cartwheel in was a Brazilian shorthair who meowed loudly as she jumped up. \"The queen of the par-tay is here! Meow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came in blue British shorthair cat girl wearing a Union Jack shirt and swaying her hips. She lets out a sigh before she lights a cigarette. \"Oy,\" she said. \"Brandy,\" she says. \"Come on, the four of us are the first Firecats to get here. We can't let Patsy know we're already here. It's supposed to be a surprise party. A surprise party. Savvy?\" Brandy lets out a pout before another Firecat comes in and her appearance shocks you. This Firecat wasn't a neko like the others. She was a giant orange-reddish furred weretiger, slightly overweight from the looks of it and judging from the cap she was wearing, the tigress was the leader of the Firecats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a slight roar to get Brandy to freeze. \"Save your energy for the surprise party and wait for the rest of the cats to show up.\" The leader cat smiles and purrs and you shake in your cage. This wasn't looking good. \"London,\" says the leader cat to the Russian blue. \"Did you bring the music?\" The Russian blue cat holds up a stereo box and smiles. \"Got them all Benni.\" Benni lets out a roaring laugh as the Calico girl puts down the keg of beer and then rubs her nose. \"Uh Benni,\" she says. \"What about Maza on the top floor? She's not gonna like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaza? Wasn't that Petra's last name? That made sense. Nefernina said the reason Petra is in the apartment was because of these Firecats. Obviously the policewoman has had a run in with them before. Benni lets out a laugh. \"You worry too much Calhoun,\" she says. \"I heard that overgrown lawn ornament is sick with the flu. We're safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't good, the Firecats were going to throw a wild biker party. Nefernina and Petra aren't going to like it. If they were as wild as Nefernina made them out to be, they could potentially tear the entire apartment building apart. Just when you think it couldn't get any worse, Brandy sniffs the air and then spots you in your cage. She smiles and shows her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bird!\" yells the Brazilian Shorthair neko. \"Mmm-mmm!\" You scream and Brandy meows as she bats at the cage. \"Alright,\" says Calhoun. \"Yummy! Let me have a piece of that.\" Calhoun and London run to your birdcage and you squawk as they bat at the cage. \"Patsy!\" you yell out.</span></div></div>",

What kind of eggs are these?\" Cadence sways her arm and makes a slight hissing noise and you realize that you're eating snake eggs.

You're a regular Felix.\" Nefernina swings her broom and almost hits you. \"For your information, I'm going to be out of town for a few weeks. Running this apartment is stressful work, so I'm heading off to the Black Lagoon for a little vacation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when it hit you. Nefernina was going to be out of town for two weeks, that meant nobody to push you around, spray you or cast cruel magic spells on you. \"Woohoo!\" you yell. \"That's a vacation for everyone. I wonder if Cadence has some champagne around.\" As you walk away, Nefernina wraps one of her bandages around you. \"Not so fast R.L.

Heck, even Demona would be a better landlady than that grouch.\" Soon, Nefernina has completely tidied up the place and had packed her bags. You and Cadence decided to walk out and watch as Lupa saw Nefernina off. Lupa was one of the few monsters that Nefernina actually got along with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nefernina was about to walk away, another monster walked up to her, presumably the temp. The temp was a tall blue furred minotaur with long red hair. She was heavy in body shape, but more muscular than fat and was wearing a black Shirt with blue jeans with a huge bulge in the front. You had no idea that minotaurs had udders, but then again, you'd never seen a girl minotaur before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Bambi,\" says Nefernina. \"Everything has been cleaned, Alicia is behind on her payments and Lupa has free run of the halls. I gotta warn you though. There's a human in my apartment building that's a real pest. I can't get rid of him, I'm afraid he's going to destroy it.\" \"Oh don't worry Nefernina,\" says this cow woman in a southern accent. \"I know how to handle humans. Just enjoy your trip.\" Nefernina shakes hands with Bambi and gets into her taxi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Nefernina is gone, Bambi walks right up to the apartment and you look in fear because Bambi is very tall. She looks bigger than Chel but smaller than Petra. Nobody was bigger than Petra. But as Bambi came forward, you're wondering if this was actually an improvement to the previous landlady.</span></div></div>",

Your first 3 months here (along with gas, electricity, etc) are free, and then afterwards you start making payments, and heck\u2026 the payments are really good here as they aren\u2019t too expensive.

So\u2026 what do you say?\u201d she asked you in a nice tone before telling one other thing. \u201cOne other thing, the monsters and I who live here, we don\u2019t have any issues with monsters from many city, unlike many others though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what do you think?</span></div></div>",

Isn't Fearfield home to that big prison Under Gloom?\" On the other end of the phone, Petra nods her head. \"Yes,\" she says. \"And it's run by Warden Destiny Sirtis. She's the meanest, strictest warden they've ever had and she's got a real nasty temper.\" You let out a gulp. Destiny sounded like somebody you didn't want to piss off. \"What species of monster is she?\" Petra drinks a bottle of water before answering you. \"The same kind as me. But, whatever you do, what your mouth around her. Destiny is a little sensitive about her appearance.\" \"Why?\" you ask. \"Is she super obese or grotesque or something?\" Petra bites her lip before answering. \"Let's just say that she looks somewhat.... demonic.\" \"Demonic?\" you ask to yourself. What could Petra mean about that. Well, whatever the case, you definitely didn't want a prison warden angry with you. \"Well,\" says Petra. \"Good luck.\" With that she hangs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence places you on her right breast so you could read the paper with her and you look out the apartments and houses available for rent. \"It says here there are two apartments that are looking for tenants. One of them is on the East side and the other is on the West side.\" Cadence moans and nods her head. \"The only question is,\" you say. \"Where are we heading?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note: I have 2 ideas for where this is going so I'll add to the East and West paths just this once)</span></div></div>",

On top of the mountain was some really aggressive looking building that was covered in bars. It looked like a prison. Guess that was Under Gloom. It sure didn't look very inviting looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you and Cadence reach your stop. Cadence takes her bags as you ride on her head. Outside was a building called the Cabal House. Cadence lets out a groan. \"Yeah,\" you say. \"This doesn't look very inviting. But maybe it's better on the inside.\" Cadence and you walk into the building and at the front desk is the landlady. She was a 850ft tall Sasquatch girl who looked similar to your yeti friend Chel, except with black skin and reddish brown fur and she was wearing a pair of glasses. The Sasquatch girl looks up at you and Cadence before getting out of her chair. \"You must be the new tenants,\" the sasquatch girl says. \"I'm Harriet D. Henderson. I'll be your landlady.\" You hold your chin before looking up at Harriet. \"Uh,\" you say. \"Ms. Henderson. You wouldn't happen to know a yeti girl named Chel would you.\" \"Chel?\" asks Harriet. \"You're friends with Cousin Chel? I haven't seen her in years. How's she doing?\" \"Last I checked she was doing fine.\" You say. Cadence grunts in agreement before Harriet hands her the key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" says Harriet. \"I know what a horrible landlady you had at Monster Arms and you'll be glad to know I'm not like that crummy mummy.\" You sigh in relief but then you realize something. \"Uh,\" you say. \"Harriet. Is there a werewolf in this building?\" You definitely didn't want to run into another werewolf. You heard Lupa had a big family and you'd hate to run into her relatives who might be as carnivorous as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet let out a laugh. \"No, no werewolves here. Although, your apartment is right next door to a married couple consisting of a werejackal and a werehyena.\" You let out a sigh. \"Great. You say.\" Harriet smiled and then shakes hands with Cadence. \"Welcome to Fearfield.\" The bigfoot girl says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't long before you and Cadence are unpacking and you breathe out a sigh of relief. \"Well,\" you say as Cadence hangs several pictures on the wall. \"It seems our luck is changing.\" Cadence grunts and smiles before nodding her head. Suddenly, there was a knock on the door. Cadence grunts and then walks to the door. That must've been the new neighbors, but exactly who were they?</span></div></div>",

You look forward and see that one of them was an obese 800ft tall were hyena giantess with golden brown fur with black spots and long reddish hair. She appeared to have a psychotic looking grin on her face. You never liked that about werehyenas, their default expression was a slasher smile. The shorter one was an indigo furred and rose haired werejackal which meant this was the married couple Harriet mentioned. The werejackal appeared to have mismatched eyes; one was light blue while the other was pure red and disfigured looking. Obviously blind in that eye. Then you look in surprise because the werejackal was a woman. They were a <i>lesbian</i> couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence moans as the were hyena giantess hands her what looks like a pie. \"Hello,\" says the hyena woman in a voice that sounds similar to Cree Summer's. \"You must be the new neighbor. The previous tenant moved out a month ago and we were beginning to think no one would move in there.\" The jackal woman then cracks a smirk. \"My name is Aurelia Macbeth-Nile,\" she says. \"And this is my wife, Cree.\" Cadence shook hands and moaned. They seemed friendly enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence then grunts and looks at the pie. Aurelia and Cree might not be able to understand the zombie woman but at least Aurelia was able to tell what she was trying to say by context. \"You want to know what kind of pie that is?\" asked Aurelia with a smirk. \"Only the most delicious kind. Human.\" You let out a gasp and cover your mouth before you hide behind one of Cadence's books on the table. Cadence is slightly horrified by hides her reaction. This was great, your new neighbors were human eaters. This was not good. You just hope you can hide from Aurelia and Cree before they leave.</span></div></div>",

Looks like it's off to Dreadberry. You and Cadence get your things together and decide to head out to the city limits to get a ride to Dreadberry. Not exactly hard to do once Cadence holds out her leg to attract an orc trucker and get a ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the two of you reach the stop in Dreadberry, the trucker gives Cadence his number which Cadence subtlety disposes of before the two of you walk towards the town. You look up and have to hold your eyes. It was much more sunny in Dreadberry than it was in Terrordale. As Cadence walks down the street, you see that the suburbs, while hundreds of times bigger, it was not unlike any old small town. \"This place looks like Kansas,\" you say. \"For giant monsters.\" As the two of you walk down, you see a realtor down the street. She was an obese 660ft tall werefox with bright red-orange fur and bluish hair. on her lower chin was a beauty mark and was wearing a red business suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Dreadberry,\" she says as she smiles to Cadence. \"My name is Meagan Reynard, I must say I'm sorry about your recent eviction from Horrorville. That's why I avoid those big cities.\" Cadence lets out a moan and Meagan looks in confusion before she spots you. \"Cadence doesn't speak,\" you say. \"I'm R.L. her roommate.\" However, Meagan lets out a growl and snaps her teeth at you as Cadence steps back. \"Hey!\" you yell. \"Sorry,\" says Meagan bitterly. \"I skipped breakfast, and I'm not particularly fond of humans. One of them broke my heart.\" You gulp but then Meagan gestures for Cadence to follow her as she leads her to a small, one floor house that was colored red and appeared to have piano keys for steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, Cadence takes a look around the interior of the place. First she inspects the well stocked kitchen that has a breakfast nook and tens of frying pans. Having spent years in a small apartment, the size of the kitchen was a major shock to Cadence, in a good way. Next, Meagan showed Cadence the bathroom and it had a bathtub as well as a shower. They didn't have tubs at Monster Arms. Finally, Cadence takes a look at the living room and flips through the channels on the wide screen TV. \"I must say,\" you say to Meagan. \"This isn't like anything back in Horrorville. Meagan smiles at that though she has to wipe drool from her mouth as she looks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do we have a deal Ms. Deadman?\" Cadence grunts and then she signs the deed and Meagan sells her the house. \"Well,\" says the fox giantess as she shakes hands with Cadence and walks away. \"Welcome to the neighborhood.\" Well, it looked like things were looking up. \"Well,\" you say to Cadence. \"Our luck is changing.\" Cadence lets out a grunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to see that you have neighbors at both sides. The neighbor to the left appears to be some kind of feline monster. She looked like a cross between a lynx and an aged Pumyra from Thundercats. She had brown hair with a white streaked ponytail and humanoid face. She looked like she was in the monster equivalent of her fifties and had quite an ass on her. The cat giantess appeared to be hanging laundry. \"What kind of monster is she?\" you ask Cadence. Cadence lets out a mutter. \"Splintercat eh?\" you ask. \"That would explain the ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you look to the right to see that next door there was a monster couple. Two minotaurs to be precise. You shudder given that a minotaur was the reason you were in this mess. But these two didn't look as bad as Bambi. The wife of the couple was a fat red furred cow woman wearing a crimson jacket and beret and was smoking a cigarette, while the husband was a muscular black furred minotaur in a grayish red shirt and jeans. Curiously he was waving to a passing gremlin girl when his wife wasn't looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence lets out a grunt and you smile. \"Well, maybe we should get to know the new neighbors.\" The question is, which one?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(For more information see this link to my other interactive, Monster Boondocks)</span></div></div>",

You smile and kick back on your roommate's shoulder. As the splintercat continues hanging laundry, Cadence lets out a grunt to get her attention. Your new neighbor stops in her tracks and then turns her head to see Cadence waving at her and smiling. Though Cadence's smile is somewhat mitigated by her yellow teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the splintercat moves a shirt out of the way and looks at Cadence with a grin. \"Huh,\" she says. \"Looks like Meagan finally sold someone that house next door. Welcome to Dreadberry. I'm Cattleya by the way.\" Cattleya holds up her hand and Cadence shakes it as she grunts and smiles. Cattleya however rolls her eyes. \"And I guess you can't tell me your name. Ten thousand zombies in the world and only a handful of them can speak. Doubt I'll get much of a conversation out of this one.\" \"Her name is Cadence.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCattleya mutters in confusion and then reaches into her pocket to take out a large pair of glasses. Once Cattleya has her spectacles on, she leans in closer and spots you on Cadence's shoulder. She gives a look of surprise that quickly turns into one of rage. \"Oh great,\" she says. \"A human. There goes the neighborhood.\" You didn't like the sound of that. This woman sounded a lot like Nefernina. \"Uh, I'm R.L., Ms. Cattleya.\" Cattleya glares at you and then looks at Cadence right in the eye. \"Please tell me that runt isn't your boyfriend.\" Cadence grunts and shakes her head as she waves her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have a problem with humans do you?\" you ask nervously. Cattleya lets out a hiss and shows you her fangs. \"Of course I have a problem with humans! Especially that worthless son-in-law of mine!\" Son-in-law? You've seen a lot of mean mother-in-laws on television but this woman was a giant monster with a human son-in-law. You don't know who that poor sap is, but you sure feel sorry for him. Cattleya places her teeth dangerously close to your level. \"Since you're new to the neighbor R.L.,\" she says. \"I'll give you a fair warning. If I catch you on my side of the fence, it's snack time.\" Cattleya snaps her teeth to show you she's serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was terrific, your next door neighbor had the worst qualities of Nefernina and Lupa combined. What awful luck. Cattleya then resumes her laundry as Cadence backs away nervously. \"Just our luck,\" you groan. \"We're living next door to a monster just as mean as Nefernina.\" Cadence just lets out a grunt as you both walk back inside. \"I think I'll stay inside for the rest of the day,\" you say. \"I'll look for a job tomorrow. Hopefully they hire humans in this small town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, hours pass and Cadence is busy typing at her computer while you watch TV. You look out the window to see that Cattleya woman taking down her dry laundry. You then walk up the walkway that Meagan had put in for you and look out the window to see into Cattleya's living room. You see several photographs on her mantle, one of which showed Cattleya as being much younger. It appeared to be a family portrait, right next to her in the photograph is a large muscle bound Nemean lion with gold colored fur. You're guessing Cattleya's husband, which is weird that you haven't seen him. You're betting he's deceased, given there appears to be a funerary urn in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you notice the rest of the photograph and see that Cattleya actually has two daughters. The older looking one was a green manticore with leather wings and purple hair and the younger one was a Nemean lion like her father, except she had white fur with blonde hair and green eyes and looked somewhat chubby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look through the window and see that the next photograph portrayed Cattleya's younger daughter, the Nemean lioness as an adult. Now she was very heavyset and appeared to be holding a baby mer-lion, you're guessing Cattleya's granddaughter. Curiously, part of the photograph seemed to be rubbed out with a sharpie around the lioness's shoulder. You then look to see in her living room, Cattleya has a dartboard that has a photograph of a human male, you'd say in his late forties. That must've been her son-in-law. Yeesh, that's the downside to marrying a giant monster. You hope if you wind up with a monster girlfriend, that she doesn't have any relatives like that splintercat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Cattleya walks back into the living room and turns to her window, realizing that you're spying on her through your new house. She lets out an angry hiss in response and forces you to run. The splintercat giantess lets out a growl and gestures that she's watching you. And you thought Mavis was a bad neighbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

You smile and climb your zombie friend's shoulder. \"Okay,\" you say. \"Hey, just because one minotaur kicked us out of our home, doesn't mean that these minotaurs can't be our friends. Let's get to know the new neighbors.\" Cadence grunts and then walks over into the next yard as the minotaur couple takes attention. The bull of the couple takes notice and then calls to his wife. \"Lily,\" he says. \"Look. We have new neighbors. Somebody bought the Henderson house next door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily, the cow of the couple lights another cigarette before walking forward to you and Cadence and bending down to your zombie friend's level. You gag as the cigarette smoke hits you in the face and you're forced to duck down. There was probably enough nicotine in that thing to kill you. Lily inspects Cadence before taking out her cigarette and blowing smoke from her mouth. \"How very interesting,\" the minotaur giantess says. \"Harriet Henderson goes missing for three months and already two strangers are on her property.\" Lily's husband lets out a sigh and rolls his eyes. \"For the last time Dear,\" he says. \"I think Harriet just moved away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily however is still skeptic. \"Okay new neighbors. Tell me who is President of the U.S.A. in the year 4014.\" You raise an eye as Cadence grunts. \"How the hell am I supposed to know that?\" you ask. Lily picks you up and inspects you with her eye and even licks you before placing you back in Cadence's hand. \"I must admit, you're a little underdressed for a time traveler.\" Cadence moans in confusion. Time traveler? What was that cow talking about? Lily smashes her cigarette into an ashtray and then wipes her brow with her beret. \"Well,\" says Lily. \"I'll be keeping an eye on you since you don't live too far away. The name's Una Tolkien.\" Una? But didn't her husband just call her 'Lily'?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mind my wife,\" says Angus. \"Una Tolkien is the name she orders pizzas with. The name's Angus Oxnard.\" \"Well,\" you say. \"I'm R.L. and this is my roommate Cadence. It's a pleasure to meet you both. Cadence sits down at the patio table as Lily stares at her. \"So a human sharing a house with a zombie?\" You gulp nervously. \"You don't have anything against humans do you.\" Lily shakes her head. \"Are you kidding?\" she asks. \"I've been friends with a human for years. He's married to one of my good friends from school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA monster human marriage? You didn't even know that was legal. \"So what brings you city slickers out to Dreadberry?\" she asks. \"Well,\" you say. \"Cadence and I got kicked out of our apartment recently.\" \"Oh,\" says Angus. \"I'm really sorry. What happened?\" \"Well,\" you say. \"Our regular landlady, who is already a big old bitch one hundred percent of the time, hired a temp who kicked us out just because I was human.\" \"She sounds horrible.\" Says Lily. You then give an uneasy look. \"Well, to be honest we were hesitant to talk to you or your husband Mrs. Oxnard. It was a minotaur who kicked us out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily takes out another cigarette and lights it before she responses. \"Well,\" she says. \"That heifer better hope I never find her. Around her I'm the president of my gun club.\" You were now suddenly afraid. You highly doubt that Lily was even mentally stable. That's when you notice Angus was smiling and waving at that same red gremlin girl across the street. The gremlin seemed to be blowing him a kiss and then you realize something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't say it out loud but that minotaur bull was cheating on his heifer. For as much of a conspiracy theorist as she is, Lily didn't see the obvious. It was funny and sad at the same time. That's when you hear a squeezing nose and Lily produces a glass of milk. Obviously from her own udder. You and Cadence both look in pure disgust. \"Care for some refreshments?\" asks Lily. You look at the milk and mentally gag. \"I'm lactose intolerant.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way you were drinking milk straight out of some minotaur's udder and given Lily being a chain smoker, it obviously wasn't safe to drink. Cadence however picks up the glass and drinks it to be polite. Once she's finished, her face turns a paler blue than usual and she begins to moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

Panicburg was voted the worst place to live in all of Mons Terra. There were crooks and killers everywhere. It was certainly no place for a human like you and you were painfully aware of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Petra was seeing you and Cadence off as you got on the bus to Panicburg. She was with her younger sister, Janet, a red skinned and pear shaped gargoyle girl with purple hair worn in a ponytail. \"I'm really sorry you had to resort to this,\" says Petra. \"Panicburg is a horrible place. You have no idea how dangerous it is.\" You let out a sigh. \"We're sorry you had to move in with your kid sister.\" You say. Petra nods her head. \"At least I have a place in Horrorville. You two be extremely careful.\" Janet then walks forward. \"Don't worry. Our mom is police chief in Panicburg. We'll tell her about you.\" You nod your head as Cadence shakes hands with the gargoyle sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you and Cadence are on the bus and it takes you past Terrordale and Fearfield and then three hours later, you're both in Panicburg. As Cadence gets off the bus and holds you on her shoulder, you look around and see that Panicburg is darker and filled with more smog that Horrorville and there was graffiti everywhere and even several burning drums. You could hear police sirens blaring and shiver. \"This is a bad neighborhood,\" you say. \"We better be careful.\" Cadence grunts and then spots the apartment building where you two will be staying. \"The Dark Hand apartment building?\" you ask. Cadence grunts. As Cadence walks towards the building, you see two white chalk outlines on the ground. One was distinctively ogre shaped and the other was distinctively griffin shaped. You let out a gulp. \"I've got a bad feeling about this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Cadence walk into the apartment building and then you see the main office. Cadence knocks on the door before she hears a voice calling. \"Come in.\" \"That must be the landlady Cadence,\" you say. \"I really hope we get along better with her than the last one.\" Cadence moans in agreement before entering the office. You look up and see that there were actually two landladies and they were both massive. Both of them were 950 feet tall, making them more than three times Cadence's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first landlady was a bright crimson red furred wereboar woman with glowing yellow eyes and sharp teeth and four tusks. She was very obese and had long white hair reaching down to her considerable rear. She was wearing a black leather vest but looked naked from the waist down. The other landlady was a type of monster called a behemoth. She was a rose skinned monster resembling a hippopotamus with the thick skin of a dinosaur and a slightly elongated tail. She had long pink hair and an orange tattoo of a hippo's foot on her forehead. She was wearing a pink jacket, blue shirt and tight black jeans that looked about ready to snap off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the Dark Hand,\" says the wereboar woman. \"I am Erika.\" \"And I'm her partner,\" says the behemoth woman as she shows her sharp hippo-like teeth. \"Gloria. Is this your first day in Panicburg?\" Cadence grunts and nods her head. \"Well,\" says Gloria as the behemoth woman taps her bloated stomach. \"I'd advise you to be careful. We're not one hundred percent sure, but some of your neighbors might be dangerous criminals.\" \"But I can never remember which ones,\" says Erika as she lets out a snort. \"So be on your toes. Apartment for one?\" \"Two actually.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika and Gloria both spot you on Cadence's shoulder and look in surprise, but then they both smile and show their terrifying teeth. \"Uh,\" you say nervously. \"You don't have a problem with humans do you?\" Both monster landladies let out a laugh. \"Oh,\" says Gloria. \"We don't have a problem. Erika and I love humans.\" Erika snorts in agreement. \"But we have a special rule regarding human tenants.\" \"And what's that?\" you say nervously. Gloria and Erika let out fiendish laughs and your knees begin to shake. \"Well,\" says Gloria. \"Humans in this apartment have only one chance each month to pay the rent on time.\" \"Or you'll evict me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika lets out a laugh. \"Oh, you'll be evicted all right. Out the plumbing system.\" You're slightly confused but you gasp before you understand what Erika is saying. \"You mean, you'll eat me?!\" Gloria and Erika both lick their lips and nod their heads. \"Of course,\" says Erika. \"Humans are just divine.\" Erika smiles at you and you see human bones stuck in her monstrous looking teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence herself is somewhat spooked. \"But don't worry,\" says Gloria. \"I'm sure you're a responsible human. But in the event you can't make the rent, well, you get to decide which one of us gets to devour you.

She looks to be about the same height as Petra, with red fur and long red hair made into a ponytail. She's got an amazon's figure but is still a little plump. \"Hey roomie!\" she says to Cadence, and then gestures for her to come in. Cadence enters the room and the wolf girl closes the door. \"Its nice to meet you.\" she says. \"My name's Autumn.\" Cadence shakes Autumns hand. \"Uggh.\" she says. Autumn sniffs the air and then spots you. \"Oh, a human! You gonna eat him?\" she says as she reaches for you. Cadence quickly grabs you and holds you close to herself. \"Uughh.\" she says. Autumn is confused until you speak up. \"I'm Cadence's friend, RL. We were roommates back at our old apartment.\" you explain. \"This tasty little guy's your friend?\" the werewolf asks. \"Takes all kinds I guess.\" Cadence relaxes a little and puts you on her shoulder. \"So you won't eat me?\" you ask nervously. Autumn leans in closer. \"I can't make any promises.\" she says with a toothy smile. You hide behind Cadence's hair as the werewolf laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where did you guys live before?\" Autumn asks. \"We lived in Horrorville.\" you tell her. \"We got kicked out though, so we moved here.\" She laughs a little at your story. \"So you moved to PANICBURG? I don't know if you're aware, but this place doesn't have the best reputation.\" she says. \"We didn't have many options.\" you say. \"Wait a second. You said Hororville? My cousin Lupa lives there.\" she says. You almost fall off of Cadence's shoulder. \"Lupa's your cousin?!\" you exclaim. \"By that reaction I guess you've met her. She probably tried to eat you huh? I know I would.\" Autumn says with a chuckle. Looks like living here will be like dealing with Lupa twenty four seven. At least she seems friendlier than her cousin though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you and Cadence unpack Autumn tries to get to know you. \"So what do you guys do for a living?\" she asks. \"Cadence here is a writer.\" you answer. Cadence nods with a grunt. \"Cool, what about you?\" Autumn says. You look away slightly before answering. \"I'm sort of... seeking employment.' you say. \"So you basically lived with her for free.\" Autumn says. You slump a little and Cadence laughs. Well, its more like a series of groans but you get the point. \"I myself am an architect.\" Autumn tells you. \"So you build houses and stuff?\" you ask. \"Yup.\" she answers. \"I have a team to help with the work but I personally design and work on every project. I actually built one of my cousin's houses.\" She sounds like she's pretty successful. You wonder why she chose to leave here of all places.

Maybe a bookworm like you should keep your head down.\" Cadence lets out a moan and walks to the door. Autumn stops her before she leaves. \"Look, here's my number.\" she says while writing on a scrap of paper. \"If you run into trouble just give me a call.\" She might be a predator but she sure is nice. \"Thanks Autumn.\" you say gratefully. She leans in and scratches your head with a claw. \"Don't mention it, I wouldn't want some other monster to take my snack from me.\" she says with a smirk. You smile nervously at her massive teeth. Its going to take some time to get used to such a friendly predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you're outside walking down the street. Looking around you see that this place really is seedy. Its dark and dingy and makes you a little nervous. \"Cadence, maybe we should have listened to Autumn\" you say. \"UUggh.\" she responds. \"Easy for you to say, you're already dead.\" you say with your arms folded. Once you're about a block away from the apartment building something happens. Suddenly are dark shape steps right in front of you from the shadows, startling Cadence. You hold on tight to avoid falling off of her shoulder. Standing in front of you is a werebear, looming over Cadence. \"Hey girlie, you new around here?\" he asks with a smirk. Cadence starts to babble unintelligently while you gulp. He offers one of his large paws. \"I can show you around.' Then an even larger shadow appears from behind you, dwarfing even the bear. He looks frightened and then turns tail and runs. Cadence turns around and you look up, way up. In front of you is a huge gargoyle woman, even taller than Petra. She's probably about 1300 feet tall. Her skin is a deep reddish orange and she's got gray hair that reaches past her shoulders. She has a great hourglass figure, kind of like Petra's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second,\" this new gargoyle as she leans closer for a better look. \"A zombie and a human...are you Cadence and R.L.?\" she asks. Cadence nods and the woman puts a claw on her shoulder. \"I'm glad I ran into you! My daughters Petra and Janet told me you'd be coming! The names Gaia, I'm the chief of police here in Panicburg.\" she says. All the nervousness leaves you and you sigh in relief. So this is Petra's mom! Petra certainly takes more after her than her sister Janet does. They've got the same build and that same tough presence about them. \"Um, thanks for helping with that guy.\" you tell her. Gaia picks you up and brings you to her face. \"Don't worry about it, I promised my daughters I'd look out for you. Its horrible to lose your home and have to come to a place like this.\" she says as she holds you to her gigantic eye. Having this woman on your side certainly helps a bit. She's the chief of police, and must be pretty good if a huge werebear runs away from her like that. \"Besides, you just have to know how to handle these crooks.\" she says. She also seems more open than the stoic Petra. Gaia then offers to give you a tour so you know your way around. \"Not everyone here is bad.\" she tells you. \"If you get to know the shopkeepers they'll look out for you too.\" She then guides you to some various shops.

It looks pretty normal, and you don't think she'd take you anywhere dangerous. \"Now you can run into trouble just about anywhere in Panicburg, but it pays to have friends.\" Gaia tells you. She then takes you inside one of the various stores. When you enter you see a chubby woman whose skin is blue. Her hair is long and appears to be made of water, circulating on her head. \"Hey Brook.\" Gaia says. The woman looks over and smiles. \"Oh hey Chief, what brings you here? Looking for a good book?\" Its then that you notice you're standing in a bookstore. \"Not today, I'm just showing some newcomers around.\" Gaia tells her. Brook comes over and greets you. \"Welcome to my shop. We've got every kind of book you could want, but it might take you a while to finish one.\" she says eyeing you. You laugh at the joke and look around. \"Panicburg doesn't seem like a place where people like to read though.\" you say. \"Oh, everyone likes to read.\" Brook tells you. \"What really gets me business is the fact that customers are always safe in my shop. Not many people want to mess with a water elemental.\" That explains the watery hair. \"They probably have some of your books here Cadence.\" you note. Brook then gets close to Cadence's face. \"Wait a second. Cadence? Cadence Deadman?\" she asks. Cadence grunts and nods. \"Well I'll be! A celebrity in my shop!\" Brook says. Cadence just moans but you know if her blood still flowed her cheeks would be red. \"Well don't you two worry, if I hear you're in trouble I'll help you out.\" Brook tells you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leaving the bookshop you see another shop. \"Whats this place?\" you ask as Cadence goes inside. Gaia comes in right after you. \"You don't want to come here.\" she tells you. \"Now, now, Chief Maza. I'm just making a living.\" a voice says. You see that the voice belongs to a kitsune woman. She's got reddish brown fur and is a little on the thick side. She comes over and offers her hand. \"Crazy Reddy, but you can call me Reddy. Customers are like family, so lets drop formalities eh?\" she says. This woman seem really likable. \"I wouldn't fall for anything.\" Gaia says. \"Reddy here sells some pretty sketchy stuff. She's just lucky I haven't found a reason to bust her.\" Reddy smiles  at the gargoyle. \"All of my wares are one hundred percent legal.\" Then she turns to you. \"Oh and a human? Well I bet I even have something you would like little buddy.\" she says and walks to the counter. Her bushy tail sways in a way that accentuates her rear, making you stare. Gaia sees this and rolls her eyes. \"Watch out, she's got a silver tongue.\" she warns. \"I just like to get to know people.\" Reddy says. \"Customers are like family to me.\" You look around at all the stuff. \"How do you deal with troublemakers?\" you ask. \"Kitsunes are really good with magic.\" Gaia explains. \"Reddy here is adept at teleportation spells.\" Reddy folds her arms proudly. \"At the sign of trouble I can whisk myself and the shop away to an undisclosed location, only to return a while later. Its to the point where people don't really try to rob me anymore.\" Wow, these shops are good at dealing with riff raff. What next?</span></div></div>",

Sometimes you might find a good deal but usually her stuff's either overpriced or faulty.\" Gaia informs you as you once again hit the street. \"So Chief Maza, have you always lived here?\" you ask off topic. \"No, I used to live in Horrorville.\" she says. \"I used to be the best cop they had, and that was while raising three daughters! Once my girls all grew up and left home though I was offered the job here as chief. I try my best but I can't be everywhere at once so its still pretty bad around here.\" Then she laughs as she remembers something. \"When I first came here the local crooks didn't take me seriously, then one behemoth who though he was tough ended up with a broken jaw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gaia talks more you think that she's much more open than her daughter. \"If you don't mind me asking, what was Petra like as a kid?\" you ask. \"As far as I know she's usually calm and stoic.\" Gaia nods with a smile. \"Yeah, she's a tough one., also the only one who followed in my footsteps and became a cop.\" she tells you. \"Don't get me wrong. Her sisters, Roxy and Janet can hold their own, but they aren't cut out for police work.\" Gaia then stops and reaches into her back pocket. She pulls out a wallet and pulls out a picture for you to see. In it are three young gargoyle children. You recognize the orange one as Petra, and there's a smaller red gargoyle next to her. Behind them with her arms around their shoulders is a taller yellow gargoyle. \"This is before Petra hit her growth spurt.\" Gaia says. \"After she shot up she became taller than Roxy. Then Janet and Roxy got bigger and rounder.\" she laughs as she reminisces about her kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Gaia chats with you someone suddenly runs past her from behind and pushes Cadence aside.You are thrown from her shoulder and grab onto the runner's shirt to keep from hitting the ground. You see that its an orc girl and that she managed to grab Cadence's wallet as well. From what you can tell this girl isn't very subtle and probably only got away because she targeted a zombie. Any other monster would have reacted fast enough. Also from you position you can see Gaia on the girl in a flash. She pushes the girl to the ground and holds her arm behind her back. \"Really? How green are you? Pickpocketing with the chief of police right there?\" she says almost laughing. You are picked up by Gaia's claws and placed on her shoulder. \"You okay R.L.?\" she asks. \"Yeah, just a little shaken up.\" you answer. Gaia lifts the struggling orc by the scruff of her jacket. \"well I should get this rookie criminal to the station.\" she says. \"You two should come along too.

She had bright rose colored scales on her back with hot pink hair that covered her eyes, long fangs and stripes on her body. The wildebeest like woman was obese with a large stomach and thighs and was wearing nothing but a white vest. \"Daphne!\" yells Autumn as she shakes hands with her friend. \"Come on in, I want you to meet my new roommates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new monster, Daphne, walks in and smiles as she appears to be carrying a pizza box that she lays on the table as she lowers her head to Cadence's level. \"Welcome to Panicburg,\" she says. \"A zombie eh? That will come in handy in this town.\" Cadence laughs nervously before she notices you. \"Uh hello,\" you say. \"I'm R.L. and this is Cadence.\" Daphne leans in closer and opens her mouth. You take a whiff of her breath and begin to gag. It smelt absolutely toxic. \"Wow,\" says Daphne. \"So Autumn has a human roommate. I wouldn't be surprised if you woke up in her belly the next morning. I'm Daphne by the way.\" Daphne holds out one of her titanic fingers for you to shake. \"Uh,\" you say. \"I mean no disrespect Daphne, but what kind of monster are you.\" Daphne lets out a snorting laugh. \"I'm a catoblepas, a monster from Ethiopia. The name means 'to look downwards'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odd name,\" you say. \"Uh, can you see me well with your hair over your eyes.\" Daphne gives a smirk. \"You don't want me to pull my hair up. If you look into my eyes, you'll become a paperweight.\" You step back and cover your eyes as you shake. \"I see,\" you say. \"You know, back in Terrordale, we lived directly over a gorgon.\" Daphne let out a giggle. \"So they have apartments that allow humans there as well?\" You look slightly confused, but then Daphne reaches into a pocket on her jacket and what she takes out next surprises you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in Daphne's hand was a young human man around your age who had long red hair and was wearing a pair of glasses. You look in surprise as the human guy waves at you. \"R.L.,\" says Daphne. \"This is my boyfriend, H.P.\" \"Hello,\" says H.P. \"I didn't think any other human would move here. Especially after Erika ate the last human tenant who moved in here.\" You couldn't believe this. Another human in the apartment building before you? Erika and Gloria must've wanted more humans around to prey on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence holds out her own hand and you walk up and shake hands with H.P. \"Huh,\" says H.P. \"Necrophile huh? Did you date her when she was alive.\" Cadence and you both look in surprise. \"What? No! Cadence isn't my girlfriend. I don't have a girlfriend. Although there was a basilisk at my old apartment who had the hots for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAutumn lets out a laugh in the background. \"Yeah, and my cousin tried to eat him up.\" Daphne snorts and then opens the pizza box, revealing a perfectly made pizza that smelled absolutely heavenly. It was most likely made of monster food, but even you couldn't resist the smell. Cadence picks up a piece and bites into it before shoveling it in and moaning in ecstasy as she chews it. You pick up a tiny piece yourself and eat it. It tastes awesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" you say. \"This is the best pizza I've ever tasted.\" Autumn takes a piece herself. \"Daphne runs a pizzeria near here. She hand makes every pizza herself.\" Daphne blushes and then puts H.P. down to speak with you as you both pick off pieces of the pizza. \"You've got serious guts moving to Panicburg,\" says H.P. \"This city has the lowest rate of human survival in the monster world.\" As Daphne and Autumn are talking, you walk up to H.P. \"But you managed to find a nice monster girl who doesn't eat humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nH.P. looks up and sees Daphne distracted before speaking with you. \"Daphne <i>does</i> eat humans.\" He says. You gasp. \"One of Daphne's specialities is pizza with human toppings,\" says H.P.  It's kinda how I met her. She made a pizza for herself and I somehow survived getting cooked. She was too full afterwards to eat me but before she could save me for later, I managed to sweet talk her into a steady relationship. Daphne hasn't stopped eating people but I'm an exception and maybe if you're lucky she'll make you an exception too.\" You were stunned. This guy had a girlfriend who ate humans and yet she's dating him. \"R.L.,\" says H.P. \"I'm not going to lie to you. Most monsters in this apartment building, if not all, are human-eaters. I've been nearly swallowed hundreds of times. Just last week, Autumn had me over her mouth. Daphne's roommate, this big woolly were rhino giantess, one time I woke up and she had me in a sandwich. Even Daphne's licked her lips at me a few times. You need to be careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a groan. This apartment was sounding more dangerous by the second. Daphne then turns her focus to Cadence and you. \"Say,\" says the catoblepas giantess. \"I'm throwing a party at my place to welcome you two to the neighborhood. Sound interesting to you.\" You look nervously but Cadence grunts and nods her head before picking you up and placing you on her shoulder. \"Excellent,\" says Daphne. \"All the other tenants will be there, so be ready in an hour. Autumn will show you the way. Come on H.P.\" Daphne picks up her boyfriend and places him in her armpit before walking away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAutumn smiles at you and Cadence both and wags her tail. \"Well, you two are gonna meet the whole gang. Oh and R.L.\" \"Yes?\" you ask. \"Try not to wind up in another monster girl's belly. If anyone's gonna to eat you, it'll be me.\" You let out a sigh. You just hope that there's enough snacks at the welcome party that Daphne's friends aren't tempted to swallow you.</span></div></div>",

Somehow it makes you want to hurl to your stomach as not only was the room a mess in every way you can possibly imagine, but it also smells as if someone is doing drugs and doing crack as well. You can see that they re cigarettes and its ashes all over the place, along with massive panties, bras, food objects all over the place that smells like it has rotten like a stink beetle. You can also look to see that there is tons of paint all over the room, and the bed is shred to no end, and also the TV and other stuff either looks broken, or just plan bad looking. After looking at the TV, maybe it isn't bad, and there is a cable box and other stuff, but nothing can prepare for you for what you saw next. Not only it single handedly explains why the room is a complete mess, but also why it smells so bad. You actually had to cover your nose just so you don't get repulse, and Cadence understands your pain. Even though she is dead like a zombie, if she was able to smell or if she is smelling right now, it absolutely disgusts her just as much as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on a big massive couch that fat people would sit on is some sort of a brownish Bigfoot like creature, only it was wearing a big ass white shirt and huge jeans, but has massive breasts and the face actually looks very girlish and with green eyes and lipstick. It was also very hairy as well, and it has for teeth two massive tusk like teeth. Give or take height wise it is at least around 1000ft tall, but the weight is like almost like million pounds at least. Give or take, this is exactly how this girl weights, but at least she is somewhat pretty, but still, you don't want a fat person in your life. This is a Yowies, a mix between a Bigfoot, apes, and a human if you want to call it that way. Your eyes just cannot stop looking at it, I mean her weight is like a beast itself, and still she is pretty somehow. She was watching TV when you and Cadence came and knock on the door, and she struggles to get up and go the door to open it. When she opened it, she saw a very tiny human (you) and Cadence. \"Hello there.\" she said really nicely, especially looking at you just as she tries to grab you, but Cadence didn't let that happen, not because she is in love with you, but more likely you would get crushed by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well uh.... hi.\" you said extremely nervously just as you continue to smell and look at her god awful apartment that reeks like a skunk. The Yowie looks at you and then replies. \"I apologize for the mess in the room and how it reeks, but to me it's nice the way it is.\" the yowie said just as she struggles to walk all the way to her couch to continue watching some reality show. \"I am Melonie, and I hope that we can be good friends.\" she said. \"Well okay. I am R.L. and the zombie girl who is with me is Cadence.\" you introduced yourself, and Cadence smiles at you for the introduction you did for her. It is true that Cadence cannot talk, but at least she is able to put up somewhat of a smile, but also kinda still not very well with the smell of the apartment that they walked in, that is if she can smell anyway. \"So uh... how are you doing?\" you asked her, and Melonie then starts to look down just as Cadence closes the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not very good. You see, I was doing alot of illegal stuff that you wouldn't like. I been selling Monster drugs to make a living. I am apart of a illegal drug trade, but please don't report me. I got kids I need to support, as I was fired from my job lately, and if they find out what I am doing here, not only I could go to prison, but I can lose my kids for good. Please, don't report me. I swear, do it my kids.\" Melonie cried and begged as she tries to plead with you not to call the police. She even pulls a picture out and shows you her 3 kids. They all seem to be monster girls, and they are all like her. Plus the mother seems to be really caring and loving to them. A criminal mother who is doing illegal drug trade to support her kids. \"Although I will admit I do make alot of money doing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you got to get up and start getting a job so you don't have to resort to illegal trading. You know if someone were to find out, then you could go to jail, but... your secret is safe with me.\" R.L. then replied to her so she can help Melonie out. Cadence smiles at you as you know that you are being nice to her, and want to help her get out of the bad lifestyle that she is currently in. \"Thank you.\" Melonie smiled just as she drinks another big bowl of Monster Soda. After she drinks up an entire bottle, she then replies. \"In case you ask about my weight, me and my kids are fine, we should just be happy with who we are.\" Melonie smiled just as she begins setting up the place for you two to live in. Still, you are going to have to deal with the stink, but at least Melonie is nice enough to let you stay, but soon you would have to deal with her kids, and you don't know about them yet. Let's just hope they are nice like Melonie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

It was a humorous image to image Petra in a fancy gown and tiara. Maybe it will have a Disney-esque design.

Petra was wearing a cyan ballgown and a small tiara. She was even wearing make-up. Aiba's costume was a witches hat, a long black skirt, a broom in her hand, and a fishnet top. To keep herself somewhat modest, you saw Aiba was wearing skull pasties. You saw Giselle, who was dressed as Batgirl, and Mavis, who was wearing Celtic armor and holding a fake head, so she must have dressed up as a Dullahan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are some good costumes.\" You say to Cadence, who nods in agreement.

Man, you were getting tired. Maybe you had outran Lupa, and she had given up for now? As you turned around in hope, your eyes widened in fear that this situation was only going to get worse. Much, much worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupa was getting bigger.

She slammed it down in front of you, a looming wall of dark fur as she rose higher and higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can explain. Sorta. Ya see, you live in a town where most anything is possible. Monsters, check. Magic? Double check. Some of the residents like to be a bit bigger than their normal height, so Nefernina used some o' that egyptian magic of hers to enchant this hallway. Everything in it, supernatural of course, seeing as I'm getting bigger and you're not, gets nice little size boost.\"She laughed once more after her explanation, creating powerful booms that nearly shattered your eardrums with her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up as Lupa's growth seemed to come to an end, the magic dealing out it's effects to her and the adjacent hallways. She was so big, you could barely even see past the tip top of her paw, the fur strands jutting out thick as tree trunks to you.

This seems too soon. I mean, I've never had a human before.\" \"Then don't start! Humans are poisonous!\" You lied, hoping that Zelda would let you go. But as drunk as Zelda is, she sees through this lie. \"Pipe down, you don't get a vote. Now, I could eat him right here and now, but I wonder how well he'd go with a swig of moonshine or maybe even aquavit. If I wait until tonight, I'll bet I could make an awesome drink out of him.\" You let out a groan. Leaving the apartment was a bad idea, but coming here was an even worse one. It's as if the apartment itself was out to get you.</span></div></div>",

She opened up the top and dropped you inside, sealing the lid tight to make sure you couldn't escape. But how could you? You were so tiny, the inside of the jar was like being in a vast cavern. Zelda settled the giant jar containing you on the table and gave you a little wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now if you'll excuse me, I have a hangover to sleep off.\"She yawned before marching off to her bed, collapsing into with a heavy sigh.

Using all the strength you had left, you ascended the inside of the jar, that taking you about two hours to do so as you climb out of one of the air holes in the lid, and it taking you nearly thirty minutes to make your way down the jar again to land on the table, leaving you roughly five hours left to escape before the gigantic centauress awoke and mixed you into one of her alcoholic drinks. But first, you had to take a break. With your heads resting on your knees, you took in big gasps of air, the whole ordeal leaving you quite stressed and exhausted. If you had known that moving into an apartment filled with monsters that would either want to eat you or hurt you, you would have gladly stayed in a human-sized town. But no, you had your reasons for moving to Horrorville, and this was just one of the consequences of that choice. With one last breath, you began making your way across the table, avoiding leftover crumbs the size of giant boulders from previous meals Zelda had had on it, and even a drop or two of vodka the size of a lake. She sure was messy, but you figured as much. This centaur girl seemed the partying type, probably spent her days sleeping away the drunkenness and her nights raving it up at a club that Elle probably DJ'd at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another hour, you had made the hazardous trip down one of the legs that held the table up and onto the floor, the wooden terrain stretching out before you as a vast landscape, the only monuments were giant furniture that reached to the sky, the blurry horizon of the door in the distance, and a few of Zelda's bras here and there. What gave you incentive to keep moving was Zelda's thunderous snoring every minute or so, knowing that you had a very limited time to sprint to freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an hour, you had already made it halfway across the apartment. In another hour, the crack under the door was in sight. What luck! You were so close, you could almost taste freedom. Cadence must've been seriously worried about you being gone all day.

From your perspective and what you could make out of a nearby window, the sun was just setting, giving you plenty of time before the actual 'night' and for the centauress to wake up to an empty jar and a humanless drink. But of course, things just had to go wrong in some way or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared up at her, expecting her to walk over to the kitchen and roar in anger that you were gone from the jar, but she just stood there, swaying slightly in her stance. It took you a second to realize that she was still asleep! Who knew she was a sleepwalker? Zelda staggered about on her four hooves, running into furniture and bumping against the wall, all the while mumbling something in her sleep. You couldn't help but laugh at such a ridiculous display she was making, until she started nearing towards you. Without warning, one of her landscape-shattering hooves crashed down right beside you, sending you flying for seemingly miles from the sheer force of impact created by her stomp. The zebra-like centaur was still muttering in her sleep, something about more alcohol and a tiny human. Even in her sleep, she was thinking about guzzling you down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrambling back up to your feet, you made a mad dash for the exit, only for her unwitting hooves to follow you all the way with her stomping, threatening you the entire time to squash you flatter than a pancake.

She places the cup and bottles on the table as she brings her head to your level and taps on the jar you're in, creating sound waves that nearly deafen you.

Then she adds a drop of cough syrup to your surprise. Then Zelda reaches for a bottle of tobasco sauce and blows on her finger at you. \"If Catalina found out I was using her tobasco she'd make glue out of my feet.\" Zelda then hums to herself as she adds the sauce and then a few lemon drops, making that vile alcoholic concoction fizz and smoke. She stirs with a large spoon and that only increases the intensity of the smoke. Finally, Zelda lights a match and causes flames to appear at the top of the drink as you watch in horror. \"She's gonna drink me with <i>that</i>?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda blows out the flames and gives a smile as she reaches for the jar you're in. She opens the jar and then shakes it as you scream and fall plummeting into the alcoholic brew. You submerge and then surface and cough on the foul taste of the junk as your eyes spin around.

Of course that's assuming being swallowed by a drunk centaur didn't kill you first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda gives a smile as she sniffs the drink. \"Now let's see how much flavor a little human adds to it.\" This was so not good, you were going to be eaten, or more accurately drunk by a colossal centaur.

You try to run but it's no use, Zelda quickly brings her hoof on you with enough force to destroy a city, rendering you as nothing more than a tiny red spot on her sole. Zelda gives a satisfied smirk before she twists her hoof to make sure you were dead. \"Well lookie there,\" she said still tipsy. \"I got 'em. annoying pests, I have half a mind to move to a classier apartment.\" With that, Zelda lets out a yawn and goes to sleep her hangover off. When she awakes she will forget about crushing you beneath her hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Cadence, she woke up later that morning and saw you gone and went looking for you. She asked everyone you both knew and then went around the new hallway. She asked several creatures including a chimera, a manticore and even a Frankenstein if they had seen you but she didn't get any answers. Cadence even asked Zelda but Zelda, the drunk that she was had no recollection of squishing you. \"Human? Can't say I've seen him. I hope you find him soon. You know there are tons of predators in this apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Cadence's search proves fruitless and she can only assume that Lupa ate you and confronts Lupa and gives her a few angry grunts. \"Get off my case Cadence. I told you before. I didn't eat him.\" But Cadence didn't believe Lupa and would never speak to her again.

She sniffed at you a few times, and began to move forward. She inched towards you farely slowly for a being so gigantic. Every step sent shivers down your spine, because each one was a step closer to your death.

You then look up to see a new titaness who looked really bizarre. She had grayish green skin, patchwork in appearance and was wearing a schoolgirl's outfit. However several parts of her body looked mechanical with several steel patches. She had bolts in her neck, a pair of conductor coils on her back and robotic hands with four fingers each that almost looked like claws. One of her eyes even looked mechanical and one of her feet looked like it was completely made of metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were looking up at a genuine Frankenstein.

Does he have to call the first thing in the morning.\" As the Frankenstein woman picks up the phone, you look in amazement, this was the first time you've ever seen an artificial monster. She looked as though she'd be taller than most of the monsters in the apartment (with the obvious exceptions of Chel and Petra of course) even without the magic hallways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to listen in on her conversation. \"Hi Dad, it's me Widget. I'm fine Dad. I just woke up. You ask that same question every morning. How many times do I have to tell you I'm not a little girl you built in your lab anymore. In fact, I never was a little girl considering you built me to be the size of a skyscraper. I don't even want to know where you got the materials. I know you worry about me, but it's not necessary. I'm 18 months old, I can take care of myself.\" You let out a laugh. Even if she was a giant monster, Widget was acting like a teenager who had moved out of her parents' house. \"Aw Dad, come on, I told you, there aren't any guys in this building. It's perfectly safe. Although that mummy who runs this place is a jerk most of the time.\" You let out another laugh. Widget didn't like Nefernina any more than you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Widget's mechanical eye fell out and landed with a boom as you let out a scream. \"Crap!\" yells Widget. \"Oh, it's nothing Dad. My eye fell out, again. Don't worry, it's indestructible, remember? Just how you made me.\" Widget lets out a grunt and then reaches down for her eye as it rolls towards you and you step back.

She also had long and spiky green hair and appeared to be wearing little more than a loincloth and belt. This woman was a type of monster that very few humans get to see, she was a Loch Ness Monster. You were in so much awe, you didn't notice that this Loch Ness monster girl was walking right towards you. You're forced to run out of the way as she nearly crushes you flat under her flippered foot. She then puts her ear to the door and listens in as she grits her teeth. \"Crazy werewolf woman,\" she said. \"She's never gonna catch that wee human. Why would she even want to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing those words, you're relieved. This is a type of monster that doesn't eat humans. Maybe she can offer you protection until Lupa gives up. But then you see her rubbing her belly, her large belly. She seems to have a worried look on her face. Then you realize something. This monster is pregnant. How was that possible, according to Nefernina there aren't any male monsters in this building and Loch Ness monsters are so rare that this woman might be the only one in all of Horrorville. She doesn't know you're here and you begin to wonder if she needs to know. Technically you're trespassing and no matter how gentle her species are to humans, she's still pregnant and you don't know how she'd react to a human in her condition.</span></div></div>",

If you wake her up, she'll be mad.\" \"Wait? What kind of monster is your...\" Then you realize something. There was a reason the windows were jailed shut. You were in a vampire's den.

Tatiana picks up the scent of your blood and then she gives a curious look before moving the table and seeing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nervously wave up as Tatiana gives a look of surprise that quickly turns to anger as she picks you up. \"Another human!?\" she yells.

I remember you begging on your knees for me to spare your worthless human life.\" Oh man, you inadvertently got Sorina in big trouble. \"You owe me your life and you break house rules. Bad girl!

Whoever lives here must not be home yet. You take a closer look to see that the apartment had a Chinese motif and there were strange posters on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run up to see these are movie posters. They were mostly action movies. Calling them monster movies would be redundant in this town. You look close to see all these posters depicted a jiang-shi, a Chinese hopping corpse that was a mix between a vampire and a zombie. Then you see that the jiang-shi in the posters was a blue jiangshi that for some reason was colored in using magic marker to look green and that there was a photo of a green jiangshi on the wall as well. Then you saw a sticker on the wall that read \"Stunt Girl\". You're starting to realize something. There was a jiang-shi in this apartment that worked as a stunt girl for action movies and from the looks of it she was jealous of the woman she filled in for. You let out a laugh. Monsters had egos too, you knew it from living next door to Mavis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you hear footsteps. \"Get out of the way wolf girl, what are you doing out here anyway? Have you no pride going to all this trouble to catch one tiny human.\" \"Like you're one to talk about pride Koko,\" said Lupa's voice in the hall. \"You say you're gonna get your face on a poster but you just play second banana.\" \"Laugh now Lupa. But I'll show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a gasp because the door is unlocking. You don't know what this monster thinks about humans. What do you do?</span></div></div>",

You almost laugh, already liking how she saw Lupa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you got a good look as Koko after she turned on the light, you had to confess that the Jiang Shi was actually...you couldn't believe you were saying this about a monster...cute, at least once you got past the green skin, sharp black fingernails, and the stiff jumping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face was heart-shaped, a button nose, and she had blood-red, amond-shaped eyes and when she opened her mouth to yawn, it was possible to see that her canines were slightly longer than her other teeth and were pointed into fangs. Her outfit consisted of white socks, black slippers, loose black trousers with dark velvet green cuffs, a long-sleeved black tunic with dark velvet green cuffs and a black, high-collared sleeveless overtunic with dark velvet green trim. A wide dark green sash/belt kept the overtunic in place. Koko also wore a green and black Mandarin-styled hat topped with a green ball and trim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh to yourself, Great...you think, you can't afford to fall for any of these horror-giantesses. As the breath leaves your bodym you recall how Jiang shi can locate their victims by their breath...but that means...HO SHIT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?!\" Koko said and looked down, spotting you \"Well, well...so THIS is what that werewolf was outside my door for!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up and see Koko leaning down as far as her unbending legs would allow, using the tips of her hands to put her in a position that seems like she's going to do a push-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...hi,\" you said, it was all you could think of to say, looking into the angry eyes of the giantess jiang-shi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here, human?!\" Koko demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trying to avoide that werewolf that wants to eat me alive.\" you answer honestly. \"I...uh...ran in here at randome trying to avoid Lupa. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoko gives a frustrated sigh, and you nearly get knocked off your feet by it as Koko mutters to herself about dumb animals and lots of silver as she pushed herself upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're an actress?\" you ask, looking around the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowns at that and glares at the posters on the wall \"I should be, but I...urgah!\" she groaned in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it, I have a hard time getting a job myself...all my employers want to eat me alive.\" you said. \"Anything I could do to help you?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoko lets out a bittersweet chuckle at that \"Unless you're an agent or derector, then no, still...you are sweet to offer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" you said. \"Still...what could I do even if I wasn't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoko looks thoughtful for a few moments and you wonder what she's thinking, before she smiles as she looks down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I do feel rather lonely here by myself...you know, I think there's something you CAN do fir me after all...\" she said.</span></div></div>",

You were great.\" \"Thanks,\" you say. \"You weren't too bad yourself. I'm surprised up until now you were a stuntgirl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Maybe that will shut those neighbors up about my career.\" You smile because not only did you get away from Lupa, but you did a good thing for a friendly new neighbor. Of course, you would have to explain everything to Cadence later about being reduced to a pet for another monster but you figure it might not be so bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unfortunately something had to go horribly wrong, that diva Vivian Wong came forward and she was pissed as she glared at you and Koko. \"You got lucky,\" she said. \"For a beginner. It won't happen again. I am not about to lose the spotlight to this green hack and her pet human.\" Of course, you had a few words to say to her. \"I've heard just enough from you Viv.\" \"What was that?\" \"You heard me, you're nothing more than a territorial prima donna who's always taking credit for everything Koko does. For a jiang-shi, you're not very good at fighting. I'll bet that you'd even lose a fight to a ghost. You can't act, you can't fight, all you can do is look good and you can't even do that right. As far as I'm concerned you are a disgusting $*)#@% beast bitch.\" Vivian was fuming mad and even pulled on her hair before moving the card over her face to show you her angry red eyes. Vivian hisses at you, but you just nod your head and mutter hmph because you didn't regret what you said and with that you and Koko were walking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think anyone would stand up to Vivian like that. You've got guts for such a little guy.\" You let out a laugh. \"Up until now I thought that Nefernina was the meanest monster in Horrorville but that blue chick proved me wrong. Oh she did.

You've got a heart and that helps your career big time.\" Koko then brings you up to her face to kiss you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did you know that Vivian knew somebody in your apartment, in the same neighborhood as Koko. This was Layla, a dullahan, a type of monster whose head wasn't attached to her body. Koko told you that one of her other neighbors, Bianca, believed that Layla was a professional killer but Koko assured you that it wasn't true. Unfortunately, Koko had no idea just how wrong she really was and Vivian was on the phone with Layla right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're not hiring me to go after that other jiang shi Viv,\" says Layla's head as her body sharpens a knife. \"That's not possible. I don't do the undead. If I could kill the undead, you think that Nefernina would still be breathing down my neck... if I had one?\" \"No,\" says Vivian. \"I'm after that human she used to buy her way to the top. We'll teach her a lesson by getting her precious pet human out of the way. Be careful though. As much as I hate to admit it Koko knows some martial arts.

I don't think so...if anyone tries to take you away, there'll be hell to pay...intrest included!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and relax, giving the green-skinned jiang-shi a greatful smile, missing the headless dullahan's eyes following you as Koko hopped through the lobby.</span></div></div>",

Oh, right, I'm the part with all the brains.\" \"Layla?\" asks Koko. \"What are you doing. Layla picks up her head and you see that had it not been the magic hallway you're in making monsters titanic, her head alone would only be 50 feet tall but the hallway made it much bigger than her body was when it began and having a city sized severed head in front of you left you scared enough to run up your owner's sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna make this as easy as possible,\" says Layla. \"Hand me the human.

You saw those moves in action during the shooting but you didn't think you'd see them for real combat and against a dullahan as well. Layla's head grit her teeth and her body got up before inching towards Koko but Koko gave a sly smile. \"Here catch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoko looked like she was going to throw Layla's head and Layla's body went to try and catch it but Koko pulled back her arm and dropped Layla's head on the ground. \"Ouch!\" It was at this point Layla's body picked up a knife and you screamed. But before Layla's body could do anything else one of the doors opened up and hit the body to knock it down. It was a Kitsune woman that walked out completely obviously to the assassin she had just clobbered. Layla's body wound up in turn tripping and falling down a flight of stairs before landing with a crash. Layla let out an annoyed grunt. \"I'm sending you my hospital bill Janine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Koko picks Layla up by the nostrils as the head lets out a groan. \"Time to teach you a lesson for trying to hurt my friend.\" Koko takes Layla to the laundry room and puts her head in the washing machine. \"Isn't this a little extreme Koko?\" you ask. \"R.L.,\" says Koko. \"Layla kills people for a living. She's not getting any less than she deserves.\" \"You wouldn't dare turn that thing on.\" But Koko gives a vicious smile and turns on the washing machine as Layla lets out a scream and goes through a very violent spin cycle. You know how that felt. One time Bernice accidentally knocked you in with her laundry and you caught a cold because of it. But now Layla was getting it and from the expressions you could see from her bodiless head, she wasn't enjoying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Koko lets Layla out, Layla is coughing and even spits up bubbles. \"Have you had enough.\" \"I give, I give.\" \"Maybe we should tell Petra there's a killer under this roof. \"No don't! I once assassinated an ambassador! If Petra gets her claws on me, I'll go to jail for life and since I'm undead, that's a really, really long time.\" \"Then leave R.L. alone. Capiche?\" Layla lets out a groan. \"Capiche.\" Koko then places Layla's head on top of a washing machine before she walks away. \"You could at least take me to the part of me that's in traction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh of relief. You're really glad that you're not going to be killed by a jiang-shi giantess anytime soon. \"Thanks Koko,\" you say. \"Maybe being your... ugh... your pet won't be so bad.\" Koko simply smiles and strokes your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now.</span></div></div>",

Shes locked up in her cell 24/7 because otherwise shed attack the other inmates and has even gone after the guards. Persephone considers herself a gourmet among cannibals and was known for cooking her victims. However, she wont pass off a yummy human. Because of her vicious appetite, Under Gloom's warden, Destiny, put a muzzle on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArethusa, alias, the doomsday dragon. A European dragoness with orange brown scales, ram like horns and long blonde hair. Arethusa was imprisoned for manufacturing deadly bombs that were used for murder. She was very reclusive and will breathe fire on anyone dumb enough to come close to her cell, even the guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri, a titanic obese gorgon with blue pythons for hair. Yuri is the most dangerous monster in the entire prison. A deranged serial killer who abused her gorgon eyes to kill over one hundred monsters so she could mutilate their stone corpses for her own twisted amusement. Upon her imprisonment Yuri was fitted with a visor to negate her petrifying gaze. As sadistic as she is towards monsters, Yuri has been known to grab any human unfortunate enough to get close to her cell with her snake hair to either eat or torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakuya, a black spider drider resembling a pale skinned child despite being an adult. Sakuya committed every crime known to monster and human alike, but instead of giving her the death penalty, she was attached to a machine that puts her in an endless coma so she'd live out the rest of her natural life dreaming. However, the device can attach to humans to put them in her dreamworld and dying in the dream means dying in reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...you all know what to do. Find and erase that human and the green-skinned upstart...by any means you deem necessary.\" Vivian said coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe criminals all grinned bloodthirstily at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n======<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoko smiled at you as she took you to a Chinese Culture Festival. It was just a small little thing, but you had to say you were actually enjoying it. Besides, it helped you learn about your new friend a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was always welcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you and Koko sat down to eat a meal of moo goo gai pan mixed with braised conpoy scallops and broccoli with pineapple fried rice and sweet and sour orange kung pao chicken, however, a loud series of terrified screams reached the two of you and utter pandemonium broke out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at the center of it all, enjoying and clearly basking in the utter chaos their mere presence caused, were a giant centaur with the lower body of a quagga, a titanic grizzly werebear that was missing left eye, a white werewolf with a muzzle on her, an European dragoness with orange brown scales, ram like horns and long blonde hair, a titanic obese gorgon with blue pythons for hair, and a black spider drider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoko paled. \"N...No way!\" she shouted at the sight of them all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the panic-stricken mob ran through the area, the table you and Koko were at was knocked over and as you hit  the ground you're knocked out from the impact and the giant centaur with the lower body of a quagga snatched you up in her hand.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Being a jiang-si and therefore already undead, the assault isn't lethal, but Koko is still in pain. Ursula turns to face Arethusa who is throwing bombs to destroy what's left of the festival while Persephone is busy eating the corpse of a pandaren she had killed. \"We got what we came for, let's go.\" Sakuya crawls up to Ursula and gives a pout. \"But I'm not done playing!\" she yells as she shakes blood off three of her spider legs. Yuri glares at Sakuya as her snakes let out a hiss. \"Don't forget Sakuya,\" she says. \"Just because you committed the most crimes doesn't mean you're the most dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne dragon gets up and he tries to fight off the criminals with his fire breath but Yuri smirks and turns around before she takes off her sunglasses, giving the dragon a view of her deadly eyes. The dragon gives out a dying scream as he's turned into stone. Yuri then takes off the head and gives a sadistic laugh as she puts her glasses back on. Persephone lets out a growl. \"What did you do that for you Yuri?\" asks Persephone. \"Dragon meat is simply divine with white rice. I could've eaten that dragon.\" Arethusa's eyes pop and she glares at Persephone. Being a dragon, she found that statement obviously insulting. In retaliation Arethusa blows fire at Persephone and forces the albino werewolf to blow on her tail. \"Watch it dragon lips,\" she says. \"Or I'll eat you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't worry Persephone,\" says Ursula as that grizzly giantess scratches her stomach. \"We'll all get our chance with the little human.\" \"Well that Mariah better not try anything before we get there,\" says Sakuya. \"She's the only one of us who hasn't killed anything bigger than a human.\" Koko manages to escape by crawling behind an over turned stand as she panted. \"Hey,\" says Arethusa. \"Where's the other jiang-si she hired us to get as well.\" Koko gasps in her hiding spot and realizes just who hired those villains. \"Who cares?\" asks Ursula. \"We can get back to her later. We'll torture the human now.\" All those evil monsters laugh wickedly at their devious plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that time, Mariah brings you back to the hideout, which appears to be a closed bowling factory. Mariah lays you down on a table and looks down on you evilly as you shake. She looks like your centaur neighbor Zelda, except she has white and brown stripes on her horse body and her back legs are plain brown. You heard about Mariah from Petra, seeing as Petra was the one who arrested her. She was found guilty of rape against hundreds of monsters. While all centaurs were violent and raunchy, even they found her despicable because she would grab hold of random people without any warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah stares down at you and cracks an evil smirk. \"Wh-What do you want?\" \"Well, after that dullahan failed, Vivian sent for us.\" You gasp. \"Vivian Wong.\" \"You're pretty smart for a human,\" says Mariah with a vicious tone in her voice. \"We can do whatever we want to you. But I think I'll have my fun before the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're terrified at what plans Mariah has for you and then you see that rapist centaur turn around and point to her backside.  She gives you a threatening look and you step back. You knew what she was planning and try to run but Mariah blocks with her hand and smiles evilly.</span></div></div>",

But when it looks like Koko is about to answer the door, Layla jumps out and then slams Koko's head into the ground and makes her let out a grunt. \"Koko!\" you yell. But then Layla grabs you and pulls you up to her headless neck and you let out a gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLayla then holds her head in front of you and it towers over you like a skyscraper. \"Oh don't worry,\" she says evilly. \"She's just unconscious. I couldn't kill that jiang shi if I tried. But you on the other hand. Vivian Wong wants a little word with you.\" You gasp before Layla closes her hand sealing you inside. You're trembling as she walks out of the apartment. She is extra careful to avoid detection and passes Nefernina who appeared to have lost one of her eyes and was checking the ground. Layla leaps over Nefernina and Nefernina turns around to see Alicia walking by and assumes Alicia touched her before slapping the jabberwock in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Layla takes you to a Chinese style mansion, that must be where Vivian lives. Layla jumps up to the window and taps on the wall. Vivian walks up to her bedroom window and gestures for Layla to come in.

And I thought Nefernina had anger issues. It was just a few minor insults. You brought it on yourself badmouthing my friend.\" Then Vivian begins to squeeze you and makes you scream. \"Koko won't be coming to your rescue tonight human and neither will the zombie friend she mentioned. You will face the wrath of Wong. When I'm through with you, you'll wish that a monster had devoured you long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a gulp. This was it. Vivian was going to show you no mercy.

ANYBODY that was worse then Nefernina couldn't be reasoned with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now human...there are so many ways to torture you, I'm having trouble deciding, so I'll just start now.\" Vivian said, placing you on her middle finger's knuckle and then pinned your head down with her index finger under your chin and your legs under her ring finger, then started to attempt to raise her middle finger slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt like screaming as you felt your spine bending, about to snap, when the pressure vanishes as Vivian drops you.<br>\r\nAs you fell, Vivian kicked out and you are launced forward as you catch the tip of her toe, Vivian laughing hysterically. With a loud thud you bang your head against the wall, blood oozing from one of your temples. It wasnt enough to kill you but it sure hurt like hell. Ricochetings off of the wall you landed again with a thud on the hardwood floor. Groaning in pain you try to stand up but before you could raise yourself, you felt a series of booming thuds and when you raised your head, found Vivian's face inches from you, a smirk making its way along her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp as you look at the blue-skinned Jiang Shi. Mercy...? No, that wasn't it. She wanted to torture you, and if you die too quick, she'd be deprived of her fun. Vivian smirks at you and you find yorself wishing for Lupa, the werewolf was much MUCH more welcoming...and she wanted to eat you alive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww...is my little prisoner hurt?\" Vivian cooed mockingly \"GOOD! she reached down and picked you up and tossed you onto a cushion.you saw her butt heading for you. You closed your eyes as she landed on you. It was an odd sensation to be crushed by two soft objects. Thankfully it was this softness that prevented you from being reduced to a red smear. She must've felt you because she started bouncing around a bit, trying to get more comfy. And while you couldn't see it, she gathered up acupuncture needles. She stood and you look upas her free hand closed around you and put you on a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed as one of the needles she held was suddenly jammed into you left leg, somehow missing the bone...but that didn't nean it hurt any less!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian seemed to flourish and glow from the pain you were in due to her and jammed another needle into you, purposely missing you organs and bones, over and over again until she no longer had any. Then she roughly yanked them out of you, making you scream again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian leaned in close and saw you were fighting back tears of agony and threw back her head and laughed. She was loving this! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I never knew tormenting a bug like you could be so much fun!\" Vivian said, smiling down at you. \"So I hope you're ready for more playtime, my prisoner. Now that the warm-up's over.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour breath hisses through your teeth in agonized gasps as you look up at your tormentor.

Vivian gives an evil smile as she turns on the sink. Huge drops of water the size of meteors come down and hit you in the face as you cough. \"You ready to scream?\" asks Vivian. \"Ha,\" you say. \"Are you kidding. It's too slow. I can take it.\" Vivian then gives a wider smile and then turns the faucet handle and causes a huge jet stream of water to come down on you. \"Oh no!\" you yell. You let out a muffled scream as the water violently comes drown on you and swallow a lot of liquid as Vivian laughs again. You swallow so much water you cough more viciously than normal and because you're tapped over the drain, soon you're underwater. At least Vivian is decent enough to take you out before you drown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't this fun?\" she asks. \"No!\" you yell. \"It's pain!

You didn't know what kind of monster lived here, but she couldn't possibly be worse than a giant werewolf with a weight problem who would eat you alive on the spot. As soon as you're in a safe place, you let out a sigh and look around your new surroundings. You look up and see a sign that read \"No Men's Land\" on the door. \"Shouldn't that say No <i>Man's</i> Land?\" you ask. There weren't any male monsters in the entire building. Of course it would explain why Izzy has the hots for you. Then you turn to see photographs on the wall of several male monsters that had push pins inside of them. Perhaps coming here was a big mistake. The monster that lived here might very well be a misandrist<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly you hear a loud snoring noise and look up to see the monster resident was on the couch asleep. She was a large bluish gray skinned monster with a froglike face and large fangs visible from her open mouth. She had horns on her head in a horseshoe shape and a long dinosaur like tail covered in spikes. She had red hair and was wearing a gray loincloth and bra with white highlights. She had claws for hand, long bushy red hair and thick legs. She was noticeably fat but most of it went into her huge thighs. She was a type of monster called a Hodag which was a monster of American Folklore, but you didn't think they were actually real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk forward and see that because of this magic hallway, this Hodag was currently several miles high, you were less than an insect to her. You figure as long as she didn't know you were here, then you can hide from Lupa. Then you see the hodag girl was sleeping on her back and her tail was moving through the ground left and right.

You ponder this question to yourself as you continue to scale the hodag woman. As this hodag woman keeps snoring, you remember something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've heard of this hodag before. Cadence told you about her. Her name was Renee and she was a journalist for the Horrorville Haunter, the town newspaper. Cadence mentioned that Renee was the only woman working for the paper and as a result she was subject to a lot of sexual harassment. Cadence warned you that because of her constant sexual harassment at the hands of her coworkers and even her employer Renee developed a hatred of all men and didn't care what species. Monster and humans it didn't matter. Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. Thanks to this hallway, Renee was tens of miles bigger than you and with you being a man this was an undesirable position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you realize something. You were too small for Lupa to see. Maybe Renee couldn't see you either. Maybe this hodag woman wouldn't notice you. You let out a sigh of relief as you climb to the top. But then you look ahead and realize something. \"Huh? Wait? Is she exposed?\" You couldn't see her underwear. Maybe she wasn't wearing any.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you catch your breath after the shocking run in with Lupa, you curiously began to gaze upon the interiors of the strange apartment you just entered. Adorned about the inside of the living room was a vast array of towering furniture, as well as oriental decoration. The d\u00e9cor overall immediately gave hints of Japanese culture back on earth. Growing even more curious by the surrounding room, you soon began to explore about only to soon catch a glimpse of a framed photograph hanging on one of the walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith closer inspection the photo was that of an eastern dragon, a rather young one at about 13 years old. Unlike western dragons that seemed to carry scales over their body, this dragons body was completely covered by a light brown shade of fur. The sides of her snout appeared to have very small whiskers that barely made it down her neck, unlike the really long ones that most eastern dragons were famous for. 'Just who was this girl?' you thought. As you continued to gaze upon the picture, the sudden sounds of explosive booms and shaking floors immediately caught your attention. Having lived with monsters for quite a while, you knew all too well what was occurring. Someone was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith quick haste you began to turn your head about the living room trying to find some place to hide. After gazing about, the first thing that caught your sight was the small area underneath one of the sofas. With little hesitation, you sprint as fast as you can towards the lower opening before leaping straight underneath the massive furniture piece. Veiled under the shadows, you curiously peer out into the room in hopes of catching sight of the apartment owner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the tremors and booms began to grow much forceful and louder, a huge clawed foot soon stomps several yards away from you. Your eyes slowly peer upwards only to gaze in surprise at the sight. The owner of the house was none other than the dragon in the photo! if not a bit older at about 19 or 20. The whiskers on her face were still short as she was garbed in a sweater and shorts. Her eyes scanned about the area as if she was searching for something. Just then it hit you. Could she possibly be searching for you? Your heart nearly froze at the thought of being found out, especially since you had no idea whether or not she was friendly or hostile like Lupa. Your worries soon died away however as she soon bent down to pick up a tea cup from one of the tables and began to head off. With the coast clear, you soon make your way out from underneath the couch back into the light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now Lupa must have gone away, or so you hoped. Unsure whether it was safe to leave, you decide to try and peek underneath the door frame to catch any glimpse of Lupa's wolfish form. As you began to walk however, a sudden strange sensation began to overcome you. While it certainly didn't hurt, it was very tingly and odd to say the least. All about you, the surroundings slowly began to shrink slightly as you were back to your normal, albeit tiny size. As the strange sensation still emerged in your body, you unknowingly end up bumping onto a rather hard surface besides you. Quickly you look at the strange object to discover that you bumped into a rather loose pile of plates. To your horror, the sounds of shaking immediately cause your head to gaze upwards as you helplessly watch an ornate plate crash right onto the hard ground shattering into pieces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound certainly didn't go unnoticed as the sounds of huge footsteps sounded off once again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before you could even manage to get a few feet towards the doors bottom area, you suddenly feel your body become tangled up in a huge furred surface and hoisted skywards. Quickly, you turn your back only to gaze up in horror as the gargantuan dragoness was gazing down at your tiny form with a scowl on her face. Within a few seconds, you were lifted right before her colossal snout as her massive orbs stare sternly at you. while still wrapped up in what you discovered was the tip of her tail, your arms began to uncontrollably shake unsure just what this monster was planning to do to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"who are you?\" she asks with the scowl still glued upon her face. You try your best to try and reply, but the only thing your mouth managed to do was clatter nervously. \"Who are you?\" she asks once more in a much more irritated yet stern tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm R.L!\" you quickly reply as your body continued to shake, unsure if she was waiting for the right time to simply drop you to the floor or force something even worse upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"what is it that you are doing in my house?\" She continues to question as her expression became even more agitated with each passing second. Without any hesitation at all, you explain your run in with Lupa and how you had no choice but to enter her apartment or become a snack to the gluttonous canine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it might sound like an unlikely story, but you have to trust me!\" You beseech her, hoping that she wouldn't think of you as some sort of tiny liar or thief. While she did carry the very stern expression throughout your explanation, by the time you were finished, it seemed that her agitation began to die down slightly. Just then, the sound of a thud from outside emanated near the door frame as your tiny form was soon moved away from the coil of her tail and straight into her right hand. Luckily for you, she took care not to grip too much around your body as she made her way to the door frame. With the swiftest of movements, she swung the door wide open only to reveal Lupa hunched on the floor to the right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"o-oh!\" Lupa stammers with wide eyes as she gazes up at the dragoness. \"I see you're our new neighbor.\" she says while giving a toothy grin, almost as if she was trying her best to hide her true cruel nature. \"I heard a crash outside and came wondering what was going on.\" she explains as she soon stood up to her full height. To your shock, her eyes soon gaze upon your tiny form within the dragonesses hand. \"Oh! and I see you found the culprit!\" she says giving a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Culprit!?' you thought with wide eyes. Just what on earth was Lupa planning this time!?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"you know of this human?\" The Dragoness asks as she soon looks down upon you as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"but of course!\" Lupa says in a rather nonchalant tone along with a small downwards wave with her wrist. \"this little human here is a troublemaker for sure!\" she states in an accusing tone. A huge shudder of nervousness as well as rage build up inside you by her deceitful words. Was this her trick all along!? to make it seem like you're the terrible person who snuck into this dragonesses house!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's been causing plenty of trouble around the apartment complex, but most of all, He's been giving me the most trouble of all.\" Lupa says with a nod of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah right! if you call trying to run for your life to avoid getting eaten trouble making!' your mind shouts as you soon end up glaring up at Lupa's lying form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"tell you what.\" Lupa smiles before extending her furred hand towards the dragoness. \"how about you let me take him off your shoulders? that way I can deal with him...accordingly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupa's request immediately caused the shudders and shivers from before to return to your body. Your head quickly turns back up at the dragonesses face as she occasionally glanced down at your form. It seemed like your fate was within this clueless dragonesses hand.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once inside the confines of the apartment, you let out a long sigh of relief form your narrow escape from the ever so relentless hunger of Lupa. After regaining your composure from the mad dash, your eyes soon begin to wander about the interiors of the random apartment. To be honest, it looked just like any other normal home as expected. Couches decorated the inside of the living room, as a rather large, if not tacky looking rug decorated the middle area of the floor. Curiously, you begin to step a bit further inside the room, not wanting to see if Lupa was still out by the doorway waiting for an attempted escape. After only taking a few strides deeper inside the so called living room, to your sudden surprise a voice resonates from an open hallway to the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? who's there?\" a feminine voice asks from out of sight. Your eyes widen in surprise by the sudden question as you wondered whether or not the person she was asking was none other than you. But, that seemed completely impossible. At your size, there was no way someone like Candence could spot you from such a distance. Unless...Unless the monster that inhabited this very apartment was capable of catching the scent of something from afar so easily, almost like...a wolf? Your heart nearly freezes at the thought as the sudden sounds of footsteps began to close in towards your location. Without the least bit of hesitation, you quickly sprint with all your might to hide underneath one of the great chairs behind the supporting right leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin moments, the tremors and thunderous steps of the apartment inhabitant only grew much more stronger before you finally managed to catch a glimpse of a massive light brown paw slam down mere yards away from you. If the sight of the paw wasn't enough, then what happened next was enough to nearly give you a heart attack. In just seconds, a gargantuan wolfish head soon lowered downwards upon the wooden floor sideways, as if examining your whereabouts. Luckily for you though, her eyes didn't manage to lock down upon your miniscule form as she scanned under the chair frame. As her eyes darted all about the shadowy area, her huge black nose would continuously inhale, as if trying to track down your scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're here.\" she says with a slightly raised brow. \"a wolves nose never lies. and judging by your smell...you're really close by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe news of her knowing just where you were nearly froze your blood as you try your best to remain perfectly still in your hiding place.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"come on.\" she says in a rather surprisingly warm tone. \"If you come out now, then I won't call the authorities on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes suddenly grow by her sudden threat. Now that she mentioned it, what you were doing was basically intruding within someone else's home, and not knowing the many different laws incorporated within this Monster society could easily be considered a great offense to a human being like you. Not wanting to deal with the police, you reluctantly begin to walk your way out of your hiding place right towards her huge face. As you slowly make your way closer to the massive wolfess, her great green eyes begin to widen upon viewing your body. It wasn't too long before you were standing only a couple yards away from her massive snout. As you gaze upon her, a nervous shudder quickly runs down your entire body unsure if this wolfess was the equivalent of Lupa or terrifying enough, worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwkwardly enough, seconds of nothing but pure silence began to pass by as the two of you were staring straight within each other eyes. It wasn't too long however before the silence was ultimately broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"a-a....a human?\" She stammers ultimately shocked and dazed by your appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"y-yeah?\" You reply as the nervous shudders continued to course about your entire body, unsure just what this mighty canine planned on doing next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your ultimate surprise, her somewhat stupefied expression quickly changed into that of surprise and amazement as a smile soon begins to form upon her muzzle. \"r-really?\" she stammers once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you nod your head as your nervous state soon began to die down and become replaced by confusion. Did this massive werewolf ever encounter a human being before? Then again, there was no telling just where she originally came from in this monster populated world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile on her furred face quickly began to grow in size upon confirmation of your species as she lets out what could only be considered a squeal of excitement. \"I cant believe it! A human being! A REAL human being!\" she says in an excited tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour confusion soon flew off the deep end by her sudden outburst of happiness. \"errr...\" you mutter unsure just what to say to this excited wolfess. \"errr...not to sound rude or anything, but what's so special about a human?\" you ask, hoping deep down that it didn't have anything to do with being a delicacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolfess soon gets down on all fours in a pose that almost resembled a pouncing position while keeping her eyes glued to you. \"errr...sorry about that.\" she chuckles awkwardly while giving an awkward grin. \"this is my first time encountering a human being.\" she admits in a slightly abashed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"w-well...there's a first for everything.\" you awkwardly chuckle as your tenseness begins to dwindle down by her odd friendly behavior. \"but...why be so excited about seeing a human? I mean, compared to you monsters we're not exactly that great.\" To tell the truth, it did hurt a bit to say something so demeaning about your very species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't say that!\" she quickly says with wide eyes. \"I've been interested in human beings for years now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For... years?\" Just what was up with this strange wolfess? \"errr...If I may ask, just why are you so interested in humans?...I-I mean...I-it doesn't have to do with taste does it?\" a nervous tingle runs down your spine by your second question, unsure if she planned on using you for some sort of snack or worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh no no no no no!\" she quickly shakes her head, as her rather long silver hair gently swayed behind her head. \"Well...you see...\" she stammers while averting her eyes slightly abashed. \"I'm well...sort of an enthusiast when it comes to humans.\" she admits with a small chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An enthusiast?\" you raise a brow unsure by just what she could mean by the word enthusiast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I mean, you human beings are so interesting!\" she says as the grin quickly reappears on her face. \"Despite your really tiny size...e-errr no offense, there's just so much I want to learn about you!\" she states as her large furry tail begins to swish back and forth happily behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just couldn't believe it. This strange tenant, who is the exact same species as that gluttonous evil being Lupa, was interested about you. Well to be specific more towards your species in general. A great wave of relief soon washes down your body seeing as how this giant monster seemed to pose no threat towards you at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I didn't introduce myself.\" she says before slowly reaching her hand towards you and extending her pinky finger. \"I'm Gabriella Snapper.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, you gently grasp her huge pinky and shake it firmly. \"R.L.\" you reply as a small smile draws upon your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, R.L. pleased to meet you.\" Gabriella says as she closes her eyes and gives a warm smile. \"anyways, just how did you get in my apartment?\" she asks curiously with a slightly tilted head. You soon begin to explain your encounter with Lupa and just how you managed to stumble within her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's terrible!\" Gabriella says as she covers her mouth slightly with her left hand. \"It must be extremely tough to live in someplace inhabited with monsters like that wolfess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"you can say that again...\" you mutter under your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well...seeing as how we just got acquainted, I'd be more than happy to take you back to your apartment.\" she says with a small nod to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"really?\" you gaze up at her with a grateful smile. \"I'd really appreciate that Gabriella.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh please, just call me Gabby.\" she says with a small giggle. \"but.\" she interjects with her index finger pointing upwards. \"you could...well, stay here if you'd like.\" she says rather awkwardly. \"t-that is if you'd want!\" she stammers. \"I mean, I wouldn't mind learning more about you human beings while you stay here.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Seeing as How Gabby was kind enough to not eat you in plain sight, and fearing that Lupa could be out waiting for an ambush to get you, you ultimately decide to spend some time with Gabby. \"well, it wouldn't hurt to stay a bit longer.\" you say as you slowly begin to walk your way towards her huge face. In front of you, Gabby's smile grew exponentially as if she was trying her best to contain a squeal of excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"a-alright then.\" she says before gingerly lowering her open hand right besides you. \"hop aboard, I promise I wont drop you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...would really appreciate if you didn't.\" you reply with a rather nervous chuckle. Due to your even tinier size, it was much more cumbersome to try and clamber your way upon the giantesses hand. Luckily for you, her soft fur made the ascension much more tolerable, considering that you had plenty of tufts to grab on to. After a couple seconds passed by, you soon managed to clamber your way upon the center of her padded, leathery palm. As you position yourself into a sitting position, Gabby gently stood upwards letting you get a good scale of just how huge her and her apartment room was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh! we'll have to make a quick detour before talking.\" she says as she begins to make her way to the room she was previously in before your intrusion. As you gaze through the doorway, you discover the room to be none other than the apartments kitchen. After taking a few more steps, Gabby stops before the kitchen s counter to fetch up a pair of square rimmed spectacles. Carefully she places them upon her snout as the were soon adorned before her orbs. Her eyes soon gaze down at you as a grin forms on her face. \"You certainly do look like the ones in the books.\" she says with a small chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"wait...you mean... you couldn't see me?\" you ask somewhat surprised that only up until now when she put on those glasses could she get a good view of your appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yup.\" Gabby nods with the smile still on her face, though in a somewhat awkward fashion. \"My eyes aren't really that good.\" she chuckles causing you to lightly shake on her palm. So that sort of explains why she was having trouble trying to spot you underneath the chair. \"Anyways\" se interjects before making her way back to her living room. \"mind if I ask you some questions?\" she asks curiously. \"I-I mean, there's just so much I want to know about you humans!\" she beamed excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were nearly taken aback by just how excited she was, but to the best of your abilities try to remain composed. \"sure, ask away!\" you say wit a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Gabby began talking, the questions were relatively easy to answer. Questions ranging from, 'how is it like being so small?' to 'how is it without having any fur?' were pretty easy to answer considering this was coming from your viewpoint, though it wasn't too long before she began asking about life on Earth. To the best of your ability you began to explain all you could to her about how it was like back in the human world. Several times, Gabby's eyes would widen like a child listening to some sort of fairy tale story. As the two of you continue with the conversation, you too began to learn more about the monster world as well. Things like unique types of games, to even a bit of geography were brought up that you just couldn't help but ask more about. Soon enough though, time began to fly by as minutes soon turned to several hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"are you serious?\" Gabby says while bursting out in a fit of laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yeah!\" you reply as you end up joining in on the laughter. \"some movies back on earth are just that terrible!\" you state recalling several times when so called 'amazing' movies would only turn out becoming flops. After finally managing to catch your breath, your eyes avert to the right only to gaze upon the wall clocks hands. 9:30 pm. \"wow...time really does fly.\" you mutter as Gabby soon turns her attention to the clock as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yeah.\" she nods before gazing down at your tiny form once again. \"well...thank you so much for explaining all that to me.\" she says giving a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"no prob Gabby.\" you reply while getting up in a standing stance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R.L.\" she says with a slightly tilted head. \"mind if we...talked again sometime later?\" she asks in an almost pleading tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as how you just made a new monster friend, how could you refuse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Gabby.\" you nod your head with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe great Wolfess returns a great smile back upon your tiny form. \"alright then, shall I take you back to your apartment?\" she asks.</span></div></div>",

It did seem like a much safer bet of reaching your apartment with Gabby's help, especially when the other tenants of the apartment could easily crush you at such a small size. Slowly, The gargantuan wolfess rises upwards taking extra care not to shake her right hand in the process to through you off balance. After a few seconds, Gabby soon stood on her two legs and began to make her way to her apartments doorway. With a twist of the door knob, she started walking her way outside into the apartment complex. Once out in the open however, a great sense of dread began to envelop your mind as you feared that Lupa could be anywhere waiting to strike. After months of experience, it seemed no matter where you were around the apartments she still managed to catch your scent. As you turn your head about nervously to spot any sign of the evil wolfess, your attention was soon diverted as Gabby began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...thanks again for talking with me.\" she says while giving a small if not awkward smile on her muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"not a problem.\" you reply as your eyes soon turn to focus upon her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it must've been quite...well... strange to encounter a crazed wolfess like me.\" she chuckles while using her free hand to scratch the sides of her ears. \"I mean, it must sound extremely strange for a human to meet a monster who is really intrigued by humans...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't call it weird.\" You reply as you give a small shrug of your shoulders. \"I mean, when it comes to monsters like werewolves the first thing that pops in mind to a lot of us humans are how ferocious and hungry they are...err..no offense.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"none taken.\" Gabby giggles lightly at the comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"and to be honest, I'm actually really grateful that I managed to encounter someone who's...well, unbiased when it comes to humans.\" While they were indeed some neutral tenants within the apartment complex, you were just glad that there was another member to add to the list. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you gaze up at Gabby, you can't help but spot a small shade of pink beginning to form underneath the valley of fur on her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"even if this unbiased monster is a bit different compared to others?\" she asks with a chuckle as she closes her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"eh, There's nothing wrong with being different.\" you add as Gabby's eyes began to grow slightly from the comment. Soon enough, a warm expression grows on her face as she gives a quick nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks R.L.\" she says in a sincere manner. \"Hey! maybe next time we meet we could watch a movie at my place?\" Gabby Muses already thinking about the next meet up. \"I have plenty of movies from romance to action...errr..mainly action and the like.\" she chuckles abashedly causing you to lightly bounce about her leathery padded palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"sounds like a good idea to me.\" you reply as a smile draws upon your face. Just as your nerves were beginning to calm after the small chat, a sudden voice towards the left causes you to jump in shear surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you were here R.L.\" Lupa's voice says in an almost satisfied tone. \"I could never forget your scent no matter what.\" Moments after the words, the rather large Wolfess soon steps underneath one of the hallway lights before Gabby and you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Gabby asks with a raised brow. While she didn't express it. you could easily tell by the look of Gabby's eyes that she didn't trust Lupa one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! we didn't meet before did we?\" Lupa says smiling warmly as she walks her way towards Gabby. \"Call me Lupa. I'm so sorry I couldn't introduce myself earlier. I mean, how rude is it to not get acquainted with a fellow werewolf?\" she says giving a toothy smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Gabby.\" Gabby introduces herself in a rather calm yet stern tone as her hand, along with you, begin to move closer to her body. Lupa immediately notices her actions as her huge eyes gaze down upon your miniscule form. Just by making contact with Lupa's huge orbs, you could see the obsessed hunger she has towards you. \"oh! I see you've met the human of this apartment complex.\" Lupa muses as she lowers her head slightly to get a better look at you.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yes...I have.\" Gabby says as she brings your tiny form even closer towards her so that you were now against the fabric of her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief moment of silence Lupa spoke once more. \"well?\" she asks with a tilted head as she raises her head up to stare at Gabby with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yes?\" Gabby asks as she gazes at Lupa ultimately confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"aren't you going to eat him?\" Lupa asks. \"It's customary for a wolf to eat it's prey once they manage to catch it, and...lucky you.\" Just by the final comment, it seemed as though Lupa sounded pained for not being able to eat you...that or she made it sound that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabby stares at Lupa with slightly wide eyes by the question before taking a second to regain her composure. \"I don't think so.\" she replies ultimately shocking Lupa by the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...come again?\" Lupa asks with a stupefied, if not priceless, expression glued upon her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I don't think so.\" Gabby repeats as Lupa continues to stare in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ah! I see, just saving him for later then?\" Lupa asks as she tries her best to collect herself from the comment. \"I mean, you could have him for a snack anytime soon, so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to eat him.\" Gabby quickly states in a stern tone before Lupa even had a chance to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"w-what?\" Lupa stammers in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't eat him and that's that. Now if you'll excuse me.\" Gabby says in an annoyed tone as she began to walk her way past Lupa. As you gaze up at the fiendish werewolf, a look of complete shock and disbelief was adorned on her face as her head turns to follow Gabby's form. Without a single word, Gabby continued to make her way downwards the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While it did seem like the trouble was all over, A sudden yelp escapes Gabby as she suddenly finds her form falling forwards towards the floor. With the swiftest of movements, the giant werewolf closes her hand into a light fist around R.L. to insure his safety from the imminent fall. Within the confines of Gabby's closed fist, R.L. soon found gravity shifting his body upwards against her padded fingers as her massive form began to descend towards the ground. In a mere second, both end up colliding onto the rough surface of the apartments outer hall. While such a blow would have been fatal to a human like R.L., whether it was luck or Gabby's quick thinking, he was miraculously unscathed from the fall. Quickly, he gets up into a sitting position within Gabby's fist trying to collect himself from the terrifying event. As he attempted to calm his nerves however, a sudden yelp from above causes him to leap in shock. There was no doubt who was the provoker of the sudden plummet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know...you're really something.\" Lupa says in a completely annoyed tone as her furred foot was placed firmly upon Gabby's back. \"here you are with the chance of a lifetime...A chance I have been waiting months for...and you reject it.\" A pained cringe begins to emerge on Gabby's face as Lupa began to apply more pressure upon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"s-so what!?\" Gabby shouts while trying her best to catch her breath from the sudden stomp. \"He's a living being just like us! no...he's more than that, he's my friend!\" she shouts. \"why would some voracious werewolf like you want him so bad!?\" she interjects while turning to glare back at the attacking Lupa. \"why not just stuff your face with some werepig instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an irritated expression overtaking her face, Lupa lifts her leg up in the quickest of motions before stomping once more. \"oh that's rich!\" Lupa growls. \"A werewolf, lecturing another werewolf about what to eat. Listen up pup! meat is apart of my lifestyle...our lifestyles! everyday we werewolves eat some helpless creature, so what's so wrong about eating a human?\" Lupa asks as she began to kneel down before the back of Gabby's head. \"don't fool yourself over 'friendship' with other species, they're nothing but snacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"to you... but not me!\" Gabby interjects as she quickly rams the back of her head against Lupa's snout full force. A yowl of pain escapes Lupa as she quickly places her hands before her snout and backs away. Taking the brief moment of freedom, Gabby quickly gets up on her feet before opening her hand to gaze at R.L's tiny form. \"sorry R.L...\" she says in a quick and stammering voice. \"but this is for your own safety.\" Before R.L. could even get the opportunity to ask what she meant, Gabby quickly pulls his body closer towards her body without hesitation. With wide eyes, he watches as his werewolf companion begins to open the collar of her shirt and bring his body towards the opening. In a swift movement, R.L is sent straight into the shirt towards Gabby's huge bosoms where his small form lands within the crevice between the werewolf's breasts. A massive shade of red fills R.L.'s face as the warm soft fur of Gabby's body surrounded his entire body. The light source within the shirt was soon sealed off as Gabby retracted her finger allowing the collar to snap close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bitch!\" Lupa snarls as she quickly leaps upon Gabby ferociously. No sooner did Lupa strike did the two werewolves begin to brawl. Within Gabby's shirt, R.L finds himself being tossled all about from the movements, yet still tries his best to remain in place firmly between the huge mammaries. Gabby, knowing full well what Lupa desired, snapped and clawed at the wolfess trying her best to prevent her from claiming her so called 'snack'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give him here!\" Lupa demands as she returns a flurry of swipes and snaps upon Gabby's form in a seemingly desperate attempt in claiming R.L.. To her growing annoyance though, Gabby continuously returned attacks and blocks having no intent at all in granting her desire.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Gabby and Lupa continued their skirmish with one another, R.L. felt like he was on the verge of losing his lunch by how quick and dizzying the movements were within Gabby's shirt. To him it almost felt like a roller coaster ride, one that was filled with countless loops and dips with virtually no sign of stopping. As R.L was attempting his best to remain firmly within the werewolf's cleavage, outside Lupa was trying her best to catch any sight of R.L. upon her opponent. While she could definitely smell his familiar aroma emanating from around Gabby's form, she still couldn't pinpoint his exact whereabouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give him here before I actually hurt you!\" Lupa threatens as Gabby quickly takes the opportunity to kick her stomach back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said no!\" Gabby exclaims as her entire form almost appeared to be riddled with bruises and cuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Persistent little bitch.\" Lupa snarls before leaping to tackle the downed werewolf once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin Gabby's shirt, a sudden impact from outside suddenly causes R.L to get propelled straight out of the firm safety of Gabby's cleavage. In a mere instant, he soon finds himself upon the soft warm fur that adorned Gabby's abdomen before another quick blow from outside causes him to fly upwards from the impact. After an inelegant landing back on the fur, R.L. looks upwards at the fabric of the shirt mortified. If he remained too long in one specific area, then there was no doubt that he would end up a mere stain on Gabby's fur. With shaking legs, he furiously begins to make a mad dash down the plain of fur, hoping to luckily escape on to the Apartment floors. Just as he was nearing the mid section of the stomach however, a sudden turn of Gabby's body causes him to end up tumbling straight towards the midsection of her abdomen. Just as things couldn't get worse, a sudden blow from Lupa outside propels him upwards once more towards the fabric of the shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was airborne, R.L. clenches his eyes close bracing for the impact upon Gabby's body. As expected, he soon lands upon the soft fur of her belly which luckily manages to break his fall. Just when he thought the worse was over briefly, another sudden twist from Gabby causes him to tumble his way downwards. Unable to get any good bearing from the quick movements, R.L was at the mercy of gravity to guide him. After what seemed like minutes to him, R.L was suddenly ceased in movements as he was soon cast in a dark and unfamiliar area. While he could still feel the many movements and attacks emanating from around him, for some odd reason there didn't seem o be so much movement wherever he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two wolves continued fighting, a sudden shout from nearby quickly broke up the duel. \"What's going on here!?\" a feline figure demands as she makes her way within the light of the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of all the people...\" Lupa mutters as she glares upon Patsy's form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you making so much ruckus?\" Patsy demands with an irritated scowl on her face. \"and just what the hell do you think you're doing to this girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of your business.\" Lupa spat as she slowly albeit painfully rises up into a standing position. \"Why don't you just go inside and continue working on that stupid bike of yours?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatsy was not the least bit impressed by her words as she makes her way towards the large wolfess and pokes her neckline with a clawed finger. \"Now you listen here you pudgy bitch! Don't think I heard you starting this whole thing.\" she threatens causing Lupa's eyes to widen slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm proof of you assaulting a fellow tenant, and I'm pretty sure that's enough to get your fat ass evicted from this place faster than you can eat a whole cow.\" she states with glaring eyes. \"Now why don't you do what's best and make your way home with your tail between your legs puppy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a growl Lupa immediately swipes Patsy's finger away from her body as she begins to limp away from the two. As the large wolfess took her leave, Patsy soon turns her attention towards the other sitting upon the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright?\" the feline asks before extending a supportive hand towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"y-yes.\" Gabby nods before slowly accepting Patsy's hand and making her way upwards. \"t-thanks for the help.\" she stammers as she stands while occasional winces of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it.\" Patsy says while examining her body. \"Looks like she really did a number on you.\" she states gazing upon the many injuries adorning the werewolf's body. \"speaking of which, just what happened?\" she asks with a tilted head. \"I could clearly tell Lupa started the fight by her annoying voice alone, but just what caused her to suddenly start attacking you?\" Patsy questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she was trying to get R.L while-\" a quick gasp escapes Gabby's mouth as she momentarily forgot about the safety of her human companion. \"R.L!\" she shouts before looking down her body in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R.L?\" Patsy cocks her head to the side utterly confused. \"you mean that human who lives here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Gabby answers as she quickly peeks within the collar of her shirt trying to spot any form of her human friend inside. \"Lupa was trying to get R.L. so I hid him for safety.\" she quickly adds as a small bout of nervous whimpers began to emerge. \"R.L, where are you!\" Gabby asks still feverishly gazing within her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was still within the dark unknown area, R.L managed to hear the whole conversation between Patsy and Lupa. As the banter ended, a large sigh of relief escapes him as the fight soon came to a conclusion. After a few sudden movements, no doubt from Gabby, he was soon shocked to hear his name being called from above. \"I'm fine!\" he shouts as loud as he could from within the dark confines of his location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabby's ears immediately poke upward by the sound of the familiar voice. \"R.L!  are you alright?\" she asks in an agitated tone still searching for his whereabouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine!\" R.L. replies as loud as he could causing a great sense of relief to wash down the wolfess's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you?\" she asks as she continues scanning from within the collar of her shirt, even going as far as looking at the apartment floors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to ask you the same thing.\" R.L replies still snugly placed within his odd safe haven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to move around a bit.\" Gabby insists. \"that way it'll be easier to spot or feel you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcknowledging her words, R.L begins to squirm as much as he could from his odd dark area, hoping Gaby would be able to tell where he was. Above, an audible yelp escapes Gabby's mouth as her eyes begins to widen in surprise. A dark shade of red begins to form on her furred face as she began to feel a small sensation emerging from slightly below the insides of her shorts waistband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"can you feel me?\" R.L asks unsure if Gabby can notice him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"y-yeah...\" Gabby stammers as the blush grew deeper on her face while averting her eyes downwards. Slowly she looks at Patsy who gazes at her with wide eyes and an awkward expression glued on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"errr...go ahead.\" Patsy says before turning so that her back was facing Gabby. With little reluctance Gabby reaches her hands downwards to open up the waistband of her shorts. From R.L's perspective, a great beam of light quickly emanates from above his location as he soon finds himself slipping downwards an odd pink surface. As his body finally ceased it's descent by a wall behind him, he soon realizes that the odd wall of pink almost appeared like something akin to fabric. Not only that, but a rather strong warmth radiated from within the wall of pink. While gazing at the odd surface, a shadow quickly catches his attention as he was soon enveloped in a furred surface, no doubt Gabby's hand. As his body was hoisted upwards, his eyes quickly widen in shock as he finally catches a glimpse of where he was hiding for the time being. The glimpse of Gabby's panties was enough to form a crimson shade upon his face as he was soon lifted upwards towards the face of the massive wolfess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Was I in?\" R.L. stammers finding it hard to believe where he was the whole time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah.\" Gabby replies with complete honestly as the deep blush remains on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...this was quite a night.\" Patsy says as she slowly turns to face the two. \"anyways, do you need a lift to the hospital?\" she offers. \"I haven't used my motorcycle for a whole day now and it must be getting lonely down there.\" Gabby turns to look at Patsy who slowly gives a long stretch followed by a small groan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Gabby simply lowers her eyes down upon his form before giving a simple nod of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yeah...\" she mutters as she cringes slightly from an open cut down near her right thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is it a yes or no?\" Patsy asks as she finishes up her stretch followed by a small sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a yes.\" Gabby replies as she brings R.L's form closer towards her neckline for safety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, give me a second.\" Patsy replies as she makes her way down the hall a few yards to enter her apartment. After around a minute or so, the ginormous cat woman soon reappears under the slightly flickering light of the hallway. Garbed in a leather jacket and carrying an extra helmet o her left hand, she begins to make her way back towards the two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since when did you have two helmets?\" R.L asks in confusion remembering countless times when Patsy adorned the same helmet for weeks straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, a biker's always gotta be prepared.\" Patsy replies while giving a nonchalant shrug before handing the spare helmet to Gabby. \"here you are. Hopefully it'll fit your head and not slide off when we're out on the road.\" Accepting the helmet, Gabby carefully begins to strap the safety headgear on as her and Patsy began to make their way to the apartments parking lot. Waiting in it's everyday area, waxed and shining with the lights of the sky high moon was Patsy's pride and joy. \"Miss me?\" She says with a smile while approaching her beloved motorcycle. While R.L did see Patsy with her motorcycle from quite a distance away, it was quite odd to see her talking to the two wheeled vehicle. In truth, he didn't know whether or not she had a great love for the biker lifestyle, or if she was completely fixated on her motorcycle alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"climb aboard, and make sure not to scratch or bend anything.\" Patsy states as she positions herself upon the seat of her motorcycle. Whether or not she was joking or being serious though was a complete mystery. As soon as Gabby sits down behind the cat biker, Patsy revs up her bike causing a loud almost thunderous roar to escape from the exhaust pipes. In no time at all, the three were soon driving down the freeway. While the speed of Patsy's driving was questionable, Gabby did make sure to keep a steady grip on R.L's tiny form while steadying herself as well. After around half an hour, the three soon made it to the closest hospital available in the area.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gabby was busy getting her injuries checked out, Patsy and R.L were sitting upon a row of chairs within the hospitals waiting room. For R.L, it felt extremely awkward as well as nerve wracking to sit next to another tenant of the apartment he knew very little about. While he was aware of how playful cats were back where he was from, he had absolutely no idea how a monster cat, let alone one the size of a multi-storied building would interact with him. Sitting with her arms and legs crossed, Patsy's eyes momentarily gaze down at R.L's nervous form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax shortstuff, she should be fine.\" she says in a tone mixed with humor and a hint of assurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patsy...\" R.L says before gazing up at her. \"...thanks for helping out back there.\" he says as a small smile began to form on the felines face followed by a small scoff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, don't mention it.\" she replies with a shrug of her shoulders. \"Besides, anyone who's an enemy to that bitch Lupa is a friend in my book.\" The comment does cause a small chuckle to escape R.L's throat before a doctor began to make their way to the two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you the two who brought in that wolfess?\" a white furred tigress asks while carrying a clipboard on her right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That we are.\" Patsy answers as she begins to get up from the chair. \"So, what's the news doc?\" she asks with a slightly tilted head.</span></div></div>",

While it was indeed a risky choice entering some random monster\u2019s home uninvited, it was one hundred percent better than trying to contend with Lupa. Upon finally making your way pass the humongous doorframe, a sudden huff from Lupa emanates from the opposite side of the entryway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t think this is over R.L.\u201d she states in an intimidating, yet clearly peeved voice. \u201cThe moment I see your tiny ass out again, you\u2019re snack food.\u201d With a low growl, the sudden sounds of rhythmic yet explosive booms fill your ears before faintly disappearing with each passing second. Once all was silent, a long exhale escapes your mouth as you once again managed to evade the gluttonous lupine. \u201cSheesh, won\u2019t she ever give up?\u201d you think to yourself, knowing all too well the impossibility of such a request. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were slowly beginning to regain some self-control from the frantic chase, a sudden current of hot air ends up blasting you from behind. The sudden warm sensation upon your body quickly switches your mindset back to tense as your body stiffens in sheer horror. A nervous sweat drop slowly begins to trail its way down from the temple of your head as each exhale becomes long and shaky with each passing breath. Here you were stuck in some monsters home, uninvited, with no idea whether or not they saw humans as some sort of treat or not. Despite the gigantic doorway being only a couple yards away from you, judging by how close the breathing was it would be an impossible escape to accomplish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral seconds begin to pass, as you remain as still as possible before the only means of escape. It was almost as if the monster behind you was relishing in your unfavorable predicament, chuckling in their mind over just how helpless you were in their midst. As your uncontrollable body remained firmly in place, a sudden sound manages to catch you completely off guard. Behind you, a feminine voice in an almost whisper like tone begins to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 that was daring.\u201d The female voice says with a small giggle to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201ch-huh?\u201d you stammer, surprised by the strange sentence. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d you ask as your tense body slightly begins to ease up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou escaping that werewolf.\u201d She replies in an almost astonished tone. \u201cSure you might be small, but it really seems like you know how to take care of yourself.\u201d <br>\r\nShe adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused and slightly abashed from her comment, you continue to remain in place, unsure if she was just playing around with words. \u201cWell\u2026do I have to worry about you?\u201d You stammer, uncertain of the response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s rude.\u201d She replies in an almost scolding tone. \u201cI\u2019m not harming you right now am I?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026there\u2019s no telling whether or not you will try later on.\u201d You retort as your eyes slowly avert towards the right in hopes of trying to catch some glimpse of the speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmmm\u2026\u201d she muses for a brief moment. \u201cWell\u2026you do have a point.\u201d She admits with a small titter. \u201cI mean who knows?\u201d She asks before you immediately notice a massive furry hand emerging from behind the left side of your body. Upon gazing at the huge limb, you immediately notice an orangish tinge adorned on the upper section of the hand mixed with black patterned stripes throughout. Just from common knowledge alone, the design was unmistakable. The very monster you were conversing with was none other than a Weretiger. \u201cMaybe I could just end you right here and now?\u201d She states before immediately retracting a claw from her pointer finger. The sight of the sharp nail was enough to cause a startled gasp to escape your mouth as your body instinctively shivers in terror over the idea. As you were near the verge of completely breaking down, a sudden guffaw erupts from behind which once again takes you aback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen again.\u201d She replies before retracting her claw, though leaving her hand in place. \u201cI\u2019m no killer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-That\u2019s g-good to hear\u2026\u201d you stammer, finding it hard to speak a clear sentence without repeatedly stuttering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, this conversation won\u2019t do.\u201d She says before you suddenly begin to notice her hand making its way straight towards you. In just a matter of seconds your entire body from under your neck was gently constricted by her soft furry grip as you feel your body being raised skywards. The trip up was almost the equivalent to that of an amusement park ride, with your stomach being shot down with such force that you were nearly on the verge of hurling. Despite this though, you managed to keep your composure before your movements soon came to a brief stop. As your eyes soon gaze upon the new angle, to your surprise you manage to finally catch the visage of the apartment\u2019s owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat emerald green eyes with black slits gaze in an almost mesmerizing state down at you as a massive tiger face took up nearly your entire view. Upon the crown of her head were rather long locks of pure silver hair that trailed downwards in a waterfall like motion. \u201cWhat?\u201d her voice sounds off, with a hint of playfulness. \u201cAm I too beautiful that you\u2019re at a loss for words?\u201d She asks while giving out a small giggle to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026you look nice.\u201d You reluctantly admit while mustering a weak smile, unsure if your choice of words were favorable in her view.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cCompliment accepted.\u201d She replies back while surprisingly returning the smile. \u201cNow then\u2026what is your name Human?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-R.L\u201d you quickly answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR.L\u201d The weretiger repeats while elongating the two letters with a grin. \u201cI\u2019m Fortuna.\u201d She introduces herself as a toothy smile emerges on her face, revealing her sharp fangs right before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-Nice to meet you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike wise.\u201d She replies back before a small purr begins to emerge from the depths of her throat.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You try to run but the wind keeps pushing down on you and you try to scream but quickly cover your mouth. If you make so much as a sound you're dead. Then, things get much, much worse. Lupa inhaled deeply and the current of air catches you as you try to grab hold of a carpet. Too bad the wind is too strong and you're heading right for her open maw. \"Crap.\" You whisper to yourself. You've heard of wolves blowing down houses, but this time a wolf was sucking you into her city sized mouth. If you didn't do something fast Lupa would finally swallow you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo survive you quickly grab hold of the very tip one of her skyscraper sized teeth. You manage to pull yourself to safety as the wind stops. Once Lupa has stopped inhaling, you slide down the toot towards her gums. As you hit the ground, you gag. Lupa's breath is horrible. It smells like death. When was the last time she brushed. As you stand up, you step on what you think is a rock but quickly realize it can't be. You look down in horror to see a skeletal foot lodged between Lupa's teeth. \"Hasn't that werewolf ever heard of dental floss?\" Of course you realize that Lupa doesn't exactly need dental floss because as you turn your head you see a claw coming towards you and move to dodge the incoming claw. At least now you know how Lupa picks her teeth. As she does so, her gaping tongue licks at the tooth, dangerously close to you. If Lupa realizes you're in her mouth, you're doomed. How ironic. You're hiding from Lupa inside her own jaws.</span></div></div>",

She grinned a wild and toothy grin as she played around with her tongue, sending you crash around into her mountain-sized tastebuds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well, my little snack finally decided to accept it's role!\"With you directly in her maw, her booming voice was intensified a hundred fold, nearly deafening you.

Apparently, some other monster was talking to her. It was unintelligible, considering your ears were filled with the werewolf's spit, but once you cleaned them out, you still found that the words made no sense. They were almost simplistic grunts and moans, until you recognized that they were <i>familiar</i> grunts and moans, except a tad more booming and echo-y.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...hey Cadence.\"Lupa said casually to the blue-skinned zombie girl. Obviously the magic hall had magnified your undead caretaker to a titanic size as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence replied in a series of annoyed groans. She had been looking for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R.L.? Nope, can't say I've seen him.\"She lied right through her fangs. Cadence said more grunts, expect a bit more angry this time. Lupa and Cadence were always on neutral terms with one another. They both had known each other for a while, seeing as how they've shared an apartment building for a few years, and they've never had any reason to quarrel until you arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoah girl...\"Lupa said, her voice carrying a worried tone.\"No need to say stuff like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore angry grunts and a little guttural roaring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine!\"Lupa complied, opening up her maw and reaching inside with her claws, plucking you out and dispensing you onto a vast blue wasteland that was Cadence's palm. You looked up at her partially rotted face, but still a tad feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Cadence!\"You called up to her. She nodded at you. Lupa sulked away, angry her meal had gotten away. This was the closest you had ever been to getting eaten by her, but you were glad your giant zombie friend was around. She always had a sense of knowing when you were in trouble.</span></div></div>",

It presses on the tooth your leaning on, and you hold your breath as it continues on. You climb out from behind her teeth and stand on her gums. You watch as the mountainous, slick muscle returns to its original position. Suddenly, everything around you begins to shake, and you slip off her gums. You slide down the slick flesh at an incredible pace until you finally reach the bottom of her mouth. You land hard and roll into a pool of Lupa's hot saliva, which was actually the size of a pool to you, forcing you to swim in the thick fluid. <br>\r\n\"Dammit...I shrunk him too small\" Lupa's voice pierced the heavens so loud, you had to cover your ears. You feel the entire space around you shift as Lupa gets up. The pool your in turns into a river leading to an ocean as it follows towards Lupa's tongue.<br>\r\n\"No, no, no, no, no, NO!\" You scream as you fight the flow of her saliva. You swim as fast as you possibly can, but the fluid was far too thick and you are pulled with the current towards the pink mountain. You scream as you're forced under the tongue of your worst enemy, allowing even less light available for you to see. The current is throwing you in multiple directions at once to the point where you don't know which way is up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis torture continues for what feels like hours with your body being pushed by wolf spit. You occasionally rubbed against her tongue, which felt hot, smooth, and amazingly soft. You gave up on resisting a while ago and are now allowing Lupa's mouth to have its way with you, which was alright because the fighting currents allowed your head to stay above the torrent, allowing you to take in the scent of Lupa. It was the smell of rotting meat and spit. Everything she says makes your ears ring due to the magnitude of her body and how close you were to her throat. But suddenly your surroundings started to shake again, and your lifted out of the ocean of slobber as Lupa coughs. It was a small one, but it was more than enough to release you from her saliva. You land on the bottom of her mouth, but this time in a dry area. You look back at the massive expanse of her maw, the saliva that you were just stuck in was quickly swallowed by Lupa, her tongue arching back and an incredibly loud GULP! could be heard. Talk about a close call... Her tongue returned to its original position, which stopped just inches before you. You crawl backwards, scared of the powerful muscle attacking you and watch it closely. It doesn't move for a few minutes, which allows you to relax. Suddenly it hits you, you are relaxing while in the mouth of a predator that would want nothing more than to eat you. The shear thought of it made you chuckle. Lupa hadn't moved much for a while, so this may be a good time to escape. You stand up on the fleshy floor and look up at the wall of her gums. You were but a mere speck to her, so it would be incredibly difficult to climb up that slick wall. On the other hand, you could stay in this monster's maw until the she falls asleep to crawl out.

You enter one of the valleys and instantly have to cover your nose.  Rotten pieces of food line the floor, creating an ungodly stench.  Braving your way through the odorous gulch, you see your final obstacle: the lips.  There is a \"short\" gap of a dozen feet between the teeth and the lips.

With a surprising amount of control and accuracy, she removes you from her sole with her claws. Still holding you in between her claws she then proceeds to open the door to her apartment. As you enter the large space with the titaness you glance around. Naturally, everything in the room is bigger than you. The walls are a light shade of blue. There is a small kitchen area with a small stove, faucet, chairs, a dining table and a pretty big fridge. There was also a nice sized sofa in front of a TV and a small hallway that led to her bedroom. The most eye-catching thing was a desk. It was spawled numerous papers on it with various sketches and designs, pencils and pens. It stood out mainly because it was pretty messy whereas the rest of the apartment was tidy for the most part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupa walks over to the table and places you on it. She leers down at you with a fanged smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, got you,\" she states needlessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp. This was it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could just eat you now,\" she muses out loud causing you to take a step back. Not that it would've help. The table was literally miles of flat surface that offered no hiding spaces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that would be...boring,\" she continues. \"I've eaten a LOT of humans, ya' know?\" She pats her considerable belly for emphasis. \"But I've never gotten a good chase or at least one that I thought was fun.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i></i>That's a sick definition for fun<i></i>, you think terrified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, while tasty, you little snacks aren't very filling.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at her with some hope. Maybe you won't die just yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, despite being so much larger than you, Lupa notices your expression and her smile increases even more. \"So here's what I was thinking: I go raid my fridge, curbing my hunger for a bit. Then I give you, let's say, 'til the count of thirty, to run around this room and try to hide from me and I try to catch you. You somehow stay away from me long enough, I won't eat you...\" You smile at that but it drops when she keeps going. \"...today. And we continue to do this until you bore me. That way, I still get something to eat and some entertainment, you get live a little while longer. However, if you fail, I get to eat you anyway to top off my meal.\" Lupa had to wipe some drool at that thought. \"Ooorrr, I could just eat you now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stand there, scared out of your mind. You hope she goes with her first idea, you might have a chance if she does that. Lupa just stares down at you hungrily, her claws resting on her belly, drumming on it. Several agonizing heartbeats later, Lupa's stomach gives a growl and gurgle that forces you to cover your ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've decided...\" she starts with you hanging off every word.<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Your eyes widen when you see it is a 'small' glass cup. Lupa turns it upside down in her claws before placing it over you. Her intent was obvious: you weren't going anywhere. You panic for a second wondering if you'll suffocate when you run out of air. After several moments you calm down when you realize at your current size the glass is still several miles high. It would be a long time before you ran out of air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that worry over you look out from the clear glass to Lupa who is doing just as she said: gathering up food from her fridge. There are somethings you recognize but there are others that you wouldn't even begin guessing at. Either way, you just wait around as Lupa prepares her meal. As the titaness goes about her food, you start think of how this will play out? How in the heck can you get away from a miles tall werewolf that really wants to eat you? Even at her size, she can tell where you're are at and pick you up without even trying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend what feels like an eternity racking your brain before a thunderous belch sends quakes through the glass and making you once again protect your ears. You look at Lupa who is picking her teeth with one of her claws and several empty plates beside her. She lets out a smaller burp before reaching over towards the glass and lifting it up and away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's time, R.L.,\" she states needlessly. You shiver at the excited glint in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gather whatever courage you can and nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But before we do...\" Lupa trailed off as she started and the rest of the room started to shrink. You look around wildly as everything become smaller and less daunting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time it stops, Lupa has gone from being so huge that she towered miles above you to about 900 feet. She's still far larger than you're used to but at least it seems like you have a fighting chance. Without a word, she grabs you and places you on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to her as she turns around, sending tremors through the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got 'til I count to 30 to run and hide somewhere,\" Lupa calls back to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she even gets to 1 you take off running. You don't know where, but anywhere is better than being in the open. Who knows you just might make it through this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Within your new surroundings, the room was incredibly dark, so you couldn't really make out what was inside. But you did hear breathing coming from somewhere. You forgot that it was still early in the morning and that most other residents were probably still asleep. Lupa just had to be exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Lupa, she stopped right in front of the locked door that separated her and you. You peered underneath the door, drips of her saliva falling to the ground in front of you and splashing across the floorboards.\"You win this time, R.L.....\"She whispered, crouching low so that her angry eye stared directly at you. You took a few steps away from the door just as a precaution.\"You're lucky I don't wanna bother who's in here. But I'll get ya next time, promise...\"She chuckled, even though it sounded more like snarling, stood back up, and walked away, her booming footsteps becoming less and less noticeable by the second. You didn't even hear her at all after a minute. With a heavy sigh of relief you wiped the sweat from your brow and took stock of the situation. You had escaped Lupa, but now you were in an unknown monster's living area, and you had no idea how they'd react to a small human suddenly appearing in their home. You would head right back out the door, but the risk of running into Lupa again would be too great. You decided that you were just going to take a breather here and head out in about a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man...glad that's over...\"You said aloud, only for the click of a lamp and footsteps from deeper within the apartment to be heard.\"Who said that?\"You heard a female voice say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Crap...\"You mutter as you stand back up, only for an approaching form a giantess come closer and closer.

You let out a scream and the ghost girl shares a scream as she flies upwards. \"Wh-Who are you and wh-what are you doing in my apartment? Pl-Please don't hurt me.\" You were surprised, this girl was a ghost, you couldn't hurt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to hurt you. I mean, you're a ghost, how worse off can you get. My name is R.L. and I only came in here to hide. What's your name?\" The ghost girl hesitates and flies downwards still wary of you. \"Well? What's your name.\" \"C-Corlette. Please, leave me alone.\" \"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you. I wouldn't be in here if it weren't for Lupa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Corlette lets out a scream and turns invisible. \"Was it something I said?\" \"L-Lupa ch-chased you in here.\" \"Yeah, but she said she didn't want to bother you.\" Corlette turns visible again and then begins to cry uncontrollably, forcing you to run, her tears like huge meteors to you. \"Ah! Hey! Be careful! Corlette then lets out a sniff. \"The only reason Lupa doesn't want to bother me is because she can't do anything worse to me than she already did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk closer out of curiosity. This ghost didn't like Lupa any more than you did. \"What did Lupa do to you?\" Corlette cries even wilder than ever. \"Why do you think I'm a ghost?! I came to this horrible Horrorville to visit Cadence! I was so crushed when she died that I had to see her when I learned she was a zombie! I had no idea monsters were so big! The first monster I met when I came to this apartment was Lupa, she told me she was Cadence's friend and offered me a lift to Cadence's apartment! I was so stupid! That rotten werewolf took me to her apartment, bit my arms and legs off, used my body as salad dressing and put my head on top of a sundae like a cherry!!\" \"Ouch.\" You think to yourself as Corlette continues crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's not the worst of it! Everytime she sees me, she reminds me of how delicious I was! She loves to rub salt in the wounds!\" Corlette keeps crying and you try to tap on her hand to calm her down, forgetting about her intangibility. \"It's alright Corlette. I'm so sorry.\" Corlette lets out a sniffle and begins to calm down. And then you decide to ask her a question.</span></div></div>",

Think about it. Lupa can't possibly hurt you anymore, but you can do anything you want to her. I think that you should get some well deserved payback on her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see Corlette's eyes light up as she heard what you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I never even thought about that... All this time, I've been terrified of Lupa. I always hid from her in fear because of what she did to me. But R.L., you're right! She can't even touch me now! I can finally get even with her for what she did to me!\" Corlette said, a newfound confidence in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right Corlette, and she deserves to be punished for what she's done. Not only what she did to you, but for trying to do the same to me, and who knows how many other humans before us! She always treated us as nothing more than a snack food, but eating you turned you into something more powerful than her. She made you into a ghost, and now she can't do anything to stop you from getting even with her. She dug her own grave, so now she has to lie in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! It's time to teach that heartless mutt a lesson! When I'm through with her, she'll never want to eat another human ever again! Thanks R.L., thank you so much. If you hadn't shown up and talked some sense into me, I'd still be living in fear of someone who can't even hurt me. Now let's go, little buddy, we've got a naughty little puppy who needs to be punished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorlette then turned her body tangible and reached down to pick you up. Smiling at your new friend, you stepped onto her pale palm and let her lift you into the air. Corlette then smiled at you and pressed the index finger of her free hand against your forehead. Winking at you cutely, she used her powers to turn your body intangible, also giving you the ability to fly just like her. The ghost girl then turned herself intangible again and proceeded to float toward the door. You followed her eagerly, and the two of you flew straight through the door without even opening it. You were really enjoying this sensation. Being able to fly freely through the air, uninhibited by the walls around you. It was absolutely amazing. If this was what it was like to be a ghost, then maybe you really should have just let Lupa eat you long ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a newfound confidence, Corlette eagerly flew toward the room of her target. With you floating by her side, the two of you entered Lupa's room to get payback. Lupa was simply lounging on her couch and watching TV, completely oblivious to the specter that had just entered her room. With a light giggle, Corlette flew over behind Lupa and began to think of what the best way to get revenge would be. After a bit of thought, Corlette decides to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before the wolf knows what hit her, Corlette fully enters her body and Lupa's brown wolf like eyes turn into Corlette's glowing pink eyes. As Lupa gets up, you let out a cautious look but then she smiles at you and laughs in Corlette's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy cow!\" you yell as you fly down at Corlette. \"You possessed her. \"Hey,\" said Corlette. \"She owes me a body. Ugh.\" Corlette feels her hands around Lupa's fat stomach and thighs. \"And definitely needs to go on a diet.\" \"Oh,\" you say. \"This is too perfect. Too, too, perfect. Now Lupa is in our power. Now how should we exploit this?\" \"Oh!\" yells Corlette as she sits down on the couch and eats some of Lupa's candy from the table. \"I have an idea. We'll sheer all her fur off. The vain little wolf girl will die of embarrassment when she goes to work looking like a naked mole rat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both laugh at that thought. Lupa took great pride in appearance despite here weight, especially when it came to her fur. But then you had an idea of your own. \"Hold on. What if Lupa annoyed all the neighbors, mad them real mad...\" \"Oh!\" yelled Corlette. \"Good idea R.L. They'd tar and feather her.\" You both share another laugh as Corlette grabs you by the hands and twirls you around. Now that she could control Lupa's body, she could do anything she wanted with her.

Let's not be too hasty. Why don't we only mess with the tenants who have it coming, Lupa is hardly the only unfriendly monster in the apartment.\" \"Okay little guy. Time to get Lupa into some high trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Corlette in Lupa's body goes off to annoy the neighbors as you follow her. First Corlette decided to bother a monster who was already on bad terms with Lupa. It was Patsy, the biker cat sith girl. Corlette decides to paint Patsy's bike with pink flowers and teddy bears. Needless to say Patsy is not amused with \"Lupa's\" actions and lets out a hiss when she sees the damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Corlette decides to get Lupa in trouble with Bernice, that cantankerous ifrit on the top floor. Corlette knew that  Bernice had been up all night working on a seafood chowder for the restaurant she worked at, and she got a nasty surprise when she saw Corlette had put Lupa's hair in the pot. She got so mad she burned down the wallpaper in her apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Corlette wanted to have some mean fun with Shelly, that con artist kappa. As Shelly was trying to dismantle the washing machine to steal money. Shelly felt something wet on her head that wasn't the water in her dome and then she turned to see Corlette in Lupa's body drinking the water out as the kappa looked in horror. Without water in their heads kappas were immobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Shelly was helpless, Corlette painted her to look like a statue and then spray painted \"Spank Me!\" on the back of her shell. All the monsters that walked by proceeded to do so as you and Corlette laugh. \"Good one. Serves that turtle back right for all the times she swindled me. I think we've got enough people mad at Lupa.\" Corlette in Lupa's body then picked Lupa's teeth with a claw and gave a vicious smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a better idea. How about we get her in the ultimate trouble?\" \"Ultimate? What do you mean Corlette?\" Corlette gives a slasher smile you'd never expect from a timid and shy crybaby ghost. \"Isn't it true that Nefernina has a date tonight with that bunyip boy from across the street?\" \"Yeah?\" you asked unsure of Corlette's plan. \"Do you think she's wearing anything underneath all that gauze.\" You're horrified. Corlette was thinking of getting Lupa to unravel Nefernina's bandages and humiliate her in front of her date. Sure Nefernina was a jerk and you didn't like her better than Lupa, but this sounded extreme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about that Corlette. Sure Lupa would get in trouble and she deserves to be punished for eating humans, but this could get her evicted. I don't know if she deserves to be homeless.\" \"Come on R.L., we control Lupa now, she'll be the one getting in all the trouble. Don't you want to get even with her for all the times she tried to eat you. I know I want to get back at her for torturing and eating me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about it. Maybe Lupa deserved whatever punishment Nefernina could dish out, but then again, you already had plenty of monsters that would want to get even on Lupa for messing with them under Corlette's control. Should you leave Lupa to the mob or follow with Corlette and get Lupa in trouble with Nefernina?</span></div></div>",

Looking down at you was one of the strangest sights you've seen since your time in Horrorville began. High above on the giantess's shoulders, three heads side-by-side looked down at you curiously. In the middle was a maned lion's head, even though this creature was obviously female. To the left was a goat's, and to the right, a snake's. Six pairs of eyes blinked at you cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\"The snake head asked in a whispery tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what,\"The Lion's head growled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you doing in my apartment?\"The goat's head finished with a bleat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"You gingerly waved at the mishmashed creature with a nervous smile.\"I'm R.L. Uhh...I live on the second floor...and...it's a complicated long story how I got here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere a scaled hand came down and picked you up by the scruff of your neck, dangling you in front of all three heads.\"I have time.\"The monster replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, there's this werewolf, Lupa, you might know her, tries to eat me all the time, and I mean ALL THE TIME. I was out taking my morning jog when she started cahsing after me. I ran down this hall, even though I've never been down here before, and ducked under one of the doors into your apartment without really thinking. You kinda saved my life, since Lupa went away, but now...you're looking pretty angry that I'm in your apartment.\"You replied after taking a long breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So yeah...sorry for invading your home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'ssss fine.\"The snake head answered.\"Just never do it again!\"The lion's head angrily roared.\"By the way, I'm Bianca.\"The goat head said cheerily. The Chimera giantess then settled you back down on the ground, each head giving you different looks. The snake one was still wary, the lion's head angry, but the goat happy.</span></div></div>",

And then there was the angry lion's head saying she was weird, but you have a feeling that head doesn't get along with anyone. The pleasant goat's head sounded the most reasonable and made Astrid out like she was nobody to worry about, so you decide to head next door to the left and duck under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you wondered. Bianca didn't tell you what kind of monsters her neighbors were and what was this idea of Astrid having three sets of razor sharp teeth and a fatal  tail? As you enter under the front door you hear footsteps. They sounded larger than an average monster but not as extreme as Petra, the thousand foot tall gargoyle on the third floor. As you walk in, you look up in fear at Astrid. Astrid was a large crimson red skinned manticore with a huge scorpion's tail and purplish pink hair with the face of a lioness. Body shape wise she was very obese, even moreso than Lupa. Astrid was wearing a black shirt with a red jacket and jeans and it looked like she was arguing with somebody but you didn't see anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you thinking going downstairs Ashley? You know it's dangerous down there.\" \"I was just trying to save you a trip. I know you like to sleep in, so I thought I'd get the paper.\" \"You're just lucky nobody saw you! Do you have any idea what Nefernina would do if she knew about you? Even walking out the front door was dangerous, you know Lupa's out there.\" \"Calm down your highness, Lupa doesn't know about me either. \"With that nose of hers, she will! I might not be around to pull your ass out of the fire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew someone else was there, but you didn't see anyone, could Astrid be speaking with some kind of monster only she could see. Then you notice that Astrid had some kind of ring on her finger. As Astrid continues arguing with whoever's there, you see her long tail swinging about and grab it by the tip. You want to know what's going on. As Astrid lifts you up into the air, you let out a look of surprise because she was talking to a young human...</span></div></div>",

Then you suddenly remember that Ashley was originally meant to be a boy's name. You decide to hide behind the tip on Astrid's tail as not to draw attention being extremely careful of the sharp stinger point. You heard manticore venom could kill in seconds. Once you're in a safe place, you continue to listen in on the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now I just heard Lupa outside,\" says Astrid. \"If you were out there, she'd eat you. What would I do if that happened?\" Ashley lets out a groan. \"I get it, I'm sorry I worried you baby. You are such a mother hen.\" Astrid then stroked Ashley on the head with one of her giant fingers. \"I have to be. It's not easy having an insect sized husband.\" Husband? Then you realize something. Astrid's ring was a wedding ring. You turn your head and even see a photograph of Astrid in a bride's outfit holding her groom in the palm of her hand. This was strange. Was it even legal for humans and monsters to marry? Especially considering that Astrid was a manticore. Manticores were even bigger man-eaters than Lupa. They didn't even leave bones behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you see Astrid taking Ashley out of her cleavage and placing him on the table. \"You stay right here, I'll go get breakfast ready.\" Ashley rolls his eyes. \"I wish you would stop worrying about dropping me and cooking me. You always assume the worst.\" Astrid bends over to kiss Ashley and you get lifted further into the air by her tail and scream slightly as you begin to slide. You have to hold onto the tip to avoid falling to your doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the kissing scene was over, Astrid walked up to the stove. Her every movement shaking you as you look down. She wasn't as big as Petra but you peg Astrid as being 700ft tall and considering her body shape, if she was human sized she'd weigh 500lbs. As Astrid tried to turn on the stove, her tail shook and you fall screaming. This catches Ashley's attention and he's somewhat confused but decides to ignore it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to do something fast to avoid falling to your death and grab hold of Astrid's underwear. You know it's risky, but it would be more risky to stay out and fall. As you climb in, your motions tickle Astrid and make the enormous manticore laugh uncontrollably. \"Ashley,\" she says. \"Oh you naughty boy. Stop tickling me. If you wanted me to sit on you again, all you had to do was ask. Ooh, you're so frisky this morning.\" \"What are you talking about Astrid? I'm still on the table.\" Astrid and Ashley then share looks of confusion. They know something's up. Maybe you chose an unwise hiding place.</span></div></div>",

Laying back on her sofa and propping her armor-clad feet next to her severed head on the table in front of her, she turned on the TV and began watching.

Layla's head alone was at least 50 feet tall, and you found it more than a little unnerving to be standing in front of a severed head that towered over you like a building. As you sat there, Layla's body turned off the TV, and her head directed its full attention toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? What's the matter, cat got your tongue? C'mon, Speak up already! Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hi there... I'm R.L., I live just down the hall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? So you're that human tenant that I've heard so much about. Well, nice to meet you. The name's Layla, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you too, Layla. Ummm, If you don't mind me asking, where did you hear about me from? And how did you even notice me here in the first place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have my connections. I make sure that I'm always up to date with everything that happens in this building. As for how I noticed you, I don't think that I'd make a very good assassin if I couldn't tell when somebody was nearby. I've trained all of my senses to their utmost limits. A fly couldn't land on my wall without me noticing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Layla really was an assassin after all! Well, at the very least she seemed to be pretty nice... At the very least, if she wanted you dead, you wouldn't even be here right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So R.L., mind explaining to me what you were doing sneaking around in my apartment in the first place? I doubt that you're the type who would want to hire me to... <i>take care of</i> someone for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, of course not! I just felt like getting to know some of my neighbors, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well if you just wanted to visit, then you should have at least knocked first. It's not polite to simply barge into someone else's home without warning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe, sorry about that, Layla...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, it's really no big deal. I'm a very hospitable Dullahan, so feel free to come and go as you please. My doors are always open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Layla. You really are nice. I'm glad that I got to meet someone like you here. Not many of the monsters I've met so far have been particularly fond of having a human around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we Dullahans are a race of knights, and chivalry dictates that we must always protect those who are weaker than ourselves. I see no issues in sharing what is mine with another. So, since you're here, would you like me to...\" </span></div></div>",

Somehow, my anger transformed my own spirit into the body you see before you.

Looking down on you was a strange white furry creature with large fangs and long horns curving towards the back of her head. She looked like Chel, that yeti girl from downstairs, but much wilder. She wasn't wearing anything but her fur covered any private parts. You even saw bright purple highlights in her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember seeing a monster in an encyclopedia just like this one and you're horrified at what this creature is. \"Wendigo!\" you yelled. This was bad, Lupa may be always trying to eat you and that's because she's a wolf and therefore a predator, but Wendigos are actually created through cannibalism. You escaped one man eater and now you were standing before another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Winona looks down and notices you. She smiles wickedly and then lowers her hand. You try to run but she's too fast and grabs you. \"Well, well,\" she says just before she licks you slightly. \"You must be that human Nefernina is always complaining about.\" You shutter in Winona's furry paw. \"Come on,\" I said. \"Give me a break, I just got away from Lupa and now this happens. Why did I come here?\" Winona playfully strokes your head before she places you on the table. \"Now you don't go anywhere little man,\" she says as she pets you like a pet. \"I'll come get you as soon as I get the oven going. Would you rather be a pancake or a waffle.\" \"Neither.\" \"Pancake it is.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Winona went to prepare to cook you, you try to run away, but then you remember that the table was hundreds of feet in the air. If you tried to jump you'd be creamed. This was truly a bad situation. Why do so many creatures want to eat you? Are humans that good? But then you see a light of hope. Winona left her cellphone on the table. Maybe you could call for help. But who, there are only two numbers in this entire apartment you know. You figure your best option would be to call Cadence, but she might still be sleeping. Then again she's saved your ass several times since you moved in. But then you got an idea for a laugh. What if Lupa knew someone else was going to eat you. She'd be furious. That would be hilarious. But also risky. You better think fast because as you ponder, Winona is starting the oven to cook you.</span></div></div>",

They sounded loud even for a monster's footsteps and then you turn around and look in fear. \"You've gotta be kidding me!\" The monster came forward was a Sphinx, a winged lion with the face and breasts of a human woman. She had white lion's fur and large cat like ears, but her human head had long goldish colored hair. All she was wearing was a green collar with an ankh hanging from it. But what really was noticeable about her was that this sphinx was very fat, almost spherical in shape. This sphinx actually made Lupa, Izzy and Aqua look anorexic by comparison. She had a chubby looking face and her wings looked to small to allow her to fly. She was also walking on all fours, the only monsters you knew that did that were Lupa and Patsy and even then, they mostly stuck to walking on their hind legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you were mainly concerned that you were in the apartment of a sphinx. Sphinxes were big time man eaters. They asked riddles to every human they met and if you didn't answer correctly, you were eaten without a second thought. Nefernina should put warning signs on doors that house human eaters. It was as if she was making this apartment as unsafe for your kind as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is anybody there?\" asks the ginormous sphinx as she walks forward. \"Hello? I hope not.\" As this sphinx walks towards you, you start to imagine that she'd be 600 feet tall should she stand up. She seemed to have a worried look on her face as she maneuvers her huge body and nearly steps on you with one of her front paws. \"Ah!\" As you scream, the Sphinx lets out a confused mutter and turns her head and spots you. You gasp because you suspect you're gonna be eaten. But then something unexpected happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAH!\" Screams the sphinx as she jumps back, accidentally knocking down her own table. \"A human! Get out! Get away!\" \"Huh?\" you ask. \"You heard me! Get out of her before I have to challenge you! Please! No more humans! I don't want any more! Out!\" You were surprised. A monster afraid of humans. That was odd. Sphinxes were sadistic man eating beasts, but this one was acting like a scared cat and wanted you to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

No more riddles!\" \"Oh-kay,\" you say nervously. \"Explain, pretty please.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sphinx woman gets up and you see just how large she is compared to you. \"Look at me!\" she yells at you. She slaps herself in the belly and then turns around to show your her oversized rear. \"Look at these gluts. You humans did this to me.\" \"Huh?\" Giselle lets out a sigh. \"Everyone knows that when a sphinx encounters a human, they have to ask a riddle to decide whether or not they eat the human.\" \"What does that have to do with... oh... Oh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiselle lets out a loud sad roar as her eyes begin to water. \"I've never encountered a human who could answer my riddles. It never stopped! Even when I wasn't hungry! You humans are getting dumber! I ate hundreds of your kind just last week and didn't enjoy a single one! Do you have any idea how much murder you are on my figure.

It almost feels like going down a slimy waterslide as you become covered in mucus and even more saliva. Eventually, you're no longer being massaged down by the muscles, but are instead falling into the stomach. You land with a plop and quickly curl up into a little ball.

Then you see that the tentacles appear to be coming from an unusual source, below the waist of a giantess monster. She had brownish green skin and was wearing a red plaid shirt like a lumberjack and a pair of blue sunglasses. She had bright green eyes and red hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what was weird about her was that she was growing foliage and leaves from her back and strange multi colored fruit coming out of them. She looked like a living tree. She was a mandrake and she looked friendly. \"Oh, how cute. A little friend. What brings you to my home human?\" You gulp loudly and shutter. \"Please don't eat me.\" The mandrake woman looks as if she's about to have a heart attack. \"Eat you?

Don't worry, Lupa won't bother you any more little man.\" Then Arbara takes her tentacle to her belly button and tossed you inside as you yell loudly. You land surprisingly softly and see that Arbara's navel was actually a knothole for living things. After all, she was a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck?!\" you yell. Arbara just let out a giggle. \"Don't worry my little pet. You'll be safe inside Mommy's knothole.\" Mommy? Oh great, this mandrake saw you as nothing more than a tiny pet and you let out a groan.

She just looks down at you and gives you a smile. \"Sorry, but I've already taken a liking to you little guy! You're such a cutie!\" she says. You let out a groan as she goes about her business. You can feel her moving about from your prison and take a look down. It seems that she can walk by using her many wooden tentacles, which you now see are like roots. You then decide to take matters into your own hands. If she won't let you go, then you'll just have to get out of here by yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up to see if she's paying attention you make your move. You slip out of the belly button as carefully as you can. You take a look at the tentacles below and decide you don't want to risk getting caught by them. Your best bet is to get higher and leap off when you see a chance. After taking a breath you start climbing her body. She's still moving about, stopping for a while sometimes. You're not paying attention to what she's doing, you're too focused on climbing. The higher you get, the more you feel like you're scaling a giant tree. Eventually you are level with her back and decide to try to get to a spot where she can't see. Carefully you maneuver to the branches growing from her back and climb on. You make your way up among the leaves and fruit that have sprouted from her. Unfortunately you make one misstep and accidentally tear one of the leaves. Arbara jerks from the sensation and you lose your footing. Luckily you manage to grab onto the branch but its no use. Soon Arbara's hand comes to view, searching for the source of her irritation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are helpless as the hand grips you between two fingers. Arbara brings you to her face and her yes widen in surprise. \"How did you get there my pet?\" she asks. \"I'm not your pet, and my name is R.L.!\" you tell her. She just shakes her head and lowers you back toward her belly button. \"Now now, you need to be more behaved.\" she says, and tosses you back inside. You make a break for the opening but tiny vines sprout up and seal it off, like a cage. They're way too strong for you to break, so you can only sit there. Arbara's hand appears and gently pushes a small piece of fruit inside. \"Here, little guy. You're probably hungry after that, so eat up.\" she tells you. You hesitate, but truth be told you are pretty hungry. \"Don't worry, I assure you it tastes good.\" she says. With a sigh you give in and start eating. She was right, its delicious! You devour the fruit only to find that...</span></div></div>",

That one is meant to calm you down.\" You try to get up but your body just has no motivation. The vines keeping you trapped recede and a giant finger pokes inside. \"Good night little guy.\" she says while stroking you. You finally lose consciousness as she pets you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up later and stretch your arms. That fruit gave a good rest, you feel great! You notice that the exit is clear and crawl to the opening. Looking up you see that Arbara is asleep. She must have went to bed after putting you to sleep. It seems like she's sleeping standing up, but upon looking down you see that she's actually inside what looks like a giant planter. You guess it makes sense since she is a plant. This is your chance, so you start to climb down her body. Since her roots are planted in the dirt you should be able to take this route without having to worry about them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just about reach the soil when suddenly everything starts to move. Arbara is laying down! The roots twist as she lays on her side. This causes you to tumble down to the dirt, getting it all over yourself in the process. You look around and see that the planter she's in resembles a bed of some sort, so there's room for her to lay down. After taking a look back to make sure she's still sleeping, you make your way to the edge of the \"bed\". You take a look at the roots as you pass by them. You're glad they're not moving right now, as you would get caught like when you first entered the room. While you're not watching where you're going you end up tripping over a stray root. When you do you hear a little yelp from Arbara. The root you hit must be sensitive. You try to make your escape but...</span></div></div>",

She has short dyed black (it's naturally brown), and red eyes. She has a fairly muscular physique, but since she has Lactose Overload Syndrome, her breasts are gargantuan, easily obscuring her torso and upper legs, and filled to the brim with milk that she can't lactate. Abia wears black, gothic clothing that shows of as much cleavage as possible and thigh high heeled boots.<br>\r\nPersonality: Abia is a goth through and through. She loves anything that is dark and creepy. It takes a while for her to warm up to anyone. She is rather distant from her family, rarely seeing eye-to-eye with her sister Lupa (since Lupa eats humans and Abia doesn't) and outright refuses to talk about Persephone. But she can still be a friendly person once you get to know her. Like some women with LOS, Abia is proud of her breasts. She does hate it when people bring up her namesake though.</span></div></div>",

Looking around, you can tell the apartment is belongs to someone creepy: horror movie posters line the walls, the bookshelves have horror books on them, and a plastic skeleton is sitting on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then saw the owner of the apartment and gulped in fear. You had heard that one of Lupa's sisters moved in a while ago, and that werewolf was sitting on the couch next to the skeleton, watching Saw. The werewolf had to be around 900 feet. Her fur was as ivory, the color of a elephant tusk. She had short, black hair you could tell was dyed and red eyes. She had some pretty beefy arms and legs, but her most obvious feature were her breasts. They were massive, filling up her lap easily. Just from looking at her, you could tell she was a goth. She was wearing a black bra, a black corset you could barely see, a black thong, and black thigh high heeled boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she started sniffing the air. She must be smelling you. Looking, she sees you near the door. Slowly, she got up from her seat and walked over to you. When she got to you, she bent down and picked you up to look at you better. The whole time, you heard a sloshing sound coming from her breasts. That's when you realized that she must have Lactose Overload Syndrome. It was a medical condition that only affected female werewolves, succubi, and gargoyles. It made their breasts insanely large and filled them to the brim with milk, but they could never lactate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe werewolf was still looking at you. From up close, you saw she had black lipstick on. Finally, she opened her mouth. \"Are you hiding from my sister?\" She asked. \"I could hear her outside.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped. \"Yeah. She was going to eat me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course she was. I always tell her 'You shouldn't eat human's. Their living things like you.' But she never listens.\" From that, you guessed she likes humans. \"Well, don't worry. I won't let her find you. I'm Aiba by the way.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, like that-\" You started to say before being cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Like the nursemaid of Greek Legends. Don't remind me. Lupa already makes fun of my breasts, I'd rather you didn't start. Just because her breasts aren't as amazing and perfect as mine doesn't give her the right to mock them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell you hit a nerve. \"Sorry. I'm RL.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Aiba could reply, there was a knock on the door. \"Crap. That might be Lupa. Better hide you.\" She said. Then she stuffed you in her cleavage, deep enough so no one could see you. Over all the sloshing, you heard her open the door. The person who was knocking was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Chel nodded her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made sense, after all, there were only three types of monsters known to get Lactose Overload Syndrome and those were werewolves, gargoyles and succubi.

You feel everything moving as Chel continues her examination. She grabs each breast with one hand and begins squeezing them lightly, checking their firmness. Its a bit hard though, as each boob is a lot bigger than her hands. \"Yup, nice and firm but not too hard.\" she says. The yeti moves them around a bit before letting them go. While she has them pried apart however you have been clinging to one and using the fur to try and climb up. You're making progress when she lets go and they return to their positions.

Suddenly the mythril bra is removed and Aiba's gargantuan boobs are set free. You cling to the fur as they jiggle in the free air.

The apartment was almost completely empty. No chairs, no couches, not even a table. All you could see was a fridge, stove, and microwave. You were confused. Then you looked ahead and saw who you assumed was the apartment owner, sitting on the floor motionless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the looks of it, she was an Onryo. She had chalk white skin and long, stringy black hair. You could tell she had an exaggerated hourglass figure, since her boobs were MM cups and her hips were jutting out, even in her sitting position. Her eyes were open, staring straight ahead. They were completely black. She was wearing a bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that's not what drew your attention. What did was the fact that she was covered head to toe in tattoos. Almost every inch of skin had a tattoo on it. All of them were sexy female monsters of varying shapes, from BBW's to bodybuilders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntrigued you walked up to the woman.

She never says more then two words.\" A voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around in confusion. Only you and Kyoko were here. Who spoke?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, look at Kyoko's left leg.\" The voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned and looked. To your surprise, one of Kyoko's tattoos was moving and talking! It was a purple BBW gorgon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You talk?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" The tattoo replied. \"All of her tattoos can. Every one is sentient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an odd story.\" The tattoo said. \"Kyoko used to be very extroverted. She was like everyone else. Then one day, she made the mistake of pissing of some werecat sorceress named Raven. The bitch put a curse on her. When she woke up the next day, she was covered in sentien tattoos.

She would love to catch you at your size. But as you turn around you see a large scaly dark blue foot come in front of you. It looked like that of a lizard's and you realize exactly who you were looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was Izzy, a 500 foot tall basilisk woman who lived across the hall from you and Cadence. She looked like a giant iguana with spikes all over her back, a long serpent's tail and a huge forked tongue with sharp teeth. Izzy had bright purple eyes and dark colored curly hair. Body shape wise she was big enough to be called fat, but she had it in the right places. Izzy was a high school teacher but she looked only a few years older than you. It was Saturday so she most likely had the day off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally you were cautious around basilisks, but Izzy was an exception, she was one of the few monsters in the building with no hostility towards you. In fact, it was quite the opposite. Izzy was overly friendly towards you ever since you moved in. In fact, Izzy was quite a flirt, the first day you met her, she baked you a cake and came to your door wearing only an apron. If you didn't know better you'd say that large lizard wanted you to be her boyfriend. You thought about it, but you thought that having a girlfriend one hundred times bigger than you would be awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Izzy would be your best hope for help and you yell up to her to get her attention. But you forgot that you were much smaller now because of that spell and Izzy couldn't hear you. She probably couldn't even see you, Izzy's eyesight isn't that good. So you get a crazy idea. If she can't see or hear you, you'd make sure that she could feel you. You jump on one her clawed toenails and climb up and rub the tip of her toe, hoping that this basilisk woman would notice you and find a way to return you to normal.</span></div></div>",

Deep beneath the basilisk's planet-sized navy-colored rear, you're surprisingly still alive, yet unable to move. As you open your eyes expecting to be dead, you are surprised to see that you have somehow not been squashed to a pulp by basilisk booty. Perhaps being shrunken so small made you invulnerable to being squished. You try to speak but you can only gag. Your mouth was stuffed up by Izzy's titanic reptilian cellulite and you try to wiggle free, but the massive behind goes on for miles. Your tiny and insignificant struggling only serves to tickle Izzy and make her reposition her butt to best enjoy your struggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" says Izzy. \"R.L.! SSStop it! That tickles! Oh! On second thought, keep it up! Make me ssssqueal!\" Izzy laughs so hard that her navy skin begins to crack, revealing a bright silvery skin underneath. Izzy sees her skin coming apart and looks in awe. \"Oh,\" she says. \"Oh, oh, oh. It's happening. Yes.\" Izzy's skin chips and falls off as her new silvery skin pops up from underneath. The skin cracks underneath where you are and you\u2019re enveloped into the rolls of Izzy\u2019s much softer new skin. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d you think to yourself. \u201cOf course! Izzy is a reptile monster. She must\u2019ve gotten so excited that she shed her skin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy feels her new skin and moans to herself. \u201cOh yesssss,\u201d she said. \u201cOh yesssss. I\u2019ve been meaning to molt for quite sssssome time now. Like my new ssssskin, R.L.?\u201d Izzy giggles to herself as she uses her tail to inch her way up to her desk as she moans and shakes, causing you great pain. \u201cWhat is she doing now?\u201d you think. \u201cOh. I\u2019m beginning to think I would\u2019ve been better off if somebody like Lupa found me instead.\u201d You then let out a muffled scream and start to fall further beneath Izzy as the ginormous and obese basilisk is busy listening to her headphones as she\u2019s grading test papers, all while moaning to herself as she feels you struggling beneath her. \u201cComfy?\u201d asks Izzy as she smiles, showing her sharp snake-like teeth. \u201cI know I am.\u201d Izzy giggles as she clicks her pen and then gets to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend the next two hours plastered underneath Izzy\u2019s rear. You were already an insect to this Godzilla-sized snake/iguana-like creature but since Nefernina shrunk you, you were an inch to an inch to this ginormous lovestruck reptile. Miraculously, Izzy finally gets up and puts her papers away. She bends over and pokes her head between her thunderous legs before lifting her tail and looking up at you\u2019re flattened but still alive form. \u201cThere you are, R.L.,\u201d says Izzy. \u201cEnjoying my big butt?\u201d \u201cIzzy!\u201d you yell. \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny! I need some way to get back to my normal size.\u201d Izzy peels you off and then giggles before she unbuttons her coat. You cover your eyes but then you look to see that Izzy is getting redressed. First she puts on a pair of long gray nylon leg warmers and then she lifts her tail as she starts to put on a bright blue leotard. \u201cIzzy,\u201d you say. \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d says Izzy as she strokes your head like you were some kind of a pet. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, my little cutie. I happen to be well versssssed in magic.\u201d Your eyes pop. \u201cWHAT?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy wiggles her behind as she continues to put on her leotard. \u201cOh yessss. We basssssilisssskssss have the natural ability to cassssst ssssspellsssss. I think that I could resssssstore you to a ssssslightly lessss microssscopic ssssize.\u201d \u201cWell then!\u201d you yell from the tip of Izzy\u2019s thumb. \u201cDon\u2019t keep me in suspense, Izzy! Please, unshrink me!\u201d Izzy giggles and then waves her finger. \u201cUh, uh, uh,\u201d says Izzy. \u201cOn one condition. I won\u2019t unssssshrink you unlessssss you agree to marry me.\u201d \u201cWhat?!\u201d you shout in horror. You couldn\u2019t believe it. Izzy was using your new shrunken size to extort you into marriage. Izzy gives a giggle and then hold you up in the air as she hold up the back of the neck of her leotard. \u201cI\u2019ll give you time to think it over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a scream as Izzy drops you down the neck of her leotard and you slide down her softer and squishier new skin until she lifts her tail and you slip between her butt cheeks (again). You groan. You were stuck to a basilisk\u2019s backside, shrunken to an inch tall, which made you nigh microscopic to the skyscraper-sized monsters that made normal-sized humans look like ants and she knew how to unshrink you, but she wouldn\u2019t do it unless you agreed to marry her.

Two simple sounds.<br>\r\nThe first is her giggling in that flirty way of hers.<br>\r\nThe next is <u><i><b>CRUNCH!</b></i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that....nothing at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy giggled devilishly as she sat down, her forked tongue snapping out from between her lips. The feeling of R.L.'s tiny form under her rump...it felt great. <i>Wonderful</i>, even! She cooed as the man of her dreams twitched and squirmed, tickling her scaly cheeks. After this little game, he was sure to <i>finally</i> let her in and hook up with her!  She knew R.L. may have preferred a lunch date, or maybe a kiss, but he could get that from any human girl. No, if she was going to score with him, she had to give him something only a monster could give. Guys always went for the unique girls, right? Right! And who could be more unique than a monster girl who was bigger than most buildings?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting R.L. in her cleavage had been her first idea. He'd enjoyed it, albiet grudgingly and tried to lie, but it was a start. So, the plump snake-woman decided to go the extra mile and sit on him. She'd picked up that little trick from a magazine: monster girls with human significant others were apparently really hot for sitting on their men, and the more plump your rear, the more he'd like it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And given how tiny R.L. isssss now...he hassssss to be head over heelsssss in love!\" Izzy chirped, wiggling her butt in the chair. Maybe R.L. would even move in with <i>her!</i> That'd be a nice change; she loved her teaching job, but having just a little help with the paperwork (or a seat cushion for her office chair) would be a godsend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until Izzy stopped giggling that she noticed something. R.L. had stopped moving. Completely. Not a single twitch or squirm. Darn, she'd liked that; it was a great massage. Oh well, he'd probably just had enough and tired himself out. No need to overwhelm her new boyfriend! Wiggling her rear one last time, she got out of the chair and turned around, grinning ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sssso, how was tha---\" Izzy's tease died on her lips as she faced the chair. Her smile fell, and her slitted eyes went wide. Her tail even drooped to the floor. \"Oh...that'ssssss not good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nR.L.'s tiny body...didn't look like a human's any more. He looked liked a tiny broken doll, with his limbs bent at unnatural angles and his chest and stomach...<i>deflated</i>. There was also a red stain around him, and it didn't take a genius to know what it was, even without her glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not good at all....dammit. How am I gonna explain <i>thissssss</i> to Cadence?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaddened, Izzy scooped her crushed crush's body off the chair, wrapped it in a napkin and whispered an apology to it before burying it in a flowerpot she kept on her windowsill. The impromptu funeral over, she grabbed some fabric shampoo from the kitchen and set about cleaning R.L.'s remains off her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbelievable...try to score with a cute guy, and she ends up killing him. By accident, and <i>with her ass</i>, no less. <br>\r\nThat was the last time she took sex advice from a magazine...  </span></div></div>",

You turned around to see on the horizon, Elle, the thunderbird harpy girl that lived on the floor above you. Her thin, yet sleek and stylistic form of orange and yellow feathers, was clad in nothing but booty shorts and a tank top today, her signature headphones around her ears, blasting away some music to her entertainment. From your vantage point on the floor, she was absolutely monolithic. Even at a distance, she seemed miles tall, bigger than anything you could ever comprehend. It seemed she was walking from door to door, placing posters on them for her upcoming music event at the club she DJ'd at. You jumped up and yelled for her attention, maybe she could help you? Elle always seemed like a chill and pretty nice girl, so, she was best bet to returning you home to Cadence and getting Nefernina to reverse her shrinking spell on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she came closer, each booming footstep carrying her across miles of terrain, you realized things weren't working. You were simply too tiny to even see, let alone hear. Plus, even if she did manage to pick up your small voice with her acute senses, she was probably too busy listening to her music to pay attention to much else anyway. So, in classic giant monster fashion, and unbeknownst to her, she slammed her foot down right in front of you, her titanic talons that dwarfed skyscrapers just mere inches away from your minute form. You looked up, jaw dropped at the awe-inspiring sight above. She seemed to tower above the sky itself, the upper portions of her body disappearing into a blurry sliver, but her lower half, you could barely even see past she was so massive. What concerned you the most, however, were her talons and toes nearby. They were absolutely too big to be even real. Apparently, high above, Elle had stopped, probably listening to a really good part of the song she was jamming out to, giving you a small chance to examine her feet up close. It was divided into three toes like a birds, but with massive talons protruding from where the nails should be. You laid a hand on one, and found it was extremely sensitive to the touch, almost human in a sense.

As Petra was unlocking the door with her keys, you hear more stomping and then you saw Irene running forward. \"Hi Petra!\" yells Irene cheerfully. \"Bye Petra!\" Petra shakes her head. \"For crying out loud Irene, sit still for once in your life. That girl has serious problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis surprised you. Irene wasn't scared of Petra. All the monsters on the first and second floor were deathly afraid of Petra.

Your view is blocked by a wall of purple strands, which you recognize as her skirt.  Reaching out, you manage to grab one of the fibers before gravity could take you back down.  You're near the edge of the skirt, with a hundred mile drop beneath you.  Your grip tightens as a small wave of vertigo hits you.  This swells into nausea as the leg beneath you swings forward, forcing the fabric to move along.  Her foot crashes down, the leg and skirt swinging backward.  This continues for what feels like an eternity as Cadence stumbles toward your room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally stops moving at the door.  However, once the door was opened the swaying motion returned, carrying her and her poor passenger towards the couch.  Gravity fails as the zombie's body free falls toward the expansive cushion, the force breaking your grip.  You fall a short distance to the top of her thigh, right in an oozing sore.  Great.  As you climb free of the green lake, you hear the TV turn on in the distance, and the rolling thunder of a sitcom laugh track echoes overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about what to do from here.  It's unlikely that anyone but Petra or Nefernina could reverse this, and only one of them would actually want to.  Of course, that means finding a way to get Petra to help you, and that means getting somebody's attention.  You look up and up the sky-scraping cliff that is your rotting roommate.  She always watches TV like this for two hours exactly, lying perfectly motionless the whole time (and no, it's not weird you know that.  It helps to know your roommates schedule, especially so you can avoid getting stepped on).  If you can climb to her ear or her good eye, there's a slim chance she'll notice you and be able to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, that's a very slim chance.  You turn the other way and see that Cadence's feet are resting on the coffee table.  That thing has never been cleaned, and she always has pizza once a week.  You could always survive rather well on there: not even bugs would be a threat, since you're too big to be noticed.  So, what'll it be?</span></div></div>",

The giant werewolf walked over to her bathtub, stepped inside, closed the curtain, and turned on the water, the showerhead shooting down warm water drops the size of buses to you.</span></div></div>",

You were in downtown Horrorville. Horrorville really lived up to its name as gray clouds filled the air, hiding everything but a red sun. For some reason that was the color that they had over the town. It was kinda creepy. The skyscrapers (to monsters) were black and had a gothic look with some buildings bearing spikes. The street lamps even had jack-o-lantern's on them with menacing faces. It's also very cold with the chilling winds that you swear could even free a human's blod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what really got your attention was the different kinds of monsters of all shapes and sizes walking down the street. You climb up and hide behind a giant mailbox and look at all the sights. Horrorville had every species of monster you could think of. You saw harpies perching on telephone wires while gargoyles flew above them and leapt across rooftops. You see titanic cars in the street, one of which was a muscle car driving by a gang of gremlins that looked all gaudy. You then look to see a golem watering carnivorous plants and a cockatrice dressed up as a postal worker carrying a bag of mail. It was so unnerving because normally these monsters would only be hundreds of feet tall, but you were shrunk to where a normal human would be that big to you. You were an inch to an inch to these titans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't the worst of it. You look up and see a sign that reads \"Bloodchill Lane\". That was on the opposite side of Horrorville to Monster Arms. This was bad, you thought to yourself. Not only were you shrunken but you were out in a city of giant monsters you didn't even know and far away from home. The worst part is that Cadence has no idea what happened to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat could possibly happen now?</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, sometimes she forgot to wear her glasses and one time she accidentally petrified a pizza delivery man. Nefernina had to get a shovel and dispose of the evidence. Personality wise she was quiet and friendly though and didn't mind humans. Though her hair was quite intimidating. Georgia was also an artisan who specialized in making metal sculptures and jewelry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figured Georgia could be of help at your shrunken form and jump on her sandal as she lifts her foot up into the air. You then jump off and grab the front of her pants as you let out a groan. You scream slightly as you nearly fall off but then climb up her skin up to her navel and rub at it.

Mavis was a banshee with pale skin and black rings around her eyes, giving her a skull like face. She also had pointed ears and curly indigo hair with a white stripe in it. For clothing she was wearing a skimpy green dress. She was hourglass shaped but you had no idea if she had feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately Mavis was not a good neighbor. She was an opera singer and kept you awake with her practicing and her voice was anything but music. It sounded like nails on a chalkboard companied with the call of a humpback whale.

All of the monsters (RedHurricane, everyone of your OCs are being here) that was on the reservation list, which is all except Lupa... came inside to your room and brought all the partying items you would need for the huge Nefernina busted party. Soda, chips, popcorn, music, and every sort of shit you can basically imagine in a party. Every single monster (including Candace, except Lupa) came to the huge massive party to celebrate. The room was redesigned to where you can access everything easily, and you are seen talking to 5 monsters on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monsters that you are right now flrting with are Aqua (giant apple figured kelpie (see Wikipedia) girl with blue skin, Petra, the gargoyle girl that arrested Nefernina earlier, a large yellow green skinned jabberwock named Alicia, neko-cat girl Patsy, and gorgon snake girl Gerogia. You are pretty much glad that Nefernina is gone, as you are now popular among the crowd, and as everyone parties hard, you start to talk to the 5 massive beasts before you, of course you had to wear glasses to prevent Gerogia's eyes from turning you to stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Nefernina bitch is now gone... we now control the place since there is no land lady in this whole hotel... we might as well party out on the whole hotel.\" Gerogia said, using her snakes to give you a cowboy ride as you were dared by Mavis to write a snake on Gerogia's hair for 5 mintues, and you managed to last 10 minutes before you fell into a glass of water, you got your glasses guled onto you, so you had no problem at all getting up, etc, but it seems that your popularity is just going up every minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AWESOME...!\" Petra said, congratulating you for taking Mavis's dare to the end of the full length, and further than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny other dare ideas?</span></div></div>",

You're still tiny but now you're a tiny werewolf. You let out another howl as Nefernina gives an evil laugh. \"Isn't this ironic. You're now the same species as your greatest enemy.\" \"You could've at least made me the same size as you Cleofatra!\" Normally that insult makes Nefernina fuming mad, but she simply held her open palm in front of your. \"Bite my giant bandaged ass R.L. You better get used to it, because that spell is irreversible unless I say different.\" With that the mummy bitch lets out a wicked laugh and walks away as you growl at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou even begin to scratch yourself. \"I think that mummy gave me fleas. I hate her so much. I hope Amit eats her heart. If she even has one!\" As you mumble to yourself, you hear more stomping and let out a gulp. You turn to see Lupa coming. \"Oh no!\" you yell. Instinctively, you begin to run in fear of being eaten, but then Lupa begins to sniff the air. \"Crap!\" she's already picked up your scent. However, she doesn't get the same hungry eyes you know her for. Instead she turns her head, spots your werewolf form and gives a lustful smile before letting out a howl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew it, Lupa leaps in front of you (despite her massive weight) and you're in direct view of her face. \"Lupa!\" you yell. Lupa sniffs you and shows you a trollish smile. \"OOh. What do we have here? About time we got a he-wolf in this place. AROO! Say, you're kinda puny for a werewolf, you know that?\" \"Uh,\" you mutter. \"I've been sick.\" This was great. Lupa didn't recognize you. Duh, werewolves don't eat other werewolves. You were safe. You let out a sigh of relief but then Lupa picks you up and licks you as you let out a scream. \"Rowr. You're a feisty one little guy.

Thank goodness she didn't realize who you really were. But you have to admit Lupa was beautiful despite her heavyset figure and you could see her jiggling cleavage from up on her shoulder.

That made sense, Lupa by occupation was a clothing designer and liked to show a sense of style. This was the more classy side of that bloodthirsty wolf. She places you on the table and lowers down with her lips puckered. You scream and instinctively try to run, expecting Lupa to try and eat you again, but Lupa pins you down by your new tail and you let out a howl. \"Don't be shy guy,\" said Lupa. \"I'm probably the most woman you'll ever see.\" Lupa lowers her head down and you flinch as she kisses you and soon you're covered in werewolf drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, hmmm,\" said Lupa. \"You taste heavenly.

You feel terrified knowing that you could easily end up in one of those pancakes.Lupa notices the troubled look on your face.\"Whats wrong baby?\" she asks, a little concerned. Its still really strange having her be so nice to you, but at least she wasn't trying to eat you. Suddenly you have an idea. She won't eat you, so maybe you can get her to throw you out. If you tell her you don't eat human, then she might lose interest in you. As long as you don't offend her too much you might make it out of this situation unscathed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you ponder this Lupa leans down and brings her head close to you. You begin to enact your plan, but falter as you see her face. She actually looks sweet when she's worried  about you. You immediately shake it off and remind yourself that this is a killing machine that would eat you in a heartbeat if you were human. \"Are you sure you're okay?\" You nervously scratch your ear and answer. \"Uh yeah, everything's fine.\" She gives you a stare that says \"You can tell me anything.\" Looks like its now or never. \"I actually don't eat human.\" you tell her. You look up at her face, which is still pretty close, and try to judge her reaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupa just stares at you and blinks. \"What was that?\" she asks. You swallow and repeat yourself. \"I don't eat human.\" The overweight werewolf doesn't get upset, she just asks. \"Why?\" You didn't think the conversation would go this far. Thinking quickly you come up with an explanation. \"Well in case you haven't noticed I'm kind of small. It just doesn't feel right eating someone thats basically the same size as me. It also makes me uncomfortable when others eat human because I feel like that could easily be me they're eating. Heck, I'm so small I might be mistaken for a human.\"  There, hopefully that will get Lupa off your back. How does your new girlfriend take the news?</span></div></div>",

You're hoping she'll end your \"relationship\" and ask you to leave, but there's still the chance she could get angry. What you get though is something you didn't expect. \"That's okay.\" Lupa says. You stare at her for a minute before you find your voice. \"What?\" She simply repeats herself. \"I said its okay. I don't mind if you don't eat humans.\" You continue to stare with a look of disbelief. Lupa eventually becomes concerned. \"What's wrong?\" she asks. \"Are you okay?\" You try to reevaluate your plan and respond. \"I'm just a little surprised. I didn't think you'd be so accepting.\" She just gives you a loving smile. \"I think you're fine. I actually have a cousin who doesn't eat humans, so I'm sort of used to it. Besides, you're such a cute little guy. I couldn't just leave you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you try to process Lupa's response she scratches your head with a clawed finger. It actually feels pretty good. The scratching stops and you look up to see Lupa walking away. \"I'll just make you some human free pancakes.\" she says, and starts cooking. So the most vicious monster you know can also be the sweetest. Go figure. Lupa returns to you with a plate of regular pancakes and sets them down. She then cuts off a small portion and holds it to your face. You look up at her expectant face and reluctantly take a bite. Its really good and you can't help but keep eating. Above you Lupa looks happy that you're letting you feed her. You catch a glimpse of her smile and blush a little. Wait, why are you blushing?! This is Lupa! She's only being this nice because you're a werewolf like her. If you were your normal self she'd put <i>you</i> in some pancakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you're enjoying the food Lupa begins eating as well. She's eating the human free pancakes and catches you looking at her. \"Don't worry little guy. I might still eat humans, but I won't do it around you.\" she tells you with a smile. She shows her teeth in that smile but you don't feel threatened like usual. Are you actually becoming comfortable around your worst enemy? You shake these thoughts out of your head. \"Thanks,\" you say awkwardly. \"It would be a shame if you got mixed up and ate me by mistake.\" This statement really gets to her and her face is in yours in a flash. \"I'd never do that! I love you!\" Her tone is forceful,like you offended her. Wow, it must have really been love at first sight for her. The biggest predator you know is willing to refrain from eating humans for you. She stands up and folds her arms. \"Besides, eating another monster is wrong.\" She sounds a little sad when she says this. There must be some issues there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupa's smile returns and she resumes feeding you. You try to think of a way you can escape as you eat. When the pancakes are gone Lupa cleans up and tells you that she's going out. What about you?</span></div></div>",

You rise through the air until you're right in front of her face. \"Um, did you say we?\" you ask. Lupa smiles. \"Thats right, we didn't really get that much time with each other, so you can join me today.\" she says cheerfully. You curse your luck just as Lupa's tongue covers your body. She licks you all over, covering you with saliva. \"Just marking my property.\" she says as you wipe your face off. You don't get it until you smell something. You would never have noticed before but with your werewolf nose you can smell  many different scents. Among them is Lupa, whose scent is now on you thanks to her saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the marking Lupa places you on her shoulder.

This proves to be a dire mistake as Lupa smiles widely.\"Ooh! Then you can move in with me! Nefernina doesn't usually allow men but I'm sure she'll make an exception.

It just requires a large sacrifice. From this moment on, I will never eat another human again.\" You are surprised and Lupa bends over for a kiss. You can't help but kiss her back. Irony is a rather funny thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNefernina looks on in disbelief and then lowers her head. \"I lose,\" she says. \"I lose, I lose, I lose, I lose. I'll admit, Lupa's my friend and it was a horrible trick to play on her. If she won't eat humans ever again, then I'm going to have to change my policy. Why is it that love has to be stronger than hate?\" Nefernina stomps her foot and then walks away as you and Lupa smile at each other. You used to hate Lupa but now you see that in her bloated and fur-covered body, there is a heart after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One last thing,\" says Lupa. \"There's somebody who should know about our relationship.\" Lupa reaches into her pocket and takes out her cellphone right before she decides to call..</span></div></div>",

I can't ask you to stop eating humans for me. But if I'm undigestible then you'll always be able to eat me when you have a craving\" you answer her with sincerity in your heart. She looks back at you beginning to tear up. \"R.L. you don't need to do that! I...I ca-\". \"Lupa! look at me\" you cut her off. \"Everything will be fine. The one thing I can say <i>for</i> Nefernina is that her magic holds up. She knows what she's doing, don't worry!\" you reassure her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instantly notice how happy this made her when she starts to soft cry, moving her other paw to hide her face. Only a moment later she raises you towards her face and kisses you passionately, forcing you to lie back in her hand as she smooches you with her giant mouth. Nefernina stands awkwardly and shuffles her feet a few times before you two stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Nefernina...\" you start with a forced cough. \"Can it be done?\" you quickly follow with. \"I think I can probably cook something up\" she nods whilst moving closer to you. She raises her open hands above Lupa's paw. You begin to see a faded aura dance around her fingers. It was a bright teal colour and seemed to move with a loose precision. The radiating light starts to wash over you and your arms begin to gently rise. This goes on for about ten seconds. Lupa is watching intensely, nearly failing to blink half the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light fades and you begin to feel the weight in your arms again. You give your hands a brief inspection and glance down at your legs and feet. \"Did it work?\" you chirp, not meaning to sound doubtful. \"That should be it! You're good to go\" Nefernina announces with a single clap, holding her hands together. Lupa hasn't said a word yet, she's just inspecting you to make sure you're okay. Who knew she'd be such a good girlfriend?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thanks for stopping by Nefernina!\" you call out to her. \"It's the least I can do R.L.\" she responds. \"I'll leave you two lovebirds alone!\" she adds with a friendly laugh. It was nice to be civil with her for a change. She suited the cheery Landlady personality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both wave to her as she leaves and Lupa takes you back inside the apartment. She walks through to the bedroom and places you on a desk opposite the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's proceeds to stand at the desk, biting her nails. She's still trembling a bit, bless her you think. You walk over to her other paw, which was resting on the desk and place your hand on it. It grabs her attention and she looks over at you endearingly, hugging you back gently with her furry fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry?\" you ask with a warm smile. This makes her breathing jump a bit before she speaks. \"R.L...Do you really...<i>want</i> this?\" she replies in a doubtful tone. \"Of course I do! I love you Lupa. I'd do anything to make you happy\" you pour out to her. You're understandably still a bit scared but you want to make it work so you suppress it. You <i>are</i> slowly beginning to look at Lupa as your girlfriend. You want to do this for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushes whilst trying to hide a joyful smirk. \"Aren't you scared to go in here?\" she queries, patting her enormous belly. Your eyes lustfully scan all over her mid-section. \"There's no where else I'd rather be right now beautiful\" you answer her with the most longing adoration. She picks you up and holds you close to her face. \"I don't deserve you\" she says, almost in tears again. She holds you against her lips and you kiss her. \"I'm all yours Lupa\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay against her lips for a few minutes until a rumble from Lupa's substantial stomach breaks the silence. You look down at it from her paw and she begins rubbing it with the other, which excites you somewhat. \"Are you enjoying this?\" she playfully teases, smiling again. \"Does it show?\" you tease back. \"Oh, just a little bit\" she answers, licking her lips delicately and making you're jaw drop a fraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch her run her paw across the vast belly that you had once, tried to avoid at all costs. Now you were actually looking considerably forward to going in. <i>This</i> is love you think to yourself. You're literally about to spend a few hours inside your girlfriend's stomach to treat her. You look back up at Lupa to ask her the question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So-uh...are you ready?\" you inch out. \"Are <i>you</i> ready? I want to take this at your pace\" she fondly counters you. \"We could fool around for a bit first? I can introduce you to this big thing before you go in if you'd like? The choice is all yours\" she offers, shaking her captivating gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her tongue looks divine as it dances for you. She lowers you closer and it snatches you into her mouth. The feeling of her warm saliva and humid breath is intense and you just can't get enough of her swishing you around and tasting you. Letting out audible noises of enjoyment, Lupa seemed to be getting into it as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to go down, my Prince\" her voice boomed. You looked towards the back of her throat and feel a rush of lust like you've never experienced before. \"Put me in there, my hungry girl!\" you call back, letting your face sink into her tongue. She smiles before she tilts her head back and you begin to slide towards her gullet. \"I'll see you in a while handsome\" she says finally as she lets out the loudest gulp you've ever heard and the view of outside disappears as you are pulled down her throat towards her waiting stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slither down through your girlfriend until you eventually reach your destination. You land into her spacious rumbling gut with a splash. It lets out a monstrous moan and the green acid begins to bubble but the temperature remains just right. Nefernina's spell worked! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're suddenly knocked off you're feet as Lupa begins patting her immense belly, causing it to wobble and gurgle a bit. You can vaguely hear her through her stomach walls. \"You feel amazing in there! I love this!\" she exclaims in joy. \"Are you okay in there?\" she asks, giving her fat gut a little shake. \"I feel great Lupa! Your stomach is perfect, I don't know why I kept away from it for so long!\" you try to call back. Luckily she heard you. \"That's good sweetie! I'm glad you like it in there\" she responds lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupa walks over to the bed to lie down. Her stomach walls squirm as she moves and there was a bit of a splash when she sat down. Once the acids had accommodated for the shift in position, you settled into a comfortable position against a wall, bathed in nice warm liquid. It truly was bliss, you wouldn't mind coming back in here. You found yourself becoming more and more attracted to Lupa. Especially her colossal pot belly, in which you were now relaxing, you have to keep reminding yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear Lupa's paw rubbing her beautifully round paunch. You drift off into a peaceful sleep whilst listening to her gurgles and rubs. Not long after, Lupa falls asleep as well, cradling her belly with a paw, in which the love of her life was now sleeping happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up sometime later to Lupa patting her stomach again. \"I'm so sorry if I woke you R.L. but it's been a few hours and I wanted to see how you were doing? You wanna come out?\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's beyond nice in here and you'd like to stay but you also wouldn't mind taking her up on that offer to enjoy her belly from the outside too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You weren't even concerned anymore about being eaten. In fact, you had willingly let yourself get swallowed a few times, and be thrown up soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you made your way down to Lupas greatest treasure.

Another part of you also feels something like excitement, but you can't for the life of you figure out why. As you look downward toward Lupa's chest you realize the answer. Its killing you that you might actually be falling for her. Looking up you try to forget about her endowments but are met with the sight of her face. The way she's looking at you makes you blush involuntarily. Nefernina walks up and gives you a little scratch under your chin. \"You behave now little guy and Lupa will take good care of you.\" she says as she walks away. While you silently curse her Lupa lifts you up higher. \"Well lets get going. The sooner we finish the sooner we can come home.\" she tells you with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupa heads outside and walks to the building's parking lot. After she gets in she takes you and puts you between her breasts. \"There you go, two airbags just for you.\" she says with a giggle. You never thought you'd hear Lupa giggle, and you certainly never thought you'd think it was cute. You resign yourself to your situation and settle into a comfy position. Lupa rubs your head and then starts the car. After a short drive she stops the car and gets out. Climbing up up you see that she's heading inside a building. Another giggle tells you that Lupa feels you moving about in her cleavage. Looking around you see all sorts of fabrics and such. She must be here to get fashion supplies. You just lay back and wait for her to finish her shopping. When she does she heads to the counter and the cashier, a naga girl, notices you. \"Hey Lupa, who's the little guy?\" she asks. Lupa takes you out and presents you. \"He's my new boyfriend, Romulus.\" she tells her. The naga tilts her head. \"He's a little small isn't he?\" Lupa licks you and stuffs you back into her shirt. \"As far as I'm concerned it just makes him easy to manage.\" She then pays for her things and exits the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two of you are back on the road Lupa begins speaking. \"Just one more stop. then we'll head home.\" she says. When you arrive you see that it a grocery store. While Lupa walks through the aisles you look around at all the different things for sale. You see things that would be normal to you, such as cookies and cereal, except blown up to monster proportions. There are also things made just for monsters, probably using ingredients you've never even heard of. Lupa begins grabbing simple things, like spices and sugar. Then she heads to a section that sells meats that humans would eat. Of course to Lupa they're very small, but she makes sure to grab a lot. \"I need to make sure I have food that you can eat, and I'll have some while I'm at it.\" she tells you. You're a little touched that she went out of her way to get this kind of food for you. Once she finishes her shopping she drives home. When the two of you get back to her apartment....</span></div></div>",

As she walks away you're mesmerized by the swaying of her tail on her enormous ass. You shake yourself out of your trance and try once again to think of all the times this wolf has tried to make dinner out of you. It surprises you that its getting more difficult to think badly of her. You begin to wonder if you should just give up and accept that you're falling for her. What remains of your sense of reason pushes forward and forces you up. You make your way to the edge of the couch cushion and look around. Its a long way down but you need to get out of here before temptation gets to you. Before you can act however a shadow appears above you and you look up to see Lupa's rear coming down. You rush out of the way as she sits down. Her weight causes a shift and you roll into her ass. The feel of her furry cheek is surprisingly great even through her pants. As you run your hand along it Lupa looks down at you. \"Ooh, can't keep your hands off huh?\" she says and gives a seductive growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore this goes any further however she lifts you up and walks toward the table. \"We can save that for later though. Now its time to eat.\" she says. She sets you down and you look at the meal she's prepared. It looks pretty good. There are rolls and side dishes and everything. Among the food you recognize there are also some things exclusive to the monster world, but even that doesn't look too bad. Lupa's cooking skills really surprise you. Lupa sits down and begins making her plate. \"All of this is human free of course.\" she says as she grabs a handful of cooked cattle. You smile at her thoughtfulness and look around. \"Where's my plate?\" you ask. Lupa gets up without answering and lights some candles. Then she turns off the lights and sits back down. \"You're eating from my plate hubby. This is a special dinner for you, so I want to make sure you eat your fill.\" she tells you. With that she nudges you to the plate and cuts off a piece of cattle. She holds it out to you and you bite off as much as you can. Its delicious and Lupa can see it on your face. She smiles proudly and continues to feed you. When its time for dessert she cuts a piece of cake and picks you up. \"Oops.\" he says as she drops you onto the cake clearly on purpose. \"Guess I need to clean you off. Then she licks you all over. Throughout the meal both of you had been drinking wine and it was affecting your tiny body. As her tongue rolls over you you embrace it and attack it with your own tongue. Lupa moans and pulls you into her mouth. The two of you have your make out session and then Lupa spits you into her paw. \"I think its time to end the night with a bang.\" she says. You don't know if its the wine or if you're finally giving in, but you howl excitedly at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupa carries you to her bedroom and begins stripping. You sit on the bed and watch with anticipation. As she reveals her big beautiful body your tongue rolls out of your mouth and you turn red. When she's done she strolls toward you and picks you up. \"Your turn.\" she says. Then she lays on the bed and tears your clothes off with ease. After that she sits you on her massive boob and looks at you expectantly. \"Get to work little guy.\" she growls. While she's still being nice you can hear aggressiveness in her voice. You get to work and she begins moaning and twitching. After a while she pulls you up and begins to move you lower. \"Enough foreplay.\" she says as you near her privates. When you reach your destination her womanly scent assaults you and your enhanced senses go crazy. The next few hours are filled with passion and while you were really into it, it was nothing compared to your partner. She was going at it like well, a wolf. She was in complete control and you didn't care. When its all over you both lay there, with you being covered in her juices. You've fully accepted everything and now want to be with Lupa. You cuddle against the fur of her inner thigh and the two of you fall asleep.   <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When you try to get up you find that it takes a bit of effort, since you're stuck to her by the dried juices. You shake your head to wake up better and then what happened last night sets in. You panic a little, thinking about how you just spent the night with your former enemy. Looking up at her sleeping form you can't even think of her as a enemy any more. Part of you is worried that this could go wrong, but part of you is happy to be with her. You lean back against her thigh while you think and then feel her begin to stir. You stare upwards as she rises from her sleep. Its like a big beautiful mountain rising into the sky. She yawns, showing off her teeth in the process, and starts looking for you. When she spots you she grins. \"Hey Rommie, sleep well?\" she asks. You blush under your fur and smile. The bed shifts as Lupa repositions her self so she's on all fours in front of you. She leans down with her ass in the air and gives you a wet kiss. Her tail wags as she does so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later Lupa is carrying you to the bathroom while humming. The smile on her face makes you confused at how someone so cute could have terrorized you. She draws a bath and steps in the tub, slowly lowering herself into the water. \"Ahh, this is nice.\" she says happily. You meanwhile are floating just in front of her, between her breasts. The sight of her naked in the tub makes you forget everything and you decide to just enjoy the moment as well. You lie back in the water and float until you bump into one of her boobs. She giggles and gives your stomach a rub with one of her claws. After a little while you climb onto her left boob and look up at her. \"So what do you have planned for today?\" you ask. \"Nothing really, since I got all my shopping done yesterday.\" she answers. \"So I guess I might do a little work, but mostly the two of us get to spend time together!\" The both of you smile until she picks you off of her boob and drops you in the water. \"I think we should finish up here.\" she says and begins washing. She starts with her upper body, washing her breasts. She sees you staring and chuckles. When she's done with that she moves to her lower body, making sure you see that as well. When she's finally done you're floating between her legs, blushing from watching her wash her privates. She then plucks you out of the water and begins lathering your fur. \"Okay, its your turn little guy.\" she says as she washes you. \"I can wash myself.\" you tell her. \"Too bad.\" she counters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two of you are done she takes you to the kitchen for some breakfast. \"How do you feel about more pancakes? Human free, of course.\" she asks. \"That would be great.\" you tell her. You watch as she cooks, paying special attention to her butt. Her tail wags happily while she makes breakfast. Once the two of you have eaten you start to think about your situation again. You want to be with Lupa, but this is pretty sudden. You feel like you should at least tell Cadence whats going on so she won't worry. \"Lupa, I've got something to take care of today, so I'll be out for a bit.\" you say. Lupa frowns and rubs your head. \"I'll  come with you.\" she says. \"Oh you don't have to. Its actually kind of a personal matter, I'll explain later.\" you respond quickly. She sets you on the floor, but continues frowning. \"Whats with the secrets?' she asks. \"Its nothing, trust me. I'll be back before you know it.\" you say as you back out of the door. When you're in the hall you think about how you'll explain this. She might love you, but she'll probably be mad that you're keeping secrets. You walk while you ponder this and come across....</span></div></div>",

Cadence gasps slightly and mumbles when she sees that you've become a werewolf. \"Uh hi Cadence,\" you say nervously. \"How're you doing?\" At first Cadence seems skeptical. \"Listen Cadence,\" you say. \"It's me, R.L., Nefernina cast a spell on me and well... I can prove it. Your name is Cadence Julia Deadman, your mother's name is Heidi and you've been a zombie for 15 years. You were afraid of the dark when you were five and...\" Cadence finally recognizes you and snatches you up before bringing you up to her rotting face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence yells and mutters in her zombie tongue and seems to freak out. She was really mad that you disappeared like that yesterday and from the tone in her voice it sounded like she had been worried. \"Yeah Cadence,\" you say. \"I know. I know. I'm sorry to worry y... huh?\" That's when you realize something. You somewhat understood what Cadence was saying. Could it be that since you were a werewolf now, you could hear her more coherently. \"How long have you had a German accent?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence grunts and groans, asking where you've been. \"Well,\" you say. \"I was with Lupa. She's my... my girlfriend now.\" Cadence lets out a loud bellow as if to ask \"What?!\". Cadence yells and gets angrier with you. \"Well,\" you say. \"Lupa and I have decided to live together from...\" Cadence yells and screams at you. She's warning you that this could go horribly wrong somehow and reminding you of all the times Lupa tried to eat you. \"I know this is Lupa, but thankfully she's no cannibal. I might even get her to quit humans cold turkey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence shakes her head and gives an annoyed look your way. \"Cadence, we're still friends. Just call me Romulus from now on.

Cadence walks away and you wave to her. \"Thanks Cadence. I knew you'd understand.\" You then scratch your chin with a claw because you have no idea how you'll work it out. You don't know if Cadence and Lupa can be friends. They didn't have any reason to dislike each other before you moved in. You'd have to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could say anymore on the matter, you hear tremors and look up to see Lupa coming forward. Your titanic wolf girlfriend sees you and smiles before picking you up and giving you a kiss. Yeah, you were getting used to it. Lupa places you in her cleavage and then giggles. \"You know, I don't know why, but you have a familiar taste to you Rommy.\" You let out a nervous laugh but Lupa decides to shrug it off before she starts to walk away with a skip in her step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure are in a good mood today Lupa.\" You say. Lupa lets out a giggle. \"Why wouldn't I be? I just decided to introduce my new boyfriend to the family.\" \"Family?\" you ask mentally. Uh-oh. You were about to meet Lupa's relatives. You know they might be suspicious of a human sized werewolf and really hope you can get along with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" says Lupa. \"My relatives are all pretty friendly. Except Selene and.... Persephone.\" Lupa's eyes almost tear up upon saying that name and you have no idea why. \"But,\" says Lupa. \"i'll stick to showing you my cousins here in Horrorville.\" That sounded scary.

Here's a photograph of her. Lupa hands you a photograph and you see that Miranda is an obese gold furred blonde werewolf with a bang over one of her eyes. For clothing she appeared to be wearing a bright red hood. Kinda ironic given her species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miranda eh?\" Lupa nods her head. \"She's kinda weird but she's friendly. I gotta visit her while I can. In a few weeks she'll be away at work for the whole Summer.\" \"Huh?\" \"She works as a counselor at a Summer camp,\" says Lupa. \"All the other counselors are off their rockers.\" Lupa lets out a laugh at that. \"I see.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope I don't see that girlfriend of hers though,\" says Lupa. \"I ain't prejudice or anything, but I don't care much for Gia.\" \"Why's that?\" you ask. Lupa lets out a sigh. \"For ten generations,\" she says. \"The Howler family has been all werewolves. Miranda is dating a girl who's not even a similar species. Gia's a bahamut. It's weird that I might end up with a cousin-in-law  that's not even a canine.\" \"Bahamut?\" you ask. \"You mean the giant fish in Arab mythology or the dragon from...\" Lupa is momentarily confused but shakes her head. \"Kinda a mix of both. Imagine a big old dragon that looks like a winged hippo with gills like a fish. That's Gia.\" \"Not that it concerns me,\" you say nervously. \"But does Gia eat humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupa lets out a laugh. \"Bahamuts normally don't. But Gia has a younger sister who's trying to stop eating humans.\" That gave you some hope. If some predators are trying to give up swallowing humans, maybe there was hope for Lupa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Lupa reaches Miranda's house at the edge of Horrorville and then parks her car. You stay in Lupa's cleavage and Lupa walks up to knock on the door and sure enough Miranda opens it.</span></div></div>",

Miranda motions for Lupa to enter as she goes back inside. Lupa shuts the door behind her and follows her cousin to the sofa. Miranda sits down and starts up a conversation. \"So what brings you here cousin?\" she asks. Lupa sits down next her before answering. As she does you get a better look at Miranda and find that she's pretty attractive too. She's got a nice big figure like Lupa, huge breasts included. You wonder if her whole family is this hot. Lupa must have caught you staring because she grips you between two claws in a huff. \"Actually I wanted to introduce you to my new boyfriend.\" she says. \"Boyfriend?\" Miranda asks. Lupa holds you up between her claws and Miranda leans in for a better look. In the process you catch a glimpse of her glorious cleavage. You look away though, not wanting to make Lupa mad. \"This is your boyfriend?\" she asks. \"A little small for a werewolf isn't he? I almost thought he was a human.\" Lupa scoffs. \"As if I'd date a human, I'm not April. Besides, he may be small, but at least he's a wolf.\" she says. Miranda rolls her eyes and decides not to get into this. Instead she offers you a claw. \"Well I'm Miranda little guy.\" she says. You extend your own paw and grab her claw, which is way too big for you to completely hold. \"Romulus, its nice to meet you.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter introductions Lupa and Miranda relax a little more and get more comfortable on the couch. Lupa places you on her shoulder as Miranda talks. \"So how did you two meet?\" she asks. \"I found him in the halls of my apartment building. The minute I caught his scent, I knew he was the one for me. We hit it off and he even moved in with me!\" Lupa tells her. Miranda laughs a little. \"So in other words, you took control and he couldn't say no because he's so tiny?\" she says. Lupa rolls her eyes but you secretly think that Miranda's right. \"Still, I'm glad you like him so much. I was starting to think you'd never get a guy, let alone such a cute one.\" the hooded wolf says. She then leans closer to you. \"Lupa can be a little rude at times, so she's been kind of unlucky with men.\" You chuckle at this and Lupa knocks you off of her shoulder into her cleavage. \"Don't listen to her, Rommy.\" she says as you climb up to the top of her shirt. You smile up at the two beautiful wolves as they stare down at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now how about I get to know you, Miranda?\" you ask. Miranda leans back in the sofa. \"Well I'm a counselor at Camp Darkly, which is a summer camp for girls. My main partner is a human named Edgar.\" she says. \"You told me about him before, right? He tastes great right?\" Lupa asks. You look up at your girlfriend and she turns a little red. \"Not that I'm thinking of eating humans.\" she adds quickly. \"Whats that?\" Miranda asks. \"Well, since I'm basically the size of a human I find it a little uncomfortable when they get eaten. It makes me feel like I could be eaten just as easily, so Lupa was nice enough to lay off eating humans.\" you explain. Miranda is shocked. \"Wow, you must really love him cuz. You were always such a predator when it came to humans.\" Then she looks at you. \"Edgar's a special case though. His mother is a Nidhogg sorceress, and she was worried for his safety so she cast a spell so he couldn't die. If he dies he just comes back to life. He may taste great, but he's still a good friend.\" You think Miranda is really nice, but now realize that if you were human right now she might eat you just like Lupa. \"Besides, I feel a little bad too.\" she continues. \"I kind of stole his girlfriend from him.\" Lupa rolls her eyes at this. \"Oh I know how you feel Lupa.\" Miranda says. \"I know you aren't crazy about the fact that she's not a werewolf, but she's a great Bahamut. You'll like her, just give it time.\" Lupa shakes her head but then smile. \"You're right, I don't really approve, but if it makes you happy then its fine.\" she says. Wow, Lupa really cares for her family. Though if she's hung up about Miranda dating a Bahamut you wonder how she'd feel if she knew you used to be human. After a little while...</span></div></div>",

You go red and your tail starts wagging uncontrollably, while Lupa smiles as she blushes. \"Wow, that quick?\" Miranda says. \"Guess you wanted to reel him in before he could get away huh?\" Lupa frowns at her cousin, but once again you secretly think she's right. You rub one of Lupa's breasts from your place between them and she looks down. Your smile makes her smile in turn. \"Man this is surreal, now if we could just get Selene a boyfriend.\" Miranda says. \"Good luck with that, I don't think anyone will ever crack that shell.\" Lupa says. You look up and inquire further. \"What is she anti-social?\" you ask. \"Yeah, she lives alone in the mountains and doesn't really care about offending people.\" Lupa tells you. \"Yeah but she loves the family and she's there when we need her.\" Lupa adds. \"You'll meet her soon enough Rommy. I want you to meet my whole pack.\" Miranda smiles sweetly at Lupa's affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda soon gets up and walks toward the kitchen. \"Well I'm getting a little hungry. Would you guys like anything?\" she asks. \"That sounds great!\" Lupa tells her. You tug at Lupa's breast fur and she glances down. You give her a telling look and she calls to Miranda. \"Can you make it human free today? Rommy would really appreciate it.\" Miranda laughs. \"Sure, I'm no stranger to a little restraint with a friend like Edgar. Besides, I'm still amazed that you of all people are showing any.\" she says. Lupa picks you out of her breasts and brings you in for a kiss. You both smooch each other with her's overpowering yours. When you are pulled away and see her face you once again are amazed that someone like her can smile like that. Its like she's a puppy. However she then demonstrates just who is in charge and who the real puppy is. She gives you a scratch on the ears and you feel like you're in heaven. Your tail begins wagging and you find yourself on your back exposing your belly. She then gives you a tummy rub and giggles. A rumbling signals that Miranda is coming and soon her huge face is peering at you from above. You go red in embarrassment and jump to a sitting position. \"He is a little cutie.\" the golden furred wolf says. You blush as you stare up at them, their titanic breasts partly obscuring your view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda returns to the kitchen and comes back with a couple of plates of meat. Its smells like some kind of deer, and is very rare. To your new wolf senses it smells delicious. The two women begin digging in, tearing at it like, well, animals. This isn't a special dinner like before, this is them eating normally. They rip and shred and even growl a little. You shrug and walk to Lupa's plate. You grab a piece of meat and bite into it. As if a switch is flipped you start tearing into it. It tastes great and you can't help but wag your tail. Soon you become aware of someone watching you and look up to see the two wolf girls grinning. \"Aaawwww...\" they both say in unison. The sight of a tiny werewolf chewing on a piece of meat happily with his tail wagging is too much for them. You stop mid bite and stare at them with the piece of meat hanging from your moth. This is also adorable to them and they give another \"Aaawwww...\" You glare at them but they also find this cute and you finally give up. The three of you finish eating and then...</span></div></div>",

I completely forgot!\" Miranda chuckles. \"I don't blame you. Your mind's been elsewhere lately.\" she says while scratching your head. \"Reunion?\" you ask. \"Yeah! Our whole pack gets together!\" Lupa tells you. She seems kind of excited. \"We're big on family, so its good to get the whole pack together once in a while.\" Miranda explains. Lupa nuzzles you to her cheek. \"The best part is I get to bring my boyfriend this time!\" she says happily. \"Everybody's gonna be really surprised.\" Miranda jokes. \"So when is it?\" you ask. \"Its in a week.\" Lupa answers. \"I can't believe I actually forgot!\" You sit there and think about what it will be like to meet the rest of Lupa's family. It would be terrifying under normal circumstances but since you're a werewolf you'll be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you and Lupa leave and head home. \"See you two soon!\" Miranda says from the door. As Lupa drives home she pats your head while you sit in her cleavage. \"I really can't wait for you to meet everyone Rommy.\" she says while she drives. \"What are they like?\" you ask. \"Now thats a big question. They're all different. Some are really nice like my cousin April and some are not so nice, like Selene.\" she answers. You lie back in her furry cleavage and wonder how it will go. When Lupa gets home you realize that you shouldn't worry about it since you have a whole week to prepare. Things in the apartment go pretty well. You and Lupa get closer and you make up with Cadence as well. She remains friends with you under the ruse of just meeting Romulus. She even helps you move your stuff without Lupa knowing. You don't know how, but she did it without Lupa picking up your old scent on anything. Cadence is really your best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week later its time for the reunion. Lupa is in the car driving there while you sit in your usual spot. \"So you ready Rommy?\" she ask smiling. \"Yeah...but do you think they'll like me?\" you say. \"Why wouldn't they? You're just so cute!\" she tells you. You come up on the park where its being held. \"Wow, this place is big!\" you marvel. \"Of course. My family is huge. I've got more cousins then I know what to do with.\" Lupa says. She parks her car and gets out with you still between her boobs. As she enters the park you are amazed at all the werewolves. Lupa walks over and says hi to...</span></div></div>",

The girl turns around and smiles. \"Lupa!\" she says and comes in for a hug. When she does her huge boobs collide with Lupa's squishing you in the process. It feels great and you have to admit that this girl's breasts are as good as Lupa's. \"Hey April, hows the reunion so far?\" Lupa asks. \"Its great! Its always nice to spend time with the family.\" April says. \"Well this year I brought my boyfriend.\" Lupa says proudly. April squeals excitedly. \"Really?! Its about time! Where is he?\" she says. Lupa plucks you out of her cleavage and presents you. \"Meet Romulus.\" she says. April stands there for a second and then leans in for a closer look. \"He is a little cutie.\" she notes as she looks you over. \"Um, its a pleasure to meet you.\" you say nervously. \"You don't think my size is strange?\" April just laughs. \"While I'll admit you're kind of small for a werewolf, I can't hold it against you. My Stephen is just as small.\" she tells you. \"He is?\" you ask intrigued. \"He's like me?\" April grins. \"Well not exactly, he's a human.\" That takes you by surprise. \"Oh please, April. Why would you want a human boyfriend?\" Lupa asks. That actually hurts your feelings a little. \"Because he's so cute!\" April replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two wolves begins moving through the park and eventually come across a werewolf who looks older than them. She's got gray fur and a big belly, much bigger than Lupa's. \"Oh, Lupa and April!\" What are you two doing here?\" she asks pleasantly. \"We're at our family reunion aunt Diana.\" Lupa says with a sigh. As April chats with Diana Lupa looks down at you. \"Aunt Diana's kind of scatterbrained.\" she whispers. You nod as Lupa joins the other two. \"Introduce your boyfriend Lupa.\" April says. Lupa presents you to her aunt. \"This is Romulus.\" she says. Diana leans in curiously. \"He is a small one isn't he?\" she says. \"Pleased to meet you.\" You smile at her. \"Same here.\" Lupa returns you to her breasts, and after a minute of talking Diana is staring at you. \"Lupa, I think you have something in your cleavage.\" she says and picks you up. Just as you are brought to her face though another paw snatches you. \"Jeez mom, you just met him.\" a voice says. You are then turned to face a black furred werewolf with icy blue eyes. \"Uh, hi.\" you say with a wave. \"Hey there little guy. My names Hecate.\" she tells you. You get a good look at her and see that she's slimmer than the others, with a nice hourglass figure. Hecate hands you back to Lupa and they get to talking. As they do you come to the conclusion that everyone in this family is hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls move to a table and continue to talk. \"Yeah, I started working at a newspaper.\" Hecate says. \"So you finally got a steady job huh?\" Lupa muses. \"Working freelance payed the bills but i thought I'd try something new.\" Hecate responds. They all begin eating from the food on the table and April stops. \"Hey Lupa, you don't usually eat at the human free table.\" she notices. \"Hey thats right.\" Hecate says. Lupa pauses and then explains. \"I'm trying to ease off on humans for Rommy. He's the size of one so it makes him uncomfortable.\" The others stare and April gives an \"Aaaaaaww.\" Another wolf at the table overheard. \"I don't see how anyone can eat humans. They taste horrible.\" This one has red and white fur and looks like a collie. She's just as big and attractive as the others. \"Oh, hey Colleen.\" Hecate says. Colleen sits with the rest of them and gives you a pat on the head. \"Don't worry, none of us eat humans at this table.\" she tells you. You like how this is going. Lupa's family is really nice, and you never thought there would be this many who don't eat humans. You enjoy the moment and....</span></div></div>",

Then a faint booming signals that someone is coming over. A shadow appears over you and you look up to see a massive werewolf with red fur and red hair tied in a ponytail that reaches down to her back. She's definitely heavy like her relatives, but she's not as big as Lupa. She also has a bit of an amazonian figure, with some muscle in there. Just like the rest of the family she's quite a looker, and is taller than the rest of them. \"Hey Autumn!\" April says and gives this new wolf a hug. Autumn returns the hug and looks over the others at the table. \"Its nice to see you guys! Still at the human free table though huh?\" she says. Then she sees Lupa and looks confused. \"Wait a second, why are you over here Lupa?\" she asks. Lupa sighs and explains once again. \"My new boyfriend isn't comfortable when I eat humans so I'm trying to lay off them for him.\" Autumn stares for a second. \"You have a boyfriend? Did you bring him?\" she asks. Lupa picks you up off the table and presents you to her cousin. \"Yup, here he is. Meet Romulus.\" Autumn squints at you for a better look and her eyes widen a little. \"Wow, he's small! I can see why he'd be a little uneasy about eating humans though. He could end up a meal himself!\" She laughs and then offers a claw. \"Well I'm Autumn. Nice to meet you.\" You shake her claw as best as you can and Lupa puts you back on the table. \"Autumn here is an architect. One of the best around in fact.\" Colleen says. \"She even built our cousin Selene's house.\" \"So she eats humans?\" you ask. \"You bet I do!\" Autumn answers. \"They're delicious!\" She still seems pretty nice though. \"With you're talent you could afford to move to a better neighborhood. I don't know why you stay in the awful place.\" April says with a sigh. \"Where does she live?\" you ask. \"Panicburg.\" Hecate says. \"Its one of the worst places in the monster world. There's crime and danger around almost every corner.\" Autumn scoffs and lets out another laugh. \"Please, you all know I can handle myself.\" she says. She does look tougher than the rest of the wolves at this table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Selene, get over here!\" Autumn calls out. Suddenly another werewolf walks over to the table. She's pretty fat with red tinted gray fur and hair reaching down to her shoulders. \"What is it?\" she asks. Then she spots you and snatches you off of the table. \"How did a human get over-\" she says before catching your scent. She looks closer and sees that you're a werewolf. Autumn grabs you from her and holds you in her paw. \"Whoa there. This is Lupa's boyfriend, Romulus.\" Selene looks over at Lupa. \"A little small isn't he?\" At this point you're used to hearing that. \"Yeah, but he's just the best mate I could ask for.\" Lupa tells her. \"He could be human he's so small though.\" Selene says as she examines you. Its probably because you're a werewolf but she doesn't appear to be hostile toward you. She just seems kind of rude. \"Yeah, in fact thats why I'm at this table. It makes him uncomfortable when I eat humans.\" Selene rolls her eyes. \"You're gonna stop eating humans for a guy? You must really like him.\" she says. \"Well now that Lupa's got a guy we just need to get you hooked up.\" April tells Selene, who shakes her head. \"I'm good.\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then yet another person walks over and you recognize this one. Its Miranda, but there's also a bahamut with her. That must be her girlfriend, Gia. \"Whats with this group over here?\" Miranda asks. \"Nothing, Lupa's just introducing her boyfriend.\" Colleen says. \"Hey Romulus.\" Miranda says to you. You wave at her and Gia peers at you. \"Wow, he really is human sized.\" she says. \"Whats going on with this family. One's with a bahamut, one's with a shrimp, and one's gaga over a human.\" Selene says. \"Its nice to see you too Selene.\" Gia says. Miranda laughs as Selene gives Gia a pat on the shoulder. \"Don't mind her.\" Lupa tells you. \"Selene's a little rough around the edges but she really cares for the family.\" Meanwhile Miranda and Gia are talking about you. \"I can see why he'd be against eating humans.\" Gia says. \"It'd probably feel like eating another monster.\" Selene chuckles. \"I don't know, Persephone gets along pretty well.\" Everyone stops and looks at her for a second. Lupa, April and Colleen look down at the table while Miranda and Autumn frown at her. Hecate on the other hand is flat out glaring at Selene, who puts her hands up. \"Okay okay I'm sorry. Off limits, I know.\" she says. You glance at Diana and see that she's looking around with a blank expression, like she's trying to find something else to focus on. You look at Lupa who leans close to you. \"Our cousin Persephone is a criminal who's wanted for murder and cannibalism.\" Then your memory is jogged. That famous cannibal is Lupa's cousin?! \"Its a touchy subject.\" she goes on. \"With a family this big there are bound to be some law breakers, but Persophone's the worst case.\" You nod and give her a kiss on the nose, which makes her smile and lick you. As the situation cools down...</span></div></div>",

Everyone at the table gets up and looks in surprise at one particular wolf woman walking forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis new wolf looked a lot like Hecate and was even hourglass shaped like her. However, she looked vastly different. She had fur and hair as white as snow and eyes as red as blood. She was wearing a black shirt and jeans that had a large red stain on the side. She was also wearing a black sun hat and a red vest that given the two extra sleeves tied in a knot, obviously belonged to somebody else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white werewolf gave a sinister smile as she came forward. \"Persephone.\" Says Lupa in surprise. You let out a look of pure horror. <i>That</i> was Persephone. So you'll finally meet the black sheep of the family. An interesting choice of words given that she was a white wolf. \"Hey all,\" says the white werewolf. \"Miss me?\" Instantly, Hecate begins to glare at her sister and lets out an angry growl. Clearly there was some bad blood between them. Diana however was stunned and looked about ready to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Persephone,\" says Diana as she walks towards her daughter. \"Is it really you.\" Before Diana could approach Persephone, Hecate steps in front of her and snarls. \"You're not welcome here Persephone.\" Says the black wolf with a growl. Persephone lets out a scoff. \"Still as bitter as ever are we, Hecate.\" Hecate growls again and Persephone growls back. It looks like there is going to be a fight but Diana grabs Hecate's tail before Hecate can do anything. \"Hecate Howler,\" says Diana sternly. \"There will be no fighting here. Your sister has returned.\" Diana smiles but Hecate ain't smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" says Hecate. \"It's apparent that Under Gloom desperately needs a security upgrade.\" Hecate lets out a scoff. \"Shows what you know. Demona doesn't even know I escaped yet.\" That word made you gasp. \"<i>Demona</i>?!\" you well in surprise. \"I thought she was just a character in a cartoon! She's real!\" \"Don't panic Rommy,\" whispers Lupa. \"The Warden of Under Gloom is named Destiny Sirtis. The inmates call her Demona because she looks just her.\" That was a scary thought. From context Destiny was a gargoyle. Given her appearance you can't help but think she'd be even harder on humans than Nefernina, if that's even possible. You could almost imagine Destiny roasting humans alive and eating them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone looks around and smiles. \"Looks like the gang's all here.\" That's when Persephone notices Gia and Gia begins to sweat red liquid. You heard that hippos sweat blood and it looks like bahamuts do as well. Persephone begins to drool. \"I haven't had a bahamut in ages. The thick flesh of a dragon combined with the white meat of a fish and the fatty tissue of a hippopotamus. Yum.\" Miranda steps in front of her girlfriend and growls at Persephone. \"Don't you get any ideas Persephone,\" says Miranda as she holds up her claws. \"She's going to be your cousin one day.\" Persephone lets out a laugh. \"I was kidding Miranda. Mostly.\" Gia starts to bite her nails nervously before she walks up to Selene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike everyone else Selene doesn't take it as a big deal that Persephone is out of prison and Selene actually smiles and shakes hands with Persephone. \"Glad to see you again cuz. We were just talking about you.\" Persephone smiles at Selene and then sniffs the air. She squints in confusion and turns to Lupa who looks at her in fear. \"Lupa,\" says Selene. \"It's been years since I've seen you.\" Persephone pokes Lupa's belly and grins. \"It seems the humans still don't stand a chance against the mighty huntress. But there's something peculiar in the air. Persephone then notices you quivering behind Lupa's neck and out of curiosity snatches you up as Lupa screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone holds you to her face and you shiver in the white wolf's grip before looking up at a big red eye the size of a moon. \"Please don't hurt him,\" says Lupa in worry. \"Rommy's my boyfriend.\" Persephone scratches her chin and shows her teeth, her back molars stained with blood from her previous meal. \"You're unusually small for a werewolf aren't you. And you smell a little off.\" You begin to sweat and even feel like you're going to wet your fur. You really hope Persephone doesn't like to eat other werewolves.</span></div></div>",

I'm not gonna eat your little boyfriend.\" she says. \"So you don't eat werewolves?\" you ask hopefully. \"Oh don't get me wrong little guy, I'll eat a werewolf, just  not one of my own pack. Since Lupa here seems to like you though I'll let you off.\" she tells you. Then she lightly tosses you back to Lupa, who catches you and looks you over. \"I'd say he's an honorary member of the pack, so he's safe.\" Persephone tells her. Lupa smiles gratefully, but Persephone leans closer. \"Just don't hurt her, or you'll be my next snack.\" she tells you menacingly. \"That goes for you too, hippo. Treat my cousin right.\" she says to Gia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything calms down relatively and you find yourself in Lupa's lap as she sits. Everyone seems to be happy that Persephone is here. Everyone except Hecate at least. \"You'd better be serious about not hurting anyone, or you'll have to deal with me.\" she tells her sister. Persephone waves her off. \"Oh please. We both know that if we fight it'll go on forever. Its been like that since we were pups.\" she says. Hecate glares and Autumn speaks up. \"Yeah, but if you start any trouble how long do you think you'll last against me?\" she asks. She and Persephone share a laugh. \"I won't mess with you Autumn. You've always been one of the toughest monsters around.\" the white wolf says. \"Stop all this fighting talk.\" Diana says as she gives Persephone a hug. \"I'm so glad to see you sweety.\" Persephone returns the hug. \"I love you too mom.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings actually seem pretty okay now. Persephone has been friendly to you and Gia, and everyone is getting along. Even Hecate is tolerating her sister thanks to their mother.

She pours herself a drink and picks you back up. \"Thirsty?\" she asks as she lowers you to the cup. You drink your fill and then signal for her to pull you up. \"Thanks.\" you say as she puts you back down. You are next to a plate of beef and you see a black paw come down to grab some. Looking up you see it belongs to a chubby wolf girl with red fur. Her paws, tail, and ears are black though. When this girl sees you she stops for a second. \"I'm sorry, did I scare you?\" she asks apologetically. \"No, I-\" you start. \"I didn't mean to imply that you're easily scared, its just that you're so small. Not that there's anything wrong with that!\" she rambles, interrupting you. \"Penny, its fine.\" Lupa says and puts a hand on the girl's shoulder. \"Rommy this is Penumbra, but we all call her Penny. As you can see she's a little...timid.\" Penny smiles weakly and offers a claw, which you grab and shake. \"So you don't eat human either?\" you ask. \"Well I used to but thinking about the poor little creatures suffering made me stop.\" she tells you. \"Yeah but she can't say she doesn't still love the taste. Back then humans were one of her favorite foods.\" Lupa says, then puts her arm around Penny. \"I recently stopped too though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA booming noise begins and Autumn comes over to the table. \"Hey guys, its game time!\" she says. Lupa grabs you and you all head to the field. \"What kind of game is this?\" you ask. \"Maul ball.\" Lupa tells you. \"The object is to get the ball to your goal. The other team tries to maul you and take it so you have to be quick and strong.\" \"Okay, so how are we gonna do this?\" Autumn asks. Persephone then gets up and comes forward. \"How about two on two? Me and Hecate will take on anyone.\" she says with a smirk. \"Like hell we will! I'm not teaming with-\" Hecate begins but Diana steps in. \"Oh, my girls are together again and playing just like when they were cubs!\" she says happily and claps her paws. Hecate sees the happy look on her mother's face and sighs, accepting the situation. Persephone grins and puts an arm around her, much to Hecate's discomfort. \"That settles that, now who else is playing?\" she asks. \"Well since you two are teaming up how about two other sisters?\" Autumn says and puts an arm around Penny. \"What? But I'm not very good, I'll just lose.\" she says worriedly. \"Don't sweat it sis, its all in fun.\" Autumn tells her. Penny looks up at her big sister and nods. Suddenly she's more determined. \"Okay sis.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAutumn and Penny stand on one side of the field while Hecate and Persephone stand on the other. Penny looks nervous while Hecate looks annoyed. The ball, which is shaped like a little cow, is thrown in the air and all four wolves go after it. Autumn covers Penny enough for her to get the ball, which surprises her. \"I did it!\" she exclaims excitedly. \"Get it to the goal!\" Autumn yells with a smile. Penny runs toward the goal on all fours with the ball in her mouth, but Hecate is soon after her. She quickly catches up and lightly tackles Penny to the ground. Then she pulls the ball out of her mouth and throws it to Persephone. \"Sorry Penny. You okay?' she asks as she keeps the chubby wolf pinned. \"Yeah.\" Penny says a little disappointed that she lost the ball. While Hecate went easy on Penny the other two are serious. Persephone runs for her goal but Autumn pounces from the side and the two of them roll around fighting for the ball. They both growl as they compete for victory. One will get the ball, then lose it, then get it again. These two are serious. Eventually Persephone is running across the field while Autumn chases her. Autumn lunges for her again but the white wolf dodges and makes it to the goal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow I can't believe you beat me.\" Autumn says and puts a paw on Persephone's shoulder. \"You might be stronger than me, but years of being on the run taught me to evade trouble.\" Persephone says. Diana runs up and hugs both of her daughters. \"See? You two always did make a great team!\" she says. Both of them hug her back, but Hecate rolls her eyes. \"Sorry Autumn.\" Penny says sadly. \"Its okay sis. You gave it your all. You even got the ball first!\" Autumn tells her.

She lifts you up to her face and gives you a lick. \"Wish me luck Rommy.\" she says and hands you off to Hecate. \"Watch him for me.\" Hecate nods and holds you in her paw. As Lupa stomps out onto the field you see April joining her. \"Guess its me and you.\" she says. You see that Colleen and Selene are the other team. \"Looks like the plus sized gals are stepping up.\" Persephone says. \"Hey, Rommy likes it.\" Lupa says with a huff. \"So does my Stephen!\" adds April. The four of them take their places and begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball is thrown into the air and all four of them go for it. April and Lupa are working together while Colleen seems to be supporting Selene, who gets the ball. \"Thanks for the assist cuz!\" Selene yells as she takes off. Lupa and April are in pursuit while Colleen tries to run interference. You can't believe how fast they are. They're definitely not as fit as Autumn or the twins, but they can still move pretty good. Back when you were human you remember cursing how fast Lupa was when she cornered you so many times. Now you're admiring her big beautiful body as she runs along the field. Not to mention her cousins, who are all pretty great as well. Selene is almost at the goal when April manages to catch up and tackle her. They roll around enough for Lupa to catch up and jump into the pile. Colleen is bringing up the rear and she tries to get them off of Selene. She does, but Lupa also gets the ball. She takes off for her goal and has a good lead, since April is slowing the other two down. When Selene finally catches up Lupa just barely wins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! We won!\" April yells and jumps for joy. Lupa walks over to Hecate and grins at you. \"Like what your girl can do?\" she asks. \"That was amazing! I never knew you could move like that!\" you tell her. \"Well werewolves are natural hunters, so we can be pretty quick when we need to.\" Hecate says. \"Even the big girls.\" Persephone adds. Lupa takes you back and....</span></div></div>",

You are pressed into her lips and she holds the kiss for a couple of seconds. April watches and sighs. \"One day Stephen and I will be like that.\" she says dreamily. Everyone around rolls their eyes. \"Ever the dreamer.\" a voice says. You turn to see who said that, and find that it was a werewolf with white fur like Persephone. She's got a similar hourglass figure as well with flowing black hair and is wearing a black jacket and a black skirt. \"And dreams come true Snow.\" April says while sticking her tongue out. Something you immediately notice about this new girl Snow is her accent. She sounds British, and her outfit also has a very British feel to it. She walks over to you and leans in close for a better look. \"Snow, this is my new boyfriend Romulus.\" Lupa says happily. Snow gives you a sniff, and stares for a second. You get kind of nervous, like you're being judged. Next she rubs your head and chest, as if feeling your fur. When she's done she looks at Lupa with a smile. \"Seems like he's of good quality. I approve.\" she says. Lupa grins and gives her a hug. \"What can I say? He's the best!\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lupa breaks the hug you look at the two of them confused. Lupa gives you an awkward smile and explains. \"Snow here is kind of particular about some things. If someone in the pack gets a new boyfriend or girlfriend she always has to give them a rating.\" she says. Snow gives a HMPH. \"I just want to make sure my family is doing okay.\" she says. Then she reaches down and scratches you under the chin. \"You seem to be a fine specimen though.\" she says. \"I trust you'll treat my cousin right.\" You close your eyes and enjoy the scratching until Lupa chuckles. \"You can stop now, I don't want him falling for you.\" she says to her British cousin. The two of them share a laugh and head toward the food. Snow reaches past a couple bowls and grabs a handful of humans from a fancy looking one. You wince as she throws them in her mouth and grinds them with her teeth. \"Snow's also picky when it comes to food.\" Lupa says. \"She won't eat humans if they're not up to her standards in quality. We make sure to have a good supply of the best humans for the reunions.\" Snow swallows her food and nods. \"She also great at sewing.\" Lupa adds. \"One of the best seamstresses around.\" Snow smiles. \"Yes, but I mainly get payed by private parties for individual projects.\" she says. \"I don't have my own fashion line like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where are you from?\" you ask Snow as she and Lupa walk together. \"I'm from Chillingham.\" she answers its very far away from Horrorville, practically on the other side of Mons Terra.\" That makes you think. You know about places like Horrorville, Terrordale, and Fearfield, but you tend to forget there are places beyond even there. Mons Terra is already huge to someone your size but its also got many other cities and countries like the human world. Its interesting that Lupa has family that far away. \"Just how many places in Mons Terra do you guys have family?\" you ask amazed. Lupa laughs and Snow chuckles. \"I'd say there are howlers in every part of Mons Terra.\" Lupa says. \"Our family roots go back a long way.\" Snow adds. Wow, Lupa's family just get more interesting.</span></div></div>",

One of them has bright orange fur with wild looking orange hair that reaches down to her butt. She's wearing a low cut shirt and a pair of jeans. The other wolf has midnight color fur with straight hair also going down to her butt. She's wearing jeans and a t shirt. Both of them are pear shaped. The two of them begin making plates of food and are chatting with each other as they do so. The orange one suddenly looks in your direction and points at you. The next thing you know they're stomping over to Lupa and Snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys!\" the orange wolf says brightly. \"Hey Skolla.\" Lupa says. \"Hello.\" Snow says. \"I take it you two are well.\" Skolla smiles and wraps her arm around the other wolf. \"Yup! Still music sensations!\" she says. Then you realize that you've seen them before. They're a singing duo that's pretty famous, You've seen them on TV a few times and they're pretty good. Skolla leans closer and studies you, catching you off guard. \"So who's the little guy?\" she asks Lupa. \"This is my boyfriend Romulus.\" Lupa answers. Skolla and the midnight wolf look surprised for a second. \"Whoa! You finally nabbed someone huh?\" Skolla says happily, then offers you a claw. \"I'm Skolla, and this is my sister Hatie.\" she says, pointing to the midnight wolf. \"Nice to meet you.\" Hatie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the introductions Skolla leans in closer, giving you a toothy grin. \"So how did you win over Lupa? Or did she get you?\" she asks. You laugh awkwardly before answering. \"Well, I guess you can say she just sort of picked me up.\" you say. Lupa scratches your head. \"He was wandering the halls of my apartment building when I found him.\" she says \"So you trapped him?\" Hatie asks with a smirk. \"No!\" Lupa argues. \"We hit it off right away!\" You decide to ask some questions of your own. \"So what's it like being famous?\" you ask. Skolla laughs and gives your head a rub. \"Your girlfriend is famous too, why don't you ask her?\" she says. You look up and see Lupa smiling.That is true, she does have her own fashion line. Skolla continues however. \"Its pretty nice, we get to travel a lot.\" she answers. \"But we spend most of our time at home in Scream Town.' Hatie adds. \"You live in the same town as Penny?\" you ask. \"Yeah, its a real nice place! We even have another relative there!\" Skolla says.</span></div></div>",

She's heavy set with dark gray fur and long hair. Your attention however is on her boobs. They're huge, even by monster standards. She's wearing a button up shirt that looks pretty tight on those puppies as well as a pair of tight jeans. \"Well speak of the devil!\" Skolla says as the new wolf arrives at the table. \"This is Remy.\" Hatie tells you. \"She lives in Scream Town like us.\" Remy looks confused for a second. \"Who are you-?\" she starts before seeing you. \"And who's this?\" she asks nicely while leaning down for a closer look. \"This is Romulus, my boyfriend.\" Lupa says. Remy looks at Lupa with a smile. \"Good job on getting a cute one, even if he is a little small.\" she says. Lupa pulls you in for a hug on her cheek. \"That just makes him cuter.\" she says happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore booming tells you someone else is coming and you look to see who it is. If Remy made you stare then this one makes your jaw drop. The wolfess approaching has ivory fur and red eyes, along with short black hair. Just like Remy however her most prominent feature is her boobs. If Remy's were big then this new wolf's are a new level. They're so big they look like they could fill her lap if she sat down. They're being contained in a black bra and corset. How she can hold them up is a mystery to you. When she reaches your group Lupa gives one of her boobs a tap. \"Hey Aiba. Still carrying those milk jugs.?\" Aiba rolls her eyes. \"Very funny.\" she says. \"I know you're just jealous.\" Lupa rolls her eyes as well. \"Yeah, cause I need a couple of beach balls on my chest.\" she counters. Aiba chuckles. \"Well that little guy seems to like them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupa looks down and sees you ogling her cousin's boobs. Not just Aiba but Remy as well. You are brought out of your trance by a bop on the head from Lupa's claw. \"Rommy!\" she says sharply. You snap to attention and look up at her. \"Uh, whats up?\" you ask. The other wolves share a laugh while Lupa pouts. \"Aww don't let it get to you. We get stares all the time.\" Remy says. \"Especially Aiba.\" Aiba gives you a scratch on the head and explains. \"Remy just has big boobs, but I have Lactose Overload Syndrome. They fill with milk that I can't lactate.\" You think you've heard of that before. \"Is it tough holding them?\" you ask. \"Yeah, but there are ways to help.\" she says. \"I'm actually wearing a mythril bra.\"  \"That's interesting.\" you say, trying not to stare. Lupa is watching you like a hawk. You all continue talking...</span></div></div>",

She's easily the largest one here. You guess she must be about 1600 feet tall. She has brown fur and an hourglass figure that fills out very nicely. Her huge boobs and thick thighs are contained in a black business suit that really shows off her figure and she has long brown hair. You get lost in staring at her and end up tumbling off of Lupa's shoulder when she suddenly steps forward. As you fall into her cleavage you hear her talking. \"Hey mom!\" your girlfriend says. Mom!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupa gives her mother a big hug, squishing you between her boobs. When the hug ends she stands back and looks up at her. \"Nice to see you.\" she says. The larger wolf ruffles her hair. \"Its always nice to see my family.\" she says with a smile. Aiba walks over as well to give her mom a hug. Her milk filled jugs make it a little difficult. You can't help staring as they press against her mother. \"How are you mom?\" Aiba asks. \"Oh I'm fine.\" her mom says. \"Just as busy as always. What about you? Are your breasts fine?\" Aiba presses her mammaries together. \"Yes, mother. You know I like them like this.\" she says. Her mother rolls her eyes with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, there's someone I want you to meet.\" Lupa says. You suddenly get nervous and dive in between her boobs. Lupa giggles and reaches in to fish you out. \"Don't be shy now!\" she says. Her claw grabs your leg and yanks you out. She presents you to her mother dangling upside down. \"Mom, this is my boyfriend Romulus. Rommy, this is my mom.\" she says. Her mom grabs you and places you in her paw, then offers a claw. \"Alfina Howler.\" she says with a smile.  \"Mom is the current head of the Howler family.\" Aiba tells you. \"She's the head of a big company that has a hand in almost every Howler business. Autumn's architect business, Lupa's fashion designing, and loads of others.\" April chimes in as well. \"She even gave me a loan to start my shop!\" she says happily.

You flinch as the humongous claws lift you up. She brings you to her face and turns you over, looking at you from all sides. You can feel her claws probing and squeezing you. When it finally stops you feel a little worn out. Alfina finally gives you a couple of sniffs and hands you back to Lupa. \"He seems alright.\" she says. \"And quite a cute one too. Good job dear.\" Lupa grins and gives you a kiss. \"I knew you would like him!\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Diana walk over and grab Alfina's paw. \"Isn't it great sis? Your daughter found herself a man and I get to see my kids together again!\" she says happily. Persephone comes up behind her and waves. \"Hey aunt Alfie.\" she says. Alfina looks at the white wolfess with what looks like a mix of emotions. She definitely looks glad to see her but still concerned about something, probably the whole escaped criminal thing. \"Hello Persephone. It is nice to see you again despite your circumstances. I trust your panting is still as good as ever?\" she says. \"You bet! A little time in the clink can't kill my talent!\" she states proudly. Diana beams at her daughter and sister. \"Thats my girl! Just like I taught her! Oh I remember when she and Hecate were pups and would work on their little projects together.\" the big bellied wolf says happily. Persephone grins while Hecate, who is also nearby, rolls her eyes. Alfina looks at her sister with a sympathetic smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your aunt sure seems happy.\" you tell Lupa from her shoulder. \"Well of course.\" Alfina says. \"She's one of the sweetest girls in the family, and when her daughter was arrested for cannibalism she had a bit of a breakdown. Persephone visits her occasionally while she's on the run but Diana has just never been the same.\" You watch Diana talking happily with her daughters. Her joy even seems to be causing Hecate to lighten up a little. Alfina sighs. \"I understand though. I would be sad if I never saw my daughters. I'm sure my mother would feel the same about my sisters and I. Sisters? As in more than one?</span></div></div>",

Her hair is long and spiky and is a mix of orange and blue in color. Her tail is pretty spiky as well.  She's a little heavy set with large breasts and a wide ass and hips. She wearing a low cut shirt and a pair of tight jeans that emphasize her thighs. At first glance you would say she looks like a rocker. The other wolf is taller with darker orange fur. She's got a more fit figure, like an amazon. Her hair is red and cut short. Her attire consists of a black tank top and pair of jeans. Her bust is pretty big but not as big as the other girl's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two new girls walk up and greet you all. \"Hey hey everyone!\" says the rocker looking one. \"Whats up?\" Alfina smiles as the orange and blue wolf gives her a hug. Looking closer now you would say she's 850 feet tall. \"Hello Fenra.\" she says. \"Aunt Fenra is Skolla and Hatie's mom.\" Lupa says. She looks like some kind of rock star.\" you comment. \"She did use to be one a while ago.\" Lupa says. \"She quit when Skolla and Hatie's act took off to support them.\" Fenra sees Lupa talking to you and walks over. \"Well who's the little guy?\" she asks. After Lupa introduces you Fenra offers a claw to shake. \"Fenra Howler.\" she says. \"You've met my daughters I assume?\" You nod, trying not to look at her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other orange wolfess comes over as well. Up close you would say she's 1200 feet. \"Hello there.\" she says and offers a claw as well. \"Lodelia Howler, nice to meet you.\" You grab her claw but when she shakes it you have to really hold on to avoid being flung away. \"Aunt Lodelia!\" Lupa says. \"Careful!\" Lodelia stops and rubs the back of her head. \"Sorry about that. Sometimes I don't control my strength very well.\" she says. She gives you a pat on the head, which feels pretty rough even though she's holding back. \"Bloody here is a construction worker so she's used to using her muscles.\" Fenra tells you. \"But hey, the gangs all here!\" she says to her sisters.

Do you eat humans?\" you ask. Alfina pats your head. \"While I don't make it a point to go after humans, I occasionally eat them. It might seem cruel, but thats just the way of the world.\" She really is suited to be in charge. The way she says it makes you want to agree with her. </span></div></div>",

Autumn gives her a look. \"Come on, between you and Penny we had to deal with tons of kids making you cry.\" she teases. The rest of the girls chuckle at April's expense, except for Penny, who is blushing as well. \"Hey, at least I got tougher!\" April objects. Selene nods. \"I have to give that to you. You're not afraid to throw down now.\" she states. Autumn pats Penny on the back. \"That doesn't mean you're still a baby.\" she says, making her sister smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you guys talking about my daughter?\" a voice asks. You hear the familiar booming of an approaching woman and turn to see a werewolf with gray fur. She's about 950 feet tall and built like Fenra, with a large bust, thighs, and hips, but is a little more toned. She's got long hair the same color as her fur and is wearing a black t-shirt with tight pants. \"Hey mom.\" April says, and makes room at the table. This new wolf sits down and grabs a cow from April's plate. As she tosses it in her mouth she spots you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's the little guy Lupa?\" she asks. \"This is my boyfriend Romulus.\" Lupa tells her, and holds you out in her paw. \"Barcetta Howler, pleased to meet to meet  you.\" April's mom says.\" You're kind of tiny huh?\" You smile and roll your eyes. \"Yeah, I get that a lot.\" you say. \"Well that's fine, my little girl here is after a tiny guy herself.\" she says, while nudging April. \"And he'll be mine one of these days!\" April declares. \"That's the spirit.\" Barcetta tells her. \"I'll have that son-in-law yet. Human or monster, if you chose him, he's good enough for me!\" The other wolves chuckle at this enthusiastic duo. \"So what do you do for a living?\" you ask Barcetta. \"Oh I'm a blacksmith.\" she answers. \"Is business good?\" you ask. \"I'm a Howler, of course its good!\" she says. \"Mons Terra isn't like the human world. With all the monsters and magic, some good armor comes in handy. I'm one of the best blacksmiths around, so the customers just flow in.\" she folds her arms proudly. \"I also do decorative pieces, so there's something for everyone at my shop!\" It sounds like she's giving a sales pitch. \"That's where April gets her tenacity.\" Lupa tells you.</span></div></div>",

The Howlers then look up and Lupa's eyes pop. \"Oh no. Incoming!\" Everyone gets out of the way as a strange aircraft comes down from the sky. The craft resembles a whirlybird of some sort but with the wings of a jumbo jet. It creates a sonic boom that knocks the leaves off of a nearby tree. Barcetta let out a sigh. \"I was wondering when <i>they</i> would show up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aircraft then tilts and flies upwards into the sky and does a loop-de-loop right before swerving, forcing Remy and Aiba to move out of the way. In the process, Aiba is pinned underneath her own breasts and groans. \"Skolla! Hatie! A little help here, please?!\" The aircraft is still swerving and you look in fear. \"What the heck is that?!\" you ask. \"It's Crescent and Trini,\" said Alfina as she lets out a sigh. \"And it looks like one of the latter's crazy contraptions is on the futz again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point, that one of the engines on the flying machine explodes, causing the craft to plummet to the ground right as two monsters leap out before the flying machine violently crashes. The two monsters piloting the craft come down from the sky wearing parachutes. One of them you assume is another cousin as she's a chubby blue-furred werewolf with long blonde hair. Her hair and fur were worn in a poodle-cut and she was wearing a steampunk-style dress with glasses and like Aiba, she had Lactose Overload Syndrome, though her breasts weren\u2019t as massive as Aiba\u2019s. Though they were still quite large. The other monster looked like a yellow-furred and black-haired saber-tooth tiger with a cream-colored stomach. She was very fat with an enormous butt. She was wearing a white lab coat and skin-tight jeans but no bra or shirt at all. Both of them stood 900ft tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like it\u2019s back to the drawing board.\u201d Said the tiger woman with a sigh. \u201cI told you we should\u2019ve taken the train.\u201d Said the blue wolf in an annoyed tone. Alfina let out a groan. \u201cGeez, Trini,\u201d she said. \u201cCould you be more careful? You\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t kill anyone.\u201d \u201cSorry about the mess, Alfina,\u201d said the blue wolf. \u201cTrini\u2019s been on a flying machine kick.\u201d You just stare at the wolf as the tigress is shaking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are those two?\u201d you ask. Lupa let out a sigh. \u201cThat\u2019s my cousin Crescent and her wife, Trini. They\u2019re from Direopolis.\u201d Miranda shook her head. \u201cTrini is an inventor by trade.\u201d \u201cAnd not a very good one,\u201d says Gia. \u201cDon\u2019t expect her to build anything that works perfectly.\u201d Crescent gives a growl. \u201cHey!\u201d she yells. \u201cI heard that, hippo hips. Trini\u2019s inventions work... sometimes.\u201d \u201cLike that machine that made truck tires out of swiss cheese?\u201d asked Lodelia as she crossed her arms. Trini just held her head down but then she realized something and then took out a pair of mechanical glasses that appeared to have binocular lenses attached to them. She zoomed in and spotted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d asks the tiger giantess. \u201cLupa? What\u2019s with that doll on your shoulder.\u201d Skolla and Hatie manage to help Aiba up before she explains. \u201cThat isn\u2019t a doll, Fang Puss,\u201d says Lupa\u2019s older sister. \u201cHis name is Romulus. He\u2019s Lupa\u2019s boyfriend.\u201d \u201cBoyfriend?\u201d asks Crescent in surprise. \u201cA little puny isn\u2019t he?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not one to talk about odd spouses, Crescent.\u201d Says Lupa. You then crawl up to Lupa\u2019s ear. \u201cTrini\u2019s a funny looking werewolf.\u201d You say. \u201cTrini isn\u2019t a werewolf,\u201d says Lupa. \u201cShe\u2019s a sabertooth tiger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re in utter disbelief. \u201cSabertooth? But they\u2019ve been extinct for thousands of years.\u201d Alfina shrugs her shoulders. \u201cNobody knows how, but sabertooth tigers and mammoths have somehow survived the ice age and became monster-sized. I think they\u2019re a subspecies of weretigers and loxodons respectively.\u201d \u201cGoodness knows,\u201d says Barcetta. \u201cIt\u2019s not everyday that a werewolf marries a cat-based monster.\u201d You could believe it, if Lupa\u2019s relatives shared her animosity towards felines. You turn and see Aiba appears to be somewhat pale and stepping away. \u201cWhat\u2019s with Aiba?\u201d you ask. Alfina lets out a sigh. \u201cAiba had a rather bad experience with a monster cat a long time ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrini and Crescent then come forward. \u201cSo nice to see everyone again,\u201d says Crescent. \u201cWait! Holy crap! Did Persephone break out of prison again?! Wow. Guess she could make it after all. As for you, Romulus. I\u2019ve never seen a werewolf so small. I\u2019d almost think you were a human.\u201d You mentally freeze. But then Crescent shrugs her shoulders and you let out a sigh. Then you notice that Trini is trying to put together some sort of strange contraption she pulls out of her lab coat. \u201cTrini is a rather.... interesting catch. I thought feline and canine monsters didn\u2019t like each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrescent just smiles and shrugs her shoulders. \u201cI like a girl who can make my life interesting and believe me, Trini is the most interesting girl I\u2019ve met and coming from Direopolis, that\u2019s saying something.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d said Aiba. \u201cThat town is FULL of kooks. Everybody there is quirky at best.\u201d Crescent lets out a laugh. \u201cI see. So, you don\u2019t see any problems with the relationship?\u201d Trini lets out a laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. Sure, some of my in-laws... and I\u2019m not naming names, find the relationship unnatural, but we get along fine.\u201d Crescent gives a scoff. \u201cBelieve me, Trini. My relatives are nothing compared to that brother of yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrother?\u201d you ask. Alfina nods her head. \u201cTrini\u2019s older brother Fang is a total soaker. From what I heard, Crescent is lucky she never met him.\u201d Trini lets out a sigh. \u201cMy brother and I haven\u2019t been on speaking terms for years. I doubt he even knows or cares that I\u2019m married. After what he put Fiona through, I hope he\u2019s dead by now.\u201d You give a gulp. It sounds like there\u2019s some serious baggage. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d you say. \u201cTrini? Crescent?\u201d</span></div></div>",

He would go from woman to woman and party all the time. Just when my family started to get tired of his crap he actually settled down and got married!\" You listen with rapt attention while the Howlers around you just shake their heads. They must already know the story. \"He married a nice manticore girl named Fiona.\" Trini continues. She was such a sweet girl and would have done anything for him. Then a month after they got married he cheats on her and just leaves. On Valentines Day no less!\" You wince and shake your head. \"Thats...pretty rough. you say. \"You're telling me.\" Trini says. \"It hit her so bad that she let body go and developed a bad case of low self esteem. Fang's lucky too, cause she used to be a bodybuilder. If she wasn't such a sweety she would beat him half to death.\" She clenches her fists as she talks. \"Sounds like it would have been well deserved.\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Trini's little story Persephone leans in close and pats your head. \"Let that be a reminder.\" she says. \"If you hurt our Lupa like that the whole Howler clan will be after you, and a tiny little wolf like you wouldn't last a second.\" You pat Lupa's shoulder. \"You don't have to worry about that.\" you say, a little nervously. Lupa smiles and scratches your head. \"Yeah well, Fang doesn't exactly have it easy.\" Trini says with a smirk. The rest of our family adored Fiona, and after he did what he did it was the last straw. Plus he's got the whole Reaver family after him, especially Fiona's mom and sister.\" Crescent nudges Trini with her elbow. \"Don't forget that her sister Maggie takes after their dad, who just so happens to be Nemean Lion.\" she says. Your eyes go wide. \"A Nemean Lion? They're some of the toughest monsters around!\" you exclaim. \"Yup, imagine having a whole family of them out for your hide. Fangs got the Pride clan to worry about too.\" Trini says. \"I've heard Una say she'd like test some special medicine on him.\" Crescent says with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you think he's up to?\" you ask. \"I honestly don't care, but I would assume he's in some crappy motel somewhere, probably drunk.\" Trini says. \"He tends not to stay in one place for too long, and I'm sure if he sees a Nemean Lion he gets the hell out as fast as he can.\" As you listen to her Persephone jabs a finger at her as well. \"You too, don't go hurting our Crescent, kitty cat.\" she says. Trini and Crescent both roll their eyes. You're glad that Lupa's family is so supporting of each other, and pretty soon everyone is back to talking happily. Then...</span></div></div>",

Its my very own mode of transport!\" she says. \"Now if only it didn't crash.\" Crescent adds. Trini sticks her tongue out, then gives her wife a kiss on the cheek. \"Well thanks for giving it a shot.\" she says. Barcetta walks over and kicks at the wreckage. \"I gotta say, your wife may be some kinda inventor, but she's definitely no metal worker. This thing was bound to fall apart.\" she says as she picks up a piece of metal from the craft. \"Yeah, I need to work on my construction.\" Trini says embarrassed. \"I'll say.\" Crescent says. \"Try living in a place where you don't know if everything will fall apart or explode.\" Trini glares at her wife before going back to her proud grin. \"Well just you wait.

Crescent gives you an awkward smile and Trini just laughs. \"Come on guys! At least nothing dangerous has ever happened.\" she says. Alfina and the rest of the older wolves look at each other and sigh. \"To be young, huh?\" Fenra muses. \"You guys still look pretty young.\" you say without thinking. Barcetta bops you on the head. \"Well aren't you a little charmer?\" she asks. Lupa gives you a look that says <i>Why are you hitting on my mom and her sisters?</i> You chuckle nervously as Trini starts her demonstration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sabertooth pulls a what looks like a remote out of her pocket. Its made of metal and has a few buttons on it. \"Trini, I wish you would at least tell me when you're bringing these gizmos.\" Crescent says. \"Your handheld devices have a history of shorting out.\" Trini waves her paw and dismisses her wife's comment. \"There's always a margin of error. Its all part of the experimentation process.\" With that she presses a button on the remote and it gives out beeping sound. What happens?</span></div></div>",

You were able to observe as sparks of lightning slowly snared off the machine in many directions, startling Trini in slow motion. She threw the remote in the air like it was a hot potato, and all the wolves that weren't already a safe distance away took a nosedive for cover. The machine grew brighter and brighter as it fell back to the ground, the rest of the pack looking on in fear, all terrified of what the machine would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it hit the ground, lightning shooting out of it in a hot flash, time speeding up again as you realize that it was coming for <i>you</i>, and everything went white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking the white out of your eyes, you groan and stare up at the sky. You feel like you've been hit by a train...you must've fallen out of Lupa's hands when the lightning came at you. You didn't feel like getting up for the moment, so you simply listen to the girls talking amongst themselves. \"Is everyone okay?\" Crescent asks. There's a chorus of \"I'm Okay\" from the girls as they talk amongst themselves. \"You <i>really </i>need to get it together, Trini! Your machine exploded! I'm surprised nobody got hurt!\" one of the girls says, you can't tell which. \"I'm sorry! But everyone's present and accounted for! Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, you realize you should probably get up now; Lupa is probably worried sick about you. Struggling a bit (wow jesus you felt sore) you push off the dirt with your elbows, looking down at...where your own body should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brain short-circuits. You're used to seeing boobs from a birds-eye view thanks to how loving Lupa is, but you...couldn't be seeing them from this angle, you just...you were just on the ground? And they didn't look like Lupa's...or the rest of her families, for that matter. What was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rom?!\" you hear Lupa shout, and you snap to attention, looking for her amongst the crowd. \"Lupa?\" you say, to let her know you're here. Only...your voice is... distinctly... <i>feminine</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's at this point that you realize, with dawning horror, that this is actually happening. You're...<i>changed</i>. With wandering hands you grasp one of your tits, and stifle a gasp. Holy shit. <i>Holy shit you were a woman now.</i> The rest of the family has gone silent, and you look up from your body exploration to find them staring at you with a look of shock evident on all of their faces, and <i>holy cow</i> you just realized you're <i>monster sized.</i> Which would be amazing if it weren't for the, uh, <i>yeah</i>. And you're <i>naked</i>, another fact that you're only just now realizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrini lets out a nervous cough, stealing everyones attention. \"Woops?\" she says with a helpless shrug.</span></div></div>",

She blushes at this and smiles back. \"No problem.\" As the two of you have your little moment Collen walks over and sees the device in Trini's hand. \"I take it your little gadget didn't work?\" she asks. \"Go figure.\" Crescent says jokingly and pats her wife on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColleen happens to glance at you in Lupa's paw and walks over. \"Aaww, he's so cute!\" she says and begins scratching your belly. You smile wildly and kick your leg as she does, causing Lupa to once again blush. More girls happen to spot you and eventually Lupa is being crowded as her family tries to get a better look at you. \"Look at him! He might even be cuter than my Stephen!\" April gushes as she has her turn with you. Selene snatches you up and holds you up in front of her face. \"Whats so great about...\" she says before her face breaks out into a smile. \"Wow! He is kind of cute!\" she says awkwardly and brings you to her lips for a small kiss. The other wolves around you give OOOHS and AAHs of jealousy, Crescent on the other hand turns to her wife. \"Trini, what was that thing supposed to do?\" she asks. Trini looks at her device, head tilted. \"Well it was supposed to put Lupa and her little man in the mood, but I guess it didn't work.\" the tiger says. \"I'm not so sure...\" Crescent says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile you're busy being pampered by the girls and loving every minute of it. For some reason you want them them to spoil you and can't get enough. At the moment Colleen is licking you all over while you giggle and pant happily. \"It looks like your invention put him in the mood all right.\" Crescent says. Trini looks at you quizzically. \"I guess it did succeed in making him more amorous, but then something went wrong. Instead of only affecting Lupa he's somehow attracting anyone around him.\" the tiger surmises. Crescent nods as her wife explains but is also stealing glances at you. \"He does look kind of cute.\" she says. \"Yeah, I sort of want to...\" Trini agrees. The two of them look at each other and then rush over to you, apparently under the spell of their own machine.</span></div></div>",

At the moment Penny is holding you gently in her paw and scratching under your chin. You relish the feeling of her claw and begin stamping your leg vigorously. Eventually you're interrupted when Autumn comes over and snatches you up. \"My turn sis.\" she says. You give her a smile and her already red face turns redder. \"Why are you so adorable?!\" she asks. Then the amazonian wolf drops you onto her paw. Feeling playful you run off and up the length of her toned arm on all fours. She giggles at the feeling of your pads on her arm and watches as you turn around to go back. You continue to run laps on her arm until you go up her shoulder and behind her head. She feels you struggling and realizes you're stuck in her ponytail. After untangling you she holds you up as you give her a puppy dog smile. \"Aaww!\" she coos and gives you a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel another paw grab you and suddenly you are dropped onto a very soft surface. Looking up you see Aiba staring down at you. having dropped you onto her enormous breasts. With your tail wagging you start rolling around on the squishy ground caressing and hugging the massive mammary. Aiba jiggles her boob enough to launch you a few inches into the air, which feels like more to you. Then something smashes into your new playground and you see that Crescent is pressing her boobs against Aiba's. The impact causes you to fall and roll along the mountain of flesh and fur. When you pick yourself up again you see that you're now on Crescent's boob. \"Look at him! He's got lots of room now!\" Crescent says. \"Well? Get exploring little guy!\" Trini says. Her giant face is nearby, watching her wife play with you. With a smile you spread out on her breast and give it a little squeeze. \"How about this?\" Crescent asks with a giggle. Then she begins jiggling her boobs up and down until you begin to bounce into the air. With a bigger jolt she launches you up high. As your falling through the air you see Aiba's boobs getting closer and closer. With a bounce you land on her boob, where she bounces you right back to Crescent. The two of them continue their little game until someone else demands a turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat time comes when you see a mass of black approaching while you bounce through the air. A black paw shoots out to catch you, and when you get your bearings you see that its Hecate. \"I think its my turn now girls.\" she says while scratching behind your ears. With a rumble Persephone walks over and reaches to pet you as well. \"Let me in on that sis.\" she says, but Hecate slaps her paw away. \"Wait your turn!\" she says. Aw come on! Lets just share.\" Persephone suggests. Hecate is about to object again but then she sees you looking up at her with wide eyes. \"Fine...\" she begrudgingly says. With a grin the white wolfess starts scratching your belly while her sister continues on your head. You don't really know why your acting this way, but you just really want their attention. The more attention these girls give you the better you feel. Your heart races as you stare up at the massive faces of black and white smiling at you. Just then another wolf comes stomping over to have a turn.</span></div></div>",

Ah!\" As you scratch, your skin starts to come off where you move your fingers. \"What is happening to me?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNefernina gives an evil smirk as she continues to wave her arms and very soon your entire body starts to decay, in one area your ribs are exposed and your clothes are tattered. You let out a scream as half of your mouth decays off. As soon as the spell is over, Nefernina casts another spell and summons a small mirror to see the zombie that you had become. You let out a loud scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNefernina laughs wickedly at your situation. \"Maybe now you'll be easier to look at vermin.\" You are beyond mad that Nefernina would do such a horrible thing to you. Your mouth tastes like vomit and you smell like wet roadkill. \"You turned me into a zombie!\" you yell up at Nefernina. \"This is murder you pear shaped bandage rack! Change me back right now!\" \"Oops.\" Says Nefernina. \"I forgot something.\" Nefernina then casts another spell and points her finger at you. \"I'm not done talking with you yet Cleof...Ugh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab yourself by the mouth. You try to speak, only to let out the same unintelligible groans as Cadence. You're horrified. You can't even speak. \"Hope you like being a walking corpse for the rest of your, afterlife,\" says Nefernina. \"And before I go...\" Nefernina raises her foot up in the air and you grunt in shock. You try to run but Nefernina slams her huge bandaged foot on top of you before she grinds you into the floor. Since you're a zombie, the assault doesn't kill you, but it's still extremely painful. You groan as Nefernina proceeds to scrape your flat undead body off of her mummified sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That felt so good,\" says the mummy woman. \"I think I'll do that every time I see you from now on. At least when Lupa wants to eat you now, you can take it in stride.\" Nefernina lets out another laugh as you groan and watch her walk away. You then pull yourself together, having to start over again since you put your feet on the wrong legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just sit down and grumble and cry. You couldn't believe you had to live the rest of... well, your existence as a monster. With your luck there was no way to break this spell. You just sit by the door and wait for something to happen.</span></div></div>",

It couldn't be. Then it realized something. You're a zombie now. Now that you were speaking zombie, you could finally understand Cadence.

Out for a jog?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You returned a friendly smile. \"Yeah, figured if I'm here for a while may as well stay in running shape. If you know what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She chuckled a little at your joke. Though you were currently not interested in Izzy the same way she was with you, it was nice to spend time with her every now and then. What was not to like? She was smart, witty, and most of all kind. In a world like this, its nice to have a few friends you could count on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So, what are you up to, Izzy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, I was on my way to the attic to pull out the Christmas decorations.

This brought a smile to your face, for once you could enjoy a morning of ordinary activity. Well ordinary for you anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Izzy opened the door with you still on her shoulder. It was a very simple scene, a dark room with boxes and other things covered in dust and sheets, much like you would see in any other attic only bigger. Izzy picked you up from her shoulder and placed you on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ok,\" she said while looking down at you, \"I just need a few minutes to grab everything we need for the decorations. You can look around if you want but don't go too far and watch out for bugs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You give her the thumbs up and she smiles before walking over to the closest of the box piles to begin her search. You looked around curiously. Everything seemed simple enough, certainly nothing that should have caused that mummy witch to ban you from this room. So, why did she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The search for whatever secrets that were hidden lead you to a small corner next to the attic window. Nothing seemed out of place, just the same giant sized boxes and chests that you could never open on your own and Izzy would never touch for fear of Nefernina's wrath. You could still hear the Serpent Queen talk softly under her breath as she continued her own search. But just as you were about to give up and walk back to Izzy, you saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tucked just behind one of the giant chests was a smaller chest, much smaller. It was human sized in fact. That got your attention. Why would Nefernina have a human chest let alone hide it? Checking to make sure Izzy was still busy with her project (she was currently trying to untangle a set of tree lights) you quickly darted over to the chest. Luck was on your side, it had no locks or chains to keep it shut. \"Poor mummy,\" you thought wickedly, \"can't keep me out of everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As quiet as you could you opened the chest.

You can even see little puffs of it fall to the floor as you push the lid back, grinding the rust into a red power. Opening the lid also stirred up a lot of dust; it's so bad you have to cringe away and cover your mouth to keep from breathing the stuff in. Damn, even <i>without</i> any hostile monster-women to worry about, this infernal place was bad for your health!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwearing under your breath, you turn back to the chest and look inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's nothing within but a book. An <i>old</i> book, with a faded binding that looks a lot like leather...but still; just a book. There didn't even seem to be a title. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn. You find something interesting--another human lived here before you!--and all you get is an old book. Talk about a rip-off--given how old the thing was, the writing had probably faded by now anyway. And since whoever owned it had \"moved out\" without getting all their things first, the unfortunate human was likely long dead--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a minute--there was a bookmark tucked under the cover you hadn't noticed before. It was a strip of cloth, and it looked familiar...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity returning, you reach down and grab the book. Touching the cover reveals that it is in fact bound in leather, and as you lift it you find that it's a bit heavier than it looks. You spare a quick glance over at Izzy, and find the basilisk woman still busy with untangling the lights--and judging by the distressingly large ball of tangled wires next to her, she had her work cut out for her and likely wouldn't notice you rifting through the chest. Satisfied that no trouble will come from this, you look back at the book, or more accurately the bookmark within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when your jaw drops. The bookmark, the cloth...it's from <i>Nefernina's wrappings!</i> It's unmistakably from your ill-tempered, sadistic landlord: the worn-yet-tough look, the stretched texture from wrapping around her frame; it was hers, no doubt about it. You knew that blasted cloth all too well; you'd gotten closer looks at it than you wanted when she'd \"accidentally\" stepped or sat on you. The sight of a building-sized behind descending on you like the fist of God wasn't something you'd forget anytime soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo why the hell was it at a human scale? And being used as a bookmark, of all things?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeartbeat quickening, you crack open the book to a random page and start reading. The date is torn away, but the rest of the entry is legible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Starting to get the ice spells down, finally managed to get the icicles sharp enough. Turns out all you need to keep the stuff from melting before they can skewer someone is to add some sawdust and little bits of wood. Hell if I know how it works; if it keeps my death-traps from turning into puddles, I'm happy. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpells? That was weird. You'd never heard of humans being able to use magic, and as far as you knew the only spell-slinger around was...<br>\r\nYou freeze. Your eyes leap up from the page and stare into space, wide as dinner plates, and your whole body goes rigid. There was no way; it had to be some weird coincidence...you force your eyes back to the page and force yourself to focus on the words. One passage in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"CleoFATra\"? Seriously?! That's what these damn humans call me?! They think that's clever or something; what are they, five years old?!? I ought to--</i><br>\r\nThe rest of the page is a string of profanity and horrid fates for anyone; human or monster, who used that nickname. But that goes over your head. There's only one important detail here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just found <i>Nefernina's diary!!</i> Normally you'd never even consider such a thing, simply due to how it gave the mummy a perfect excuse to kill you. Or worse. But this? This was something you'd never expected. From the size of the diary, and the piece of cloth used as a bookmark, it seemed that Nefernina had been <i>human-sized</i> at one point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe...she might have even been <b>human</b>, period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was NO WAY you were just letting this go. This diary could be useful. VERY useful. But you would have to study it further...that was the ONLY way you'd learn more. Steadying yourself, you slip the book into a pocket in your jacket and re-close the chest. Taking a deep breath to calm yourself, you stroll back around towards Izzy, hoping you look casual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find her looking rather frazzled, scowling as she stops. Her tail is twitching back and forth behind her, and she's even rubbing one clawed hand with another. Apparently, even monsters could get carpel-tunnel or hand cramps. But, surprisingly, the wires are mostly untangled. Guess she works faster than you thought. Idly patting the book within your jacket, you stroll up to the friendly basilisk and tap her on the leg. She looks down at you, her annoyed scowl melting into her usual cheerful grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey there R. L.! You've been looking around a lot?\" She holds out a hand, palm up, giggling as you clamber on. She brings you up to her face, sitting down on a box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug, putting on your best aloof look. \"Looking around? Yeah...not much TO look at, since I can't open boxes that're the size of buildings for me. Didn't run into any bugs, though; that's a plus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy giggles again, her snake-eyes looking bright with glee behind her glasses. You can't help but smile yourself. You may not be so keen on having a monster girlfriend, but she was still fun to be around sometimes, her cheeky way of hitting on you and asking for dates notwithstanding. \"Sorry if you were bored, but I found the lights and got 'em mostly untangled, so they're pretty much ready\". she reports, pointing a claw at the lights with her free hand. Then she tilts her head. \"Hey, R.L.? I have to ask you something...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course, you completely forgot that at your size one stair was the size of a mountain. If you tried to jump down you'd probably get killed. As you're pondering this situation, you heard footsteps. You turn your head to see Lupa yawning and walking downstairs. You immediately run to the side hoping she doesn't see you. If she did you're gonna be breakfast. Lupa sniffs the air and you get nervous, you assume that she's picked up your scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately Lupa lets out a yawn and continues walking downstairs. Luckily for you she's half asleep. But then you see her wagging tail. As Lupa walks down, you jump out and grab hold of her tail. Fortunately for you, she's going to the mailroom herself. As soon as Lupa gets her paper, you climb down her leg and onto the ground. You figure you better hide before she wakes up. You let out a laugh at how that stupid wolf completely missed her most elusive of prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Lupa walks away, you realize something, your mailbox was at the top.

She also had a large dome on her head full of water being a kappa. Because of this, she couldn't wear traditional clothes, but her shell covered everything up. You didn't like Shelly that much. She was a sneak. She was always on the lookout for Petra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only knew three things about Petra having never met her. 1) She was a gargoyle, a winged demonic looking creature said to rule over the night. 2) She was the biggest monster in the entire building. You heard she was one thousand feet tall, more than twice as big as most of the monsters in the apartment. 3) Petra was a cop. This was the main reason you think Shelly avoids Petra. You always suspected Shelly of being a con artist. She would steal any opportunity she got and made a living selling things that either didn't work or didn't exist. Of course, these were your suspicions but Shelly didn't do a good job of convincing you otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you were wondering why this four hundred foot tall sea turtle woman was in the mailroom.

Shelly looked around slightly and gave a smirk before reaching into your and Cadence's mailbox and snatching your newspaper before shoving it into her shell. \"Hey!\" you yell. You knew you couldn't trust her. That Shelly was a no good thief and she was stealing your paper. You would complain to Nefernina if Nefernina would even give you the time of day.

Nefernina got along well with Lupa, most likely because Lupa got rid of any humans that infested the apartment. \"Rest in peace old friend.\" Says Nefernina. \"Good luck in the second life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChel feels Lupa's body as you look on. \"I joked that her unhealthy diet would be what did her in,\" says Irene. \"Lupa never was the thinnest monster.\" \"This death had nothing to do with her diet Irene,\" says Chel as she felt Lupa's forehead. \"Ow.\" Chel then looked to the ground to see the bullet you threw and tried to pick it up, only for it to burn her as well. However, Nefernina was able to pick it up without it hurting her. You guessed silver bullets have no effect on mummies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I thought,\" says Chel. \"A silver bullet and it's still hot. One touch to the right place is dangerous for monsters, but to werewolves it's always fatal.\" \"I can't believe this,\" says Petra. \"Me, a cop, and a murder takes place in my own apartment building.\" Nefernina clenches her bandaged hand into a fist as she hide deeper into the hole. She was probably furious at the thought of anyone murdering Lupa and you knew who she was going to blame. \"I bet R.L. did it! Who else would hate Lupa enough to do this?! When I get my hands on that human....\" You let out a gulp from your hiding spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be ridiculous,\" says Chel. \"R.L. wouldn't do such a thing and if he did it was most likely in self-defense. Need I remind you Lupa was the one who tried to eat him everyday. Why didn't you arrest her for that Petra?\" \"Because a lot of monsters consider humans a delicacy. It's not a crime.\" You couldn't believe that. Lupa had the right to try and eat you. This city has a terrible legal system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrene was so scared she was getting teary eyed and for a cyclops that was bad because she couldn't see and was even holding her face. \"We're all gonna die! There's a monster killer in this very building. They'll probably stick me right in the eye, like my great, great, great grandfather Polyphemus.\" Irene is blubbering so hard in panic Chel picks up a flower pot and splashes water on her to calm her down. \"Calm down you one-eyed baby. Nobody is going to kill anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra nods her head and then places her police badge on her shirt. \"I can guarantee,\" says Petra. \"Whoever did this will be facing jail time. Not only for murder, but for possession of illegal silver bullets. They'll get a century for this.\" This was not good. Monsters may be able to life that long, but that was a life sentence for you. You had to get out and fast and you quickly dart out the crack.</span></div></div>",

The giggle was enough to tell what was to happen next. Desperately, you cling to one of her tastebuds with all your strength as the huge muscle begins to shift in gravity. At first, luck seemed to be on your side. With both hands, you manage to keep a hold on the squishy surface as if it was some makeshift rock climbing wall. However, after a mere couple of seconds, your grip was slowly beginning to weaken due to the shear amount of wolf saliva descending down the pink wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupa seemed to take sheer joy in your struggles, as the giggles manage to increase in volume behind you. Without warning, she soon begins to wiggle her tongue back and fro in an attempt to lose your grip. Unwilling to give out without a fight, you attempt to huddle as close as you can to her tongue as you're soon given the ride of your life. Half a minute soon passes by as Lupa's enjoyment slowly begins to get replaced by annoyance. With a grunt, she begins to move her tongue about even more faster than before which, to your ultimate horror, works in her favor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA good flick to the right soon ends up causing your grip to release as you both momentarily gasp from the event. No hesitation at all, Lupa quickly cranes up her neck as her lips contort into a wide smile. For years she's been awaiting this moment, and now it's finally come! With an excited giggle, she soon places her right index finger before her throat awaiting for the right moment. Inside, you give out a loud scream as your miniature sized body begins to freefall straight towards the pink abyss that was Lupa's throat. Desperately, you try to reach about and struggle, hoping that you'd manage to grip onto a nearby wall or anything. Your actions once again prove futile as you disappear right in the fleshy entryway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith wide eyes, Lupa manages to feel the tiny human enter into her throat before quickly giving an audible *Gulp*. Despite being miniscule compared to her, The huge werewolf begins to trace down the bulge carrying the human as it descended down towards her belly. Deep down it felt like a lifetime goal accomplished for Lupa. The plight of trying to consume that pesky human for all these years has finally come to an end. With R.L now within her large stomach she lets out a small chuckle of fulfillment. Soon enough though, the chuckle soon erupts into a squeal and almost maniacal laugh. \"At last!\" Lupa beams as she begins to rub her belly in a circular fashion. \"You were quite the handful getting R.L.\" she begins talking while gazing downwards at her pudgy abdomen. \"But you were ALL worth it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lupa was taking joy over her sudden achievement, little did she know just what was occurring within her own stomach. After a terrifying descent down her huge slimy throat, you easily manage to plop right into the massive organic chamber that was her belly. With a splash, you land within the slightly mucky digestive fluids before ascending up with a deep gasp. \"n-n-no.\" you stutter, looking about hopelessly as the pink fleshy walls pulsate and contort all around you as the groans and heartbeats of her body capture your ears. \"n-no! this can't be happening!\" you shout, shocked by the outcome of this supposedly great day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were expecting your body to melt within the pool of bubbling acid, to your confusion and absolute disbelief they seemed to do nothing. \"w-wait, what?\" you mutter noticing that the liquids seemed to carry the strength of hot tub water. \"I-I'm alive?\" you stutter by the sudden change of events. A small smile forms as you quickly raise your hands up in a victorious fashion. \"I'm alive!\" you shout with a laugh. Just when you were about to bask in your victory, a gasp escapes as you slightly cover your mouth from the outburst. With you perfectly alright inside her, there was no telling whether or not Lupa knew. Slowly, you avert your eyes towards the upper section of her belly, nervous if she managed to hear your voice.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately for you it ends up being the latter as Lupa's tongue finally settles down and tilts upward. You slowly start to slide down the massive tongue towards the throat that eagerly awaits to take you down to your doom. You cry out in terror and and try to stop your descent, but the tongue is too slippery and you can't get a grip on anything thanks to the saliva that covers you. Lupa's tongue tilts up even more, and you begin to slide even faster towards her gullet. It takes only a few terror filled moments for you to finish slideing to the back of the throat. Then Lupa tilts her head back and with a loud 'GULP' swallows you whole and quite alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus you begin your slow journey down Lupa's esophagus on the way to her stomach. You get covered from head to toe in a mixture of mucus and saliva on your way down. You almost feel like you're going down a slimy waterslide, but the muscles slowly massageing you down into the stomach help you remember were you really are. You don't bother struggleing within the confineing tube since you realize it's pretty much useless at this point. Lupa finally ate you after all. So you accept the fact that now you're just wolf food, or rather seafood since you still smell and taste like shrimp. After a few minutes of being massaged down you come to the stomach sphinter. It accepts you as food and squeezes you into the stomach where you end up in free fall for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly land with a 'PLOP' inside the stomach. You quickly look around at your new home, though you can't see much due to how dark it is. However, you notice that Lupa's stomach seems to be devoid of digestive jucies at the moment. You're glad to see that as it means you'll get live for a little bit longer. Though you're grateful for that you know that this is the end for you. You sit down and hug your knees, accepting your fate. You just hope that you give Lupa indigestion, and wait to be digested. It only takes few moments for the digestive jucies to finally start flowing, and soon you find yourself floating in a large pull of them. You cry out in pain as the acids quickly begin to eat away at you. Unfortunately for you you get the luxary of passing out before being turned into a nutritisous soup, since the digestive jucies eat away at you too quickly for that.</span></div></div>",

You saw a pair of dreadfully familiar, bandaged feet in front of you and look up.    <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nNefernina!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mummy growled with a snarl on her face. Seems Lupa told her she'd puked in the hall, judging from her expression and that she was carrying a bucket of cleaning supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your landlady bent down and started cleaning, she grumbled how she needed to remember to hire a cleaning staff, and you smirk at that. She'd need her brain for it, and from what you knew about it, as part of the mummification process, four main organs would be taken out of the body and placed in special containers called canopic jars. Each jar had the head of a different god, known as the four \u2018sons of Horus\u2019: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQebhsenuef, with the head of a falcon, who looked after the intestines<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuamutef, with the head of a jackal, who looked after the stomach<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHapy, with the head of a baboon, who looked after the lungs<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImsety, with a human head, who looked after the liver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterestingly, the brain wasn't included in the list. The Egyptians must have thought that the brain was worthless, so they would usually pull it out through the nose and throw it away. You always found that funny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleofatra the Brainless. You never called her that to her face, of course, it'd cause you more trouble. You even believed she had a tortuous streak even when she was alive, but that was mostly because you didn't like her much. If that was true or not, you didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you caught sight of what she was holding and you paled: a cordless handheld vacuum!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hated vacuums, you'd been caught in one more than once since moving here.  But now...that wasn't even the slightest bit funny!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished scrubbing and sanitizing the floor, Nefernina thought she spotted something and bent closer to it, squinting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RL?!\" she shouted, making you clap your hands to your ears as your concentration shattered and her shout...her breath...sent most of your body  blowing away. You quickly concentrate on coming back together and being completely solid again with all your willpower and it works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That IS you, isn't it?\" the mummy demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, and, against your better judgment,  explain about Shelly, the potion, Luppa and being turned into an Enenra...then again, it wasn't like Nefernina  could do anything to hurt you the way you were now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finish your story, Nefernina does the one thing that you never expected to see her do... she smiled. And what made it more frightening was that it wasn't a malicious smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now this is just too good...\"She cackled deeply.\"R.L., much less than a human now...I wonder...what to do with you?\" Your pear-shaped mummy girl landlady who was wrapped in gauze up to her neck giggled. Then she smiled at you and brought a huge index finger down and prodded you in your solidified stomach. Not hard or to hurt you, but it disrupted your concentration and it turned back into smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is gonna be SO~MUCH~FUN!\" she squealed like a little girl over getting a new toy, \"I could blow on you to scatter you into particles to reform or I could inhale and exhale you. It's not as if I could damage my lungs. Or I could just step on or sit on you multiple times. Not like it would hurt you...Ho, I love this, my sweet smoky!\" the mummy laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she leered at you with a gleam of pure mischief before she brought the vacuum up to you. You paled and bolted the other way, even as Nefernina turned it on and a roar filled your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, no. No, no, no, no! NOOOO!  You try and run, but the very nature of your new body is against you as the vacuum's suction roared in your ears, mingling with the sound of Nefernina's manic laughter as you felt parts of you being pulled away and sucked into the cleaning machine. As the last of you vanishes into the vacuum, it's turned off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha!\" the mummy said, grinning. She tapped the vacuum a few times, smirking as she imagined her new little Enenra trying to escape. Poor little plaything! She was gonna adore keeping him! Best of all, Enenra couldn't physically die, she she could act out a bit of a good display of cartoon-like sadism every now and again to him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was known that the Egyptians believed in reincarnation or the transmigration of the soul. They thought the soul transmigrates from body to body and this was a reason why they embalmed the body in order to preserve it so that it could journey along with the ka, an animating force that was believed to be counterpart of the body, which would accompany it in the next world or life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally got him again after 3000-plus years. Now to see if he was just as fun as she recalled...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got into her own room, Nefernina stuffed the cracks under her door and windows so they were airtight, then stuffed an old throw pillow into her ventilation grate to make sure you couldn't escape her that way, then finally picked up the vacuum and flipped it to reverse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shout at you were blasted out of the vacuum, collide with something and break apart into wisps of smoke, reform, and then you see Nefernina grinning at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to enjoy my new toy!\" she laughed.   </span></div></div>",

You look and see that Nefernina's room doesn't look so much like an apartment but looks more like an ancient Egyptian palace given the hieroglyphs on the walls, the throw pillows all around and the massive golden throne. It was just big enough to hold Nefernina's overgrown ass. Not that you're in any position to be insulting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNefernina laughs fiendishly. \"We are going to have so much fun,\" says the mummy as she shakes her enormous hips. \"So, so much fun and I think I know how to start. You try to fade out of Nefernina's hand but your body just had to choose now to go solid of all times. Suddenly Nefernina opens her hand and your smokey body begins to fall as you scream before landing in water. You look around to see pink glass everywhere and then look up to see the sky was filled with glass and there was even a tube with Nefernina holding onto the end and smiling fiendishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you have a cruel realization. You were<i> inside a giant hookah</i>! You didn't even know Nefernina smoked. Then again, it's not as if she could damage her lungs or even needed to breathe. Nefernina puts the end of the tube in her mouth and begins to puff as your body starts to ripple and the water below you bubbles. \"No!\" you yell. \"No! No! No!\" Then you feel more suction. \"Oh!\" you groan. \"Not again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNefernina inhales through the hookah and you scream as your smokey body comes apart particle by particle as you're sucked through the tube at what you'd say would be 500MPH. It isn't long before you reform and see that you're in Nefernina's mouth. You look around in horror and shock. For a three-thousand year old corpse, Nefernina's teeth were well preserved, though it still stunk like hell in there. Now what happens?</span></div></div>",

The fact that he was the same size he was when he was human actually added onto that. Now that she thought about it, she could and really SHOULD have turned him into a monster a long time ago!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Enjoy being my property, small-fry! We're gonna be together for a loooong time from now on!</i> she thought giddily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you looked around at the gargantuan teeth that made up part of the floor and ceiling of your slimy cavern, dripping with saliva. Not to mention that big tongue you were standing on. Soon, however, the tongue began to move around violently, tossing you everywhere in the mouth except for the pit that served as a gateway to her stomach (was it in her body anymore?\"). It was a very rough ride, you were battered against her large teeth and the hard ridges of the top of her mouth. coupled with the fact that you were completely covered in saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Nefernina slightly opened her mouth, puckering her lips and exhaled, blowing ash gray smoke from between her lips and watched as it pooled together. Smiling as she saw it thicken and turn back into her eensy-weensy Enenra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yelped as soon as you reformed and found Nefernina smiling at you again. Then she stood up to her full height and laughed. <br>\r\n\"Enjoying yourself, my little Runihura-Isfet-Luzige?\"  the mummy cooed at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh? Why did she call you that? In Egyptian, the name  \"Runihura\" means destroyer, while  \"Luzige\" means \"locust\". But how did you know that? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-?\" you start to ask, intent on asking her, but you stop as Nefernina wags a finger at you \"Nuh uh uh! I'm not telling! But back to matters at hand: it's still playtime!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pale and fade out into smoke, Nefernina did absolutely nothing to stop you, she only grinned as she watched the little plume of smoke dash around her room, trying to find a way out without success. It zoomed to the  the cracks under her door...NO! Then dashed to the windows...NO! Then her ventilation grate...NO! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNefernina  laughed, amused by her plaything's vain attempts at freedom. She held out her hand as if waiting for something to be deposited into it. \"As you can see, Tiny, I Enenra escape-proofed my room before I let you out of that vacuum. Did you really think I wouldn't?\" she smiled at the plume of smoke, \"you're so naive and trying to escape your mistress...it's actually adorable! Now...give up and come to Nefernina, little one. Unless you want me to make you go back in that vacuum again.\" she cooes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no other choice, you reluctantly surrender. As much as you hated it, you really hated this, but there was no way you could get away from her...at least for now. You float over to Nefernina and solidify in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you win, Nefernina,  but only this round!\" you promise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'This round', huh?\" Nefernina said, then closed her fist around you \"Well then, looks like I'll need to tame you first before I let you out of my room! You're MINE! ALWAYS!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that,  she spun around and tossed you as hard as she could and you struck something, dispersed, and reformed again. But this time as you became fully solid again, human-scale-sized, golden, egyptian asps zoom at you and wrap around your wrists and ankles and suddenly they weigh a ton and drag you so you're lying spread eagle on your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then realize the you're lying in the middle of the cushion of that massive golden throne, the one you thought  was just big enough to hold Nefernina's overgrown ass. When you try fading, nothing happens. Great! must be magic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing a series of booms and a loud laugh, you look up to find yourself looking at Nefernina's planetary, gauze-wrapped buttcheeks looming over you as she shakes her enormous hips.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now brace yourself little guy, here comes the judgment of Nefernina-Su-Ancknamun!\" she announces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Nefernina slowly lowers her butt down to the massive golden throne you were pinned to and you could do absolutely nothing but watch and dread when it will hit you. Surprisingly though, the booty just freezes before it crushes you. You look up to see Nefernina's butt moving upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder if she changed her mind when THUD! Nefernina slams her booty down on you like two meteors of armageddon and starts wiggling her rump and bouncing on you with her butt as if trying to get comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan in agony for a second, then you realize that you weren't feeling any pain. Huh? You move as if to look down at yourself and you realize that you can fade to smoke again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhew!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just some sadistic joke of the mummy's! She hadn't intended to kill you at all, just scare you! You could get out of this no problem! All you had to do was find a space that you could squeeze through. Easier said than done, considering just how massive Nefernina's overgrown ass was, but you could at least move around in the form of smoke and vapor. As you started moving, you hear a moan of pleasure above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By Ra's throne! RL! You feel good moving like that under me!\" Nefernina moaned. Huh? But she shouldn't have been abl...you mentally sigh, figuring it must have been part of the spell that had bound you to her throne a second ago: making her able to feel you as if you were still solid  even in smoke form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't focus on that now, you have to escape Nefernina.

Not Nefernina-Su-Ancknamun's planetary ass!  You couldn't scream, she never would have heard you.  You had to morse-code it against the inside of the mummy's buttcheek. You heard Nefernina moan in pleasure as you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let you out?! I think NOT! Why should I,my little Runihura-Isfet-Luzige?\" the mummy cooed at you. Good thing she was loud enough for you to hear clearly, even if it was a bit muffled from her buttcheeks and bandages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[What's your deal?! You always HATED me before! So what's changed other than me being an Enenra?! It seems too personal from you that me being a monster now is all there is! And why do you keep calling me that!?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too personal for that to be all, huh? Fair enough...and the answers tie into one another anyways, honey.  To answer why I keep calling you that, in Egyptian, the name \"Runihura\" means destroyer, while \"Luzige\" means \"locust\". And the word \"Isfet\" was the word for \"Chaos\". Then there's your liking for the color red. Red a bad color in Egypt,  It's the color of Set, god or chaos and destruction.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[I thought black was the evil color, and what does that have to do with the mood you've got towards me now?]  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll get to that, but as to what you mean about black being bad...modern folk have it backward. Black is the color of good soil, like the soil of the Nile. You can grow food in black soil. Food is good. Therefore black is good. Red is the color of desert sand. Nothing grows in the desert. And it's the color of freshly-spilt blood on a battlefield during war. Therefore red is evil. And since food is good, thus locusts are seen as a form of chaos, creatures of Set. Understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did.  Then you thought of something and pounded it out against the interior of her butt, while you were no expert on ancient Egypt, you did know SOME stories and customs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n[I heard once that Isis and Osiris were married. Horus was about to be born as their son. But in another story, all three of them were siblings, children of the sky goddess.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Nefernina agreed. \u201cThis can be confusing for those who do not know the nature of gods. They cannot walk the earth in their pure form\u2014at least, not for more than a few moments. They must have hosts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Humans, you mean?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr powerful objects, such as statues, amulets, monuments, certain models of cars. But they prefer human form. You see gods have great power, but only humans have creativity, the power to change history rather than simply repeat it. Humans can think outside the cup the box. The combination of human creativity and godly power can be quite formidable. At any rate, when Osiris and Isis first walked the earth, their hosts were brother and sister. But mortal hosts are not permanent. They die, they wear out. Later in history, Osiris and Isis took new forms\u2014humans who were husband and wife. Horus, who in one lifetime was their brother, was born into a new life as their son.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[That\u2019s confusing,] you beat out. [And a little gross.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNefernina twitched and even hugged herself as she moaned in response to how much enjoying the massage you are unitentionally giving her by the communication method you were using. \u201cThe gods don't think of relationships the way humans do. Their hosts are merely like changes of clothes. This is why the ancient stories seem so mixed up. Sometimes the gods are described as married, or siblings, or parent and child, depending on their hosts. The pharaoh was often called a living god, you know. Egyptologists believe this was just a lot of propaganda, but in fact it was often literally true. The greatest of the pharaohs became hosts for gods, usually Horus. He gave them power and wisdom, and let them build Egypt into a mighty empire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, though you couldn't see it, her face darkened, \"However...Gods have different agendas than humans do. They can overpower their hosts, literally burn them out. That is why so many hosts died young. Tutankhamen, poor boy, died at nineteen. Cleopatra VII was even worse. She tried to host the spirit of Isis without knowing what she was doing, and it shattered her mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[So...hosting the Gods was bad?] you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mummy landlady/warden sighed. \u201cSome adepts could call upon the gods only from time to time. Others attempted to host their spirits...with varying degrees of success. The ultimate goal was to become the \u2018eye\u2019 of the god\u2014a perfect union of the two souls, mortal and immortal. Very few achieved this, even among the pharaohs, who were born to the task. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Like you, I'm guessing?] Great, as if Nefernina's ego wasn't big enough. Now you were hearing that when she was alive, she shared her body with a Goddess!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nephthys, the goddess of mourning and lamentation, sleep, rivers, the night, service, and the home, a friend and protector of the dead, actually. I was glad for that. Serving as the Eye of Nephthys. I was glad that it wasn't Isis...powerful as she was, Isis was the reason Set got out of control in the first place. She exiled the God's first king.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[You mean Ra?] you tapped out. [Didn't he get old and decide to leave the earth?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNefernina snorted. \u201cHe was old, yes, but he was forced to leave. Isis got tired of waiting for him to retire. She wanted her husband, Osiris, to become king. She also wanted more power. So one day, while Ra was napping, Isis secretly collected a bit of the sun god\u2019s drool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Eww,] you said. [Since when does drool make you powerful?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cIsis mixed the spit with clay to create a poisonous snake. That night, the serpent slipped into Ra\u2019s bedroom and bit him on the ankle. No amount of magic could heal him. He would\u2019ve died\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Gods can die?] you interrupted. Confused. How could an immortal die? It contradicted the very term and concept. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Nefernina said. \u201cOf course most of the time the Gods rise again\u2014eventually. But this poison ate away at Ra\u2019s very being. Isis, of course, acted innocent. She cried to see Ra in pain. She tried to help with her magic. Finally she told Ra there was only one way to save him: Ra must tell her his secret name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Secret name?] you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything in Creation has a secret name,\u201d Nefernina said, a little annoyed with the constant interruptions. \u201cEven gods. To know a being\u2019s secret name is to have power over that creature. Isis promised that with Ra\u2019s secret name, she could heal him. Ra was in so much pain, he agreed. And Isis healed him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[But it gave her power over him] you guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExtreme power,\u201d Nefernina agreed. \u201cShe forced Ra to retreat into the heavens, opening the way for her beloved, Osiris, to become the new king of the gods. Set had been an important lieutenant to Ra, in the old days, he was Ra\u2019s strongest lieutenant. He protected the sun god\u2019s boat from the serpent Apophis. Now there was evil. Apophis was the embodiment of chaos. He hated Creation from the moment the first mountain appeared out of the sea. He hated the gods, mortals, and everything they built. And yet Set fought against him,in fact some myth states that he was the only god that helped Ra through the centuries against Apophis. But he could not bear to see his brother Osiris become king. This made Set and Osiris enemies<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Then Set turned evil?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNefernina shrugged. \u201cSet has always been Set, for better or worse. He had done horrible things, yes. It is his nature. But he is still one of the gods. He acts his part. While he is the god of evil, he simply exists as a balance of necessary evil for all of the gods who are good. Thus, unlike the purely evil Apophis, Set does have a more honorable side to him, being fiercely loyal to his master Ra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[I get it] you pounded. All this was making your head hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As it turns out, the fact that  they were husband and wife, and that Set went so far as to tell Nephthys his Secret Name was rather ironic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Why's that?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was betrothed a long time ago. To someone that was the Eye of Set, funnily enough. But when Upper and Lower Egypt merged, the followers of Horus gained power and increasingly demonized Set. They slit his throat when he was on his way to our wedding. I know it wasn't his fault, but I was stood up for millennia. Can you imagine how much bitterness and resentment can build up over after 3000-plus years over something like that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped herself and then sighed in aggravation. \"I've been using my magic to trace where my beloved's soul ended up. Egyptians believed in reincarnation or the transmigration of the soul. They thought the soul transmigrates from body to body and this was a reason why they embalmed the body in order to preserve it so that it could journey along with the ka, an animating force that was believed to be counterpart of the body, which would accompany it in the next world or life. Had to deal with the trouble that seemed to gravitate towards you a lot, it kept interrupting my search.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Nefernina's tone became giddy again all of a sudden, \"But then imagine my surprise...! I was a fool! The initials were a give-away in and of itself!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOooo-Kayyyy.  That made sense why she was always in a bad mood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Sorry about that. And what was so surprise...] you pause in your beating, eyes wide. Everything the dastardly mummy told you was all falling into place like pieces of a puzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHO GOD!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe meant that...?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"BINGO! YOU'RE MINE, BELOVED! AFTER ALL THIS TIME, WE'RE TOGETHER AGAIN! AND THIS TIME, WE'LL BE STAYING THAT WAY! I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WERE RIGHT UNDER MY NOSE...LITERALLY, CONSIDERING HOW SMALL YOU ARE COMPARED TO  ME!\"  </b>  Nefernina boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe this! According to Nefernina, you were the reincarnation of her fianc\u00e9!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...I think we make up for lost time, my love!\" the mummy said. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as you're trying to wrap your head around what's going on, you feel Nefernina getting up with you still wedged up her giant mummified butt. She even smiles seductively as she squeezes her cheeks together, putting a lot of pressure on your smokey body as you groan in pain. \"And this time, my Eye of Set,\" she says as she gives a seductively grin. \"I'm not taking any chances. We leave for Egypt at once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n {Egypt?!} You were now horrified beyond belief. You were on your way to Egypt and you were going to be forced to marry <i>Nefernina</i> of all people. Who would've thought that you were her <i>fianc\u00e9</i> in a previous life. Suddenly, the idea of being eaten by Lupa didn't seem so bad. Nefernina kept squeezing her cheeks as she let out an evil laugh. \"Oh, but remember, my little Runihura-Isfet-Luzige,\" the giant pear-shaped mummy said. \"It will be a long trip all the way from Horrorville to Egypt. But I know a shortcut, through the world of the western gate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't sound good at all. From the sound of it, Nefernina was going to take you on a stroll through the Egyptian underworld. As much as you hate it, the mummy's ass was the safest place for you right now. Nefernina however, has something to do first. First she takes off her vest before putting on a more regal robe and applying makeup to her surprisingly well-preserved face. You never could figure out how Nefernina could have such a beautiful face for somebody whose been dead for 3000 years. Then Nefernina put on a crown similar to the one worn by Nephthys in Egyptian mythology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you hear Nefernina tapping buttons on a cellphone from the beeping sounds. On the other line, a phone is ringing in some sort of ancient Egyptian style dwelling where there was another mummy. This mummy girl looked remarkably similar to Nefernina, even with the same body shape. However, she had darker skin and long green hair worn in a ponytail. The green-haired mummy was eating what looked like a bowl of centipedes when she heard her phone ringing. \"Hello?\" \"Cleo,\" said Nefernina on the phone. \"Get your butt into the western gate. I have a project for you.\" \"Nefernina?\" asks the other mummy girl in surprise. \"You sound like you're in a surprisingly good mood.\" \"Oh, I am, little sister,\" says Nefernina with a smirk. \"I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were shocked from inside of Nefernina's intestinal area (if her intestines hadn't been removed). You didn't know Nefernina even had a sister. \"Cleotiti,\" says Nefernina. \"Remember Runihura-Isfet-Luzige?\" \"Runihura-Isfet-Luzige?\" asks Cleotiti. \"The man who was supposed to be your husband? I thought he died.\" Nefernina let out a laugh. \"Let's just say after three thousand years, I've found him again and this time, nothing is going to ruin the wedding for us. I'll tell you where to meet. After all, what's my wedding without my twin by my side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were sweating heavily and it made Nefernina moan in pleasure as you made her insides wet. As Nefernina was rubbing her lower back where you were inside her body, the mummy giantess takes out a strange potion from her vanity and pours it into a wall where there were strange symbols carved inside. Nefernina speaks in ancient Egyptian gibberish and then a door opens up that appears to be some kind of dimension that looks like Egypt but with a glowing red sky and triple moons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to take a trip to the Egyptian underworld...</span></div></div>",

You didn't know what nebutori was but there was no way it could poison a zombie. \"So,\" says Shelly. \"What potion will it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nodding your head and thinking it over a bit, you point to the vial of green nebutori. The kappa giantess lets out a laugh before handing you the bottle. \"Good choice, shrimp,\" she says. \"And by the way, don't tell Cadence about the potion. It'll be a surprise.\" Shelly let out a laugh and walked away with your paper. You were kinda worried about the laugh but you figure that this potion if it makes Cadence's decaying body feel better you figure it was worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while for you to get back to the apartment but thankfully, you're not late for breakfast. You're holding onto the vial as you see Cadence fixing herself a cup of coffee and notice she's holding onto her back. Lately Cadence's spine has been bothering her and the rest of her bones weren't sitting straight either. She even moans as she snaps her neck back into place. Yeesh. You quickly make a note to yourself to never become a zombie yourself. Your roommate returns and puts a glass of coffee on the table as she moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling okay, Cadence?\" you ask. Cadence grunted and shook her head. \"I figured as much. You've been undead for fifteen years now, right.\" Cadence nods her head and moans again. Then she walks off to get the rest of the meal ready. While Cadence is busy cooking pancakes, you take out the nebutori. You weren't completely sure if it was a rejuvenating potion or not but what harm could it do. The moment Cadence isn't looking, you pour the entire vial of the nebutori into her coffee. \"I really hope you're not lying this time, Shelly.\" You think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence returns with a stack of pancakes and puts a plate of human sized portions at your level that you immediately dig into as Cadence eats her own breakfast. You watch as she lifts up her swimming pool sized coffee cup and that's when your giant zombie roommate swallows the nebutori laced coffee. You look closely to see if there's any immediate effect, but it seems as though Cadence is unaffected and you shrug your shoulders. Guess that potion was nothing more than colored water. Stupid Shelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, Cadence takes the dishes and walks up towards the sink. That's when you turn and notice that her skirt looks unusually small on her and you can clearly see her spider web print panties. You look in surprise and then rub your eyes. You could've sworn that Cadence's ass had gotten bigger. \"Uh Cadence,\" you say. \"Are you putting on weight?\" That was a question you should never ask a girl, especially one who was a zombie the size of a skyscraper. Upon hearing that, Cadence angrily stomped towards the table, let out an angry grunt and slapped you across it. Well, you can't say you didn't ask for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, you're watching the television and waiting for Cadence to come back from grocery shopping. Of course, nothing really good is on. \"Geez,\" you say. \"This new Titans show is painful to watch. I wonder if the Walking Dead is on.\" You hear the doorbell open and you see Cadence walking in and look in surprise. She had brought in enough groceries for Lupa and it looked like her breasts had gotten bigger. How was that even possible considering they were as dry as a bone. \"Cadence?\" you ask. As Cadence is unpacking the groceries, you see that most of it is meat, candy and junk food. That struck you as odd. Cadence normally didn't eat that kind of crap. Heck, she usually ate like a bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then see Cadence take out a bag that looked like takeout from a fast food restaurant and unwrapped it to eat a cheeseburger. \"Cadence?\" you ask. \"I thought you didn't like cheeseburgers.\" Cadence grunts and shrugs her shoulders. After Cadence has put away all the groceries, you're on her shoulder watching as she is writing a romance novel at her computer and eating a bag of candy coated eyeballs. After an hour of writing, your zombie roommate lets out a yawn and leans back in her chair, giving you a few of her stomach that you swear has to have gotten bigger. Cadence saves her work, turns off the computer and then gets out of her chair, which has somehow gotten stuck to her backside before sliding off. This was weird. You never knew Cadence to be a slacker, especially when it came to her writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, you and Cadence are watching Attack on Titan on the television and you're sitting in Cadence's belly button as the zombie is laying down and eating a bag of chips. You could've sworn that the navel has gotten tighter and softer and you also could've sworn that Cadence's belly was getting bigger. What was in that potion? If you didn't know better, you'd say your zombie roommate really <i>was</i> putting on weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, you're already in your cigarette box bed as you hear Cadence grunting in annoyance. The giantess corpse is trying to put on her pajamas but as you look forward you see that they were barely fitting and her pants looked like they were coming apart at the seams. You're really starting to regret slipping her that nebutori. If only you knew what that stuff did. Was it supposed to be doing this. Before you could think anymore on the matter, Cadence puts her glasses down on the nightstand and lets out a yawn before grunting \"good night\" to you in zombie talk. \"Good.. night... Cadence.\" As Cadence gets in bed, you hear it creak. That didn't sound good, but you were too tired to think of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, you wake up before Cadence do and let out a yawn. You rub your eyes and turn to see Cadence in bed and then gasp. \"Oh my gosh!\" you yell. That nebutori did make Cadence put on weight. Boy was she going to be mad to wake up and see what happened. But how big was she?</span></div></div>",

It seems that nebutori really had an effect on Cadence, and it made her put on a lot of weight, and it was weight that you didn\u2019t want to see at all. You started to panic as you notice that Cadence is now just as big as Lupa in terms of weight. Her size in terms of breasts, butts, and other stuff is just as big as Lupa, and surely most of her clothes won\u2019t fit her at all because of this. You were really scared now, as if she wakes up and finds out that she is very very fat, you don\u2019t want to know how she will react at all. She only starts to get up, but has a hard time getting up as her weight gives her a much harder time of lifting herself up. By the time that she did, she look at the mirror, and notices that she is just as fat as Lupa. She gives out a shocked expression after she looks at the mirror. Note that she also put her glasses on at the time as well. At least her bra and panties still fit her, but you couldn\u2019t help but feel bad with her. \u201cUh\u2026 Cadence, are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence then turns to you and then she started to panic a bit just as she looks at you in confusion. \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d you thought out to her, and then you started to realize that the nebutori had that really bad side effect. It made Cadence put on a lot of weight, and you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s curable. \u201cCadence, I got a lot of explaining to do but uh\u2026 do you mind setting down while I call the doctor?\u201d you told her, hoping that she will understand your request to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then get on the phone and contact Chel. \u201cUh Chel, you might want to come up to my apartment, as I got some really bad news?\u201d you told Chel on the phone. \u201cWhat R.L., what\u2019s wrong? It seems like you are stressed out by something.\u201d she replied. \u201cIt\u2019s Cadence, and I am afraid that we got some very bad news, and you aren\u2019t going to like it.\u201d you replied to her. \u201cOkay, I will be up here with the nurse in just a moment.\u201d You then walked out into the living room with Cadence, who looks at you with worry and concern as you been very worried lately. She kinda understands if it\u2019s the weight that she gain, but she knows that you would never call her fat, but you kinda knew something was uneasy. By the time Chef the yeti girl came up, she gasped in shock to see Cadence now the same weight as Lupa. \u201cOh gal, what happened to you Cadence?\u201d she asked in shock, noticing that Cadence put up a lot of weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was some shocked responses for sure, but nothing could prepare anyone for what you were about to say. \u201cWell, sadly I will admit. It wasn\u2019t what she did, it was what I did.\u201d You told Chel and Cadence. They both look at you in confusion. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d Chel asked in confusion. \u201cThere was kinda no way you could have made her the way she is now.\u201d Cadence even agreed with a few grunts. \u201cYou see. I was going to get the paper for Cadence, hoping that Lupa didn\u2019t came, and then Shelly came by and I asked for help in getting the paper. Then both I and she had a bit of a fight, and then she offered me to get one of two potions that would help Cadence in exchange for the paper. I picked nebutori, thinking it was going to help Cadence rejuvenate her body a bit, but it actually it started to give Cadence a bit of an appetite for food, and she putted on weight. Sorry Cadence for mentioning it again, and then this morning I notice all the weight she truly gain, and\u2026 man I really regret giving her that, I basically drugged her coffee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Chel and Cadence were in shocked to hear such a thing that you did. \u201cI am really sorry for you Cadence, and I am really sorry Chel that I did it.\u201d both the yeti and zombie girl look down sternly at you, as if something was about to happen, but you were too sad to admit what you have done. It was all your fault, but you know that there is something that you can do to help them. \u201cIs there a way I can cure her of this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is, but I am afraid that\u2026 it is going to require you to do something you aren\u2019t going to like at all.\u201d Chel said, admitting that she kinda did had some experiences with nebutori before. \u201cYou are going to have to go inside her body, and extract all of the nebutori out of her body before the effects become irreversible. Now the good news that the effects haven\u2019t become permanent yet, but I am afraid in the next few hours it will be, but be careful. She is a zombie girl, so the smell is surely going to be very bad in there. You will need some special gear to go inside a monster girl. There have been a few surgeries that humans were used to go inside of a monster\u2019s body, and begin curing the selected issue.\u201d Chel said just as she now calls some sort of (9-1-1) emergency number to get the van to come by. Once Cadence was on the bed, she is then taken to the hospital. You are going to have a big job up ahead. You are going to have to go inside of the zombie girl who is undead, and remove the nebutori before the effects become for good. This day has really gone wacko so far. You eventually get to the hospital, and then you are taken by Chel to a special room and section made for humans. \u201cAll you have to do is to suit up and get ready to go inside the girl. Also, I would want to take a mask with you, as the zombie girl\u2019s smell is going to be pretty bad.\u201d Chel warned you. \u201cThanks for telling me.\u201d You replied.</span></div></div>",

The nebutori had mutated your zombie friend into a continental blob of blue flesh. You'd even say that the nebutori made her taller. Now Cadence's stomach was as wide as Petra was tall and that was saying something. She had at least five chins and her cheeks seemed to have merged with the rest of her fast. Cadence's breasts were also 600ft wide each while her butt cheeks were now 700ft wide each. Her fingers and toes were so minuscule to her massive limbs that you'd even say that they looked boneless. Cadence's pajamas had even torn apart in her sleep, leaving her wearing a spider web bra and thong that looked tattooed on. \"Oh no.\" You say. \"Uh Cadence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence wakes up with a grunt and then looks at you in confusion before rubbing one of her eyes. She then gives a look of surprise and looks all around her body and gets up out of her bed as it creaks. The giantess zombie grabs her glasses and puts them on before looking down at her massive breasts and belly. She gives a shocked expression and lets out a moan of distress before grabbing her oversized hips and then looking at her now titanic butt that was even making her bed crack right before she let out a yell of distress. \"Cadence! You yell! Calm down! I'll get Chel to look at you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence lets out a groan as she looks at her obese self in the mirror. She looked a lot like a female Boomer in her current condition. You quickly call Chel and the yeti girl and the nurse immediately comes in. \"RL?\" she asks. \"What's going on? You sounded distressed on the phone.\" \"It's Cadence,\" you say to the yeti giantess. \"Just look.\" Cadence stomps out of the bedroom with a sad look on her face and Chel looks at Cadence in surprise at how much weight she put on. \"Oh my gosh! Cadence, you look terrible. How did you gain so much weight so fast.\" Cadence just mutters that she didn't know and you see that she's as tall as Chel down, which is amazing since the only monster in the building bigger than Chel was Petra. You let out a groan and decide to come clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\"m the one who did this to her.\" Both Cadence and Chel look at you in disbelief and Cadence groans in confusion. \"How?\" asks Chel.

She told me it would rejuvenate Cadence since she's been having joint trouble lately and...\" \"Nebutori!?\" yells Chel. \"What were you thinking?! Nebutori is a Japanese gender-specific supernatural disease. It makes all females regardless of species, extremely obese and lethargic.\" Cadence gives a look of shock and then actually glares at you. \"How was I to know?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wonder Cadence got so fat so quickly,\" says Chel. \"Oh, you don't know what you've done RL.

You look and see a cream colored pair of thighs that looked 750ft thick and looked up to see Patsy, the siamese Cait Sith and from the looks of it, she was now fatter than ten Garfields. She was puffing and sweating as she walked down the hall and even had to stop to rest her obese belly. It was now 1000ft wide and her head was resting between her massively swollen breasts.

You looked up to see the pale reddish violet hair reaching down and then looked up to see Mavis, who due to the nebutori was stuck immobile on the ground. She gave a glare your way. \"You philistine,\" hisses the banshee giantess. \"Look at me, I'm a travesty! I should strike you down with a death wail right here.\" You gasp as Mavis inhales deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she exhales and scratches her stomach with her long black nails. \"But that would be too much of a bother.\" You let out a sigh and then you feel more rumbling, there were two particularly obese monsters walking the hall. You turned and saw Lupa and looked in both fear and surprise. Lupa was now very spherical, sure she was obese before the nebutori struck, but now she monumental. She had to have ballooned up to Petra's height and each of her butt cheeks had to be 1000ft wide and her stomach was so big her feet could barely reach the ground. She was huffing and puffing (no pun intended) and looked too lethargic to chase you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lupa is on the ground, you see Astrid, the manticore and she was just as bloated as Lupa and was wearing nothing but a skimpy polka dotted bra and panties, leaving her blobby red skin exposed. Astrid and Lupa were already obese so you didn't think they'd be effected by the nebutori but now they were basically living islands. \"You don't look so good, Lupa.\" Says Astrid with a wheeze. Lupa let out a smirk. \"I never had a problem with my weight before. Hell, you can count the skinny girls in my pack with one hand. But look at me now. I make my Aunt Diana look like a twig. I kinda like this.\" Lupa even rubs her belly as you look in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you hear more stomping and down the hall is Irene, the cyclops girl. Her muscles had been replaced with multiple megatons of lard. Her thighs were the biggest and looked like she had elephantiasis. She also had a larger stomach, though her breasts only increased slightly in scale. \"Where is he!?\" yells the cyclops in a deeper voice than usual. \"Where is R.L.!?\" You gulp. Irene sounded pissed beyond belief. Her single eye was thick with angry red veins. Then you remembered, Irene was an utter health nut and never ate anything remotely fattening. Being infected nebutori was hell for her. \"That R.L. turned me into a butterball!\" yelled the cyclops at the top of her lungs. \"I've turned into my mother! Oh hell, as long as I'm fat, I'm going to swallow that troublemaker whole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were horrified. Irene actually expressed desire to eat you. Irene never are humans. She considered them to be junk food. But since the nebutori made exercise futile as long as she was infected, she was basically screwing her diet out of desire for revenge. \"I'm going to eat that human whole so I can listen to him scream as my stomach acid breaks him down. And then I'll vomit his bones.\" \"Please, Irene. I'm eating.\" Elle was walking by eating several boxes of donuts and she was now so pear shaped that her orange-yellow feathered thunderbird ass could easily flatten the Empire State Building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrene was so stressed out, she grabbed several of Elle's donuts and stuffed them down her mouth. \"Screw my diet!\" she yells. \"Nothing I do could outrun a virus.\" \"Irene!\" yells Elle. Lupa let out a growl. \"You better watch it, one-eye, I have dibs on R.L.\" Irene was about to deck Lupa but she was suddenly stopped. Petra had grabbed her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra was also affected by the nebutori. She was now even taller than she was before and was fat all around. Her red jacket and gray unitard were practically tattooed to her skin and her belly was so large that she was practically a walking continent. From the looks of it, she didn't seem to have a chin anymore. She was so large now that her wings looked too small to fly. \"That is quite enough,\" the gargoyle policewoman says. \"Irene, it isn't R.L.'s fault. Shelly sold him the nebutori and he didn't know what it was. I was wondering why that kappa was moving out yesterday. She's probably skipped town by now.\" Petra then lets out a slight belch before grabbing her lip. \"Believe me, Irene, I don't like this mess either. My big sister was always the lardo in the family. If she were to see what the nebutori did to me, I'd never hear the end of it.\" Irene gives Petra a glare. \"If I knew what Shelly was going to unleash, that bloody kappa, I'd be dining on turtle soup right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYikes, Irene was pissed. Bernice, the red fire genie waddled up from the hall but then let out a sigh. Bernice's fat all went to her ass from the looks of it. \"I quit,\" she says. \"Build an elevator, because I'm not taking a single step upstairs. Oh, by the way, Chel said that they need one last ingredient for the cure, but it won't be in the shop for three weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three weeks?!\" yells Irene. \"We're gonna be walking continented sized sums for three freakin' weeks!? Bernice! Where do you keep your skillet and butter?! I'm going to eat that little bastard for lunch for putting me in blubber belly hell for three weeks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to run down the hall to keep Lupa or Irene from seeing you. However you bump into a monster who was sleeping in the hallway. It was the kitsune woman, Janine and the nebutori had ballooned her up to such an obese size that she was wearing her kimono as a cape and her nine tails were covering up her breasts and privates because it was obvious she wasn't wearing clothes. Her breasts were both big enough to make a molehill out of Mt. Fuji to say nothing of her girth. You have to climb up one of the fox giantess's tails and walk across her bloated belly, but then you feel yourself sinking on the fat beneath her massive boobs and yell as you are sunk in the valley of lard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you find yourself suddenly being pulled out of Janine's cleavage. You thought you were safe. Then you realize you were looking at a nebutori-infected...</span></div></div>",

The thing was a wrecking ball, each cheek several times the size of Neferenina's own head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because of you,\" Neferenina started, her tone heavy with venom. \"I'm no longer a mummy!

The yeti had surprised everyone with just how much she could pack away and her body reflected it. Her belly was huge, the white furred dome stretching out in front of Chel to the point that it nearly doubled her mass! The only contestant that had come close to the monstrous level of stuffed that Chel had achieved was Lupa. Your werewolf nemesis was smaller but not by that much. Said werewolf was currently scowling at Chel, who was gently patting her belly to relieve some of the stress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could've run over and kissed the engorged yeti, you were so happy! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeferenina was less enthused, a frown etched on her puffy face. She had been so sure that someone like Lupa would have won and she could watched as you were either devoured or worse. Instead Chel, a monster who would never hurt, had won and saved your hide. She waddled her way over to Chel, frustration virtually pouring out of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she began, nonplussed. \"You won, Chel.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChel nodded. \"That *urp* did.

While she did agree to hand you over to whomever won, she also wanted you suitably (in her opinion) punished. <i>It would be so easy</i>, Neferenina thought. She could just throw you over to Lupa or even call another contest or the like. Chel had won but she looked to be at her limits and probably couldn't eat another bite. Lupa, however, looked like she was still rearing for another round. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Chel HAD won. Fair and square.

But I'm a fair sport. Chel, if you win this last time, it's over and you're free to do with RL whatever you want. Eat him, make him a servant, take him on a date, I don't care anymore.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if Lupa wins?\" Chel asked, clearly dreading the answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere Neferenina paused, really thinking it over. \"In fairness, if Lupa wins we'll then have a tiebreaker and whomever wins that wins the whole thing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slapped a hand to your face in disbelief. You should've known that Neferenina would pull something like this. For Chel's part, she looked like she was going to be sick. She had stuffed herself to hell and back to make sure that she won so that you didn't get killed or tortured. The boulder that was her belly was proof of that. She didn't know if she could do that again. That was until she saw your clearly distraught face and saw Lupa, huffing and puffing, maneuvering up towards the you, her and Neferenina. The werewolf, despite looking tired from trying to heave her bulk, looked smug as ever. Chel's face set into a determined grimace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" was all the yet said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, Neferenina was quite pleased. Even if Chel won, the yeti wouldn't be moving around too much to protect you. If Lupa won this round, you were most likely doomed as it was doubtful Chel would be able to eat enough to have a chance in the third round. Lupa would the meal she always wanted and she (Neferenina) will have finally gotten rid of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then.\" Neferenina smiled. \"Let's get this started!\"</span></div></div>",

It was more like she was simply a part of her own belly, rather than it being a part of her. Said massive organ made loud, churning noises, attempting to digest all that Chel had consumed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to far away, Lupa lay on her side, groaning and her belly bulging out from her. Again, she had come close. Close enough that you swore your blood turned to ice for a while. However, the werewolf had eventually eaten herself into a food coma. Her stomached vibrated visibly with what you guessed was indigestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeferenina could only gape. She had been so sure that Lupa's appetite and Chel seemingly hitting her limits would have guaranteed your demise. But is wasn't to be. The mummy sighed, resigned. She marched up to the wrecking ball Chel and without so much as a word, put you into Chel hand and then marched off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChel brought you up to her shoulder and set you there. You immediately prostrated yourself on said shoulder, almost crying from sheer happiness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you...\" you muttered over and over again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChel gave a weak smile. \"No *urp* problem, RL.

Nefernina raises her hand in both disappointment and fear because the winner of the eating competition was Petra Maza, the gargoyle policewoman. Petra was already the tallest woman in the entire building and towered over most of her fellow tenants, which was why they feared her. However, after the nebutori struck combined with that eating contest, Petra was even bigger than she was before. She was downright blob like. She had to be three-times as tall as Nefernina and had at least four chins. Her belly was stretched out and covering half the table while her ass was even wider than she was tall. Her tail, arms and legs were also bloated and her wings were so undersized that it would be a wonder if she could fly. And she still wasn't finished. She stoically bit into a pterodactyl leg as she stared at Nefernina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a problem, Nefernina?\" asked the enormous gargoyle. Nefernina waddled back as she looked up in fear at the gargoyle staring down on her. \"No, no problem at all,\" said the corpulent mummy with a nervous laugh. \"The winner is Petra Maza.\" Nefernina reached into her cleavage and handed you into Petra's flabby clawed hand. Despite being the landlady, Nefernina was scared to second death of Petra. Petra had the authority to arrest anyone she caught doing anything illegal and the apartment, even if they were the landlady. Everyone got out of the way so Petra could waddle her enormous hulk down the hallway. She cast a shadow over everyone she passed. You were scared yourself. You didn't know what Petra had planned for you. Sure, she was most likely pissed off at you for turning her into a blimp like most of the other girls. However, she's still a cop so she could be reasonable. Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look and see that the hallways were miraculously big enough for the enormously obese gargoyle to move around. Nefernina must've cast a spell. You are however, shiver as the gargoyle giantess moves her fat body up the stairs. You pray that the stairs don't break under the talons of such a large gargoyle lady. Petra reaches her apartment and then sits on the remains of her couch as she lays you on her right breast. You can feel the gargoyle staring down on you as cross your fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Petra! Don't kill me! I had no idea that the nebutori...\" Petra places a flabby orange finger over your mouth. \"I know. Very few humans out of Japan know what nebutori is and you certainly don't look Japanese to me. But that doesn't mean that I'm not mad, R.L. My sisters are never going to let me hear the end of this.\" \"Sisters?\" you ask. \"I didn't know you had sisters.\" Petra holds up a photograph of herself and two other gargoyles. One of the gargoyles was a raven-haired yellow-skinned gargoyle. She was the shortest of the three sisters and was very obese, albeit not as severe as any of the monster girls who were currently infected with nebutori. There was also a red gargoyle girl with purple-hair worn in a ponytail. She was taller than the yellow gargoyle but shorter than Petra. She was slightly chubby in the stomach but her ass was so huge it could be used as a wrecking ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra gave a sigh. \"They grew in the wrong way. The yellow gargoyle is my older sister, Roxy. She lives in Terrordale and works as a lifeguard.\" \"Older sister?!\" you ask. \"I thought you were...\" Petra shoots a glare at you as her eyes glow red and you shut up. You couldn't believe that Petra wasn't the oldest of her sisters. She sure looked the oldest given that her hair was white and she was the tallest of the siblings. \"And the red gargoyle?\" \"That's my younger sister, Janet.\" You were confused. Janet? Petra and Roxy made sense but Janet sounded odd. Petra let out a groan and grabbed herself by the face. \"And to think, me and Janet are the ones who always taunt Roxy about her weight. Roxy is a twig compared to me thanks to that nebutori. You can bet by the time I find Shelly, she's be turtle soup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry, Petra,\" you say as you stand on Petra's boob. \"I didn't mean for this to happen.\" Petra laid back as her stomach poured over and covered her coffee table. She scratched her hips and rolled her eyes. \"I know that, but a lot of monsters out there aren't as understanding. I figure that if you stay with me at all times, I'll be able to keep you from harm.\" You let out a sigh of relief. Petra then rubbed her stomach as it churned. You let out a sigh of relief and then lay back in Petra's folds of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long...</span></div></div>",

I mean, won't the nebutori have most Horrorville laid up?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True but it's a little more complicated then that.\" The policewomen answers, patiently as she moved to the door. \"While the female population is suffering from being big and lazy, there could still be crimes. Someone could be hungry enough to bust into a store for instance. Don't forget, nebutori only affects females, the male population just might take advantage of that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Hadn't really thought about that...\" You admitted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra gave a small chuckle. \"It's not exactly your job.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you two lightly chatted, Petra waddled down the hallways and stairs. Anyone loitering in her path was quick to move out of her way. Some, however, made a move to growl when the spotted you, only to be silenced when Petra gave them a glare. The gargoyle's massive frame had only heightened any intimidation factor she already possessed. For your part, you were feeling surprisingly okay, even with all the glares and hostile intent directed towards you. As Petra basically owned you, there wasn't anything they could do to you without her approval. Add on to that that she was a cop, too...you had really lucked up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra, given her size, quickly traversed through the building to outside. She made her way to her police car and, with a good amount of effort and grunting, squeezed herself into the driver's seat. She started the car and drove away slowly, her belly obstructing her access to the wheel and her large breasts blocking some parts of her vision. However, not even a minute later, her vast belly began to emit deep rumblings, prompting Petra to groan and your eyes to widen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" You asked her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra gave an exasperated shake of her head. \"Blasted nebutori...you know, I'm not a glutton but I'm hungry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took every once of willpower for your jaw to not drop. \"But-but how? You just ate a feast not too long ago.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't remind me.\" Petra muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, can't you just stop and grab something to hold you for a little while?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have time to stop and eat anything significant, RL. Besides, the only place that is even close to us is a donut shop.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if it works...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RL, I hate that stereotype if I being honest. On top of that, given what I'm like at the moment, a handful of donuts isn't going to do me much good. If I go in there, I'm liable to clean the whole place out by myself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra contemplated for a moment and from what you could tell, despite what she said, she was really considering whether to stop or not. After a few more seconds thinking and audible growling coming from her belly, Petra came to her decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot before long...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were watching from your position on Petra's right boob as she took box after box after box of donuts from the bloated worker. Honestly, you had stopped counting after about thirteen... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. \"Petra, if you give in every time...well, do I really need to say it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no and you're right but I all ready bought them all...not much else can I but either eat them or let my money go to waste.\" Petra reasoned as she took the last box and set it with all the others in the passenger seat next to her. The sheer number of boxes piled in the seat was a mountain in it's own right and Petra didn't waste much time in the process in reducing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly drove pulled her car out of the drive-thru and into a parking lot. Despite her hunger, Petra demonstrated enough self control to not try eating and driving. Instead she opted to just find a nice parking spot and plow through her large mound of donut boxes. Even further to her credit, Petra didn't eat like a starving animal. She ate quickly but smoothly. It took a good twenty minutes, but Petra ate her way through the boxes' contents far more quickly than you thought. She have her taunter belly a firm pat and gave a discreet belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thirty-five boxes...\" You muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra shrugged, wiping her fingers with a napkin. \"Hey, I won Nefernina's contest, remember?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a dry chuckle. \"I was there. Thanks for that, again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you're taking this nebutori real well. I mean, I expected you to be a little more annoyed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RL, I never wanted to be big...er. But it happened and I'm dealing with it. I just have to not keep repeating these binges and I'll be fine. Gargoyles are a lot stronger than most monsters, I can handle all this extra weight. I won't be winning any races but I can get around. I just have to hold for the cure and then I'll worry about slimming down.\" You could tell that that answer was to reassure herself, just as much as it was to answer you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't overdo it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra nodded. \"I'll do my best but little help wouldn't hurt.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave her a playful salute and smile. \"Private RL, reporting for morale support, ma'am!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra actually gave a laugh and returned your smile. \"Well, private, let's actually get to work.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Petra started her car back up, ready to proceed with her patrol.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

You gave them a chance and they lost. That's no one's fault but their's!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra added her own glare in agreement before speaking. \"Quite right. Nefernina, they had a chance and lost it. You said whoever won could do whatever they wanted with RL. Well, I won, so what I say goes when it comes to him.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNefernina had the decency to look ashamed before she replied. \"I know, I know. It's just that all of the tenants are still angry because they feel like RL got off...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra's eyes glowed white as she cut in. \"It's not his fault in the first place, so he can't really 'get off'.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mummy threw her hands up in to placate the gargoyle. \"Look, I'm not saying that there's going to be another contest. Heck, I knew how you'd take it if I just did another one. So I told them that when you got back, I'd tell you what was going on and that you'd get your say in the matter. You did win, after all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Petra just continued to glare down at the mummy. After a few moments, Petra turned her gaze from the mummy and looked over to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you think, RL?\" She asked, her tone even. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave an annoyed sigh. \"I think it's crap. I've already been put on the chopping block for something that's not my fault. But more importantly, why should you have go through this AGAIN? Everyone's got to deal with nebutori, including you, especially after winning the first contest. Shoot, you'd just win again and have that much more work to do once the cure get's here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra nodded, taking it in. For your part, no matter what Petra decided. You were confident that you newest companion could handle anything that came your way. She won the first contest and was bigger and even hungrier for it. There was no why she'd lose. If Petra refused, she was still the biggest monster in the building and a cop. No one would mess with her. Either way, you were safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNefernina looked like she was on the verge of a conniption fit. \"Look, I understand you're upset and you've got every right. The thing is that the tenants' aren't just going to let this go. They're going to just keep coming up with things. They told that if you didn't agree to another contest. I mean, it got crazy. Eating contests are one thing but they were talking about sumo contest, trivia, beauty contests, even KARAOKE contests! FREAKING KARAOKE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mummy threw up her hands for further emphasis. \"At the end of the day, it's up to you. All I'll say is that if you agree to the eating contest, I'll throw in another prize for. If you win, I'll get you whatever you want as long as it's in reason. You want a miniature room just for RL put in your room and your entire apartment redone. Fine. Done. You want to have a whole floor to yourself. I can make it happen. Just please consider it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNefernina was really desperate and it was plain on her face. Ever since Petra won the eating contest, they just didn't leave her alone. They all knew that Petra wouldn't hurt you. They also knew that Nefernina didn't like you. So that they thought it would be so easy for them to convince her for a rematch. What they hadn't counted on was the fact that Nefernina was terrified of Petra and that she didn't want to be on the gargoyle's bad side. But she was stuck between a rock and a hard place. If she didn't at least ask Petra for a rematch, the tenants would never leaver her alone. But if she did ask, she'd risk incurring Petra's wrath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Petra's part, she was seriously starting to get angry. You weren't to blame for any of this and yet everyone kept demanding your blood. Just as bad, it was like none of your neighbors cared that they were really just making their own lives worse by blimping themselves up just in the name no misplaced revenge! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a better idea.\" Petra started, a hard edge in her voice. \"How about if I win we make a contract that no one is allowed to hurt RL? \"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's be a nice change of pace.\" You mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't promise that!\" Nefernina exclaimed. She hurried to explain when she saw Petra scowl. \"Even if I threatened to kick them out or something if they hurt RL, they could still go behind my back an do it. It'd be an actual contract, if they break it I'd be liable as well!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra just glared down at the mummy for several heartbeats before she gave her final say in the matter.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When I win this, AGAIN, I giving them all a piece of my mind!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that declaration, you concluded something. Petra was a monster who held a very strong sense of right and wrong. She simply refused to let thing truly spiral out of control. Her figure was just a sacrifice that she had to make to get some control on the situation. Then there's the fact that she considered your protection as something truly important. You felt rather content in that and safe. Safer than you ever been since coming to monster arms. The nebutori may have landed you in hot water but it had also given you a seemingly true friend and guardian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra smiled at you, bring you out of your thoughts. \"Besides, I can't just let my new friend get hurt, can I?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled back. \"Well, you could but then you'd miss out on my morale support.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Petra held each others' gaze for a moment before you both busted out laughing. Petra entered her apartment, you both still laughing. <br>\r\n-------------------- <br>\r\nJust as Nefernina said, she called you and Petra down in an hour. Petra, with you placed in her cleavage for safety, made her way down to where the contest would be held. It was the same setup as last time. A large table, arrayed with scores and scores of food and surrounded by the various tenants, each of them even bigger than they had been during the last contest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Petra came in to take her own place around the table, Nefernina came up, hand outstretched, obviously wanting to hold onto you just like before. Petra's response as to glare and the mummy quickly took the hint and backed off. Nefernina instead turned to address everyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Same rules as last time. The winner who eats the most and the longest wins. Ready...set...go!\" Nefernina announced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that call, everyone tore into the food, snarling, chewing, and grunting. For her part, Petra ate quickly. She'd pick up a pterodactyl drumstick and strip it clean in a matter of moments before moving on to the next morsel. You watched calmly with absolute confidence in your gargoyle friend as she devoured the food in front of her with a quickness one would not expect from her size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the contest came towards the end, announced by a thunderous belch of victory that shook parts of the building... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her last attempted at the contest had obvious results. Her thighs were huge, each mountains of adipose that had previously made up much of her bulk. Her stomach was a dome of purple flesh, pulled absolutely taunt from the amount of food packed into it and currently dominated her physique. Her breasts are rather larger but nowhere near any absurd proportions. Her face had large puffy cheeks and at least two extra chins. Irene was big, there was no doubt but she was nowhere near Petra's size. She maybe a bit taller than Nefernina but that was all. It would certainly change once all the food in her gut was digested. Currently, she was pinned to floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A tie?! I ate the most!\" Irene insisted. \"Besides that little bastard has to pay for this!\" She motioned towards her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra glared from her own position. Petra had eaten a lot but due to her larger size and high level of strength, bared the weight much better. Her own stomach was rather taut but other than that, she appeared unchanged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RL's not responsible at tall for this mess! Shelly was!\" Petra growled. \"Besides, at this point you're doing this to yourself! You didn't have to push for another contest or participate!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrene gave a snarl and Petra's eyes glowed white in warning. You could practically see lighting shooting between the two and the room was flooded with tension. You were rather nervous. Did Irene really hate you that much to do fatten herself up just to get revenge?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNefernina cautiously stepped between the two angry monsters, hands held up in placation. \"Look, it was a tie. We can have another round to settle it? Deal?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra whipped her gaze over to the mummy who shrank back but swung her gaze back to Irene when the cyclops yelled out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine by me! What's wrong, Petra?! Actually scared that this time I'll win?!\" Irene exclaimed, her voice dripping with condescension. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra glowered at the cyclops who appeared to unaffected. \"Fine...we'll do this one more time. You sure you can handle anymore food?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Petra remark, you studied Irene. She looked tired. She just didn't seem like she could fit anymore into that belly, no matter what she said. While you didn't have the best view of Petra from you position between her breasts, she didn't seem even that winded or tired. You best guess that Irene had just powered on through on nothing but determination and anger. Despite the rather troubling turn of event, you felt like Petra could really still win this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNefernina cut in again. \"Okay, tie breaker time! Ready... steady...GO!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the two monster went at the food again, which seemed to have magically replaced itself. Both were tearing into like animals. Anger driving the both to abandon all manners. One was driven to protect, the other to destroy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut only one could claim victory. Who wins?<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite all the bluster, all the seeming anger fueled determination, Irene just couldn't cut it. She maybe eaten away 1/8 of the food before she seemed to seize up and collapse onto the table. You all but cheered when you saw the cyclops go down like a collapsing building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra noticed her opponent had gone down as swell but she didn't stop eating until all the food was gone. It wasn't because she was a glutton. It wasn't because she was even that hungry. She'd done it to prove a point. She done it so that everyone would see that no matter what they pulled, she'd win. She devoured all the food to prove that none of them had a snowball's chance in hell in keeping up with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when the last bit of food passed down her throat and into her belly, she glared out at the stunned audience of your fellow tenants. The sheer amount that Petra had eaten had shocked them all into silence. Her belly, large as it had been before had now overtaken the table. Her breasts had ballooned until that brushed up against her puffy cheeks and her face now held at least six chins. Her ass, which had already been wider than herself was easily big enough to crush several of the nebutori infected tenants underneath it with each cheek being a wrecking ball onto itself. Her limbs were like doughy marshmallows ending in hands and feet while her tail resembled a large body pillow. Her wings were comically out-sized barely able to be glimpsed from behind her bulk. But what truly made Petra seem enormous was her height. She was at least five times the height of Nefernina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when glared at the rest of you neighbors, several of them took steps away from the clearly angry gargoyle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, since that's out of the way, we need to have a nice little chat.\" Petra growled. \"You all seem to be incapable of controlling yourselves, so I'll have to do it for you. RL is not to blame for the nebutori. He had no idea what it did or just how much trouble it can cause. He already feels guilty over the whole thing. But that's not the real problem here. The problem is that none you seem like you can get your acts together. That cure will be here in a few weeks. Once it's here, we'll all be cured. But the weight isn't going anywhere unless you get rid of it. If I were all of you I'd be more worried about working it off than getting any kind of revenge. If you don't like that, TOUGH!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra lifted her immense belly off the table before allowing it to fall back down, causing the table to buckle under it's immense weight. There were several shouts of surprise and shock from everyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra gave a growl, her eyes glowing red. \"If you don't like the fact that you can't take it out on someone, then you can try and take it up with me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one seemed to be willing to do that in the least. With the matter seemingly settled, Petra turned towards Nefernina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and I will talk about the rest of the agreement later.\" The mummy gave a nervous nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Petra turned to leave, each ponderous step sending vibrations through the floor and nearby objects. As Petra made her way back to her own apartment, you noticed that she actually seemed out of breath, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" You ask tentatively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra gave a nod. \"I'm fine, it's all that eating and moving all this weight around is finally causing a little strain. If I wasn't a gargoyle, I don' t think I could even move after all that food.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could agree with that. \"So what now? You think that they'll back off?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they don't, I can always use a new couch cushion.\" Petra joked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be funny. But, speaking about that, you think you'll ever lose all this weight?\" You honestly a tad worry about how everything would affect Petra's life day to day. It didn't helped that she had sacrificed a lot for your sake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Petra sighed. \"Well, I don't know. I don't think I can really get back to my previous size. I'm sure that I can slim down, just not by how much. It's not like I'm trying to impress anyone. I would like to be able to fly again, however.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you two retreated back into the gargoyles apartment, ready for rest a relaxation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

There'd been little rumblings about the contest and how things played but nothing too serious. In fact, except for the occasional annoyed look or short-lived glare, you couldn't really remember any open hostility. The closest thing to a problem that came up was Lupa or Irene leering at you. However, the two had really kept their distance. Irene, out of the fact that, from what you heard, was actually trying to get a diet together and training regiment going. Lupa's reason was far less admirable, she was staying away because you really didn't leave Petra's company and the one time she had tried something, Petra had used her for an impromptu chair. That had left lasting enough impression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNefernina had also made good on her promise of redoing Petra's apartment. The couch had been replaced by a large more reinforced one as had the coffee table. Petra had also gotten an extremely large and comfy reclining chair and new bed. Nefernina had even made to what amounted to a miniature apartment inside Petra's. It had a bed, couch, TV and even a shower all perfectly sized for you. The mummy hadn't been too happy to do it but honored her deal nonetheless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to Petra's increased size, she hadn't been able to go on patrol, if only because she couldn't fit in the police car and the walk to the station all the time just wouldn't have been practical. That didn't stop Petra from working, however. She'd taken to sorting through police files and reports through her computer. When she wasn't doing that, she was using her new free time to talk Chel about some tips to slimming down and curving her hunger. When she wasn't doing that, Petra would just shoot the breeze with you. You two would talk or joke about things. Overall, it was a rather lighthearted environment when with your new roommate.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, RL?\" Petra started, looking up from her computer. \"We should go out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned away from your new TV. \"Out?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra nodded. \"I don't know, catch a movie or something? I just kind want to get out for a bit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mused it over for a second. \"Yeah, I mean all this new stuff is cool and all but I'd like a change of pace. But how would we get around? You can't really drive.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a movie theater and a park not that far from here actually. I've gone to both a few times.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned off the TV. \"Well, it be nice to get out of here for a bit. So should we go to the movies or the park?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra thought it over as she rose up from her new recliner.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did she decide to go?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Petra rises up, her stomach, butt and breasts shake, hypnotizing you as you step back and your new titanic gargoyle roommate waddles her way up to you. \"I think it would be in our best interest to catch a movie. There's a new Corona Poe flick at the theater.\" \"Corona Poe?\" you ask. \"Who's that?\" Petra gives a scoff. \"Corona Poe is a famous monster actress. Just her appearing in a movie guarantees it 5 stars.\" Petra points to a poster on the wall and you see that Corona Poe is apparently a very plus-sized apple-figured minotaur woman resembling a mix between a bison and and a Native American woman. She had copper-colored fur with long black hair and small horns that looked like those of an American buffalo. From the looks of it, she also had a large udder and wore glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a whistle. \"She's quite a looker. Did she gain weight for that role?\" \"Actually,\" says Petra. \"Female minotaurs are naturally heavyset much like real cattle. But this movie in particular doesn't just involve Corona. Vienna co-stars in it.\" Vienna was a name you knew. She was a famous singer, primarily a jazz singer and you heard Elle playing her music at high volume. Vienna was a gargoyle like Petra. She had gold skin and long brown hair. However, unlike Petra who had a more humanoid face, Vienna's face was bestial and almost ape-like, yet still clearly feminine, with cat-like ears. You also remember that Vienna had Lactose Overload Syndrome much like Aiba. Vienna was exclusively addressed by her first name and her surname was a complete mystery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" you say. \"But Vienna's a singer.\" Petra lifts you up and places you between her massive breasts as you sink between the nebutori-inflicted gargoyle's folds of fat. \"A singer who is good friends with Corona. This is her debut as an actress. What's more, the movie is set in one of the Chameleon Claw Hotels.\" You heard of that hotel chain. There was one of them down the street. It was a business run by Claire Melon, a chameleon-like werelizard that you heard had a reputation for being extremely neurotic. \"I'll take your word for it.\" Petra smiles and then walks out the door. Though it takes some effort as even with Nefernina's magic, she couldn't make the doors wide enough for the massively fattened female tenants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra finally squeezes her gargoyle booty through the doorway and then waddles down the hallway. Bernice is stepping out of her apartment and has gotten so obese that she's reduced to wearing a black unitard with white highlights and an apron. That only helped to highlight her resemblance to Red She-Hulk. \"Hi, Petra,\" says the fire genie. \"I was just about to head off to the theater.\" Petra gives a slight chuckle. \"So were we.\" Bernice spotted you and then nodded her head before waddling by Petra's side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you saw Irene bending over and trying to touch her toes. You see nothing but her large butt, but the cyclops turns her head as much as her multiple chins allow so she can glare at you. Lupa is nearby ready to strike but then she sees Petra's massive badonkadonk that is more than twice her height and Petra glares at Lupa. \"Leave R.L. alone, Lupa,\" says Petra. \"Need I remind you that I could use a wolf-shaped sofa cushion.\" Petra taps her behind as it shakes and Lupa gets the message and walks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk down the stairs takes its toll on Petra and Bernice and they stop to catch their breath before they both made their way towards the front door. However, Petra gets stuck and Bernice is forced to try and push the overstuffed gargoyle through the door. Petra tries to pull herself and gives a grunt. \"You'd think that Nefernina would've made these doors big enough to accommodate a butt that makes her own look like a pimple.\" You say. Bernice is having some trouble pushing Petra through when she spots Janine waddling from the mail room with only her fox tails hiding her nipples and privates. \"Janine! A little help here.\" The kitsune takes one butt cheek while Bernice takes the other and they push with all their might, finally shoving Petra through the door. Petra is forced to flap her wings to maintain her balance. You nearly fall out of Petra's cleavage but her belly fat cushions your tumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was close.\" You say. Petra then lets out a laugh and fondles her own massive booty. \"Boy, would my younger sister Janet be incensed if she saw me like this. She can get really jealous when she meets a girl with more booty than she has.\" Bernice stands up and runs after Petra as she is waddling towards the movie. You see that Horrorville hasn't shown much improvement from the nebutori plague. All the women were massively obese but none were as big as Petra. You see a lot of female monsters were choosing to take taxis and buses. Merely walking became a Herculean task for them. Petra jiggles right up to the movie theater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was there you see a poster that advertised the movie. It was apparently a movie made as a homage to the style of the 80s and it showed Corona and Vienna side by side. It was apparently a music-themed movie, which explained why Vienna was in the movie to begin with. The title was \"Starlight Virgo\". You then see that Petra was at the ticket booth. The woman in charge of the ticket booth was a harpy who was infected by the nebutori as well. She was a harpy with the wings and legs of a black bull finch and she also had slicked back gray hair. She stared at the much larger Petra and was visibly intimidated before Petra lowered her head. \"Two tickets for Starlight Virgo.\" The bull finch harpy blinks. \"Two?\" Then she notices you and licks her lips. You're worried but then Petra's eyes glow bright red and the harpy girl nervously takes Petra's money and gives her the tickets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't long before Petra is sitting down in eight chairs in the movie theater and has two large popcorns that are bigger than Roman coliseums as well as a large soda that she has placed in between her breasts. She holds you on her shoulder and passes you a piece of popcorn that you nibble on. It's as big as a bowling ball to you. You were really looking forward to this. But then you were wondering. Does this mean you're on a date with Petra?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could think anymore on the situation...</span></div></div>",

This wasn't getting you anywhere.\" Nefernina let out a yell and pulled on her hair as she shouted into her bloated breasts. \"This isn't getting us anywhere! There's no food left in the apartment buildings! Not a single scrap!\" \"Well I'm not letting this orange behemoth beat me!\" yells Irene. \"So what do we do now?\" \"We leave,\" said Petra. \"If I eat anymore I won't be able to walk. I already can't fly. Besides, Irene, haven't you tortured yourself enough with this petty anger.\" Irene was about ready to deck Petra as Nefernina held her arm back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You idiot! You'll get into worse trouble for assaulting an officer!\" Irene gave a hiss as Nefernina held her head. \"Okay,\" she said. \"Clearly this is getting us both nowhere. No more eating contests.

You felt your chest tighten as your own dread builds. You had no idea what to expect from whomever this Giselle was. You aren't given too much time to wallow in anymore of your fears when Nefernina starts moving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew if, Nefernina had stopped in front of the fattest monster, you had ever seen, counting the nebutori infected tenants! The monster was a sphinx, her body was that of winged, white furred lion. Her face was that of a human women's with large cat ears and long hair that was golden colored. And she was <i>immense</i>. Her body was like a vast sphere of white fur that was so large that it's bulk spread out over the ground to the point that her legs could barely reach around the blubber to scrap the ground. Her breasts her so bulbous that they pushed into the sides of her fattened face, making her puffed cheeks seem even larger than they already were and forcing her to squint. She had multiples chins going down from her face. Her legs and wings looked comically small, just jutting out of her vast bulk and seemed as though they had been filled with air. Overall, from what you could tell Giselle was several times as big a Nefernina, her fattened self not only spreading out wider but also rising high into the air above Nefernina's head. But then something that caught your attention. It was the expression of Giselle's face: a mixture of anger, embarrassment and...sorrow?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were startled out of you reverie when Nefernina plucked you out of your place between her breasts. She handed you to Giselle, who brought a paw up with a grunt of effort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go, Giselle.\" The mummy laughed. \"He's your's to do what ever you want!\" With the Nefernina walking off and laughing, sure of your demise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiselle stared down at you, her gaze intense. You gulped and felt a shiver run up the length of your spine but you held her gaze. For about a minute that was all you two did before Giselle spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what you've done to me?\" She spoke, her tone quiet and somewhat hitched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just nodded, afraid that anything else would just set her off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued, voice cracking as she went. \"You, humans. All you do is make dumb decisions. When a sphinx encounters a human, they have to ask a riddle to decide whether or not they eat the human. But you humans just can't do anything right. I ask the riddle and all of you get it wrong! I've eaten hundreds you humans, not because I was even hungry but because none of you seem to have brain! I ate so many of you that before...all of this...I was bigger than LUPA!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened. She'd eaten that many?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiselle saw your expression and nodded, tears rolling down her cheeks now. \"Oh yeah! I became a fatass long before you and that nebutori! I had to endure all kinds of riducule! I couldn't even go out any more with out someone pointing out how fat I am. 'Hey, the nearest buffet's that way!' 'Giselle, you should really lay off the dessert!' I was beautiful once upon a time but now...but...now...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringed as the sphinx let out a heart-wrenching roar of sadness. \"I'm a blasted WHALE! All because of YOU! Well, someone's got to PAY!!\" Giselle used her paw to wipe away some tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt bad. Scratch that, you felt horrible for Giselle. With everyone else, it was just anger, which you expected. But to see a monster just break down crying and to know that you were at least partly responsible it...even worse, you were apart of something that had been making her miserable for God knows how long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry...\" You spoke quietly, your head downcast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sphinx regards you, eyes red and cheeks wet. \"Yeah...well I don't think you're sorry enough...\" That caused you to look up, guilt giving way to trepidation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do with me?\" You ask, nervous of the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiselle opened her mouth and said...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If I happen to get any bigger, well, we'll just have to deal with it...<i>together</i>.\" She emphasized the last part with a snarl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped at that but Giselle wasn't done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think for a second that you can refuse either. I don't have to eat you! I've more than enough ways to make you miserable.\" She threatened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven those bloodshot, teary eyes glaring at you, you believed it. Giselle had gone from breaking down to a tearful sort of rage that terrified you. Goodness knows that she had in store for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The last several days had been...interesting if nothing else. Giselle had kept to her word of making you help her out. Once she had gotten you and herself back to her place, which given her bulk, took some time, she got back to her life with you in tow. As she now owned you, you would be staying with her. You quickly noticed that everything in the building had been...expanded. From what Giselle told you, Nefernina had used some enchantment to give the tenants more room to move around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiselle had been quick to put you to work. The moment you had gotten into the room, she had all but demanded that you place an order for several extra large pizzas, as she had been quite hungry from all the walking she'd done. And so the days went, Giselle would have you do something: everything from placing several different takeout orders a day to searching around her desk or drawers to find certain things as her size constantly got in the way of more precise movements. Overall, she had been a little demanding but she hadn't been too cruel or vindictive toward you just yet. She hadn't made you do anything embarrassing or disgusting just yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the last days, you had also learned several things. You found out that Giselle mainly did computer jobs since she had been gaining weight from all the humans she had consumed. While this was a point of contention for her, it had benefited her once the nebutori had hit. She was bigger and fatter but she had already adjusted to living like that, no matter how much she hated it. Still, you couldn't imagine how much ridicule she would have had to endure to force her into all but cutting herself off from the outside world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had also gotten to see several pictures of herself that had of before she had become an overstuffed parody of herself. Giselle had been rather attractive, all things considering. She had had sharply defined facial features that many a human woman would have died for. Her body had been nice, trim and toned. Her fur, feathers and hair had a healthy sheen to them. All in all, you could really see why see was so concerned with her looks. She had lost what many would've called perfection through no fault of her own. Add the nebutori on top of that and well...it definitely made her anger much more justified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven all that, you struck you that Giselle seemed to be just eating herself into a deeper hole. The nebutori had her ordering food frequently, like everybody else. The thing was, you had heard from her that several others had started trying to get an exercise group going to fight off the nebutori. You asked Giselle if she would join them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer response was simple: <i>\"It doesn't matter anymore.\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou highly doubted that. But really what could you do? You guessed that you could try to talk to her about it and risk getting her really, really angry. Or you could do nothing and watch as Giselle let's herself go until she outgrows the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were legitimately afraid for your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And since I'm already fat and miserable right now,\" says Irene. \"It doesn't matter anymore. It doesn't matter how much I starve myself or exercise because this nebutori isn't going anywhere soon. Which is why it won't make a difference if I break my diet and pig out on a certain piece of junk food, just! This! Once!\" Irene opened her mouth wide and you knew where this was going. You were so dead.</span></div></div>",

I was duped by Shelly! How was I supposed to know??! I don't even speak japanese, how was I to know about the effects?\" you try reasoning with her, but seeing that your pleading wasn't working, you keep trying to reason with her, desperately so. \"What will Petra say? Or Candance? I ALREADY TOLD YOU I'M SORRY!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a sudden stop, as you hung right above the cyclopean woman's mouth, who thankfully closed. Her glare still remained, though. \"Didn't you hear me, flea? At this point I. Don't. Give. A. Damn.\" she stressed each word with venom for emphasis. \"You ruined me, you ruined my figure, and all the effort I wasted to stay healthy and fit is GONE. FOREVER.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, to your great dismay, Irene starts opening her mouth again, and you feel her grip on you loosening slowly, as if to torture you with a slow but iminent death. Gears grinding at Mach 5 in your head, you urgently think back at what she said, how she was before this whole disaster was unleashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT!! Irene, please wait! I've just thought of something, something you could benefit from!\" Her grip holds, and her mouth closes again, much to your relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...you're just trying to buy time, aren't you, worm?\" said the cyclops, baring her teeth at you. Sensing the precious time you just bought going to waste, you inhale sharply, and let it all out, panic still occasionally shaking your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Irene, I know how much you love exercising to be the pinacle of health and fitness, and you gotta admit, you enjoyed the adrenaline rush you got from knowing you lost weight, got some muscle, stayed sickness-free, right? Think about it, this outbreak is all over the news, and if you manage to lose weight through sheer force of will and physical effort, you'll get recognition, a lot of it.\" as you spoke as clearly and quickly as you could, Irene listening with her eyebrow arched, a thought of joy crossed your mind, you were getting through to her! \"Can you imagine the fame you'll get if you manage to fight the nebutori? Or even how you will inspire all the others to follow your lead? You'll be famous, Irene.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe strokes her flabby chin with her free hand, pondering your idea, before sniggering and smiling at you. Her smile however, was less than reassuring. \"I think you hit your head really hard, because that is complete asinine. But thanks for the laugh.\" she once again raises her hand holding you above her mouth, widening it to swallow you. Talk about deja vu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not listening! I know it's going to be really hard, with the sickness making you lethargic and all, but I also know you're the kind of gal that won't give up! So you'll start all over again, so what? You can do it! You're not going to let the nebutori win! I know you're mad at me, and I'm genuinely sorry for my blunder, but if you eat me now, you'll just be giving up and accepting the nebutori's effects! I can help you, please, just GIVE ME A CHANCE!!\" You close your eyes, as your life literally hangs by a thread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut once again, you feel her grip tightening instead of loosening. Opening your eyes, you blink at Irene's seriously pissed face. She sighs, and lowers her meaty hand, allowing you to climb to the soft palm of her hand. Looking up to her, you thank her for her patience and lower your head in shame. \"I'm sorry for ruining all your hard work, but I'm willing to help you get back in shape. I'll motivate you in any way I can, this I swear, and if I don't keep my promise, you can eat me, or give me to Lupa, she's not worried about her figure, at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, that remains to be seen, twerp. And you're right about Lupa, that overfed mutt only thinks of food.\" she lowers her titanic cherubic face to her hand, her single eye gazing at you with such an angry intensity, you feared for a second she'd fire a laser beam and burn you into ashes. \"Fine, you win this time, but as of now, you're under my supervision. You'll be my coach, and help me lose all this flab until I regain my toned body, if not better. Three weeks is how long Chel said we need until that last ingredient for the cure. Three weeks to help me shed weight, and you'd better deliver, for your sake...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow hard before you get another idea, to further help the cyclopean giantess...</span></div></div>",

As I said earlier, the nebutori is making you lethargic, but with some motivation and force of will, I think you can lose the weight. Here's an example, earlier, you could have just done what everyone else was doing, instead of taking their frustrations out on me, or flat out EAT ME, they just glared and gave up. You (and Lupa to an extent) just went for it, I mean, me. You didn't let the sickness stop you from, well, erasing me from the map.\" all the while, Irene just nods slowly, mulling it over. After a few seconds of pause, she rubs her chipmunk-like cheek with her free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...That is true... I was so consumed by my desire to get payback on you, I practically didn't feel tired or sleepy, or even hungry for that matter... fine.\" with a ponderous grunt, she begins waddling up the stairs. \"But first, if you're going to be my 'coach', as you say, you're going to get yourself patched up.\" she puffs out, laboriously, and you cannot help but look at the cyclopean behemoth of a woman carrying you, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Really? You're taking me to Chel?\" you ask before recoiling from Irene's glare as she suddenly stopped climbing and raised her hand to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get me wrong, idiot. You won't be much of a coach if you can't even run a lap, not with a busted leg like yours is at the moment. And while nothing's stopping me of forcing you to exercise with me in that current condition, I'm not a sadistic bitch like Nefernina. I don't like torture. So you're getting yourself patched up, pronto, so we can begin working this load off.\" she grabbed a handfull of her belly fat with her free hand and shook it for emphasis. You nod slowly, wincing as the pain on your left leg made itself known again, the fear of being eaten by the angry cyclops momentarily made you forget the wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Thanks... and sorry.\" you mutter, shamefully. Your carrier, however, just snorts, frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apologies aren't asked, they are avoided, my father always said.\" Irene mumbles, as she reaches the 1st floor and proceeds to Chel's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way there, you cross paths with Izzy and Lupa, the latter of which was panting and leaning against the wall. Izzy takes a few steps forward, a mix of relief and aprehension plastered on her face, as she sees you alive but still in Irene's grasp. She readies herself to take you away, but you raise a hand and wave, signalling her that you were fine, well sorta, on the inside you were trying desperately to conceal the pain and discomfort emanating from your busted leg. For your credit, Izzy just relents, and shyly waves back, her arm fat and massive bosom jiggling as she does so and Lupa, again for your credit, simply does nothing, her attempt at catching you earlier and wrestling with Izzy left her completely exhausted, so all she did as you two passed by was pout angrily and pant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally reached Chel's room, Izzy knocked a few times, and the door opened to reveal...</span></div></div>",

You see that your yeti friend had gotten more than a little bigger since the last time she saw you, thanks in no small part to the nebutori. Her stomach had to be 1200ft wide and her ass looked like an enormous white snow covered mountain while her breasts looked the same, only slightly smaller. Additionally, you see that Chel was in a motorized wheelchair of some sort, showing that the nebutori had completely immobilized her. Also, aside from her nurse's hat, she's completely naked. The yeti looks at Irene in surprise. \"Irene?\" she asks. \"Yes,\" says Irene with a sigh. \"It's me, Chel.\" Chel nodded her head and rubbed her mountainous large belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Chel gasps because she notices you and sees you holding your leg in pain. \"R.L.?\" she asks. \"Oh my gosh. That looks really painful. How did that happen?\" Irene gave a blush. \"Lupa and I kinda, chased him down the stairs.\" Chel is shocked at that. \"It's okay,\" says Irene with a sigh. \"I was mad, but R.L. came up with an idea that might just help me through this nebutori nightmare. I just need you to fix his leg. He's not of any use to me in this condition.\" Chel nodded her head. \"Come back for him in half an hour, and he should be okay.\" Irene nods her head and leaves you with Chel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yeti woman wheels herself to the table in the center of her apartment and applies some kind of monster medicine to your leg. You groan in pain as she applies that medicine. \"It'll take ten minutes for the leg to fully heal with this medicine,\" says the obese yeti nurse. \"I think I can tell why Irene chased you down the stairs in the first place. This nebutori has everyone on edge.\" \"Speaking of which,\" you say. \"You seem to have become more infected than before.\" Chel cupped her massive butt cheeks and sighed. \"Now I know how Ambrosine Peinture must feel. I can't even move my legs. I can't get to work until this plague is over, but I can still tend to the monsters in this apartment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh,\" you say as Chel is going through some strange elixirs. \"Speaking of that, Chel. Exactly how long will it be until this nebutori mess clears out.\" Chel let out a sigh. \"Unfortunately, it will be a month before the cure is ready and even then, it'll be weeks after for everyone to get back to their normal weight, at least. That Shelly really did it this time. I heard she's halfway to Chillingham by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was another knock on the door. \"That can't be Irene already,\" says Chel as she wheels her chair to the door. \"Must be another patient.\" You give a gulp and Chel opens the door to reveal...</span></div></div>",

She entered with a panicked look on her face, eyes darting to every corner of Chel's home, squeezing past the wheelchair-bound tenant with a curt hello. \"Well, excuse you, Izzy.\" mumbed the bloated yeti nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R.L.??! Where is he??! Lupa said she smelled blood on him, IS HE HURT?\" she bawled, tears forming in her bespectacled eyes. You can't help but flinch a little at this, you don't need this, not right now. Taking a few steps forward (you realize you limped to a hiding spot behind some books layed out in the table, out of paranoia), you wave at the basilisk worrywart and call her name. As soon as she heard your voice, however, she was right on top of you. \"YOUR LEG! WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, I just fell down the stairs, I'll be fine.\" you say as she grabs you and holds you up to her puffy face. Even with the added weight, she was still a beautiful woman. Her face darkened at your explanation, however, and before she can say anything, you tell her off. \"And no, Izzy, Irene did not do this to me. In fact, she was the one who came up with the idea to bring me here.\" hearing this, Izzy's expression eased a bit, although she was still angry at Irene's earlier rampage. The nurse wheeled herself to the edge of the table, still annoyed at the sudden intrusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's right, Izzy. Now put him back on the table so he can relax a bit, the wound is still healing.\" Chel admonished your carrier, and she returned you to the table, as gently as she possibly could. Slowly and carefully, you sit down and stretch your leg, keeping it still. Whatever that medicine was, it was working, as you felt the wound throb with less pain, gradually. Chel cleared her throat, making you look up from your wound. \"So, if you don't mind me asking, how exactly are you going to help Irene fight off the nebutori?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not really that special, I'll just move in with her and help motivate her to shed the weight. I mean, this sickness makes you lethargic and hungry, right? I'll push her buttons in order to keep her focused.\" you clarify, while the two females listen. \"At the same time, I'll try to convince her that having a little pudge isn't such a bad deal, maybe even make her less of a hypochondriac.\" Chel nodded quite vigorously at your last remark, leaving you puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... good luck with that. It's taking me a lot of willpower to keep myself from just staying in bed and eating junk food all day long... or what's left of it, anyways.\" she turned to the bespectacled basilisk and sighed. \"I imagine it's the same with you, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. But, I mean, I was never on the thin side to begin with, so for me, I'm okay with it.\" her voice lowered a bit and she gave you a bit of a look. \"I might even decide to keep it, I feel so soft and plushy...\" you roll your eyes, what a flirt. Even with all this weighty chaos, Izzy still finds room to try and seduce you, guess somethings will never change...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while passes, with the three of you chatting over past outbreaks that were on the news and how many people were affected, and by the time Chel tells you you're ready, your leg feels just as good as before, if not better. You jump and give a quick dash to test your leg muscles, under the nurses' supervision, and give her a thumbs-up. Izzy squees, happy that you're fine, but Chel doesn't share the sentiment. Walking up to the edge of the table, you ask her. \"What's up? Aren't you glad I'm fine now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Oh, yes, but don't you find it strange that Irene isn't here yet? I mean, I know the added blubber must've slown her down a bit, but it's been five minutes since the time period I gave her.\" she points to a clock hanging on the wall. She was right, thirty-five minutes had already passed. Frowning, the bloated yeti turned to Izzy. \"Could you take him to Irene's room? While he can go there himself right now, it may be best not to push his legs too much, it might cause discomfort if he uses them for too long right after healing up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChel's idea makes you groan while the basilisk simply nods in an enthusiastic manner. \"What makes you think Irene's in her room?\" you ask, eyebrow cocked. Chel just gives a sad smile, and points to her bloated apron of a belly. Then it hits you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope I'm wrong, but I cannot help but get this feeling that Irene's back in her home stuffing her face. I want to think she's stronger than that, but if not, then you'll need the best of luck to deal with her.\" with that, Izzy eagerly beckoned you to climb on to her hand, and placed you on her shoulder, while Chel wheeled herself to open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonderful. You really hoped she was wrong.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was already setting up her treadmill and stairclimber, and she had pulled out several weights and barbells. And she had changed into her workout clothes, though they were strained against her bloated body. Seems Chel was wrong. Irene was determined to lose this weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Irene. You ready to get started?\" You ask as you walk up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrene looked down at you and smiled. \"I am. It was tempting to just plonk down on the couch and snack, but I'm not going to let a damn disease beat me! I am going to lose this weight one way or another!\" She declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at that. Irene may have lost her figure, but she did not lose her drive. She picked you up and set you on her shoulder as you two began her workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started with the weights. She got through the dumbbells easily, but the barbells proved to be a problem, since she had difficulty getting them past her now massive gut. But with her determination and your help, Irene got them up, and even got it more lifts. She wasn't even winded afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was on to the stairclimber. This proved much harder, since Irene actually got winded quickly on it. But she kept pushing on, determined to beat this damn disease. You kept pushing her on, yelling encourgament in her ear. Eventually, she managed to do the equivalent of climbing 7 Monster Arms buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe treadmill was next. It proved to be easier than the stairclimber, but harder than the weights. Her constant running meant her massive body kept jiggling, threatening to throw her off. And several times, you almost fell of her shoulder. But both of you held firm, and eventually, Irene ran 20 miles on the treadmill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Irene finished up. You could tell she was exhausted. But you also felt proud that she was able to do all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It used to be that I could run 50 miles on the treadmill. This stupid disease slowed me down.\" She said between pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But 20 miles is still good. And you proved Chel wrong.\" You told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Proved her wrong?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She thought you'd be gorging on food.\" You explained briefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made Irene laugh. \"Seriously? I may have been turned into a blob, but I'm not letting the nebutori turn me into a lazy pig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to reply when you heard a knock at the door. Slowly, Irene got up and waddled over to it. Open the door, you saw...</span></div></div>",

Her long blue-toned hair was disheveled and messy, and she was half mumbling to herself and half hiccuping, all the while carrying several boxes of pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zelda. What do you want?\" groaned Irene, annoyed. Oblivious to the hostility emanating from the cyclopean butterball, the humongous zebra-like centaur just giggled with a dumb grin plastered on her round puffy face and leaned on the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He-heya Aye-reene...

Ah baught theses 'cuz ah wass thinkin' bout yous...-hic-\" the inebriated centaur wobbled forward, thrusting the boxes clumsily onto the equally-fat cyclops. She accidentally took a whiff of the boxes, and suddenly she started sweating. For good measure, you smelled the contents inside the boxes, and boy did they smell good. A thick, cheesy aroma emanated from the square containers, and looking over to your companion, you go pale when you see her earlier steel resolve vanishing into vapour in the face of this addictive junkfood. She just stood there, holding several boxes while muttering incoherently, stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Irene, no, don't.\" whispering to her, you try urgently to help her reconsider, but a sudden fit of giggles and hiccups interrupts you. Zelda thrust her pudgier hands on her wide centaur hips, a look of triumph in her flushed face. She seemed proud of her actions, almost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weell, you's lookin' atta pizzas, eeh-hic-? They're ahwesum... oops!\" Zelda slurred as she wobbled backwards, her colossal butt bumping onto the opposite wall. Leaving a completely beffudled Irene behind, she turned and waved drunkedly. \"Ah gots tah get goin', ah gots me a hunk ta have sum -hic- fun with toniiiiight, byyyeeee!\" woah wait, what? Was she referring to the pizza delivery boy? You were about to ask her when you catch the former athletic monster glancing at the boxes with a thin line of drool slowly going down from her mouth to her second chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Irene... come on, don't you dare give in. Remember our talk, okay?\" you admonish her, and she gives you a look that is half-pleading, half guilty, almost as if she was some puppy. A big... bloated... one-eyed... puppy. You sigh and try again. \"Come on, you'll thank me later for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... RL... those have stuffed veggies in the crust... at least one slice wouldn't hurt, right? I earned it today...\" your stern gaze made her single eye look down to the floor, defeated. This wouldn't do, she was giving in to the urge to eat and stuff herself silly, and that would mean a post-binge tantrum when she came back to her senses and you'd both have to redouble your efforts with the workouts. She just couldn't be around addictive junk food, was this another symptom of this blasted disease, you pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInspiration hits you suddenly with a mallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Irene, do me a favor, will you? Take me outside, and bring the pizzas with you. I've an idea, you'll surely thank me later on, no doubts there.\" surprisingly, she complied, and with one meaty arm she carried the boxes, while you rested on her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... where are we going?\" your cyclopean ride asks, confusion written all over her face. \"Please tell me you're not thinking of throwing these into the trash cans outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, want not, waste not, right?\" you say with a smirk on your face. After she nods in accordance, you add. \"We're taking these to Lupa.\" Irene actually froze and stopped moving for a few seconds, turning only to look at you, shocked. But after a tense staredown between the two of you, she relented with an explosive sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... fine.\" she mumbled in annoyance. Of all the tenants, it did make sense to deliver the junkfood to the most gluttonous of them all, and the werewolf girl would have something to munch on, for a while at least. You secretly hoped she would become immobile thanks to the virus and the free food, that way she'd be off your back for a very looong time, one less predator to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short walk down the stairs, more like waddle given Irene's predicament, the two of you reach Lupa's door, and she sets the pile of boxes right next to it. Just before ringing the bell though, Irene hesitates. Only after she felt you tapping your foot in her shoulder did she press it. \"Ugh... come on, let's go back to my room... before I regret leaving those there.\" grumbling all the way back, you can't help but roll your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least you're still getting a workout, climbing up and down the staircase.\" you joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way back though, you meet someone else, but who?</span></div></div>",

Besides, even if I don't really lose that weight, I can at least keep myself from gaining too much. Also having someone else to work with can really motivate you.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day, you and Irene decided that a jog around Horrorville would be the best thing to fight back the nebutori that has befallen the titanic cyclops. Irene decides to invite Cadence and knocks on your zombie roommate\u2019s door. Cadence opens the door and you look in shock because your zombie roommate was inhumanly obese, especially in her monstrous stomach that had to be 2000ft wide by now and a quadruple chin. Looking at Cadence you\u2019d say she would weigh a ton if she was human size, much like Irene. Cadence was wearing tight red shorts and a gray tank-top along with her usual red rimmed glasses. Cadence lets out a zombie moan and Irene shakes her head. \u201cI know I\u2019m not one to talk, Cadence, but you\u2019re a mess.\u201d Cadence grunts and walks out revealing that the biggest part of her was not her stomach but her ass. You could not believe how large your roommate had gotten since the last time you saw her. Cadence even glares at you slightly. \u201cI said I was sorry, Cadence.\u201d You say weakly. The zombie girl just lets out a bellow that your equally massive cyclops friend understands before flinching. \u201cDo you kiss your mother with that mouth?\u201d Cadence and Irene just waddle down the stairs. They\u2019re already covered in sweat from that alone. You decide that it would best to stay on Irene\u2019s shoulder since Cadence is still sore with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown in the lobby, Nefernina had become a veritable blob. The mummy was extremely obese with an ass that looked like a beanbag chair the size of a dinosaur and her gauze was loose along her 3000-year old yet surprisingly well-preserved and tanned body. It appeared that she couldn\u2019t move and was pretty sore about it given the glare she gave as she bit into a taco that looked like it was filled with nachos. The mummy landlady sees Cadence and Irene leaving the building and then looks at you with a glare as she tosses an empty takeout back that nearly hits you. You let out a moan. \u201cI\u2019ll be lucky if she just decides to evict me.\u201d You thought to yourself. Then Cadence and Irene both try to squeeze through the doorway at the same time. Cadence lets out a loud zombie like bellow. \u201cGet <i>my</i> fat ass out of the way? Get <i>your</i> fat ass out of the way, you donut-stuffed Ghoulia!\u201d Nefernina shakes her head as she watches the display and then takes out another naco. As Cadence and Irene are trapped in the doorway, a morbidly obese Janine walks by wearing a kimono that looks like it was sewn together from three kimonos. Janine gags at the sight of Nefernina\u2019s snack. \u201cHow can you eat that?\u201d asks the nine-tailed fox woman. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I have a choice,\" says the mummy as she presses the back of her head into her own fat ass. \"The pizza place is running slow since one of their delivery boys is trapped in a zebra striped...\" \"T.M.I.!\" yells Janine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence and Irene managed to squeeze their way right through the front door, breaking the doorway in the process and both the super obese zombie and cyclops start to jog down the street. You look everywhere and see the extent of damage the nebutori did to Horrorville. You see what looks like a light blue-gray six armed female monster resembling a Xenomorph who was sitting at a bus stop and her ass had swelled to twice the size of the bus stop as she was trying to read the newspaper. As Cadence is jogging, she passes a morbidly obese white skinned and purple-eyed hobgoblin woman wearing a primarily purple and black gothic lolita outfit complete with a large skirt and a tiara. Her skirt had been reduced to a thong on her now obese body and from the looks of it, she was carrying a purse that you could've sworn had at least one human inside it. You turn your head as Irene passes a corner and you see what looks like a blonde hellhound prostitute with thunderous thighs, five chins and a massive belly. You didn't think the nebutori would spread so fast. Then you look up and see three female gargoyles that looked like flying whales with how much the nebutori inflated them. It was a wonder any of them could still fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cadence,\" says Irene with a huff. \"Race you to the park.\" Cadence lets out a grunt and she and Irene are jogging more ferociously. You have to hold onto Irene's hair as the cyclops and the zombie run as fast as their obese forms would allow them to go. As they're nearing the park, they're neck and neck, or more accurately, ass and ass. Both of them reached the park gate at the exact same time and both of them pant. Irene is sweating heavily and you have to climb up and swim through the sweat coming down from Irene's hair to keep afloat. From Irene's head you could see that Cadence and Irene were moving slow but at least they were active. You could also see that there were more obese female monsters all around. You see another jogger pass you from the opposite direction, one that was as big and fat as Cadence and Irene. She was an obese and brown colored baku girl with long white hair and a pair of goggles on her head. There was also an obese black furred werebat woman with a red nose and ears and long red hair who was sitting on a destroyed bench as she fed a flock of quetzalcoatluses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Cadence andIrene were only concerned with their jog and they were both panting. Cadence let out a moan. \"You undead baby,\" says Irene. \"This is nothing. Feel the burn.\" But then Irene panted and both she and Cadence stopped to catch their breath near a large bulletin board. Both of them were drinking enough water to poison a camel. Especially Cadence who didn't even need to drink. \"If I'm not careful,\" says Irene. \"I might get used to all this blubber.\" You let out a sigh. At least they were active and maintaining their weight but then you see something on the board that looks interesting. \"Cadence,\" you say. \"Irene. Look.\" Irene and Cadence look and see a poster and Irene takes it off to read it. \"At Horrorville Astral Dome,\" she reads. \"This Saturday, there will be an all female sumo tournament featuring obese monster girls from around the world. Hmmm, the mayor must be trying to capitalize on the nebutori.\" Cadence just lets out a moan. \"You're right,\" says Irene. \"It might be fun, Cadence. It might ironically help us both get into shape. Good thinking, R.L.\" You smile as Irene and Cadence walk away with you on Irene's head.</span></div></div>",

The three of you went inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the building, Irene and Cadence walked up to the ticket booth, where a male werewolf was stationed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi. Where do we sign up for the sumo tournament?\" Irene asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe werewolf pointed left to a table where a female oni was sitting. The oni had blue skin and black hair. From the looks of it, the nebutori seem to focus on her belly, because while her breasts were beach ball sized, her belly was the size of a wrecking ball. From your position on Irene's head, you couldn't see her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrene and Cadence walked over to the table. The oni looked uninterested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. We'd like to sign up for the sumo tournament.\" Irene said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name?\" The oni asked in an Irish accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Irene Stargazer. This is Cadence Deadman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe oni wrote their names down on the list in front of her. \"Fights start at 9 AM this Saturday. You will be given outfits at the tournament. When at the tournament, you will be assigned a coach. Listen to what they have to say. Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrene and Cadence nodded. She then looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about him? This is a women's only tournament.\" She asked. She must have seen you through Irene's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrene pulled you out of her hair. \"He'll just be spectating.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, he'll need a visitors pass on the day of the tournament.\" The oni explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrene and Cadence nodded and turned to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now we just need to wait until Saturday.\" Irene said.</span></div></div>",

At this point the nebutori bloated her until she was as tall as Petra before the outbreak and from the looks of it, though she had a triple chin and an enormous girth, her ass was clearly the biggest part of her as it was so large she couldn\u2019t even pull it out the door. The mummy giantess\u2019s bandages were now reduced to a sumo thong and just one ribbon that covered her nipples as the mummy was clearly pissed. \u201cNefernina!\u201d you and Irene both yell in surprise and horror. Nefernina gives you a deep glare. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that I know this is your fault, you little twerp,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll deal with you once all women are back to their normal size. Nefernina just grunts and continues to struggle to get her fatter than usual ass outside of Chel\u2019s office. You give a smirk. \u201cI think I like you better this way, Cleofatra,\u201d you say. \u201cYour ass is finally as big as your bad attitude.\u201d Irene giggles at that joke as Nefernina grits her teeth in absolute rage. \u201cOh, you can laugh all you want, R.L. You\u2019ll pay for it soon. As soon as I get out of here, I am going to anal vore you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d love to stay and bounce marbles off your tuckus but Irene and I have to get to work and my leg is...\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t care!\u201d yells Nefernina. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky that I don\u2019t grind you up into lasagna and feed you to Lupa.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Nefernina gives a smirk. \u201cAs for this situation, I\u2019ve already hired somebody to help everyone fight off the nebutori. She\u2019s accepting 7 girls for the first session.\u201d Irene gives a look of surprise. \u201cShe is?\u201d Nefernina nods her head. \"If I were you, Irene, I'd sign up quick.\" Irene runs off carrying you and you groan. \"What about my leg?\" you ask. Irene lets out a sigh. \"Sorry, R.L.,\" she says. \"But this way maybe everyone will be able to fight back the nebutori to keep it under control before a cure is made.\" You let out a groan. Meanwhile, Nefernina is still trying to pull her ass out of the doorway while Chel lets out a sigh as the bloated yeti can't get out of her apartment/office. \"Well,\" she says. \"Might as well do something constructive.\" Chel proceeds to take out some paints, a pallet and a brush in order to pain a mural on Nefernina's fat ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Irene takes you to be able to train with the so-called weight loss expert Nefernina hired. Besides Irene, there were 6 other girls gathered for the session and each one was so morbidly obese that had they been normal-sized they would weight 2 tons. First was your roommate Cadence. She looked more Boomer-like than ever and her zombified stomach and ass had bloated out, giving her a prominent jar shape. She was wearing a red leotard for the occasion. Janine, the kitsune woman from the second floor was next to Cadence and she was reduced to wearing a blue tanktop and a black mawashi of a sumo wrestler. From what you could see, she had a tattoo on her left butt cheek under all nine of her tails. The tattoo resembled a stylized leaf. Janine was even carrying a fan because she was sweating heavily. Selena was there as well and the black werecat was completely naked due to her breasts and girth outgrowing her bikini. She poked one of her boobs and let out a sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at this, Janine. I\u2019m enormous. My younger sister looks scrawny compared to me.\u201d Janine nodded her head before speaking in Japanese. Elle was also in the room and the yellow-orange feathered thunderbird\u2019s obesity had centered into her thighs as she was struggling to stand. She was still wearing her headphones but her jeans were tearing apart. Zelda waddled her centaur form in and you saw that not only was her upper torso\u2019s belly obese and thick but her horse half was dragging its stomach and ass on the ground. Finally, Petra was there and since she was the tallest monster in the building before hand, she was the most obese of the girls infected by the nebutori. She was wearing nothing more than a pink two-piece bikini that was showing off her belly and ass as she was blushing in embarrassment. \u201cYou girls think you have problems? I had to borrow this bikini from my older sister and even then it\u2019s too tight. When I get my hands on Shelly, that night, I dine on turtle soup.\u201d Cadence then blows on her finger as you sit on Irene's shoulder. \"Here she comes.\" Says Irene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trainer who walked in was a large werecheetah who stood 1015ft tall, making her slightly taller than even <i>Petra</i> before the outbreak. She had orange fur with black spots, orange eyes and short spiky red hair. She was extremely muscular but to your surprise, she had a gargantuan obese belly that stook out and appeared to be wider than she was tall. She was wearing a yellow tank top and tight black sweat-pants as she looked forward. She looked like a rather mean customer and you were sweating on sight as you looked up at her. \"Guten Tag,\" said the cheetah giantess in a German accent. \"I am Nicolette Macht.\" \"<i>The</i> Nicolette Macht?\" asked Irene in surprise. \"So she's famous?\" you ask. Irene nodded her head. \"She's a well-known fitness instructor. Her methods are known for being rough.\u201d Cadence grunts in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you take one look at the cheetah giantess\u2019s enormous girth and you can\u2019t say you\u2019re impressed. \u201cIf she\u2019s supposed to be a big time trainer, what\u2019s with the beer belly.\u201d Suddenly, Nicolette snatches you and you grunt as she stares down on you. \u201cListen here, little human. I\u2019ll have you know that in mein workout, the frauleins gain muscles but keep the belly. It is required for the workout.\u201d \u201cBut these girls aren\u2019t cured of the virus,\u201d you mutter. \u201cWhat makes you think that you won\u2019t get infected as well.\u201d Nicolette let out a scoff and then held up a magic ring. \u201cMagic ring,\u201d she said. \u201cProtects against all diseases, including the nebutori. Now, vhere do I put you so you don\u2019t cause any trouble?\u201d Cadence and Irene just look on at Nicolette as she takes out some tape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019s going to tape you somewhere, but where?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note: Nicolette is an O.C. of the 12th Doctor (Non Canon) and he asked me to put her in the story)\u2028</span></div></div>",

Your brain lurched at the thought and desperation took hold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Lupa wait!\" You shout, desperation dripping from every word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupa's grin turns into a quizzical look. \"What?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp as you  force out every word and you try to steady your voice. \"L-Look, I-I know you've been after me for a long time now. But I'm pretty sure I can do a lot more for you right now than be a snack.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupa fixed you with a deadpan look. \"Whaddya mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened slightly. She's actually going to listen? A little hope restored, you continue. \"I mean, think about it. Do you really think little 'ole me is going to do anything for your appetite? I mean seriously?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupa looks down at her mountainous figure and then back to you. She shrugs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I'm getting at is that I'm pretty sure being this big now has made somethings harder right? I'll do whatever you need me to.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe werewolf cocks a brow. \"Whatever...I...need?\" She asks slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod vigorously. \"Have an itch on your back you can't reach? I'll scratch it! Need to clean your fur, I'll help! Anything you need me to do and I'll give it my all!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew how ridiculous all of this sounded. You also knew that this job would probably get you killed by getting smashed or even by sheer exhaustion. But it was better than certainly ending up in her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupa rubs her chin with her other hand, mulling the proposition over for several moments before answering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer response: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your landing is surprisingly soft and you realize that you must've landed on one of the monster girls. From your angel, whoever you landed on, you landed on her rather large back. From what you see, you're standing on a blue fabric and from the looks of it, there is a pair of leather wings up ahead that looked like they were too small for the monster girl to fly given all the weight that she put on due to the Nebutori and that the wings were a distinct orange color, like the flesh you see as you walk back and that by your feet there is long white hair. You breath a sigh of relief because you landed on Petra. She must've been trying to button her coat for work. While Petra is a cop and it would make sense for her to go to work, even in a crisis, you wonder why on Earth would they allow her to leave the premises in her condition, unless the nebutori already reached that far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can think about the situation anymore, Petra starts to stand up and you yell as you slide down the gargoyle giantess's back and bounce off her tail right before landing between her colossal buttcheeks. Petra's ass looked like it was several times as wide as she was tall before she was infected with the nebutori and since Petra was the tallest monster in the building from the start, that was saying something. By this point, the rest of her was utterly massive. As Petra is about to walk out of the building, you feel her turn around because she hears heavy panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mountainous gargoyle turns around just in time for Irene to come down the stairs and bump her face against Petra's huge belly. Irene rubs her head and then looks up in shock to see that the nebutori caused Petra to swell up so large that she looked like she was twice Irene's height. Petra looked down at the cyclops in disapproval as Irene nervously stepped back. \"Irene,\" said Petra. \"Leave R.L. alone.\" Petra shakes her head before waddling out the door, it takes her a lot of effort to get her massive frame through the doorway and it seems like she doesn't even feel you underneath her tail. You couldn't believe your situation but seeing as it was Petra you were stuck too, it was probably the safest place you could be at the moment, so it's not like you can complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside there is another monster waiting for Petra and she was also dressed like a policewoman. From the looks of it, she was a bluish gray furred chupacabra woman with shoulder length black hair and spikes going down her back. She also seemed to have wings like Petra. You couldn't tell her body shape before but it looks like she was infected by nebutori as well and was as tall and wide as Petra and while her butt and belly were quite massive, her breasts were the biggest parts of her body and looked bigger than moons. \"Hello, Rosalyn,\" says Petra. \"I see the nebutori got to your neighborhood too.\" \"And who's fault was that?\" asked Rosalyn. \"All the girls at the station have it thanks to you.\" Petra makes her eyes glow bright at Rosalyn. \"Don't go pinning this on me. Having nebutori doesn't count as a sick day for us. If I ever catch that Shelly, I'll make her into turtle soup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalyn wisely steps off as both of the girls squeeze into the police car and to your displeasure, Petra sits down, pushing you into the upholstery of the car seat as you groan. It was like you were caught in an avalanche of pizza dough just as Rosalyn turns on the car. You slip and you're enveloped by gargoyle flesh. It's a wonder you weren't turned into a bloody paste. \"Keep your eyes open, Maza,\" says Rosalyn, referring to Petra by her last name. \"There are a lot of male crooks who would take advantage of this plague infecting the stronger sex. Today, Jameson wants us to patrol...\"</span></div></div>",

My older sister lives in Terrordale. She\u2019d be laughing her ass off if she could see how fat mine was right now.\u201d You sink down Petra\u2019s ass and you fine yourself trapped between a wall of orange overflowing gargoyle flesh and another wall of black spider web print panties. It was a very good thing that she wasn\u2019t wearing her leotard today. She mentioned her older sister. You had heard Petra was the middle child of three sisters and that her older sister was not only the fattest of them, but she was ironically the shortest. You believe you heard Petra say her name was Roxy. Well, Roxy definitely wasn't the fattest sister down. You could hear Petra's seat coming apart and cracking beneath the gargoyle's mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalyn was driving slowly because she could barely see past her own extremely engorged breasts and her blobby belly was obstructing her ability to turn the steering wheel. \u201cYou can tell the pier is going to be jumping,\u201d the chupacabra giantess says. \"With all the female monsters bloated to near immobility, every male crook in town will be capitalizing on it.\" \"Not surprising,\" says Petra. \"Female monsters are way stronger than the males. Especially gargoyles like me.\" You didn't know that. That's probably why you see a lot more female monsters than male monsters if that's true. Petra then lets out a yawn and feels her triple chins as Rosalyn feels her stomach gurgling. \"This nebutori is a plague,\" says the chupacabra. \"It's taking all the willpower we have not to laze around like the other infected females, but I just ate two breakfasts and I'm still hungry. If you don't make Shelly into turtle soup first, I'll drank her dry first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra lets out a sigh. \"I'm no glutton myself, but you're right. We can't patrol on an empty stomach, nebutori or no nebutori. Well, the donut shop's up ahead. As much as I find that stereotype offensive, I we might as well get some snacks to keep ourselves active. At least our jaw muscles. Rosalyn parks the car and you hold on tight to Petra's constantly shrinking panties as Petra gets out, demolishing her car seat in the process. \"Don't forget a goat's blood cruller for me, Petra.\" Said Rosalyn. \"Will do.\" As Petra is walking into the donut shop, each step shakes you loose from her massive mounds of orange flesh. You might be able to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have two options. You see her white hair reaching down to her massive ass. You could try climbing up the white vines. But you could also crawl underneath Petra's ass and get her attention by beating around the bush. Or more accurately, positioning yourself at her more sensitive area. What will it be?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was going to be dangerous, you knew it. There was so much gargoyle flesh that you could be buried alive underneath Petra's enormous mass. But the way you see it, if you could reach Petra's \"womanhood\" and yank at it, you'd have a better shot at getting her attention. It's not nice and she'd more than likely be sore at you, but you were kind of out of options. It would be too much of a chore to climb up her hair and maneuver up the large rolls on her back. So you take a deep breath and shove yourself underneath Petra's titanic butt cheeks as you start to maneuver underneath. The nebutori has made Petra's rear the biggest part of her body and it was several times her height before she was infected.It takes all the effort you can to move underneath the ginormous gargoyle's underside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heat is intense and it feels like you're trying to crawl underneath a giant blob of pizza dough. You even cough from the heat and have to suck on Petra's sweat to stay hydra dated. After five minutes, you manage to move to the halfway point and stop to catch your breath. But then you feel movement because Petra had bought the donuts and was moving back down. This gives you the motivation to furiously force yourself through the orange seas of fat and sweat. If Petra sat down right now, she'd squash you into red paste beneath her ass. So you fight your way through just as you hear the car opening and just as Petra is about to take her seat, you reach the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra sits down and you find yourself trapped between her monumental thighs.You struggle to move through them and at this point, Petra is so morbidly obese from the nebutori that she can't even feel you as she bites down into a chocolate glazed and hands Rosalyn her goat's blood cruller that she sucks on as she drives. \"Thanks,\" said Rosalyn. \"One thing I hate about nebutori is the appetite that comes with it.\" Petra just shovels in another donut. \"Tell me about it. And it doesn't look like it's going to get any better anytime soon. Petra grunts and has to hold her tail outside the car window as she and Rosalyn are slowly outgrowing their vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalyn gives a smirk. \"I think I know somebody who might enjoy seeing you like this.\" Petra makes her eyes glow red slightly. \"Don't even get me started on Roxy.\" \"Not, Roxy, dumbass,\" says Rosalyn. \"I'm talking about Stephen. That human boyfriend of yours. You said he liked big chicks.\" You were surprised and then you remembered something. Petra recently started dating her sister's coworker, a human lifeguard named Stephen. You heard that Stephen was horribly burned and his skin was replaced with a patch of Roxy's own that was donated as a skin graft. You then realize that since Petra had a boyfriend, stroking her love tunnel would only lead to trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Please see this path for reference in Monster Shores <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1927548-Monster-Shores/map/1353111211\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/ite...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you're rethinking your options, you back up and feel something open right behind yourself. \"Huh?\" you ask. You look back and then you find yourself tumbling into Petra's love tunnel. You scream and you slip as you're sucked into the hungry hole. You beat around but Petra doesn't feel you as her colossal snatch swallows you whole.\" Well, the good news was that you were probably the safest from being crushed inside the \"tunnel of love\" but it was dark and wet and Petra didn't know you were in there. Man, if Petra found out you were in a space reserved for her boyfriend, you were toast.</span></div></div>",

It's so dark you can't even tell which way leads to the exit and which leads further down. You wonder what would happen if you reached the end. You remembered asking Petra if gargoyles really did lay eggs and she confirmed that they did and she and her sisters hatched from eggs themselves. You shiver. If you went down to far, you might end up being trapped in a gargoyle's egg. You wondered if female gargoyles could actually reproduce with male humans since you were pretty sure it couldn't happen the other way around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra and Rosalyn sure enough had to thwart several crimes in their state. Because all female monsters were infected with nebutori and a majority of them were immobilized, the much weaker male monster crime element was on the move. However, because of Rosalyn and Petra's more obese bodies, the bullets from their guns had no effect. Although, while they were arresting the robbers, a male naga head butted Petra in the groin, causing you to slip further into the abyss. Well, there were worse things. At least it wasn't the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you hear Rosalyn being dropped off. \"See you tomorrow, Rosalyn.\" She says. \"See you tomorrow, partner.\" Well, looks like you're back at Monster Arms. Petra walks inside and sees Bernice walking down the hallway. Bernice was a massive red blob of genie flesh that was slightly shorter than Petra herself at this point. Bernice was wearing a black unitard that looked painted on her body and her belly was so big that she had to drag it. \"Oh,\" says Bernice. \"Hi Petra. I just gave Stephen a lift to your apartment. He was more than excited when he heard you were struck by nebutori.\" Petra gives a smile and lets out a laugh. \"What can I say. He's a chubby chaser. Before we were dating, he was lusting after a fat anaconda naga goth chick.\" Petra steps up the stairs and shakes your surroundings with every step. You were legitimately scared. When Petra and her boyfriend find you, you're gonna be in serious trouble. You hope Stephen is very understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra soon opens the door to her apartment and removes her shirt as she slips off her pants. \"I'm ho-ome.\" She states in a flirtatious tone you weren't used to from Petra. Standing on the gargoyle giantess's bed was a human around your age, except he had indigo hair and it looked like his skin had been replaced with yellow gargoyle skin. He looked in surprise at Petra and his nose was even bleeding. \"My,\" he says. \"Aren't you a big beautiful creature.\" Petra smirks and holds up her H-cup breasts before turning around with her naked ass inches away from Stephen's head. Stephen sees Petra's long tail waving around and is in a trance. \"Oh my,\" he says. \"You make Connie look like a piece of dental floss. That nebutori saved me years of fattening you up.\" \"Flatterer,\" says Petra. \"But I'll humor your fetish. Just let me slip into something more comfortable.\" The naked gargoyle walks into her closet as Stephen smiles lustfully. You couldn't see it, but in preparation, he was wearing nothing but a loincloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn't bode well for you. This was only delaying the inevitable. But from the looks of it, Petra had ordered some super sized costumes to act out a fetish to appease Stephen's lust.

You shiver right before the now much more bloated Izzy shoves you into one of the folds underneath her breasts as you moan. The basilisk giggles as she strokes her 800ft wide butt cheeks and then starts to waddle back to her apartment. You could feel every step but you couldn't move as you were sandwiched between Izzy's fat. You were actually surprised that there was air there to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Izzy grunts and her blobby belly shakes, causing you to briefly lose your footing. She had bumped into another giantess infected with the nebutori. This monster was Selena, an 875ft (prior to her weight gain) were cat with black fur and orange hair. She usually wore a black bikini but it had burst due to how massive she had become. Her thighs had swelled up considerable but it was her breasts that were the biggest part of her. They always were, but thanks to the nebutori, her breasts were so big she had to resort to using her billiard staff to hold them up. \"Ssssorry about that, Ssssselena.\" Said Izzy as both her thighs and Selena's brushed up against each other. \"It's okay, Iz,\" said Selena as her breasts rippled. \"I beat the lethargy that came with this damn virus. I don't mind a little bumper to bumper.\" You give a sigh of relief. That was one more monster that wasn't mad at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you hear a keyhole turn and then grunting and you're forced to grab Izzy's scale-covered flab as the titanically obese basilisk squeezes her massive hulk right through the door and grunts. With a lot of effort, Izzy pops her frame through the door and then you feel vibrations as you slide out from under her boob down her now much more massive than usual belly as you feel Izzy unbuttoning her blouse. You slid down and fall off the mountain that is Izzy's gut and land on something soft and light green. You look at the new landscape and see that you were on Izzy's bed. You hear Izzy humming as she takes off her glasses and flips her black hair. She tears off her bra and then her panties go down as she shows you her bare 1600ft wide ass with her tail moving in a circular motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you realize what Izzy brought you here for and gulp. \"I've got you right where I want you, RL,\" says Izzy as she stretches out her tongue like a lizard to lick you. \"And now that there's more of me than ever, we are going to make it happen.\" \"Y-You mean sex?\" you ask. Izzy nods her head and smirks, showing her fangs in between her blood red lipstick. \"I'm talking hard, unprotected and now. And to start off, handssssome, I want it in the...\"</span></div></div>",

What are you doing out in the road?\" The dullahan girl then yelled as Izzy grabbed her by the head and switched into a basketball uniform. The dullahan yelled as her head was bounced around like a basketball and then Izzy snaps her fingers to make a basketball hoop appear up in the air before jumping up and tossing the dullahan girl's head through it. \"High score!\" yelled Izzy. Izzy laughed to herself as the dullahan was in a daze attempting to put her head back on her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was official, Izzy was completely out of control.

Izzy then grabs Petra by her green and yellow phoenix-print panties and pulls them over the gargoyle's head as she lets out a scream. \"Wedgie!\" yells Izzy as she lets go and leaves Petra in an uncomfortable position. Izzy then runs off as Petra tears apart her own panties with her claws. \"IZZY!\" yells Petra in such an enraged state that her eyes glow red.

What was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Irene, do you mind if I talked to you for a moment?\" Petra asked, just as surprised as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Irene replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra set you down and took Irene away to talk to her.<br>\r\n------------------------------------------<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, Petra came back. She looked even more confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that sin did more that make her fat and hungry. It apparently changed her memories. I asked her about her life, and she said taht she grew up skinny and weak. On her 19th birthday, she started eating and eating, putting on more and more weight.\" Petra explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's insane. She's terrified of getting fat.\" You say, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now, she isn't. When I left her, she was throwing out every health food and drink she had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to see her.\" You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Petra could stop you, you bolted up the stairs and went for Irene's apartment. When you got there, you slipped under the door crack. Inside, you were surprised to see that Irene...</span></div></div>",

But that wasn't what surprised you. What surprised you was that, in one mere hour, Irene had massively ballooned. Her breasts were now twice Aiba's size, her belly had gone from a beanbag chair to a normal chair, and her butt was filling up the entirety of her couch. It now looked like she had four chins, and even her cheeks had plumped up. You couldn't help but gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, Irene had heard you and looked in your direction. She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey RL.\" She said happily, and began to get up. Or at least tried to. It took her four attempts, but she eventually got up and waddled over to you. She then, with great difficulty, bent down and picked you up. \"How are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked. \"Um, fine? How are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing!\" She yelled happily. \"Guess how much I weigh? Go ahead, guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, 10 tons?\" You guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrene smiled. \"Close. 20 tons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're jaw dropped. She was happy about that? You decided to glance around the apartment. You saw that all her workout equipment was gone. Looking at the trash, you saw her health food was in the bin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Irene, why did you throw out your healthy food?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that? I think Lupa must be trying to prank me. She knows I hate healthy food, so she must have snuck in and put those in my fridge. Same with that workout stuff. Why would I use that?\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra was right. The Gluttony sin was messing with her head, rewritting her memories. This was insane. Before you could say anything, you heard a knock. Irene placed you on her shoulder and waddled over to open it. On the other side was Aiba. She had a package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Irene, your mail got sent to me. Again. Our PO Box numbers aren't even close, how do they mix them uuuuu...\" She trails of when she sees what happened to Irene, but more specifically, she saw her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Aiba?\" Irene asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see Aiba's eye twitching. She hated it when someone had bigger boobs then her. Angerly, she shoved Irene's package into Irene's hands and left, muttering. Irene shrugged and closed the door. She looked at the package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I'll open it later.\" She said before tossing it on table. She then picked you up off her shoulder. \"Hey RL, I'm going out. Want to come with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided you needed to keep an eye on her. This was partially your fault after all. \"Sure.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and, to your surprise, dropped you in her massive cleavage. \"We'll have so much fun.\" She says. She then heads for the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she gets to the front door, she's completely winded, already panting and sweating. \"Geez, you'd think Nefernina would be more considerate to the truly fat like me and Lupa.\" She said. You still couldn't get used to the formally fitness obssessed Irene calling herself fat. She then starting waddling down the street. The vibrations from her massive body caused you to sink deeper into Irene's cleavage. But after about 30 minutes of walking, Irene stops and pulls you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here.\" She says. You look and see that you are at...</span></div></div>",

Anyone but Petra!\" But it was too late because the machine already worked its magic. While you would hardly be called fat yourself, you did suddenly feel slimmer as the machine was beeping and whirring. In the kitchen, Cadence is fixing herself a steak sandwich when suddenly her pants became looser and she grunted in confusion as she held them up. The machine was going to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the hallway, Lupa was chewing on a bone of some sort and then suddenly, she was as skinny as a supermodel and gasped at the sight as she tried to hide herself in embarrassment. Clearly she wasn't used to being so thin. Nefernina is jogging outside of the building when suddenly all of her wrappings came loose. She felt a draft and then looked down to see her rear had shrunken and her underwear was showing, forcing her to cover up and grab all her loose bandages and run. In the mailroom, Astrid and Renee suddenly felt their clothes looser and they feel themselves as they gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, in her own apartment, Petra was in her pajamas watching TV and eating a sundae when she suddenly felt a strange feeling in her stomach. \"Ugh,\" she says to herself. \"Those strawberries I ate must've been rotten. Suddenly, Petra heard a ripping sound and got up to see that her pajama pants were coming apart at the seams. \"What the?!\" yells Petra. Petra then looks down and see the top part of her pajama was coming loose and the buttons were already popping off. Petra develops three more chins as her neck begins to disappear and she looks at her clawed orange fingers to see they have become sausage-like as her butt expands and knocks her couch over right as her belly breaks her coffee table and touches the floor. She was getting heavier with each second and tries flapping her wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she quickly becomes too heavy to fly and crashes right through the floor and several other floors right before she lands with a loud boom in the basement and causes a slight earthquake that shakes the entire apartment building. You feel it in your own apartment and give a gulp. Cadence lets out a mutter as if to ask \"What was that?\" You give a gulp. \"My impending doom.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the basement, every other girl in the apartment (all of which are as thin as rails), runs down to see what happened and saw a large hole in the ground. \"What the heck happened?\" asks Astrid. \"Look at how thin I've become. It's atrocious.\" Izzy bites her claws as she is practically swimming in her much looser dress. \"I hope that R.L. likes skinny girls.\" Irene gives a scoff. \"Why are you all complaining? This is a good thing. If you ask me, you all have never looked in better shape. Hey, wait a minute, where's Petra?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrene's answer comes in the form of a deep growl and a pair of glowing angry red eyes from the bottom of the hole. \"Nefernina! Is this some kind of sick prank?!\" Nefernina gives a dumbfounded look and drops her jaw. \"Petra?\" she asks. There is loud rumbling and everyone does their best to stay on their feet as Petra digs her claws into the walls and begins to climb up, revealing how huge that strange machine had made her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she gets to the top, all the girls look in fear and shock at how large she had gotten.

You could see a tail swish behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't the most obvious thing. You saw you were a slim werewolf, but your boobs were ENORMOUS.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The article starts by detailing the first ever meeting conducted between humans and monsters. The meeting was conducted shortly after the initial contact between the monster and the human world. On the human's side there were representatives of every country present, and the monsters each had a single member of their respective species represent them. Initially both sides acknowledged that considering the monster's size related to humans, accidents were bound to happen. As such, a law was passed that would offer general protection to monsters that have accidents involving humans, as long as it happened in a mainly monster area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aforementioned law was extremely vague at best and very easy to abuse. All a monster had to do in order to classify a deadly encounter with a human as an \"accident\" was to walk up to a policeman or policewoman monster and say something along the lines of: \"Oh, i only accidentally stomped on him repeatedly!\" or \"I swear i didn't mean to sit on him and grind him into a red pulp!\". During the most recent meeting the human delegates highlighted the fact that the law was often abused, they even bough up several cases in which a human reported an accident to a monster police officer, and in turn the officer simply gobbled up said human and pleaded innocence via the accident law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monsters acknowledged the widespread abuse of the law and both sides started a discussing in order to come up with a better solution. At first the werewolf representative suggested that monsters be allowed to eat humans under conditions of \"extreme hunger\". The proposition was backed up by the Wendigo and Sphinx representative, but it was quickly shot down by the vast majority of human and monster representatives. In the end both sides agreed that a monster should be held accountable for any form of harm they cause to a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but smile, your life just got a lot safer. Now Lupa or Nefermina couldn't get you, without getting prosecuted by the law that is. You decided to keep reading through the paper, hoping that it would get even better. Sadly the rest wasn't nearly as interesting, it was mostly just news about trade deals, preparations for the winter Olympics, oh and a new law was passed that allows monsters to adopt human children. \"That's kinda neat\" you think, but then you shudder at the thought of someone like Lupa or Nefermina adopting a human... After you shake that feeling out of you you decide to...</span></div></div>",

Day went by as it turned to afternoon, both you and cadence went out for lunch. You and her looked around and noticed a shop that wrote 'deli cats'. You asked cadence if that place was ok and she nodded, went in and the inside looked like your average sandwich shop until you notice a flag of Israel on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n (Why's there the flag?) you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Welcome!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You andbcadence turned and saw a mid-long blacker haired woman with lightly tanned skin and had two cat tails on her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Are you the owner?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes..oh my, I never had humans in my delicatessen.\" Female said with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Cadence gruntled and both you and the female talked.

So your the famous novelist!\" Lady said, then standing up, \"I am Samantha Nightstar, a dhampir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You know dhampir as they are a human vampire hybrid.

There weren't that many to reach the next floor, but each one would be like trying to scale a building. But as you look back, you see that Lupa's tail reached to the top step. You look back down and see that she was still unconscious, and that her head was sideways and could be climbed. If you worked up enough courage, you could quickly climb that mutt and get back home. But it would also be troublesome if she woke up, plus climbing near her mouth could end badly. <br>\r\nAnother option was that you could wait for another monster to pass by, one that is nice enough to take you back up the stairs.

Nefernina hated you but you didn't think she'd eat you like Lupa would. How many monsters in this apartment are man eaters? You know Lupa's one and you're sure Patsy would be one and you heard Aqua used to be one, but you had to get away fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, you forgot Nefernina still had her bandages and sent one of them out like tentacles and one of them almost grabs you. You see a hole in the wall and think you can make it free but then you find yourself floating in air and turn your head to see Nefernina's fingers glowing gold. \"Damn mummy magic!\" you yell. You let out a scream as Nefernina sends a bandage out to grab you by her legs and lifts you in front of her awaiting face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a horrible tenant, but maybe you'll make a nice snack.\" Nefernina even licks her lips and her decaying breath hits you in the face and nearly chokes you. \"Come on Nefernina! You were human once! This is cannibalism! You certainly don't need any extra inches Cleofatra!\" Nice going R.L., now she'll probably chew you up. But at this point it's too late to reason as that mummy woman lowers you into her awaiting mouth.</span></div></div>",

But all this time she found a use for you little pests.\" With that she swallows you whole, sending you screaming down to her dark insides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expect to be broken down by this monster's stomach acid, but as you land you let out a grunt. It was surprisingly dry. Then you remember something, Nefernina is a mummy, she doesn't have stomach acid. She doesn't even have a stomach since they cut it out some thousand or so years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ha!\" you yell up to your captor. \"In your face Nefernina! If you were trying to digest me, you already failed! I didn't think it was possible, but you're even more of a Cleofatra on the inside!\" As you laugh at Nefernina, outside, she gives an irritated look that quickly turns into a smirk. \"Be that as it may R.L., you're forgetting one thing. Unlike you, I'm already dead, therefore, I don't need food or water to survive. You on the other hand...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you realize something. Nefernina was right. This was bad. Now your survival depended on the mummy that swallowed you. This was bad.

It was a hallway to the monsters, a highway to you. You nervously rapped your fist against the bottom of the door, cupping your other hand around your mouth and calling out \"Hello? Is anyone home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knocked a few more times a bit harder and called out louder.\"Hey! I'm R.L., your neighbor from downstairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more moments, you heard footsteps from within the apartment. Loud, booming steps that shook the ground with each encroaching one. Given the size difference of you and the other residents of the apartment complex, you had felt quakes from their footsteps before. But this one was much different. You had heard that Petra was much, much bigger than any of the other monsters living here. You gulped and hoped that the rumors weren't too true. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wide swing the door opened up, a pair of massive orange feet slammed down in front of you, each toe easily the size of a bus and the length of the foot covering a city block or so. You looked up to a massive, curvaceous gargoyle woman looking down at you with a bored look in her eyes, her body clad in a blue police officer's uniform. It seemed you had just interrupted her getting her clothes on, as her cap was haphazardly skewed atop her head and her boots were in her hands.\"Can I help you?\"She asked in a monotone voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh uh....hi.\"You waved up, expecting a reaction from her, but you really couldn't tell considering her chest blocked most of her face so high up.\"Like I said, I'm R.L....and I've just been wanting to meet my neighbors, that's all. You're Petra, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct.\"She replied.\"You're the human from downstairs, right?\"She turned around and went back inside her apartment, casually offering for you to come inside as well. You scurried in behind her as she closed the door before sitting down on a couch that rivaled the height of skyscrapers. She truly was big. Much larger than any of the other monsters. Most of the others were around 300-500 feet tall, but you gauged Petra easily around 800 or even a thousand feet tall, leaving her torso and a head taller. She was even intimidating with her scaly, demonic appearance and piercing eyes. Maybe coming up here wasn't the best of ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if you're ballsy, or stupid for moving in here. Most humans ignore Horrorville all together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wanted to experience something...different.\"You replied as you sat down in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh.\"She laughed as she put her boots on, nearly blowing you away with the wind generated by her movements.\"Ballsy is what you are. You know monsters and humans don't get along, it's been like that for ages. Plus, with the whole 'monsters getting gigantic' thing lately, that's really made things edgy. But lucky for both sides, I'm here to keep the peace.\"She grinned as she proudly flashed a gold policewoman's badge on her chest.</span></div></div>",

She was an ifrit, a type of fire elemental genie. She had bright red skin and long black hair with red streaks and glowing eyes. From what you've seen of her, she dressed in black Arabic garbs and carried her lamp in her sash belt to make sure nobody stole or misused it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard Bernice was a cook at a monster restaurant in town and that she was very single minded when it came to her work. She was a perfectionist who was always trying to improve on her previous work. Chel warned you that Bernice had a fiery temper, which you'd expect from a flame element genie and didn't like being interrupted, especially when she was trying to create a menu.

You let out a sigh as you finally reach the door and prepare to knock. But then you remember something. Chel said that Aqua used to eat humans just like Lupa. Kelpies were monstrous water horses that were said to drown people. Of course you weren't certain that Aqua would eat you. She always seemed so pleasant to everyone. But then again, you weren't a monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figure you could risk it and knocked on Aqua's door. \"Coming!\" yelled Aqua from inside. You hear quakes and look up to see the door open. It was there you see Aqua. Aqua had to be 500 feet tall and she was bright blue in color with fish like scales and long blonde hair with two wildflowers in it. She had a horse like face with hooves, but a fin on her head and webbed hands like a fish and gills on the side of her neck and a huge tail like that of a dolphin. She was very apple figured with a huge stomach and was wearing a black one piece swimsuit. From the looks of it she had already been out surfing this morning and she was in a good mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, you're that human dude from downstairs. R.L. right?\" \"Yeah Aqua was it.\" \"That's my name, don't wear it out. Come on in.\" Aqua scoops you up with her tail and places you in her hand. It's cold and wet and you can barely stand, but she takes you in. Once inside you see Aqua's apartment looks like a Hawaiian hut. There's a huge pair of shark's teeth on the wall and the place was painted to look like the ocean. She even had several different surfboards lined up and there was a record player playing Hawaiian folk music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAqua places you down on the coffee table and then turns the music down a little. You almost regret it, it was a soothing tune. \"Oh,\" said Aqua. \"I got something for you.\" Aqua gives you a small piece of pizza and it still felt hot. \"Wow. Thanks.\" As you eat the pizza, you get a good feeling. Maybe Aqua won't be so much trouble. \"About time you started visiting the uppers dude. We've got some gnarly ones up here. You should meet Elle, she's really got it going on and Irene, it's always good for a laugh to see that gym bunny pumping it, just last week she tried to make a smoothie after having eye surgery. What a disaster.\" You let out a laugh at that thought but then you get worried. Maybe there was a reason Aqua decided to give you something to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay little dude?\" asked Aqua. Well, you figure now's a good a time as ever to ask if the rumor of Aqua (pardon the pun) holds water. \"Uh Aqua,\" you say. \"Do you mind if I ask you one question?\" \"Go ahead bra.\" \"Well, I heard a rumor that you used to eat humans?

Oh no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf that wasn't enough, you hear your stomach growling and groan. \"I'm starving,\" you say. \"Cadence told me not to skip breakfast today, but I didn't listen. I just hope that there's some food in this package.\" While it was dark in that package, you saw there was something inside of it that appeared to be wrapped up. Several items that seemed to be wrapped up. You unwrap one of them and you look in surprise. It was a red velvet whoopee pie as big as a cafe. You lick your lips. \"I really hope that whoever this package is for won't miss just one whoopee pie.\" You bite into the pie and started to munch away to stave off your hunger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 3 more hours, you hear the mail truck come to a stop. You don't know it but it stopped at a building that read \"Rolling Boulders, Gym and Apartment\". The package containing you and one less whoopee pie is taken into a mailroom of some sort and you gulp as you don't know exactly what to expect. You wait for 20 minutes before you hear stomping sounds. One of the giant monsters that lived in this apartment building had come into the mailroom and was heading your way. You hear them pick up the package and hide behind another of the whoopee pies. It was then you heard a female voice with a slight Russian accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" she says. \"Mom must've sent another batch of her homemade whoopee pies. Figures. Every time I manage to lose 5 lbs in the gym, she makes it impossible for me to keep it that way. Oh well. It's not like I'm good at losing weight anyway.\" The giantess hums to herself as she stomps away and you begin to shape. \"I hope that this giant woman doesn't like the taste of human flesh. Whoa.\" The giant woman arrives at her apartment and uses one of her large fingers to cut through the tape on the box. The box opens up and you look up in pure fear at the giantess who opened the box and was now looking in surprise at you down below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant woman was an 850ft tall weresheep with long brownish red hair, two curved horns at the side of her head and black wool all over her body. The sheep giantess wasn't wearing any clothes, but her wool did a good job of covering her up. She was chubby in body shape with a large belly and round cheeks, however, the biggest part of her body was her butt that was wider than she was tall and appeared to be higher on her body than her head. But you were more focused on the fact that you had the misfortune to be shipped to a weresheep. You read somewhere that weresheep were a surprisingly carnivorous species that were bigger man-eaters than werewolves. That was why wereewes were so chubby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A human?\" asks the weresheep in shock. \"What are you doing here?\" You break down and get on your knees. \"Please don't eat me! I wasn't even supposed to be here! I was in Horrorville visiting a neighbor when I got stuck in her shoelace and into the mail truck and...\" The weresheep giantess waves her hand. \"Stop right there. You don't have to worry about me. I don't eat humans. They make me gassy. Now, if my mother saw you, she'd be spitting out your bones before you had a chance to grovel.\" You gulp and then give a sigh of relief before the sheep woman sits down on her couch, filling it up and places the box of whoopee pies on the table before she bites into one. \"You said you were from Horrorville? That's half a day's journey from Cryptfork.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cryptfork!?\" you yell. \"I went all the way to Cryptfork. Oh no!\" The sheep giantess blows on her finger. \"Not so loud. You'll get in big trouble if Mrs. Hatten finds out you're hear?\" You give a gulp. \"Mrs. Hatten? Is she a human hater?\" The sheep woman takes a sip of some water before placing her glass on one of her enormous cheeks. \"No. On the contrary, her husband is a human. She'd be more concerned about a single man in the apartment.\" You don't know what's going on, so you focus on your weresheep host. \"Uh, Ms...\" \"You can call me Bailey,\" says the sheep woman. \"Bailey Johansen.\" \"R.L.,\" you say. \"Uh, Bailey. I don't mean to offend you... but... uh... poor choice of...\" Bailey immediately realizes what you're talking about and lets out a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a rare disorder that only affects female adult monsters. It's called Glutos Syndrome. In fact, half the women in Cryptfork and every monster woman in this building has Glutos Syndrome. The gym at the bottom of the building trains our bodies to carry the extra weight easily. Despite how I look, I'm as graceful as a ballerina.\" \"I see.\" You say nervously. Then the weresheep decides to explain the house rules. \"Mrs. Hatten doesn't like men in the building, except for humans and even then, there's one condition.\" \"What is that?\" you ask. \"Well,\" says Bailey. \"You have to marry one of the residences.\" \"What?!\" \"It's not as bad as you think. The landlady gives all humans who want to live here a 90 day courting period to decide which monster girl they want to marry.\" \"90 days? What happens if...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBailey shakes her head. \"Trust me,\" she says. \"It doesn't end well for the human. You just better hope Mrs. Hatten doesn't find out you're hear or you'll have no choice. It's date or <i>die</i>.\" You give a gulp and then you hear a knock on the door.\" \"Bailey,\" says a female voice. \"Are you in here? It's the first of the month. Rent day.\" Bailey gives a gasp. \"Crap,\" she says. \"Mrs. Hatten. If she sees you, you're toast.\" The door then begins to open and in walks the landlady. She's a yellow-green-skinned gargoyle with light blue hair and multiple face piercings. She wore a tank top and a Hawaiian sari. Her butt was just as big if not bigger than Bailey's, showing she had Glutos Syndrome as well. She was carrying her human husband on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBailey knew that she couldn't let her landlady spot you, so she grabs you and hides you...</span></div></div>",

The two of them were smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Bailey.

Bailey turns her head and gasps as Catherine focuses on you and blinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then gives a large grin that while not an evil looking grin, looks unsettling with her sharp teeth. It made her resemble a shark with lipstick. \"Bailey,\" says Catherine. \"I had no idea that you had company.\" Magnus climbs his wife's hair to get a good look at you. \"Can't say we've seen him around the apartment before. His face doesn't look familiar.\" Catherine decides to closer examine you and even sniffs you, giving you a good look at her studded nose. \"Wait,\" you think. \"What am I worried about. She's a gargoyle. Gargoyles are harmless to humans.\" Then you remembered that in very rare occasions there were rouge gargoyles that could be dangerous to humans, but there's only a handful of those in the monster world. Bailey did mention that there would be consequences if Catherine found an unmarried human in the building who wasn't married within 90 days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine leans her enormous behind on the ground, sitting down without even actually sitting down. Her massive behind ripples as she taps it, thinking about what to do with you. \"You don't seem to be from around here. In case you're unaware, we don't like unmarried men in this building.

The harpy from the looks of it was a harpy who resembled a bird of paradise harpy with bright red, black, blue and gold feathers. She was also enormously fat which made it a surprise that she could still fly. The centaur walked up and handed the harpy the package. \u201cHere, Olivia,\u201d says the centauress. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re heading back to your home town, take this package with you. We have a strict policy here about sending our carriers into hazardous areas.\u201d The harpy gave a scoff. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s an insult. Why does everyone think that Direopolis is full of psychopaths. We\u2019re just quirky.\u201d The centaur rolls her eyes. \u201cThis coming from a woman who surfs using two boards instead of one and whose sister is a teacher who dresses like a masked wrestler? Do us a favor, Ringmoore and take this back where you came from. You did say that you were a postal carrier back in Direopolis, right?\u201d Olivia rolls her eyes and takes your package into her talons before flying away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now very afraid of where you were headed. You had heard some bad things about Direopolis. Cadence warned you that all of the monsters who lived in Direopolis were practically insane. Every one of them had one eccentric quirk or another. You try to bang on the walls of the package but then you remember, you don\u2019t know the harpy who is carrying you back to Direopolis. For all you know she might like to chomp on humans. You begin to wonder who the package is meant for when Olivia reads the name. \u201cCleopatra Round,\u201d she reads. \u201cCool. Maybe I\u2019ll get some grub out of this. Patty\u2019s Direopolis\u2019s best cook.\u201d Your eyes poke out of your head. \u201cDid she say cook?\u201d you ask yourself. You\u2019re more nervous than ever. What if whoever gets this package is a predatory monster who likes to cook humans. Now, you begin to think. From the monsters you knew alone, their names were a dead giveaway to their species. Cleopatra Round was most likely a mummy and the only mummy you knew was a human hating tyrant. This was not looking good. Out of curiosity, you decide to look back to see exactly what was in the package. It looked like a cookbook of some kind. You look closely and you\u2019re more horrified than ever. It was a cookbook for sushi. Cleopatra Round was no doubt planning to chop some humans up and serve them with a side of fish and rice. You really hope that Cleopatra Round had very bad eyesight and doesn\u2019t spot you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 2 hours, Olivia arrives in Direopolis. You can\u2019t see it but she lands in front of a large and fancy looking house with Egyptian statues outside along with a swimming pool. No doubt it was where Cleopatra Round lived. Olivia knocks on the door and you hear it open before hearing a contralto voice. \u201cOlivia? Pinky said you were in Horrorville for the Terrordale surfing competition.\u201d \u201cJust got back,\u201d says Olivia. \u201cBrought home the silver. Somebody I knew at the post office wanted me to bring this to you, Patty.\u201d \u201cThanks. I\u2019ll see you at the ball.\u201d  \u201cPatty?\u201d you think to yourself. \u201cI guess Cleopatra Round prefers to go by a nickname.\u201d You then gasp as Cleopatra Round starts to walk up to a table to place the package down. From the sounds of her footsteps she particularly large and heavy. You guess she would weigh a few tons if she was human-sized. That was a bad sign. A heavy chef with sushi on the mind.\u201d Then you hear a male voice. \u201cLooks like that cookbook finally came. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re going through with it, Patty.\u201d \u201cBlame your mother, Wes,\u201d says Patty again. \u201cShe was the one who suggested that we add sushi to the menu.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then feel tremors. There was another monster in the room who was just as heavy as Patty. The voice that comes from that other monster was very light and bubbly like a teenaged goth girl. \u201cReally? We already serve pizza, burgers, donuts, sundaes, pancakes and panini.\u201d You give a gulp and become more worried. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be supportive, Salli,\u201d says Patty as she takes out a letter opener. \u201cYou like your meat raw.\u201d You begin to sweat. Forget Patty. You were more afraid of Salli. Whatever monster she was, she sounded like she liked to eat humans alive. Then you hear a voice that oddly sounds as if you heard it before. \u201cIt can\u2019t be helped, Patty. Mom\u2019s always been a huge piscivore. One time she swallowed a submarine by mistake.\u201d You recognized that voice. It was the voice of Corona Poe, a minotaur actress who was well known throughout the monster world. From what you know, Corona is a rather fat copper-furred and black-haired minotaur resembling a bespectacled bison. You remember one of Cadence\u2019s books was made into a movie and Corona was the leading lady. She must either live in Direopolis or she was visiting her in-laws. You then remember that Corona was strictly against the idea of monsters eating humans and breathe a sigh of relief. Then you realize that Corona\u2019s associates might not share her dietary views. Patty has begun to cut through the tape on the box and you hide behind the cookbook hoping that she doesn\u2019t see you and try to eat you. Light enters the box and you see for yourself what kind of monsters were in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides Corona there were two of them. The first of them who you guessed was Patty was an enormous pink-skinned and red-haired werehippopotamus with a blue tattoo of a pyramid over one of her eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s a werehippo?\u201d you think to yourself. \u201cShe\u2019s huge. I\u2019ll bet she\u2019s even bigger than Petra.\u201d Then you turn and see who you guessed was Salli. Salli was a vanilla-skinned loxodon, a monster resembling a humanoid elephant, in her case an Asian elephant. She had long black hair and dark yet colorful eyeliner and lipstick like a goth girl. However, to your surprise, it looks like she has fangs inside the nostrils of her trunk and in her mouth. \u201cHuh? Loxodons don\u2019t have fangs?\u201d Then you realize something strange about these giant women. From the looks of it, they were both wearing costumes. Patty was wearing a skin tight Fox Xanatos costume while Salli from her face makeup and split colored costume with a transparent skirt was dressed as a harlequin. Then you look and notice that there are two humans with these giant ladies. On Patty\u2019s shoulder was a bespectacled and bearded young man dressed like a mummy and on the end of Salli\u2019s trunk was a pale blonde young man dressed as a vampire. Neither looked afraid of either giantess. Then you remembered something. You heard that Corona Poe had three human stepbrothers. Those must\u2019ve been them and Salli and Patty must\u2019ve been their wives. Guess they didn\u2019t eat humans here after all. That was a relief. You look and see that Corona herself was wearing a pink and white outfit with a tiara that clearly meant to make her resemble the Queen of Hearts. Her bright hair was wrapped up in a bun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then hear more stomping as another giant woman enters the room. This one is a huge and fat blonde wereboar with brown skin that almost looked like chocolate. However, what was surprising was that this wereboar had leather wings like those of a bat. She was dressed up like a cowgirl with a cow\u2019s skull on the brim of her hat. On the boar woman\u2019s shoulder was a muscular blonde-haired human man who looked younger than the other two and was dressed like a Frankenstein monster. Apparently another of Corona\u2019s brothers. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to go to the big shindig.\u201d says the third brother. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a shindig, Norman,\u201d says Wes. \u201cVienna has invited the town to a charity costume ball.\u201d Pam gives a snort. \u201cI\u2019m not an idiot, Wes. I know it\u2019s a fancy party at Vienna\u2019s place. I just don\u2019t understand why that sister of yours has to go with us.\u201d \u201cBecause we agreed to be Corona\u2019s entourage for the night, Pam.\u201d Says Salli. \u201cNot me.\u201d Snorts Pam. Patty gives a scoff. \u201cYou were outvoted 2 to 1. Can\u2019t you two get along for just one night?\u201d Pam gives a pout. \u201cWhat is the charity for anyway.\u201d \u201cTo build bigger libraries for our schools to increase literacy.\u201d Says Wes. Pam gives a confused look. \u201cIsn\u2019t that against the law? There\u2019s too much literacy in the world already. That\u2019s why there\u2019s so much garbage in the ocean.\u201d \u201cNot littering, stupid,\u201d says Corona. \u201cLiteracy. Something that you obviously would know nothing about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam gives an angry snort and stomps her foot like an angry child. This sends you up into the air and you fall screaming down until you land in between Corona\u2019s breasts. You grunt and begin to sink down and from the looks of it, Corona didn\u2019t even feel you given the look on her face. She was rolling her eyes at Pam\u2019s actions. \u201cYou are so primeval, Pam. What my youngest brother sees in you, I\u2019ll never know.\u201d Salli\u2019s husband lets out a sigh. \u201cDon\u2019t mind them, Allen,\u201d says Salli. \u201cThey\u2019re be in a better mood during the festivities.\u201d Patty gives a sigh. \u201cWell, we better get going. The sun just went down. Vienna\u2019s costume ball awaits.\u201d All four giant women stomp out the door with you as an unknown and unwilling tagalong. You struggle but Corona\u2019s body is too thick. All you can do is struggle as all four sisters-in-law make their way to their friend\u2019s place.</span></div></div>",

Yo little man. You're R.L., right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod in reply.\"I just wanted to meet my neighbors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cracked a small smile across her beak.\"Well, come on in, little man. Everybody's welcome to DJ Elle's crib.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed behind her, trying to ignore her giant, threatening taloned feet in front of you and her heart-shaped butt swaying above. Her apartment was an utter mess. Trash littered the ground, ranging from soda bottles to pizza boxes and everything in between. The apartment was dark, but lit with neon lights adorning the ceiling, and some electronic music was playing heavily in the background.\"Yo little man, you want anything?\"Elle asked as she walked into her kitchen and to the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm good.\"You reply as she came back with an energy drink in hand, appropriately labeled 'Monster'. The thunderbird girl crashed down into a comfy beanbag chair, stretching out her long legs until her talons were looming right in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, watcha wanna know, or even do, little man?\"She asked as she popped the tab and took a long chug of the sugary beverage.</span></div></div>",

Other than DJ and mix records, Elle was known to release music of her own. She already had an album out, and it was pretty popular with the younger monsters of Horrorville. Cadence had it playing one time, doing her little odd zombie shuffle to the electro-pop music blasting through the air. You had to hand it to the harpy girl, she knew her way around a record table and a synthesizer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\"You went on.\"The first track was actually a pretty cool lead-up to the rest of the songs. I could hear a similar beat through them, kinda heavy on the bass drop, but just light enough to catch some record spins and hear the synthesizer in the background. Plus, your vocals mixed in well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes lit up even more.\"Finally! Somebody gets my music!\"She clapped her wings together happily.\"You have no idea how much the other monsters 'round here are so...culturally dead with the music. Some of them still listen to the...\"She shuddered.\"...Monster Mash...\"She gagged at the song's name in her beak. You had to chuckle at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\"She picked you up off of the floor, and you found yourself in her feathery palm, looking at her ecstatic face.\"You're pretty cool for a little dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"You shrug. You just liked her music, and got this reaction from her? Pretty good considering how you handled the other monsters in this apartment complex.</span></div></div>",

It really wasn't anything that spectacular. Just a little conflict of interests. You know Mavis is a singer, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what about her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the day before you moved in, I was gonna have a DJ gig in this new place that was opening up in town. Everything was goin' just fine, but then that banshee bitch came in out of nowhere and decided to upstage me! The manager ended up choosing her singing over my DJ skills, so she got to take over my gig while I ended up with diddly squat! That little bit of static that you saw when you showed up was just my way of getting back at her for moving in on my turf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that must've been rough... So are you to like rivals or something?\" You asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, as if! That banshee isn't even worth the dirt off the bottoms of my talons! I don't know what people see in her. Her singing sounds like nails on a chalk board.\" Elle replied, crossing her feathered arms in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just sighed, not knowing what to say. Since you didn't respond, Elle decided to speak up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, shrimp, is there anything else you want from me, or are you just here to drag up bad memories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm really sorry! I didn't mean to bring up anything that you were trying to forget.\" You said nervously, worrying that you had gotten yourself on Elle's bad side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to your relief, the giantess harpy simply started to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, don't worry about it, little guy.

It looked exactly as the name would sound signify. Dark grey clouds hung heavily overhead. Tall, giant skyscrapers(relative to the monsters) of gothic deocorum rose into the sky, and monsters of all shapes and sizes walked through the streets. Some gave you odd looks as they passed by, as if the sight of a small human was the most curious thing in the world. For the most part, the monsters who walked by greeted Elle with a wave and a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo Elle!\"A Cyclops greeted her with a fist pump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rory!\"She fist pumped back just as enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you doing with a human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naw man, this is R.L. He's one cool little dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was about the same with every friend she walked by. Elle was pretty popular. As you neared the restaurant, bright neon letters greeted you. <i>Echidna's Nest</i> was what was emblazoned as the eatery's name. Huh. Fitting name. Echidna was the mother of all monsters, so you guessed it was tribute to her or something. The thunderbird harpy opened the door, and a draconic waiter greeted her.\"Evening Miss. Table for...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a little date.\"She held you up, and the waiter looked at you awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...err...right this way.\"He motioned, Elle followed, and the two of you were seated in a booth. She sat down and settled you atop the table.\"Swanky place, eh?\"She commented towards you. You had to admit, it was pretty nice. It had a greek fashion to the architecture, but a dark vibe due to the lighting. Overall, perfect place for a monster to eat. Too bad you weren't a monster.</span></div></div>",

He looks at you a little uncertainly.\"I don't think we have...glasses your size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply shrug in reply.\"That's cool. You could uh...just bring a normal cup...for you guys...and we can just dip droplets next to me. I'm fine with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at you with the same look as before, but shrugged in reply.\"Fine. I'll be back in a moment with your drinks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was away, you tried to make small-talk with Elle to liven up the mood. Things were going well enough with her, and she seemed to like you a decent amount, enough to go eat out with her. Was this considered a date? Or just a small meal for friends? You had just met her, and already you were doubting anything. With a sigh, you continued.\"So, where to you usually DJ at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe perked up slightly, leaning on her elbows against the top of the table.\"Down at a club called '<i>Tombstone Hole</i>. Man, that place is sick!\"She cackled a little high-pitched squeal that you expected from a harpy.\"It's got the most complete set-up for a DJ, from scratch table to disks to effin' strobe lights! And we even got a little smoke machine, and a goblin lady owns it, so we can get some wicked enchantments going on if the partygoers want to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed honestly enthusiastic about this sort of stuff. Elle must've really enjoyed what she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could really say anything to continue the conversation, the entire restaurant had fallen silent. The clinking of forks and the chatter of the patrons had ceased all together. You looked up at Elle, her eyes wide as she stared out at the entrance. What could be possibly going on that sent a bunch of monsters into awed silence? When you turned your head to look, you found out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding there in the doorway, easily 600ft. tall, was a slender woman, her top human barely covered in a slim tank top, her bottom a coiling snake's tale. She had animalistic features, but you couldn't quite pin everything down about her. One moment, her eyes were piercing, the next, soft. One minute she had fangs, the next, human teeth. Even her hair seemed to change from a soft brown to writhing snakes. All at once, it hit you. Before you was Echidna, the mother of all monsters, the very being that had given birth to every species of monster present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings, my children!\"She called out to them all in a seductive tone, to which every monster replied \"Greetings, mother!\"In an almost rapt, cult-like chant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are we doing this evening?\"She asked the nearest waiter. He bowed to her before replying.\"Business is good as usual, mother.\"He said. Of course, Echidna must've owned the restaurant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing you knew, Elle's giant feathery hand had grabbed you and hidden you in her lap. You struggled against fingers that were bigger than your whole body, but the thunderbird silence you.\"Sssh! You don't want Echidna finding you!\"</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">(9/21/2016: Under new management. Originally created by RedHurricane)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are R.L. a rare example of a human living in Horrorville, a city inhabited by the monsters of folklore and legend. To make matters worse all the monsters are giants hundreds of feet tall. Despite this, you've managed to find a place on the second floor at the Monster Arms apartment building. But even there it's a dangerous place. Every apartment houses a monster giantess and they have mixed feelings towards you. Try not to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther Characters<br>\r\n   Cadence Deadman- Your roommate, a blue skinned zombie giantess with long hair and two differently colored eyes. The conditions of you living in the apartment was that you share a room with the last new addition. Despite being roommates you don't know much about Cadence since she doesn't speak but let out a few zombie grunts. But considering she's a novelist for a living, she's not as stupid as most zombies. Of course, you're not sure how she thinks about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Nefernina-Su-Ancknamun's- Your landlady, a pear shaped mummy girl wrapped in gauze up to her neck. She surprisingly looks no older than you but she's obviously older than she looks. Unfortunately Nefernina hates humans and sees them as pests. It's a wonder she even let you live here. Of course she warned you that there would be consequences should you make any trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloor 1<br>\r\n    Patsy Hardy- Another tenant of the apartment, a giant Siamese cat sith girl. You usually try to avoid her because of her hyperactive nature and your fear of what a cat would do if she caught you. Patsy is a biker who is usually seen with her gang, the Firecats. She also doesn't get along well with Lupa.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  Georgia Alexopoulos- Your downstairs neighbor, a humongous hourglass shaped gorgon with cobras for hair. Georgia works as an artisan and craftswoman. You don't have a problem with her, but Georgia has to constantly wear a pair of specially designed sunglasses to keep those petrifying eyes of hers in check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Shelly Roshi- A giant kappa girl with the shell of a Ridley sea turtle. She's a rather dodgy character who you suspect to be a con artist since she avoids Petra like the plague but you haven't seen enough of her to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Chel Sherpa- A yeti girl who is one of the few monsters in the building you have no trouble approaching. She's one of the few sensible creatures and would never intentionally harm you. Usually Chel will try to avoid any of the crazy antics of the rest of the apartment. Unsurprisingly she works as a nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloor 2<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Mavis Blaze- A gigantic hourglass figured banshee with pale skin and dark rings around her eyes, a next door neighbor of yours. She sees herself as an accomplished opera singer but all her music does is give you a headache. Unfortunately for you she's too haughty to listen to you complaining about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Alicia Wocky- Another next door neighbor on the opposite side as Mavis and a large yellow green skinned jabberwock. She's somewhat out there and you can barely understand what she's saying. Like Mavis she is musically inclined, but more towards rock than opera. You're pretty sure she's a stoner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Lupa Howler- Your worst enemy and a giant obese werewolf girl. Lupa works as a tailor/clothes designer but that's not what you're interested in. Lupa is out to get you, in her stomach. She's eaten humans before and she isn't going to quit pursuing you until she's caught you. That's why you don't like leaving the apartment without Cadence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Izzy Zard- An overweight, bespectacled but beautiful basilisk girl with a long forked tongue. Izzy works as a schoolteacher but she's also very flirty especially towards you and is determined to make you her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3rd Floor- You don't know much about the third floor's opinion towards humans since you rarely go up there, they might be friend or foe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Bernice Robins- A giant red ifrit (fire genie). Bernice is not very open towards the rest of the apartment but you know she works as a gourmet chef at a monster restaurant and is very single minded when it comes to her work, getting really angry when she's interrupted. You have no idea how she feels towards humans but you don't want to really find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Irene Stargazer- A giant purple cyclops girl. Irene is a hypochondriac and is always exercising. She takes health very seriously and even works as a physical instructor. She lives directly above you and Cadence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Aqua Laguna- A giant apple figured kelpie girl with blue skin. Resembles a scaly anthro horse with gill and a fishes tail but still with hooved feet Aqua is a pacifistic girl who is usually out surfing and generally acts carefree. However you heard a rumor that she used to eat humans. Of course, you don't know if that rumor holds water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Petra Maza- The tallest girl in the entire apartment complex and an orange skinned hourglass figured gargoyle woman with long white hair. You don't know much about Petra except for the fact she's a cop. You don't think she'd harm you but you can't be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Elle Morningdove- A Native American looking harpy with the wings of a thunderbird and electric powers to match. You've seen Elle getting along with everyone in the apartment (except for Mavis and Nefernina) but you've also heard that she tires easily and is usually asleep. The fact that she works as a night radio DJ might have something to do with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew Additions- New monsters added by myself and others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Bianca- (addition by Spiralwriter) a three headed chimera woman with three personalities. Her left head is a goat's head that's friendly with everyone while her center lion's head is always angry and her snake's head on the right is somewhat of a conspiracy theorist and a paranoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Corlette- (addition by Spiralwriter) a ghost girl with long pigtails with pink streaks in her black hair. She's nervous and shy and a bit of a crybaby. She was originally a human who had the extreme misfortune of being eaten by Lupa in a violent manner and is deathly afraid of the wolf girl as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Giselle- A gigantic sphinx. Giselle is very fat and almost spherical in shape due to having no humans being able to answer any of her riddles and as a result she has developed a fear of humans and tries to avoid eating them when she can. Unlike the other monsters, Giselle walks on all fours like an animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Arbara- A giant hippie mandrake with the appearance of a humanoid tree. Arbara is against the idea of monsters mistreating or devouring humans and believes that humans can't defend themselves. Unfortunately, this also causes her to see humans as little more than pets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Zelda- A titanic centaur with the legs of a zebra and long bluish black hair and dark skin. She's usually drunk and not particularly intelligent as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Catalina- (addition by me, name by Spiralwriter) Zelda's roommate and a giant chupacabra woman. She resembles a grayish pink dog woman with spikes growing down her back and long brown hair that appears to have horns. Catalina is the \"Felix\" of the duo and is always angry with Catalina's messy habits and brainless actions. It would be best to steer clear of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Janine- A giant kitsune woman. Janine resembles a human with fox's ears and feet and nine tails. She also has a blue kanji tattoo on the side of her face. It is unknown if she is friendly or evil because she mostly speaks Japanese rather than English.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Koko- One of Janine's neighbors. A green skinned jiang-shi (hopping corpse) giantess. Works as a stunt woman in monster martial arts movies for another jiang-shi but is trying to score higher, with little success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Renee- A giant and very pear shaped gray skinned hodag woman. Renee has long red hair, horns on her forehead, a dinosaur like tail, a frog like face and large fangs. Renee isn't prejudiced against humans but she despises all men regardless of species. Definitely a bad idea to cross paths with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Layla- One of Bianca's neighbors and a 450 foot tall Dullahan, (500) if you count her severed head) who dresses like a medieval knight. Bianca believes that she's an assassin but it's unknown if that's true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Astrid- Another of Bianca's neighbors and a giant obese crimson skinned manticore with long purplish hair and three sets of razor sharp fangs. Astrid mainly keeps to herself. This is because she is secretly keeping a human mate named Ashley in her apartment (who's gender depends on the storyline).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Amy- A chubby purple skinned gremlin giantess and new addition to the apartment. She's very smart and good with machines but unfortunately is horribly racist against the undead and even treats Nefernina with disrespect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Elizabeth Williams- (addition by UltimateNeo) A human looking giantess in a trenchcoat and black leather. Before she became a giant, she was Jack the Ripper and Springheel Jack and has the ability to turn her hands into weapons and leap high. Nobody else knows this however. Holds a grudge against Lupa for eating her when she was human and turning her into a wraith like creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Selena Brown deCrata- An OC by the 12th Doctor. Selena is an 850ft tall and hourglass shaped were cat covered in black fur with orange hair worn in a ponytail. Mainly wears a black bikini and speaks in a Cajun accent. Selena loves to play pool and will challenge anyone, human or monster. Any human who loses to her has to spend the day in her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiba Raven Howler- A werewolf with ivory fur and a long, bushy tail. She has short dyed black (it's naturally brown), and red eyes. She has a fairly muscular physique, but since she has Lactose Overload Syndrome, her breasts are gargantuan, easily obscuring her torso and upper legs, and filled to the brim with milk that she can't lactate. Aiba wears black, gothic clothing that shows of as much cleavage as possible and thigh high heeled boots  She is a goth through and through. She loves anything that is dark and creepy. It takes a while for her to warm up to anyone. She is rather distant from her family, rarely seeing eye-to-eye with her sister Lupa (since Lupa eats humans and Aiba doesn't) and outright refuses to talk about Persephone. But she can still be a friendly person once you get to know her. Like some women with LOS, Aiba is proud of her breasts. She does hate it when people bring up her namesake though. She is an OC of the 12th Doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoko Hana - An OC of the 12th Doctor, Kyoko is a 1000ft Onryo with chalk white skin, long stringy black hair, and solid black eyes. She has an exaggerated hourglass figure, with MM-Cup breasts, wide hips, and a huge ass. She is covered head to toe with tattoos, all of sexy monster women. They range from BBW's to massively busty, to gorgeous bodybuilders. She wears a skimpy bikini so her tattoos are exposed. Kyoko herself is usually silent. When she does speak, it's limited to one or two words. She is largely emotionless. The majority of her personality are in her tattoos, which are sentient. The tattoos represent aspects of herself, including a very shy bodybuilder, a tomboy with huge boobs, and a very flirty BBW. These tattoos can move freely on her body, are capable of speech, and can even control parts of Kyoko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of the Apartment<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimiko \"Kim\" Drake -  An 825ft tall Yuki-Onna who is an OC of the 12th Doctor. Kim has chalk white skin, long, light blue hair, icy blue eyes, and blue lips. Kim's body lacks legs, ending instead in a ghostly tail. Kim is naturally and enormously pear shaped, with a fairly slim upper half/ Kim, being a Yuki-onna, constantly causes it to snow where ever she is. Despite this, she is a warm person, being very friendly. She is a serious meat eater, but refuses to eat humans. She is the landlord of a building with three businesses: a deli, a comic shop, and a salon. She is married to a succubus named Alia. Both have the opposite body shape of the other: Kim has decent breasts but a gargantuan rear, while Alia has a small rear but Lactose Overload Syndrome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicolette Lito Macht - A 1015ft tall were cheetah who is an OC of the 12th Doctor. Nicolette has short, spikey red hair, orange eyes, orange fur with black spots, and a medium tail. She is extremely muscular, but due to her training style, has a gargantuan obese belly. She wears workout gear. Nicolette is a well-known fitness instructor from Germany. She is known for her program that can make woman super muscular, but requires them to have a fat belly. She is loud, demanding, and strict, but she gets results. She wears a ring that protects from all disease, including nebutori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori LeCroix - An OC of the 12th Doctor. Tori is a 1680ft (originally 920ft) rose creature who is friends with Aiba. Tori has forest green skin, blue eyes, and a red rosebud acting as hair. Various other flowers grow out of her body. There are also what appears to be vines on her body. If it weren't for her weight, people would say she resembles Poison Ivy from DC comics. Due to a bizarre strain of nebutori, Tori is impossibly obese. She wears an enormous green bikini made of leaves. Tori may not be the tallest monster (that honor goes to Morgan Wayne) but she is the fattest. A strain of nebutori has turned her into a literal mountain of a woman, weight little over 5 tons (10,000 Ibs). She is extremely proud of this, and determined to get even fatter to maintain her position. Outside of that, she is a friendly person, willing to talk to anyone. She loves comic books. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese are the monsters, try to survive.<br>\r\n   All monsters are giants. Three hundred feet is the minimum.<br>\r\nRules<br>\r\n   Males Monsters can appear, but only females can interact with or harm R.L. I've decided to let it slide but to be honest, I don't like male giants.<br>\r\n   Only female monsters live in the building<br>\r\n   No toilet stuff!<br>\r\n   No extreme sexual content. It makes me uncomfortable.<br>\r\n   Do not use existing characters from anime, cartoon etc. OCs are okay.<br>\r\n   Try to keep the monsters adults<br>\r\n   Try not to end the story too soon.<br>\r\n   Read the previous chapters before you add. I don't want to see anybody using information that is clearly wrong. I had to fix some chapters because some fool wrote things about the characters that contradicted previous information.<br>\r\n   You can add more monsters if you want, just try to make them different species than the ones I've put in.<br>\r\n    If you come to a type of monster you've never heard of, you can look it up on wikipedia. You might learn something.<br>\r\n   Please try to keep this story a fantasy. It had gone out of control with sci-fi giantesses and I had to sadly delete a lot of chapters to restore this story to its glory.<br>\r\n  As show with the above rule, no human giantesses, mechas or mutates. I allowed it once and it turned out to be a HUGE mistake.<br>\r\n  Keep underage characters to an absolute minimum. You have to be an adult to have an apartment. Be logical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   This story is meant to be black comedy, try and make it funny.<br>\r\n   Other than that have fun and please add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Thanks for all the additions. I really appreciate it. Special Thanks go to Spiral-And-Twist, Forestfire5000, Xoncron, Anonymous One, Runic, UltimateNeo, Dylan M, Oregulus, Infinitebull, J.M. Darkly, the 12th Doctor and Crimson Freak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
