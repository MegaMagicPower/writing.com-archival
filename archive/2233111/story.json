The program was called the Hero Work Recommendation Project. The Hero Public Safety Commission sponsored it and they would be dealing with minor crimes and helping civilians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe island was recently built upon and still had several areas that were under construction. But it at least had a town and places for them to stay. The island was called Nahuro Island and the students of 1-A would occupy a call center and take on various tasks that the locals needed doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku Midoriya was on once such task, an elderly woman had lost her cat and it had been reported seen near a cave. As Deku neared the opening he felt something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" He held up his gloved hand and wiggled his fingers, \"It feels like something in this cave is reacting to One for All...\" He murmured as he shook off the eerie feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty! You in here?\" He called into the darkness as he activated the flashlight on his phone. No response, just an echo is what he got back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeku entered the cave and shone his flashlight all around, there was no sign of the cat anywhere. \"This place is creepy...\" He whispered to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here kitty kitty!\" He called for the lost feline. His flashlight hit a strange crystal formation that caught his eye. \"Huh? Weird...\" Deku drew closer only to yelp as he heard a voice in his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yo kid. So you're the Ninth huh?\"</i> It almost made Izuku jump out of his skin before he saw the image of a man inside the crystal. \"Wait..I know you...I had a dream about you and the other users of One For All. You were there...\" Izuku crouched before the shining fragment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yeah yeah, well it's your lucky day. Seems these crystal formations are reacting to One for All in a neat way. So much so that you can awaken another quirk...mine!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Like Black Whip?\" Izuku questioned, rather curious and more than a little excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yeah sorta...but mine's better. Now don't be alarmed, it'll take some getting used to...but once you get over your shock you can control it.\"</i> The mysterious figure vanished and the crystal began to glow...before shooting energy into Izuku. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidoriya yelped for a bit, it felt warm but it startled the freckled boy. That was when he started to grow...and things really got freaky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis green messy hair hit the roof of the cavern..and it began to collapse as he slowly but surely filled the entire place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"W-WHAT'S HAPPENIIIIING?!!?</b></span></div></div>",

Soon in less then a second, the top of the cavern burst and blasted off pieces of rock. As the dust clear a huge figure's shadow could be spotted sitting up and letting out booming groans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku rubbed his head and hissed in pain, hitting the ceiling luckily didn't give him a concussion. Opening his eyes the greenette waved a hand to blow away the dirt in the air. Unaware a massive gust spread blasted the trees and made birds flap out in a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what was that, how did i get that quirk...and what was that energy?\", Izuku thought over the crazy events that just occurred. However as he looked down, Izuku's eyes widened in shock as he looked in front of his big red shoes. A tree...that only reached his ankle!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around him, Izuku couldn't believe the sight. The forest around him looked like a tall field of grass, and the town in the distance looked like a toy model. Izuku began nervously mumbling as he took in his situation. \"H..how everything's tiny! Or am i huge?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatting his cheeks, Izuku took a breath. \"Ok i need to calm down, this has to be the other One for All user...but i didn't see him as a giant in my dream.\", slowly placing his palms on the ground and slightly cracking it, Izuku sighed before beginning to stand. The greenette flinched in worry as the earth beneath his large feet began to crack, his weight sending a shake throughout the island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku looked around in slight awe, seeing things from a plane's pov was sorta breathtaking. Standing over what he assume 200 ft, Izuku slowly stepped forward, he stiffened however as he crunch rang out as he flattened a section of trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe i should be careful, dont wanna mess up their home...\", Izuku awkwardly chuckled beginning to try and cross the forest falling victim to his massive shoes.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nMeanwhile at the call center, the homeroom teacher of 1-A was tiredly sitting behind a desk as the elderly woman the problem child was assigned looking worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's been gone awfully long, neither him or my Ruru have turned up.\", the elderly lady spoke wiping her eyes with a tissue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAizawa sighed. \"Miss please don't worry, my student will find your cat, he's come back from far-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tired man was cut off as a sudden shake hit the building, making the lights flicker as some shelf items fell. The woman looked in fear at the shaking ceiling. \"Oh no an earthquake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly bringing the woman to the floor, Aizawa stood over in surprise. It wasn't  just the sudden earthquake, these shakes weren't like a magnitude they were in a pattern. Not like tectonic plates but...footsteps?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully the shaking stopped and the lights stayed consistent. The underground hero sighed in relief before helping the elderly woman up. \"Ma'am are you ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalming down the woman nodded taking a few breaths. \"Ha..yes thank you young man. I don't understand there hasn't been an earthquake at all in Nahuro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made the teacher more confused, not only was the shaking itself different but there hadn't been an earthquake in this island's history. Before he could ask the resident any further, the door to the call center suddenly burst open. Panting from being out of breath was Denki leaning on the door and looking as if he had rushed here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Aizawa sensei you gotta look at this!\", Denki yelled before rushing back out. Aizawa would normally scold the student for leaving so abruptly, but after the earthquake he was willing to bet that this was important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sitting the elderly lady down, Aizawa made his way to the door. Opening it a screeching cat darted through his legs and towards the woman. The old lady cries in joy hugging her lost feline, though the cat clearly was scared based on its eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping through the doors, Aizawa saw...</span></div></div>",

But it was going to get harder to keep One for All on the downlow if he kept gaining quirks randomly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAizawa groaned, \"Can you at least reverse it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll make things difficult...especially since you seem to be even larger than Mt. Lady, if you can't revert back.\" Yaoyorozu commented with a sweatdrop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku concentrated, he'd been so wrapped up in his shock and the possibilities of this new quirk that he hadn't really taken the time to try to reverse it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, as everyone watched with anticipation...the greenette began to dwindle back down to his normal height. \"Hey! I did it!\" Midoriya cheered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta say that's a really cool new quirk!\" Uraraka cheered. \"Grrrgh...some guys have all the luck...\" Mineta grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now that that's settled...everyone needs to get back to work!\" Aizawa ordered. \"Yes, sir!\" The students said together as they went back into the call center.</span></div></div>",

Days often went by and you weren't sure if the sun wasn't even up when you awoke from your long slumbers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeck you barely left your room to the rest of the apartment, if someone entered they probably assume nobody lived here. After your parents separated you had to adapt to  living different places each time of the year. Right now was your dad's time yet he had to go on a buisness trip, leaving you to brood in your cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the games, anime, manga around you, you'd deny having a lonely feeling in your NEET heart. Unfortunately the lack of another presence often contradicted that.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~\u2022~\u2022~~~~~~<br>\r\nYou yawned as you layed on your side, the laptop hooked up to the T.V and playing the...damn you lost track. Something episode of season two of My Hero Academia. Being a late watcher of the series you were immediately invested in the thrilling show, enjoying the characters and story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man he broke his finger just to encourage the icicle.\", you grinned watching the screen. \"Get me a friend like that...well any friend for that matter.\", you sighed already making self loathing jokes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClicking off the T.V and computer you yawned again. \"I really need to catch up, cant use the no spoilers card for long.\", you began making a list in your head of all the anime you needed to watch before next season. Just as you were about to lay down you noticed the screen to your laptop click back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\", walking back over, you pressed the power button again. Oddly the screen didn't turn off, and you sore static began to flicker. You looked worried as you began clicking randomly. \"Shit don't dont tell me the screen's glitching!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever this was far more disastrous then a computer issue. The screen itself began to glow and a...wind began circling your room. Sparks danced off the screen in a frency. \"W-what the hel-AHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour screams were cut off as the spark flashed a bright light, after dimming you were no where to be found. All that showed was the summary on your screen of My Hero Academia.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nA ringing filled your head as you stirred awake, all your senses returning from your unconscious state. Immediately you knew you weren't in your room as there was a bright light. <i>\"Am i in the hospital, might me this bed is not supporting me.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up however proved you were not in a hospital, the light above wasn't just a lamb it was...like a sun. And you weren't on a bed it looked like a wooden floor, stationed next to a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up you suddenly felt shock looking around. This forgein place was giant! The wall before you was a towering blacket and just over you saw a skyscraper height dresser holding...All Might figures? Wait why would you be in a giant room with MHA merch? Did some company make a giant tourist attraction and kidnap you as an unwilling reviewer?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore further contemplating hit you, faint yet noticable vibration hit the ground. You frantically looked around. \"Hey if your here for my input i might recommend not kidnapping people!\", you yelled figuring the team behind this would wake up any minute. Yet no one appeared, the vibration grew more heavy and consistent in it's step rhythm?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the vibrations stopped and the doorknob to this giant room began to shake. You shook as you clenched your teeth. \"N-no way there isn't actually giants right!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door suddenly opened and a strong breeze from the swinging frame followed. You saw a pair of large feet, looking bigger then a house, going higher you saw familiar white and blue sweatpants. Above was a bare and buff torso, sweat dripping from the numerous abs and large pecs. Finally you realized everything as the giant's head was that of Izuku from My Hero Academia!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no what? A giant Izuku, how is this possible!?\", you began to think over everything, that freakout glitch, Izuku himself before you. \"I got...sucked into the anime!...This is awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you knew you weren't in some government conspiracy you thought of this scenario. You were in your current favorite anime, sure you were probably an inch but you were in the anime! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so rad, everything looks so cool in person, wait do i have a quirk!?\", a million things ran through, though they were halted as Izuku let out a booming sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku smiled as he wipped his muscular arm with a towel. \"I'm glad Todoroki invited me to train, he had a lot of exercise to practice!\", The greenette chuckled sheepishly as he smelled his strong potent b.o. \"I probably should've put on some deodorant hehe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a breath, while being in a anime was cool you still were shrunk. Now you need to think of what to do....</span></div></div>",

After the birth of Shouto it was a surprise when another child was on the way. It was quite a shock when at birth you were only a speck. It made seemingly no sense, you had a quirk of being an inch tall and invulnerability to boost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill growing up was tough not only due to your size but the conflifts within your family. Your mother disappeared before you even got to know her, you rarely saw your father, and your oldest brother Touya had passed.

All were options for a suitable highschool, ones catering to technology, political careers, etc. Of course the ones missing were any schools focusing on hero programs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Of course, finally let's me go to school and it's not even the one i want.\"</i>, you looked irritably at the schools that didn't match your interests.

You were sent back onto your back with a yelp. Looking up you felt your nose tingle as a sweaty odor filled your nostrils. Sure enough, it was due to the damp socked foot resting on the paper and wetting them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLook up the towering sweatpant clad legs you saw the sweaty and muscular torso of your brother Shouto.

The pressure of Shouto's full weight came down on you full force and you felt yourself compressing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pamphlets you had been looking over now had a moist foot print on them as your elder brother stepped off of them...and brought you along for the ride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shou-!\" <b>SLAM!</b> \"-To!\" <b>SLAM!</b>. Over and over again the cycle repeated, lift, slam, lift, slam. Shouto must have some thick feet not to feel you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe icy hot boy slid open the door to his bedroom and entered, shutting the door behind him before plopping on his bed.</span></div></div>",

Wiggling his large toes the giant frowned at the stuffy constricton on his firm drenched soles. Of course the cotton being full of sweat not only smeared his unaware passenger but also made feeling him minimal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing his unoccupied foot on his knee, Shouto began to peel off his now crummy sock. A peeling sound came out as the fabric was pulled from the muscled and wet soles. A thick odor soon poured out like steam as the foot was released from the sock. A strong concentrated vinegar musk thoroughly coating Shouto's stompers, the boy showed no disdain for his stench though whether ot was due to his usual blank expression or him not being bothered was unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTossing aside the rank sock, Shouta sighed as his smelly and large foot was freed. Flexing his firm sole, Shouta brought it down with a wet slap against his floor before rising his other foot...<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nYou cringed as the heavy and rank pressure squashed you down, the cotton full of warm vinegar stink was knocking the wind out and making you breath the odorous foot musk. Finally the pressure was relieved and you felt a rush of air as your brother brought the foot you were squished into onto his knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShouta's fingers grabbed the hem of his sock, you knew this could be your chance! Unfortunately you had been stomped so repeatedly that you were unable to dislodge yourself and yell to get his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe peeling noise boomed as Shouta tore off his smothering foot wear. The warm sweat squelched as it was peeled away with the sock. You almost yelled in panic had it not been for the musk getting in your mouth and making you gag on the reeking stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were dislodged and coughed as you sat in the vinegar foot odor scented sock like a bag. \"Shouta I'm in he-AHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chance was dashed again as Shouta tossed aside the sock as well. You screamed as you fell from at least skyscraper height, tumbling and being thrown around the rank sock. Luckily in addition to your durability, the sweaty sock offered cushion as you landed near the other discarded sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShouta blinked as he thought he heard his sibling's voice. \"K\u00f5ri? I trained too hard my head must be dizzy.\", the two toned haired boy groaned rubbing his head while also wiggling his fuming and sweaty toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou coughed as you walked through the humid darkness, the foot odor condensed into the rank sock. Walking into the light you looked up at your brother, determined to get his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShouta was....</span></div></div>",

U.A's sports festival was in full swing as the student body was competing for the top of the competitions. Right now, the screens of the citizens were shown the battles between each student, clashing with their respective quirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this universe the flow of the fabric was a little...different. Certain things in time, or appearances may have shifted. One of them were the addition of members to families and groups. Such is the case with the lad standing in the battle ring waiting for his match now...<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nIzuku hummed as he looked over the various notes he had taken so far. He described the victory of Tokoyami and the nature of Shinsou's quirk, now he just had to wait for the next duo to fome out in battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides the greenette, his friend Uraraka was tapping her fingers as she thought of her future match with the explosion user of their class. The brunette looked over at her mumbling friend with a sweatdrop, before she could snap him out, Uraraka noticed her other friend focusing on the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iida is everything alright?\", the glasses boy blinked out of his focus, he saw Izuku snap out of his mumbling to look at him as well. \"Ah apologizes were you saying something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you just seem kinda into the match before it started.\", the brunette said waving her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdjusting his glasses, Iida smiled slightly. \"Yes well.. the next match actually has my brother participating.\", nearby Denki blinked as he leaned over. \"Wait your bro's a pro hero right, why he be fighting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three blinked, Iida shook his head. \"Oh no Tensei isn't fighting! It seems i never told you of my other brother, he attends class 1-C. His name is Takeru.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's my younger brother by a year, due to his scores he was able to move up to my grade. Though this is the first time we aren't in the same class...\", the bluenette finished in a sad tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku smiled. \"He sounds really cool, maybe after his match could we meet him?\",Uraraka nodded eagerly in agreement. \"Yeah i bet he's a great leader just like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIida smiled. \"Thank you both, i would like for him to make more friends as well so I'd be happy to introduce you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the loud voice of the announcer Present Mic began to boom the introductions. \"Up next in our thrilling set of matches is two rising heroes from class 1-C!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A part of the well known hero family, it's Takeru Iida!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the ring was a boy with a toned tall frame, he had layered blue hair with a small ponytail tail. Takeru eagerly grinned as he took his spot for the match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He makes his words his weapons, it's Manga Fukidashi!\", the student with the speech bubble head walked up, giving a friendly wave to his opponent. \"Hey there, don't go easy on me ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeru nodded, shifting his feet. \"Same it's not a true match otherwise. I've got people i care about watching me and i need to show how far I've come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIida focused on the match, he had faith in his brother. Especially with the quirk he had to work with. Though still, call it his protective brother nature, he did feel worry for Takeru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...START!\", the hero shouted, signaling the start of the match. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeru took a breath as he sprinted into a charging run, moving quickly across the field. Though it wasn't the super speed like Iida possessed, he didn't have any evidence of having engines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing his opponent approach, Manga launched a BOOM!, the giant letters projecting forward. Takeru hopped out of the way rolling to the side, as the word exploded against the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, much to everyone's confusion as the smoke cleared they saw Manga by himself in the ring. Takeru was nowhere in sight as the comic head student looked around everwhere. The spectators began to voice their confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku furiously write down the details shown within just a few seconds. \"I-Iida does he have a invisibility quirk like Hagakure? Or...did he teleport?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumming, Iida looked around the field. Though of course he couldn't see anything small at this size. \"No it's a little more...complicated then that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one could see it, but on the shoulder of Manga was a speck. That speck turned out to be Takeru who nodded before suddenly hopping off. In an instant, the boy popped out of thin air seemingly before before grabbing his opponent and throwing him over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManga yelped as he was thrown on his back, being thrown out of nowhere! The crowd suddenly went wild at the unexpected turn of events. It was over however, Takeru vanished once again. Just as Manga began to get up his foot rose and he was flung forward and as if being kicked he was launched into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp in the booth, Aizawa rubbed his bandaged chin as he looked at the report. \"Iida Takeru, he is able to downsize his body to an inch or even a centimeter. At this size he keeps his stamina and strength. He seems to use it accordingly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe greenette began to write the details down, Uraraka looked in awe at the fight. Iida smiled as he saw the definite outcome. Landing on the ground once more, Manga groaned before promptly passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeru sighed as he regrew, looking up he was greeted with the crowd cheering at his victory. Looking around, his eyes found the proud face of his older brother. His lips shook slightly before grinning as he looked up in success.</span></div></div>",
