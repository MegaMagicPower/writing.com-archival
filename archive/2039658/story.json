He was an explorer at heart and so he found himself strolling around the kingdom, restlessly looking for new visages. Although the kingdom had been his home for a long time there seemed to be an endless amount of nooks and hidden areas to stumble upon and Mario loved the feeling of finding an untouched glen or a forgotten castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he dashed around aimless he suddenly found a set of brick blocks and almost by reflex he sprinted towards them and banged his fist against the underside of each one until he heard a familiar sound of an item appearing from one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously he flung himself up to check what toy he had managed to unearth and found himself at a loss. It was a mushroom, but not one he had seen before. It was pink and blue, its eyes shut and, most oddly, it wasn't moving at all. Mushrooms usually forced him to hunt them down but this one just sat there. Mario didn't hesitate long before he ran up to it, reached his hand out and touched the mushroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt an intense tingling which he knew meant that the mushroom's effect was being applied to his body. He was excited to find what it would do to him. Maybe he would be able to fly or jump higher, or maybe he would turn into an animal? Barely a second later the tingling dissipated and Mario noticed that something was indeed very different. He looked down to see what the mushroom had done to him only to discover that his body and clothes had changed, but not in any way he was previously familiar. What he saw was not his own body, nor was he a cat, or a raccoon or even a bee. What he was looking down on was clearly the body of...</span></div></div>",

It didn't take long for him to notice that this was something entirely different, however. There was no mistaking that pink, frilly dress after all. Those long, curly locks of blonde hair. His now very delicate hands were clothed in elbow-length white gloves. When he yelped in surprise, it was with a soft, feminine voice, almost squeaky.

She looked over the rolling hills, Toads playing around in the green grass, cheep cheeps jumping up and down in the sparkling water. It was gorgeous - and she was so bored. She thought that sitting out in the garden bathing in the summer sun would kill some time but she found herself restless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe garden was beautifully landscaped with flowers of all colours and sizes adorning almost every single inch of it. All of a sudden, she noticed a mushroom slowly gliding around among the vegetation. She hadn't seen one like this before and she was certain it was a new addition to the grounds. Perhaps something Toadsworth had given to the groundskeeper, a rare gift from a foreign diplomat or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved towards it, entranced by the beautiful fuchsia colour that stood out even among the rainbow palette of petals surrounding it. She walked towards, bent over and picked it up, for a moment so lost in the beautiful hue that she forgot to consider what effects it might have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body started tingling. She felt a wave flush over her, moulding her and transporting her. It was over in a few seconds and when she came to, she could feel instantly that something wasn't right.

Mario?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrantically, she inspected herself. Her long legs had become short and stocky.

Luckily she didn't bump into any toads on her way. Mario was obviously coming and going in the castle so seeing him rush around wouldn't have been all that unusual, but in her flustered state, Peach preferred not to have to deal with anybody else right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she made it to her quarters, at which point she prompt shut and locked the door behind her and tried to gather her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith cautious steps she moved over to her full-length mirror. Maybe, she figured, getting a proper look at what had happened might allow her to calm down and get to grips with the situation. What looked back at her was indeed Mario. It felt hugely disorienting seeing Mario's body respond to her body's commands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost without realising it she began prodding at her face, stroking her moustache and feeling her soft cheeks. She was certainly not unfamiliar with Mario's body, but seeing it from this angle, feeling the sensations of touching it, it was interesting to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer attention soon turned to the biggest differences between her old form and her new one. She looked down and gazed at her rotund waist, There was something very odd about having this extra bulk on her. She stroked her big belly, prodded it with her hefty fingers and felt them sink in to the chub with ease. She slapped it lightly, noticing how it rippled gently for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMario had always been a chubby man and she definitely didn't mind, finding his podgy little body very attractive, but being used to a more slender build made her feel slightly ashamed. Regardless, she decided to...</span></div></div>",

Having her body take new shapes was not exactly a unique experience for her, she was particularly fond of being a cat, but this was so new and exciting. She just had to make the most of the opportunities this experience afforded her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she began with unbuttoning her overalls and slowly lowered them to the floor. She slid off her gloves and bent over to take off shoes and socks. Her red shirt was next and before long she found herself standing half-naked, with nothing but Mario's tight white boxer shorts on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sight was enough to induce an unfamiliar stirring in her groin. She could even see the fabric on Mario's pants tighten as his penis grew bigger. He was a cute, fat little plumber after all, and now she could explore him closer than she ever had before. She looked down on her fluffy belly and rubbed it sensually, her fingers caressing the perfectly smooth, round surface. Her fingers travelled over her plump chest, moving in circles over her rapidly hardening nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cast a glance at herself, spotting that her penis was now as hard as it could get, pitching a decent tent in the white boxers. She turned around to inspect what was always her favourite part of Mario's body; his cute, plump butt. And indeed, it was incredibly beautiful even now. Soft, yet immensely pert. She alternated between stroking it gently and grabbing it with her full palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer erection was almost hurting now, so big and pining to be touched. There was nothing that could stop her. She pulled down the boxers and Mario's penis flicked out with a bounce, thick and pulsing. She tensed it and felt a surge through her entire crotch area, her penis responding with a tightened bounce. She took her chubby hands and grabbed it, stroking along the length with a careful but decisive grip. Her other hands remained on her torso, stroking Mario's chub in rhythm with her right hand's movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted him there, the fat little guy. She loved the feeling of his soft, malleable body against her taut form. But standing her, seeing him in immense pleasure, his chub wobbling with each stroke, his cute face contorted in ecstasy as his orgasm neared with each breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe load hit the mirror, dripped on the floor and over her hand and she still couldn't stop herself. She couldn't help but scream out and the sound of Mario's voice made the last few spurts even more powerful. It was too much for her and she found herself on the floor, her penis still dripping little pearls of cum onto the pink carpet. She splayed herself on the floor and felt the erection slowly dissipate as she stared into the ceiling.</span></div></div>",

She said herself every so often in the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her every moment in the shower was a slow minute of tailoring since she was washing the body of her own hero whom she had admired so many years with her own hands (or well .. Mario's) and that made her happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carefully washed all the parts where she had splashed the liquid with a pink soap she had in case she got very dirty in some case if she left the castle and fell or something similar but was perfect right now for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell that the soap gave off when I scrubbed it in mario was great, that aroma was so good that they removed some odors without problems that Mario contracted from the previous thing done by Peach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter humming some songs she knew came out of the shower with the towel covering it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least now she felt more relieved since every time she took a shower she always calmed down (of course if Bowser didn't show up)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to wonder if she would wear Mario's clothes since she was dotted with her previous experience until she heard someone knocking on her door on the other side, that scared Peach a lot since nobody could see him in that state and it would be very confusing to anyone who sees the disaster on the carpet and a naked mario next to it, obviously Peach would not open the door in any way until he hears someone speak to him on the other side of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person on the other side of the door is ...<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"><b>(Santinox: If you are going to put a new part of History be Descriptive plz!)</b></span></span></div></div>",

So while the Mushroom Kingdom celebrated, what was left of Bowser's troops vacated his castle until Bowser calmed down, so not to get caught up in his raging destruction. Not even his own son, who had rescued him from the lava he had fallen into, wanted to stay around him after he had lost. Anything in his path would almost certainly be demolished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser's stomping spree was already well under way. He charged through the halls of his castle, tearing down blocks and platforms, wondering where he went wrong. He was sure this would have been too much for Mario this time. He kicked an empty Koopa Shell Mario had left behind in frustration, only for it to collide with an unused ? Block and come back to hit him in the foot. He held his injured foot in his hand, roaring in pain, and hopping around on the other, only to lose balance and fall over on his back. It was times like this that made him glad that his minions left him alone for a while after a defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting to his feet, Bowser redirected his anger towards the ? Block that had sent the shell flying back at him. To his surprise, it hadn't simply ejected a coin or some sort of mushroom or flower he was familiar with. Instead, it was a type of mushroom he was not familiar with. It seemed almost cross-eyed, and it's cap seemed to switch back and forth between various colours. More interestingly, though, was that it didn't move around like any other mushrooms he'd seen, it merely stood in place on top of the ? Block. It almost seemed to beckon him to come and get it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Bowser had never seen a mushroom like this, he certainly didn't know what it did. But that also meant Mario hadn't found one and used it against him yet. This could be the edge he needed to beat Mario once and for all! He quickly ran over the the mushroom and grabbed it. He could feel the familiar energy following through his body, similar to when he used the Super Bell, but this transformation did not turn him into a cat. Instead, upon looking down at himself, he found himself turned into...</span></div></div>",

When somebody touches it, their body is instantly swapped with the person who they most recently had physical contact with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne mushroom can only swap one character once, but can be used multiple times on different characters. For example, if Mario and Luigi switches bodies with Mushroom 1, neither of them will be able to use Mushroom 1 to swap back or with anybody else. However, Mushroom 1 can still be used to swap Princess Peach and Bowser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese mushrooms are relatively rare, hence why they have only recently been discovered.
