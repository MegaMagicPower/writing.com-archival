The younger cat is holding a partly-eaten chocolate bar, a sight which made Rachael a bit uneasy, and she looks like she wants to ask something. \"Hey there, sis.\", Rachael greets her, \"Got something on your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On my mind? Nope! In my mouth? Yes!\", the white cat cheers, holding up her chocolate bar. \"Yummy chocolate!\" Rachael nods, smiling a bit at Sarah's enthusiasm, but then looks a bit more serious. \"I just hope you don't expect me to try some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww... Why not? It's yummy and it gives you energy!\", Sarah cheers again, holding it up to Rachael. \"Try it!\" Rachael backs away. \"Woah, no way! You know I don't eat that stuff!\", she replies quickly, \"You shouldn't even be eating it--it's not good for you, and it'll make you fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah shakes her head and steps up to Rachael again. \"Not if you work out like you do sis! You won't get fat and you can work out longer!\", she says while swishing her tail playfully. \"Pwease??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Sarah!\", the black cat insisted once more, \"I'm not getting my lips anywhere near that artery-clogging junk!\" She figured this would get Sarah to stop... But then she remembered Sarah's secret weapon... \"Don't you dare...\", she warned the younger kitty as she saw her preparing to do it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but... Rach~!\" Sarah makes her big-eyed pouty face and sniffles at her sister.<br>\r\nRachael tries to resist, but finally finds herself giving in with a heavy sigh. She takes the chocolate bar from Sarah. \"If I have a heart attack after eating this, I hope you know how to call the hospital.\", she grumbles as she slowly takes a bite...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah watches happily and swishes her tail again. \"Well??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael chews and swallows the chocolate, and remains silent for a moment, before her eyes widen, and she yells... \"Oh, what the hell, I'm not gonna hide it anymore!\" With that, she begins wolfing down the entire bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!! Rachael approves!\", Sarah cheers, jumping up and down with glee. \"Want another?\", she asks as she offers the black cat another bar. Rach nods gleefully. \"I don't wanna know where you pulled that from, but of course I want it!\", she confirms, grabbing it and tearing the wrapper open, nomming it all down. \"I knew you loved it all along, Sis--Taffy told me you're addicted!\", Sarah giggles, grinning widely. \"I am, Sarah... I am addicted... And I want more...! Sarah, where do you keep those?\", she asked, suddenly alot more hyperactive than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have more back in my room, Rach!\" Sarah grabs Rachael's hand and drags her to her room. Rachael giddily follows Sarah to her room, eager to see this stash of chocolate. \"Rach... Behold!\" The hyper kitty shows Rachael the stash of chocolate bars hidden in the dresser in her room. Rachael lets out a very high-pitched squeal and grabs an armload of them, murring as she eats them, a heavy blush covering her very aroused-looking  face. \"What else do I still need to know the taste of?\", she wonders out loud with her mouth full of chocolate. \"I avoided chocolate for years until I came here, so what else have I been missing out on? Maybe it's time to start enjoying more junk food!\" She grins, lips smeared with chocolate, pointing a chocolate-covered finger into the air. \"I'm gonna make up for those lost years!\", she declares proudly, \"Besides, I'm sure I could work it all off within a couple of weeks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!! That's the spirit!\" Sarah encourages her sister.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rachael had a great idea as she and Sarah went down to the den. \"How about we order up some fast food?\", she suggested with a grin, \"I know you've always wanted me to try some, so now's my chance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Yes! Pizza! Burgers!\" Sarah jumped up and down in glee as she grabbed a phone book. \"Pick a place, sis!\" Rachael began looking through the phone book, dialing the nearest fast food restaurants and ordering a few meals for herself and Sarah. Before long, the kittens have received their food and gone back to their room to feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah grinned and started to dig in happily. \"Yummy! So tasty!\", she purred as she ate a burger. Rachael picked up a burger and held it to her lips. She sniffed it, then slowly took a bite out of it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah took this opportunity to push it into Rachael's mouth. Rachael's eyes widened as her mouth suddenly became filled with burger, her expression softening as she chewed it. \"Mmmm... So good...\", she purred through a mouthful of meat and cheese as she enjoyed her first burger ever. \"I want more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then dig in!\", Sarah cheered, offering her sister a big slice of pizza, then digging in herself. The black kitty swallowed the burger and began eating the pizza, finding its flavour just as heavenly. She washed her food down with a nice large root beer, her purring growing louder as she continued stuffing her face with the greasy treats in front of her. Sarah purred and murred as she ate her pizza. \"Cheese!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, the two hungry kittens have finished their meal, their bellies packed tight and slightly rounded. Rachael belched and rubbed her gut. \"Man, we sure can pack it away...\", she giggled. \"Mmm... So yummy~\" Sarah patted her belly. \"How was it, Rach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better than I expected! We should do this again tomorrow!\", Rachael purred. She looked over at her sister, rubbing the white kitten's big tummy. \"You were right about this stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told ya!\", Sarah giggled, licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kittens ended up continuing this for several days. They would order up a large dinner of fast food, and bring it up to their rooms to feast on, much to the confusion of the other residents, especially Taffy. Rachael knew this would affect her figure, but she decided not to worry about it. She could probably work it off in a week or less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the 6th day, the sisters had grown quite plump. Thanks to the privacy of their room being the place they had chosen to eat in--and the fact that this day was rather warm--they currently sat in their underwear as they ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inevitable effects of Rachael\u2019s constant snacking were beginning to reflect on her usually athletic figure. Her once-toned thighs had started to soften, deepening around the creases of her underwear elastic. The raven-furred beauty\u2019s abs had given way to a hint of a belly, which was only made more prominent when she sat. Her chest had begun to flourish since her new diet had started. Not one to simply walk around bra-less, she had reluctantly put to use the bra that she received the previous Christmas from, unsurprisingly, Miles. While by no means obese yet, a delicate plushness had begun to cover her muscles. A week of inactivity, minimal movement, and stuffing her face with fast food had slowly but surely brought her weight up to nearly 200 pounds. Despite this rather dramatic gain, Rachael remained blissfully unaware of her changing body. Food was slowly becoming her world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah had gained far more weight than Rachael, weighing well over 200 pounds, and due to her shorter height, it showed clearly. Her breasts weighed heavily against her increasingly flabby midsection, the latter developing into her most dominant feature. Her poundage was unevenly distributed across her short frame. Like a melting scoop of ice cream, her belly began to spread its influence to and past her chest, allowing her swollen breasts to ooze over the top of her nightshirt. Sarah\u2019s perpetual binging left her butt fairly large, her panties showing just how fat she was actually getting as they became wedged between her rump's bloated cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooohh... Yummy! <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">\", Sarah purred happily, blushing. Rachael purred as she watched her sister gleefully pig out. \"Hey, sis... I hear there's an eating contest at the pizza place this weekend. Wanna enter with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!!\", Sarah cheered, \"Let's do it!\" Rachael smiled and gave Sarah's belly a soft pat. \"Thought you'd want to!\", she giggled. \"It's on Sunday--you might want to save your binging energy until then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got LOTS of energy! Bring it on!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was finally Sunday, and Rachael and Sarah have arrived at the pizza place to participate in the eating contest. Rach takes a moment to look around at the--mostly female, to her surprise--competition. \"They don't look like they can handle it... I know either you or I can win this one, Sarah.\" Sarah raises her fist with a grin on her face and cheers. \"We shall win and eat yummy foods!\" She then tilts her head. \"What's the prize?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA very plump vixen walks up to her, smiling warmly. It seems this woman is the manager. \"The grand prize is a cheque for $10,000, young lady!\" Rachael's grin widens as she hears this. \"$10,000? Mora's gonna be thrilled if we win!\" Sarah's eyes grew wide when she heard the prize. \"W-We gotta win!! Let's do it, Rach!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe manager giggles and begins assembling the contestants, seating them at a long row of tables as a small audience forms. \"The rules are quite simple--the last person to drop out of the contest for any reason wins! Until then, stuff yourself like crazy!\" Sarah licks her lips. \"I'm SO gonna win this! Just watch me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe manager signals for the contestants to start eating, each one of them digging into the pizzas placed in front of them. Rachael eats like the world might end if she doesn't wolf it down fast enough. \"Mmm... Delicious... No way I'm dropping out...\" Sarah eats her pizzas like she hasn't eaten in forever, getting grease and cheese all over herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 minutes in, they were still going. After 10 minutes, 17 of the 20 contestants remained. Rachael laughs to herself. Those three who left were so very weak. But not her--she was going to win this one... Sarah eyes the other contestants with a sly grin as she devours her delicious pizzas. \"Hehe... I've so got this...\", she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n15 minutes in, and two more contestants had left... 20, and another was gone... And Rachael still kept going... Upon swallowing her umpteenth mouthful of pizza, however, Rachael realized that something was wrong. Her endurance began to weaken as her belly encroached upon its limits. As she packed herself tighter and tighter, it began to take on a more spherical shape. Her developing rolls were stretched and obscured by her growing gut. The desire to eat was beginning to disappear as her progress through each pizza slowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah let out a loud burp and rubbed her now larger belly in delight for a moment before digging back in. Rachael fought to continue, not wanting to lose in front of Sarah. Before long, the pizzas were gone, only Sarah, herself, and 10 others remaining in the contest as the manager called for an intermission. \"Mmm...so good! I want more! More, I say!!\", Sarah shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've all done well! But now it's time for something else entirely!\", the manager announces. \"Each of you must finish off an entire novelty-size slush drink!\" Rachael groaned at the thought of it, feeling a bit sick, but she tried to remain strong anyway. Sarah drooled, her eyes widening again. \"Mine!\" She grabs hers and starts gulping it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael reluctantly picks hers up and starts drinking it. Rachael felt her belly quickly becoming much colder as she gulped down the 2-foot-tall icy drink. By the time she finished the drink about three or four minutes later, Rachael\u2019s great sphere of a belly hung over the edge of her tight panties and spilled into her lap. Her skirt had unzipped, loosely hanging around her thighs. Moving the cold container off of her swollen tummy, she groaned as she slumped over and hugged her aching belly. \"Oooh... I\u2019m gonna burst...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah purred and shivered as she finished hers. \"Ooooo... Pizza now, please?\" The manager looked around at the remaining contestants--Rachael, Sarah, and only 5 others. She giggled as she noticed how big they had all gotten. \"Yes, little one--each of you must now eat one massive pizza!\" Each contestant is given an absurdly large pizza, and the manager signals for them to continue eating. Sarah's eyes grew big again and she began to drool before starting to devour her huge pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael manages to continue only by reminding herself that this is the final round. Her confidence grows as she watches two more contestants quit, and as she watches Sarah gleefully pig out despite her massively bloated tummy. \"I...can...do this... I know..I can...\" Sarah pays no mind to the other contestants as she eats and gets bigger and rounder. \"Yummy... Hey, Rach, if you dont finish, can I have yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael watches one more contestant leave. She and Sarah are the only ones left now. With one last groan of effort, she manages to stuff the last two pieces into her mouth, slowly chewing and swallowing them, just as Sarah finishes her own. \"Wooo! Did I win? Did I?\", Sarah cheers, looking around curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe manager holds up both kittens' arms and cheers, \"We have two winners, ladies and gentlemen!\" The audience loudly applauds as Rachael and Sarah stand up, both a little wobbly, and accept their cheque. \"W-We won! We really won!\", Rachael purrs, rubbing her painfully stuffed belly. \"YAY!! WE WON!!\" Sarah hugs Rachael tightly and purrs. \"WE DID IT~!!\" Rachael belches and hugs Sarah, their tummies pressing together. \"Let's go home and show everyone...\", she giggles, waddling out the door with Sarah, trying to get used to her large gut for now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The kittens soon returned to the farm, Rachael silently hoping the long walk had helped her shed a little weight. \"We're home!\", she called as she and Sarah entered the living room. Sarah cheered as she entered the room. \"And we have good news!\" Taffy, who was in the kitchen, came out and tilted her head at the kittens curiously. \"Welcome home. What's this good news, dears?\" Rachael showed her the cheque. \"We won $10,000 in an eating contest!\", she giggled, rubbing her full belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaffy's eyes widened in surprise and Sarah cheered again and jumped. \"Yeah! We ate good food and got good money!\" Taffy blinked several times. \"W-W-Wow! This is great! I'll go get Mora!\" Taffy smiles with a nod and leaves to call Mora. Rachael grins, sitting down and letting out a nice belch. \"Looks like Helium Hooters is gonna have to respect us alot more now, eh, Sarah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! She better after bringing her all this cash!\" Sarah grinned and burped loudly. After a moment, Taffy returned with Mora, who jumped back in shock upon seeing Rachael and Sarah. \"What the hell happened to you? You look like you swallowed beachballs!\", she exclaimed. \"Y-Yeah, they do... But they brought home a cheque worth $10,000, Mora!\", Taffy exclaimed and pointed at the check. \"It was pizzas, Big-Boobs!\" Sarah stuck her tongue out at Mora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMora fumed for a second at Sarah's comment, but suddenly grabbed the cheque and stared at it. \"$10,000?! Rachael, Sarah, I never thought I'd say this, but you've really helped me out!\" Rachael glared at her. \"Never thought you'd say it? Real nice, Turbo Tits! I mean, I only do your damn accounting every day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Now, let's all calm down... How about I make dinner...or are you two not hungry?\", Taffy asked with a nervous smile on her face. \"Yay! Food!\" Sarah licked her lips. Rachael opened her mouth to speak, blushing as her belly growled. \"I'll have something too.\" She noticed Randal entering the room next, and wondered how he might react...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandal froze and stared at the kittens with wide eyes, a faint blush on his face. \"Well... Hello, kittens... You look...bigger today.\", he chuckles, smiling at Taffy. \"What are you feeding these girls? I want some as well.\" Taffy drooped her ears back. \"Just the normal food!\" Rachael's blush grew a bit deeper. \"We entered a pizza-eating contest...\", she chuckled nervously, rubbing her swollen tummy. \"Well, I see that now, how did that...go...?\" Randal pasued when he saw the cheque, and clapped his hands. \"Bravo, girls!\" Sarah giggled and rubbed her belly. \"I did better though!\" By now, Miles has seen them as well, a look of slight disgust on his face as he stared at them. Rachael scowled at him. \"Okay, what the fuck is your problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I dunno... You've suddenly traded in your hot bodies for fatass ones?\", he replied bluntly. Randal placed a hand over Miles' mouth and shook his head. \"No need to be rude, Miles. It's their bodies and they can do as they please.\" Miles pushed the puppy away. \"Whatever...\", he muttered as he walked away, frowning. Rachael began cursing under her breath at him, hating him even more, if that were possible. Minos came in next to see what the commotion was about, stopping in his tracks as he saw Rachael. \"Rachael...?\" Mora nodded. \"That's her, alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandal and Taffy nodded in agreement. \"Mhmm! It's us, Mr. Robot!\", Sarah giggled, waving. Mora noticed Minos staring at Rachael, who was now blushing heavily, and directed his attention to the cheque. \"They ruined their figures all to help us out! Isn't that nice of them?\", she giggled. \"Ruined is a bad word to use when you say it like that Mora... They just...made a little sacrifice to help us is all...\", Randal pointed out, his ears drooping. Minos glanced at the cheque, nodding and turning his attention back to Rachael. \"Congratulations.\", he said to the kittens, a small smile on his face. \"Th-Thanks, Minos...\", Rach purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaffy sighs in relief then heads to the kitchen. \"I'll get started on dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael and Sarah found it very difficult to quit their new eating habits during the days that followed the day of the contest. The plump kittens continued to eat junk food at every meal, slowly becoming much softer, wider and heavier. The others kept showing the same reactions and emotions as before--some shocked, some concerned, some amused, Miles disgusted. Three days would soon pass since the contest, Rachael and Sarah currently sharing another fast food dinner in their pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah purred as she ate and jiggled. \"Yummy yum yummy~! We're getting big, Sis!\", Sarah laughed. Rachael giggled, her mouth full of pizza. \"Damn right we are!\", she purred, rubbing her gut. \"And I think I'm gonna stay this way--Minos has been paying way more attention to me lately!\" She took a moment to gleefully examine her figure. Her soft cotton panties have begun to stretch thin over her widening rear, growing tighter with each passing day like too little butter on a dinner roll. She's very bottom-heavy, a pear figure. A set of gracious love handles rest atop extra-wide hips. Deepening cleavage runs down the opening of her pajama top. Since the day of the contest, her appetite had increased dramatically. Larger and larger servings had become required to satisfy what\u2019s become an insatiable hunger. From the time her feet hit the floor in the morning to when she crawled into bed, she constantly ate. Every sugary, salty or greasy treat that passed her lips undid years of hard discipline and self-denial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, and Randal has too! They're both so nice to us, Sis! We should ask them to be butlers!\", Sarah suggested and burped. \"So we don't have to get up!\" The young white kitten had gotten quite the impressive figure herself. Her breasts were her largest feature so far, as if to contrast her sister's rear. They could be easily compared to a pair of massive marshmallows. Her belly was quickly catching up, round and fluffy like a huge pillow. Her butt was starting to split the seams of her pajama pants, each beautiful cheek like a soft mound of jello, gently jiggling with each movement the cat made. Sarah was very happy with her new body, and secretly wanted it to grow much fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think we should aim for immobility?\", the black kitten chuckles. \"Well, if you want to, go ahead, but I'm not so sure I'd want to.\" With an audible slosh, Rachael realigns herself on the bed. Her belly is no longer as large as it was at the end of the contest, but it is slowly returning to that size. It's still full with the numerous helpings consumed during her meals. Sarah rubbed her head. \"Well, I never said I wanted to do it for a long time, just a little bit, y'know?\" Rachael nods, rubbing Sarah's tummy. \"Okay, maybe for a little while.\", she replies with a warm smile. \"I'm sure Randal will be happy to serve you--I think he's hot for you.\", she adds, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah blushed softly and giggled. \"Oh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, have you seen the way he blushes when you're near him?\", she adds, \"And have you noticed he's been acting a bit more nervous when talking to you?\" Sarah shyly shook her head. Rachael giggles again and lays down, rubbing her stuffed belly. \"Mmmm... I'm so full...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So am I...\", Sarah yawns, closing her eyes a bit. \"Mmmm... Cat nap time?\" Rachael nods and closes her eyes. \"Cat nap time...\", she replies with a yawn. Sarah purred and layed down, her body jiggling slighty as she drifted off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

A scent of candy. That candy smell that smells...candy-y................................................................ . \"Your tummy's growlin', sis!\" spouted an excited Sarah suddenly. Blushing heavily, Rachael put her hands on her stomach. \"N-no it's not....\" <i>.......Rrrruuuurrrrrr...rrrghh...</i> \"Okay, I'm pretty much starving,\" she sighed, whilst Sarah giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they reached their destination: the big snack shop on centre street. \"Here we go~\" giggled Sarah, and the two walked in...Rachael went wide eyed. Inside the store was every treat she could imagine, and many more she couldn't. People on the other side of the sore looked around confusedly as Rachael's stomach rumbled louder than ever, making her blush a bright red. \"Hehehe, silly Rach...well, go crazy, eat and eat til your tummy is ready to pop!\" Rachael nodded, and began digging into whatever treats were closest. She decided to attempt one of everything to see what she liked best. \"Mmn, so good!\" she grinned before downing another mouthful of candy. \"Mff, rfmf grrff!\" replied Sarah, who didn't bother to stop eating when talking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rachael finished trying out all of the flavours, she let out a small burp. Looking down, she put a hand onto her stomach. She was quite full...rather stuffed, actually, her toned stomach just starting to push out. But the candy, pastries, and the like were all just too good to pass up. \"Gotta keep going...\" Sarah was still eating, her flat tummy had bulged out more than Rachael's, as she ate faster. Rachael preemptively downed a few antacids, and continued to gorge herself. After a few minutes, she groaned, reaching down, and unbuttoned her pants. Her once trim stomach, which was muffin-topping moments before, bloated out to the size of a 6 month pregnant gut, giving a loud, sloshy gurgle. Rachael was too busy sighing with relief from the release of the pressure to be embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on, the two stumbled out of the shop, both cats looking like their were ready to deliver a litter of 3. Their overstuffed bellies sloshed and gurgled as they waddled down the street. \"That was good, Sarah...hic...I can't believe we ate so much...<i>ORRRRRAAARRRP!!</i>\" Sarah giggled, letting out own \"<i>Eeeerrpp~!{/i]</i></span></div></div>",

I wanna make sure all of them are good, Rach! You can work it off anyway~\" Sarah giggled and Rachael blushed a bright red as her trim stomach let out a low <i>Grrrgrgrgrgrrrr...</i> \"Alright then....uhhh...which should I try first?\" Thinking to herself for a moment, Sarah said \"Try the cookies~ :3 Just take whatever's closest after that.\" Shrugging, Rachael picked up a cookie, which wanted to melt between her fingers since it was just out of the oven, and took a fair sized bite out of it. Quickly, her eyes lit up, and the devoured the rest of the cookie. \"That was GOOD, Sarah, how'd you learn so quickly?!\" she said excitedly, and began cramming more cookies down. \"Oh, you know, practice, and Taffy helps too...eat all you want~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael kept on eating and eating, trying all sorts of foods that Sarah had baked. After about 10 minutes, she had finished most of he plate, and lied back, sighing contently. Her shirt was rolled up, showing her slightly bloated stomach. \"Rachael?\" poked Sarah. Letting out a small burp, Rachael asked what was up. \"There's still a few more treats you haven't tasted...\" Rachael hiccuped a bit. \"Oof, I'm stuffed Sarah, I couldn't...\" Sarah's ears started to droop a bit as she started to refuse. \"Um...but...ah...but I still have a <i>erp!</i> bit more room...\" Sarah lit right back up, and began offering more of her treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 15 minutes, the last crumbs of the plate had been cleared. \"Did you like it, Rach?\" she asked happily.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Not too long in the future of the Las Lindas ranch a certain black cat had finally gotten her dream and hooked up with the literal beefcake of her desires. It had finally happened one day after what felt like an entire day at the gym.  Minos had stopped his on and off affair with Mora after another long and loud argument between the two , Rachael herself felt it would be much too soon to swoop in for the rebound and so kept her own feelings reserved and let Minos work things out on his own. But it was so HARD especially while watching him over 500lbs.  Shirtless! It was enough to send her tail a-twitching, (and also causing her to lose touch of her pushup reps.) Redoubling her efforts she began her set again when suddenly two large hand slowly crept up her lithe sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRachael...\u201d  Minos gruffly said, still not able to express his emotions fully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMinos?\u201d  Rachael said letting the massive mound of muscles pull her up as if she were nothing. She brought her own hand drop down to his dumbbell plate sized pectorals, and pawed at one of his erect nipples. Without another word the kissed and from there it seemed like a blur of clothes and sweat. Now literally face to face Rachael lay nude on top of him as he worked his powerful digits over her svelte black body.  But for some reason, Rachael could only feel that the bull may still be holding something back\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMinos is something wrong?\u201d she couldn\u2019t help but ask as she dived down for another kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u201d said Minos bashfully diverting his gaze. \u201cIt\u2019s just I\u2019m just trying to be gentle.\u201d  Said the crest of power fully aware of his full power and the responsibility he had to control it.  \u201cWhat! I\u2019m the strongest girl on the ranch!\u201d Rachael stated confident in her own sexuality and power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo that\u2019s not it at all Rachael\u2026I just\u2026 your so\u2026\u201d he couldn\u2019t exactly explain being the crest of power (not exactly understanding his hazy past himself).  He searched for the right word to describe what he saw in Rachael, the inner sophistication that lied beneath her cold exterior, her refinedness\u2026what was the more modern word for it? \u201cDainty?\u201d He tried hoping the word summed up his emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDainty?!\u201d This unintended insult was enough to twinge Rachael\u2019s perfect day. She\u2019d known for a long time that most men were only looking for two things on a girl, ass and tits, not her smarts or her interests. But Minos she had hoped would have been different! Sure Ms. flabby cow might have a good 50lbs on Rachael, but Rachael would never consider her own self dainty. Why, that corn fed cow was probably more fat than muscle when it came down to it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Rachael thought inwardly, standing up on the spot. \u201cIf Minos thinks I\u2019m dainty, maybe I could do so some bulking up\u2026\u201d And with that she dedicated herself on her new affections aspirations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Rachael began resolutely on her plan. Yes, there was plenty of food on the farm that could go towards filling out her frame, bur Rachael wanted results now! That thought in mind she\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Seeing that made Taffy feel guilty about rejecting Rachael for what she wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, when Mora wasn't around the house, Taffy was the mother figure to Rachael &amp; her little sis, Sarah, seeing as how the two feline siblings were orphans and had no place to call their own.

First there had been the incident with Mora, and her breaking her leg jumping into the well. Rachael wouldn't admit it, but she was depressed after that, badly, her ego taking a near fatal hit. Her attitude only drove people away, making her all the more blue. With no one to comfort her, the only thing that could lift Rachael's mood was a plateful of chocolate chip cookies or a pint of ice cream. Then the cast had come off, Rachael tried to get back into exercising....and found her body flabby and way out of shape. Rachael nearly cracked. Her training equipment began to gather dust as she sat in her room with a tub of ice cream, a spoon, and one ton of self-loathing. It was a vicious process, her weight driving her depression driving her to eat, driving her weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, of all people, Taffy reached out to Rachael with what she needed - a mother figure. Taffy forced Rachael out of bed like the grumpy teen she really was, gave Rachael things to do with herself now that she had so much free time not exercising. Mostly kitchen tasks, and Rachael had slowly learned to cook. Unfortunately, Taffy didn't care for Rachael's weight, which only steadily grew under the bunny's care. But Rachael, in a way, stopped caring. If Taffy found her upset, she'd only fuss until Rachael felt like apologizing for being upset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachael, time to get up.\" Taffy said, tossing Rachael's covers off her bed. Rachael groaned. A small mountain of kitten lay on the bed. Rachael had become obese by now. A lot of it went to her belly, which had grown steadily and smoothly, causing it to become a smooth apron of fat that just billowed out from her, covering her thighs even when she was laid back. Her sides reach beyond the edges of the bed on both sides, great jelly rolls of black fur. Rachael looked like she was sleeping on a hillside, as a great bubbly ass propped up her lower half. That made Rachael's tits slide chinwards. She was destined to be small up top, but compared to her monster ass DD was still small. Rachael's cleavage peaked out of the neck hole of a badly stretched night shirt. Taffy sighed, not at Rachael's obesity, but at her reluctance to remove herself from her funk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on dear, wake up.\" she said sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did Rachael respond?</span></div></div>",

The two of them had slowly become used to Rachael's ballooning weight, and Taffy was so adamant to help Rachael out that she had gotten accustomed to helping Rachael with numerous small tasks. it took both of them to heave Rachael on to her feet. Her obese body jiggled about, barely contained by her badly over-stretched pajamas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want my help getting dressed, dear?\" Taffy asked tentatively. She wasn't oblivious to Rachael's body, she just didn't care about her weight, and so she had noticed the struggle Rachael tended to have with various tasks that a month ago hadn't given her pause. She had asked almost daily this question for the last week, as she found Rachael taking longer and longer to get dressed and looking increasingly winded by the time she managed. This time, instead of rejecting the request out of hand like she had been, Rachael paused and considered. She looked blue, the scraps of her old pride trying to stop her from asking for help on such a supposedly simple, and intimate task. Still, Rachael turned to Taffy meekly, looking defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe a little...\" she said, tail down. Taffy just gave her a comforting smile, and as she walked past Rachael to the closet she laid a hand on Rachael's shoulder. Rachael's tail twitched up at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go, darling.\" Taffy said, having picked out an outfit for Rachael. She kept meaning to get the kitten proper clothes, but there never seemed to be the time. So Rachael didn't exactly have anything that fit. At least bras they had had to spare. Taffy stood behind Taffy and began to tug up her shirt. Rachael did her best to raise her meaty arms over her head, an arduous task given that each one was covered in a thick layer of blubber that made her forearms thicker than any other woman's thighs. Rachael's furry breasts flopped down on to her belly shelf, making the blobby kitten blush profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my, you'll be outgrowing my bras soon!\" Taffy said, helping Rachael in to just one of those. \"I'm almost jealous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you're not...\" Rachael said, blue again, \"No one's jealous of me....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachael.\" Taffy said, her tone going from sweet to assertive in a snap. \"You have a lot to be thankful for. And you are a beautiful girl. I mean that, I wouldn't just say that.\" Taffy moved in and wrapped her arms around Rachael - well, she tried. She just gripped the sides of Rachael's massive belly and hugged Rachael tight from behind. She couldn't see Rachael go red, burning straight through her fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Taffy? I'm thankful for you...\" Rachael mumbled. Taffy tried to keep a giggle to herself. Sure, Rachael had lost her spunk, and ultimately Taffy was working to get that back, to get her to her old self. But honestly, quieter Rachael wasn't all bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on hun, let's get you dressed.\" she whispered, letting go of Rachael and bending down to get to Rachael's shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael was soon waddling through the halls of the ranch in a terribly too small ensemble. A giant green shirt like the kind she had often sported in her skinnier years now barely served to cover her boobs, ending somewhere around the first big roll of her giant belly apron, which wobbled free for everyone to see, big sunken belly button at crotch level. Rachael took up the entire hall, or so much of it that only the thinnest could squeeze by, mostly thanks to her huge hips and giant bubbly ass, one that was always peeking out of the top of her stretchy black sweatpants. With her hips as wide as they were, it was no wonder she had such monstrous thighs that lifting them was a bit of a challenge, and Rachael's walking speed was easily half what it once was as she shuffled along. She was still mobile, by all accounts, she just sure couldn't get anywhere in a rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get you a proper breakfast to start the day, shall we hun?\" Taffy asked sweetly, entering the kitchen after Rachael. Something possessed her to pat Rachael's belly as she walked past, but she didn't turn to see Rachael blush. Or see the way Rachael's tail twitched excitedly, the kitten forgetting to guard her emotions for a moment. While Taffy wasn't aware, the fact of the mater was that Rachael....</span></div></div>",

However, it wasn't just that feeling of being loved by someone such as Taffy. There was also this feeling of romance toward the lapine woman, as the corpulent black cat that was Rachael continued to blush, having this timid but squeamish look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she waddled and sat herself on two chairs (due to the embarrassment that involved fitting in one chair without her bulk threatening to fracture the seat into pieces), Rachael  could not help but stare at Taffy, who was making the rotund feline's almost excessive breakfast, as she served it to Rachael and said, \"Here you go, Rachael. Enjoy!\" What Taffy served to Rachael was large stack of thick waffles, homemade of course and larger than most pancakes. It was lathered in a copious amount of syrup, snowed under with powdered sugar, and buried with chocolate-covered strawberries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Taffy would take in consideration over everyone's diet, but she enjoyed having Rachael as an excuse to practice making more delectable dishes and pastries. As a result, this caused Rachael to develop quite the sweet tooth, relishing the kinds of desserts that the lapine woman would create and being able to taste some of them, despite Taffy being unaware of Rachael's crush on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Taffy began to notice that Rachael wasn't touching her food, causing the pink-haired rabbit to approach the obese feline an asked, \"What's the matter, Rachael? What's wrong, how come you're not eating?\" Due to her newly submissive personality, Rachael simply turned her fat head away from Taffy, not uttering a single word, shy from speaking up toward her crush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about how to solve this problem, Taffy looked toward Rachael, speaking to her with a gentle motherly tone, and  asked, \"Do.....do you want me to feed you? Is that it?\" Hearing what Taffy had just said, Rachael was caught by surprise, blushing profusely, unable to think straight a little from what her crush had just said.

Clearly, she realized, the young girl was having a much rougher morning than she'd thought, and with matronly grace she leaned across the table and plucked up the girl's set of utensils; cutting a slice of the delectable waffle before her, while making sure it had an even coating of syrup, sugar, and a nice piece of strawberry to top it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black cat was lost in thought momentary, weighing in on the absurd question asked of her. Being fed? Like a little kid? By the woman she's had a growing crush on? As the gears in her mind slowly attempted to churn all this, she could barely hear what amounted to the effect of a saccharine sweet \"Open wide, dear~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael's eyes bugged out as a piece of warm, buttery confection was firmly, but with a sense of care, prodded into her mouth. The pink haired girl's delicious home-cooking causing the portly feline's tail to twitch. \"O- oh\", she gently puffed, shocked at just what occurred. \"Taffy I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could eek out whatever was coming to her mind, another slice of the warm syrupy dish was guided into her mouth by the young but motherly bunny-girl. \"You've got to eat to keep your energy up, we don't want you to go hungry, do we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBite after bite, nibble after nibble, the home-cooked breakfast feast made its way into the black-furred kitten's mouth, whether she asked of it to or not, as the lapine's calm words and gentle pushing made Rachael weaker in the knees than she ever could think. She'd almost feel humiliated if it wasn't for the constantly assuring smile on the face of the woman before her. Plus her soft belly did enjoy the scrumptious dish that was being directly delivered to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the meal finished up Rachael sat there with a slightly glazed looked in her eyes, hands gently sitting in her lap. She made no effort to stop the woman before her as she dabbled a bit of syrup away from her mouth with a napkin. \"Did you like that, sweetie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-\" Rachael paused one more time, her face beet red from blushing. \"Thank you, Taffy\"</span></div></div>",

You simply had a very full tummy.

Here she was sitting in a frilly bib with her crush looming at her side; the same soft smile that's been consistently on her face for the past few days as she seemingly more and more took charge of habits the black-furred feline would find inconsequential just a few months back. Right now the taller bunny woman was feeding Rachael gentle forkfuls of a homemade cake that she cooked as a reward for her being \"such a good girl\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a \"good girl\" made Rachael feel happy in the oddest sense, but this whole experience had been leaving her in a whirlwind of emotions. Taffy had been there every step of the way to help her during her extended bout of depression, and much of her agency had been freely given away as a result of sheer lack of caring and bitter self loathing, but these past few turns had been peculiar to say the least. She loved that her crush had been directing her eyes more and more towards her, and it would be a lie to say that she's hated the treatment she'd been given in the last few days, but what kind of relationship could come about if she allowed this to continue? What would the next few steps entail? A sense of worried foreboding sank into the obese cat's mind as her body reacted slightly differently; her tail twitching with a tingly sense of electricity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, Taffy?\", Rachael asked in-between bites of the sweet confection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, hun?\" The pink haired Lapine responded, her fork hovering a few inches away from its intended target, the feeding momentarily stopped to look her kitten in the eye; spare hand gently rubbing the girl's soft belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now or never, the puffy feline figured. Later she would come to question if maybe she could have somehow set this up a whole lot better, but it didn't matter at the moment. Right now she was mustering up a sense of backbone that she hadn't felt in ages. Her face turned up toward her would-be love, eyes shut and with a scarlet red blush that could be seen from acres away, and said \"I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she could get more than a word out, a particularly large bite of cake was poked into her mouth. \"wuv... oyu...\", the delectable taste of the dessert distracting the sweet-toothed girl, as her eyes opened half glazed, her mind reeling from a mixture of her confession, and frosting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaffy giggled as she looked at the little kitten before her. During all this, her bib had only managing to defend against some of the meal that was smudged around her face. She was such a silly thing. \"Aww, I love you too, sweetie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Rachael could compose herself, she was taken aback even further, as the motherly bunny leaned forward to lightly kiss the girl on the forehead; afterward using a napkin to gently clean off the sweet coating covering her charge's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now be a good girl and eat up!\" The lapine woman's smile right then grew wider than Rachael had ever seen it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid kitten though could only let out a light moan.</span></div></div>",

Rachael sat, her big soft tummy digesting the sweet treat it had just received, while its owner's face did its best to not stare at the matronly bunny before her, her features growing flustered for a quick second when they both crossed eyes. To Taffy though, there was something else of interest on the girl's person. Her bib still securely laced around her burgeoning chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm A Big Fat Kitty\u201d, Taffy mentally mused, a smile starting to show on her face. The fact that the girl accepted it without a hint of resistance simply proved she needed her help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her sweet demeanor, the womanly lapine wasn't ignorant. She knew that Rachael was regressing, but really, was that so bad? Her mind wandered to a scene from a while back, where she consoled Sarah, Rachael's sweet younger sister, after the incident with Digit at the well. Sarah's striking words of wanting Taffy to be their new \u201cMommy\u201d had really started to hit home in recent times. These two kittens had been without a real family for so long, it was obvious they needed someone to step forward and nurture them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was simple. Mostly. Her saccharine outlook on life and childlike attitude, as well as her outright seeking a mother-like figure in Taffy, allowed the older woman to gently guide the bubbly blonde with a much lighter touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael on the other hand was a much more hands on project. The black-furred kitten had several issues to overcome. The girl's crippling depression had shattered her once confident personality, and Taffy was determined to build her back up again. Though maybe gentler, softer, and from the looks of things, certainly rounder. The bunny reasoned that maybe given her kitty's current disposition, it wouldn't be a terrible idea to start right at the beginning, and give Rachael the tender care she so desperately needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus it was fun, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light blush appeared on her face as she finished drying her last plate. She had to admit, she found this oddly enjoyable. It was kind of like role playing. Sure, it wasn't the high octane fantasy adventures she was used to, but there was some distinct allure to her playing the mother to her \u201cBig Fat Kitty\u201d. That's where the idea for the bib came from. She sewed it up one night on a whim, her heart lightly pounding as she looked at the final product. She was left conflicted on if she was going too far, but when her rotund ward accepted it without a second thought, Taffy knew she was on the right path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then\u201d, Taffy sweetly sang, her fluffy tail wiggling as she leaned herself into the refrigerator. \u201cHow about we wash that yummy cake down with a nice drink?\u201d The young gray-furred rabbit turned towards her charge, a smile in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her hand was an ice cold baby bottle filled to the brim with milk.</span></div></div>",

After all, Taffy distinctly recognize if it was Sarah, since she is known to call the lapine woman \"Mom\" or \"Mommy\" due to seeing Taffy as a maternal figure. Quickly trying to come up with what to say, Taffy tried her best to mask her surprise a little under a gentle, motherly demeanor, approaching the pajama-wearing Sarah, gently scratching her blonde hair and replied, \"Aww good morning, Sarah! Did you have a good night's rest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did, but um.....What's going on here? And what are you doing with 'Rach?\" Sarah confusingly asked, calling her blubbery older sister by such a nickname.

Some may find what was going on to be peculiar, but Taffy knew she was doing what was best for her kitties, and she intended to follow through. \"Well hun, you see, your sister and I are playing a little game right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A game, Mom?\", the naive young girl asked, her snow white features still marked with confusion, but also a bit of wonderment. The moniker for Taffy slipped out as if it was completely natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaffy, smile never once leaving her, bent down a bit to pet her \"daughter's\" head. \"That's right, dear, a game. Your sister has been real stressed out lately, as I'm sure you noticed. So I thought we'd have some fun and play.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike your role playing games?\u201d Sarah shot in, currently enjoying the gentle caress of her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight again sweetie, but this game isn't like one of those stressful fantasy adventures, it's more like a game of house. I'm role playing the mommy, and Rachael's role playing the baby.\u201d Taffy wondered for a moment if that wasn't a bit too on the nose, even for Sarah. What she was saying wasn't exactly a lie, but it wasn't the whole truth either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah processed these words slowly. Her sister had gone through a lot of changes these past few months, but a lot of them she actually found kinda fun. Rachael was a whole lot less bossy now, and her big squishy tummy was nice to cuddle up next to, even if the black-furred girl got real embarrassed because of it. But now Rachael's a baby? Sarah thought she was the only one between them who jumped at Taffy being their mom, but boy, it sure seemed she was wrong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis though did make her curious.

And Rachael's a baby. So, um.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResponding to what the blonde feline had said, Taffy wrapped her arms around Sarah, reassuring her when she replied, \"Aww, it's okay, kitty!

Though, I won't mind if you do choose to wear them.\" During the loving embrace, Sarah took into account of what her \"Mom\" had explained to her, which made her think about what she was going to do while she was roleplaying with her rotund older sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after Taffy let go of the maternal embrace, Sarah made up her decision, which came in the form of....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah snuggled deeper into the hug with her mother, a light purring emitting from the back of her throat. This was what she wanted more than anything, and if getting more of it meant wearing a big, soft, puffy cloud between her legs, then the snow white kitty knew her answer. \u201cOkay Mama, I wanna wear em'.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaffy chuckled lightly. \u201cYou're so cute sweetheart,\u201d she said, as she gently loosened her embrace. \u201cYou and your sister are going to have lots of fun, I promise! Though I think if we want to do this right, we're going to need to get some supplies...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXxXxX<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack over in the kitchen, Rachael still sat. Her caretaker hadn't \u201cexcused\u201d her yet, and she didn't want to be a bad girl. So all she could do was contemplate things, as Taffy and Sarah were too far out of eye and earshot to make out what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis whole situation was a jumbled up mess. First she stumbled at her confession, then Taffy brought out that baby bottle, and then worst of all, Sarah came in to see it! Thankfully Taffy took hold of the whole matter, but still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo top it all off though, she still hadn't had her milk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting at the edge of the table, just out of reach, the dairy ambrosia tempted the pudgy kitten who was still licking her lips from the generous meal she was just served. I mean sure, it was in that bottle, but the more she thought about it, the less it bothered her. In fact, she reasoned that lots of people drank from bottles. Bottles of water, bottles of juice, bottles of soda, bottles of anything in-between. What's a bottle a milk? Okay maybe this one was a little different- it had a nice safety cap on it to prevent anything from spilling, plus it had that rubber bit on the top that made drinking from it more fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally, the more she thought, the more she realized that Taffy was being incredibly considerate by preparing one for her. It was just too bad that her sister distracted her, but hopefully her patience would-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bottle of milk was popped into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHiya sis!\u201d Sarah said, her tone bubbly as ever, with her hand helping hold up the bottle that Rachael was being forced to gulp down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Sarah, be careful, you scared her!\u201d Taffy gave the young kitty a lightly stern gaze as she took Sarah's spot. She continued to bottle feed Rachael, but in a much gentler manner; one hand on the bottle, and the other stroking the corpulent girl's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael though was supremely embarrassed. In her daydreaming state (something that'd become increasingly more common with her), she hardly noticed the others enter the room, and now this was happening. A thousand questions were whirling in her head. What went on between those two? What did her sister know? Why was this milk so good?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's okay kitten, your little head has nothing to worry about. Your sister and I had a nice talk, and I cleared up any misunderstandings. In fact, I have some surprises in store for you two!\u201d Noticing her charge had drank the bottle clean, she gently guided it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-surprises?\u201d Rachael asked, catching her breath a bit. Thankfully the milk didn't choke her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's right hun, I'm going to be taking you two out shopping!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay!\u201d Sarah interjected, jumping in at the moment to giver her sister a big hug, her body squishing into the black-furred girl's big soft belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael could only look on wide eyed as the confusing and overwhelming situation developed before her.</span></div></div>",

That's a good girl!\u201d The praise of a young bunny woman filled the room as the last vestiges of a certain full-bodied feline's pajamas were removed. The expansive top of course neatly being placed in an adjacent hamper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, Taffy, why are we doing this again?\u201d Rachael squeaked out, a high pitched inflection added to the end of her sentence. The young girl was stripped down to her skivvies at the moment, and while this normally wouldn't be that embarrassing, as the two had shared many mornings at this point getting dressed and ready for the day, none of them involved her younger sister sitting in the room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause, dear, if we're going to get you new clothes,\u201d Taffy paused for a moment to take something from her pocket.\u201cwe're going to need to know what size you are!\u201d A smile was strewn across Taffy's face that was almost as wide as the soft and flexible measuring tape she had just pulled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on top of Rachael's bed, her legs playfully dangling over the edge, Sarah looked on towards the scene folding out in front of her. She'd hadn't really seen her sister like this in the while. It used to be when they were on the road traveling together, they had no qualms getting dressed in front of each other, but ever since Rachael started to get softer, she'd become a whole lot shyer too, so this was a new experience. She looked so squishy and cute! Sarah almost wished she could curl up sitting on her rather than the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a twinkle in Taffy's eye as the ran the tape across her frightful little kitten. First over her thick arms, once toned and muscled, were now soft and without definition; only capable of holding a fraction of the strength they once had. Then down her legs, so once used to travel and roaming, were now coated in a warm layer of blubber. The idea of walking even a mile now feeling like an arduous task. Third came the belly, the tape straining to properly wrap its way around the girl. It used to be that Rachael stuck to a strict diet, partially out of necessity, and partially out of pride in her physique, but that was far from the case any longer, with her round tummy by far being the most noticeable of the recent \u201cadditions\u201d her figure. Each of Taffy's delicious meals proudly showed their conquest over the girl's midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast but not least came the bust, the tape having a significantly easier time here. Rachael was never the most gifted girl in this area, but Taffy seemed to have been \u201ctutoring\u201d her well, with her breasts now reaching to compete on respectable levels with any one of Las Lindas' current residents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grayed-furred rabbit couldn't help but smile at this. Standing to the back of her, the young kitten still wrapped up in the web of her tape, she leaned in gently to her ear. \u201cMy my, I think someone's gotten bigger~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the door burst open. \u201cHey Taffy, are you in here? Where's breakfast?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in front of the trio, still dazed and half asleep, was the matriarch of the farm, Mora Linda.</span></div></div>",

We'll see how it goes.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was silent as as the buxom bovine stood in the doorway, looking slightly disheveled as she rubbed the sleep away from her eye. She was currently clad in a pair of blue polka dot PJs that clung tightly to her shapely figure. As she blinked her eyes clear though and appraised the situation, her features grew a tad haughty. \u201cOoh, did I interrupt something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaffy, loosening her hold on Rachael, turned to her employer and switched to her best poker face. \u201cOh, good morning Mora. I'm so sorry, breakfast just slipped my mind. I've been busy getting the kittens here ready to go out for a little clothes shopping.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Mora!\u201d Sarah waved, still lolling about on Rachael's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d the matriarch's attention drifted from the other two as her vision zeroed in on Rachael, striding on over to the girl. Mora had grown to have some rather deep seated issues with the night skied kitten ever since she tried to make a move on Minos behind her back, but she had eased off a bit after the feline broke her leg during the incident with Digit. Watching the girl grow under Taffy's care had been... fascinating. There was something exhilarating about seeing the transformation of the kitten before her, as the once hard edges of both her mind and body rounded into something soft, meek, and in certain ways, cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had allowed for a slump in Rachael's workload so her leg could heal, but let it continue even afterward for some admittedly selfish reasons. She wanted to see the extent at which things would go, and seeing the full figured body before her plain as day, she could could certainly see the way in which things had <i>grown</i>. Already caught in a compromising situation, and with her literal pants down, Rachael's rotund features were as red as a tomato, with her face staring like a deer  caught in the headlight at Mora, unable to say a word. All this ignited something in the bovine, as her towering form leaned in to her, her left hand cupping the girl's cheek. \u201cWell, I suppose clothes <i>are</i> essential,\u201d she remarked, the stray hand absently drawing tiny figure eights on her target's soft belly. \u201cLas Lindas needs its employees properly attired.\u201d Her tone had a slight sultriness to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaffy furrowed her brow, not entirely liking the intimacy being displayed, especially after having her fun interrupted by the person currently displaying it. \u201cWell, they are growing girls.\u201d Her tone though was slightly less saccharine than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMora finished one last circle on the girl and gave her a quick poke for good measure, eliciting an unintended \u201ceep\u201d from Rachael. Ignoring this, she turned to Taffy. \u201cYeah well, this is fine, but we've still got a couple of employees, myself included, who should be up and about soon, and they're going to need something to eat before getting to work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis annoyed Taffy even more, as she was hoping to sneak out before she could get bogged down with work. I mean it was the weekend, and while that didn't mean as much on the farm, she still felt she was warranted a bit of free time, but unfortunately, she realized, she might have gotten a little over-zealous with her game, and missed her chance. Just as she was about to admit defeat and tell the two girls that their trip might have to be held off for a bit, a voice squeaked out unexpectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, I can make breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Rachael. Her tone was sounding a bit shy, but there was a look of mild determination on her face that surprised the bunny in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweetie?\u201d Taffy inquired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI- I don't have to go to the mall,\u201d Her face turned down a bit. \u201cYou already have my measurements, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...\u201d Taffy pondered for a moment, imagining her hands gliding over Rachael's soft and toneless body. Measuring tape in hand, of course. \u201cEnough for now, I suppose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen you can just take Sarah out. I'll do your work! I promise!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaffy was hoping to make Rachael part of the fun as well, but if it meant actually going out now as opposed to not at all, this might be the best situation. There was just one thing nagging in her head that she needed to put on the table. \u201cAre you sure it's not because you're worried about what people will say? I want you to know Rachael that you're a very beautiful girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-\u201d Rachael stumbled, her nigh constant cherry blush growing ever so slightly redder. \u201c...Thank you Taffy. But that's not it! You always do so much for me, so- so I want to help out!\u201d Determination started to return to her. \u201cYou taught me how to cook, and to clean. I can do all that stuff. At least for a day. It's the least I can do!\u201d She then turned towards her bovine benefactor. \u201cUmm, if it's okay with you, Mora.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about this girl was enticing. So much different from how she used to be, but in a way Mora could <i>get </i>used to. Soft spoken, soft bodied, cute, and wanting to please. Far and away someone who could take away Minos. She'd been keeping a relative distance from the going ons between her and Taffy, but maybe she should get to know the new girl before her a bit more now. \u201cSure, we can give it a try. No harm, no foul.\u201d she said, starting to take her leave from the scene. It'd be interesting to see how Rachael would act without being under the influence of her omnipresent bunny guardian for a bit. \u201cI'll be down stairs. I hope my new cook is ready soon.\u201d She gave one quick pass over at Rachael. \u201cPants optional.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael gave an embarrassed mewl when she realized she was still dressed in her undies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaffy started to absently look through Rachael's drawers for some clothes for the kitten. While this might not have gone 100% as planned, she could still easily make something of this. A slight smile formed on her face at the thought of her big little kitty getting a surprise tonight when she saw her new wardrobe and \u201csupplies\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver off on the bed, a light snoring could be heard coming for a snow white kitten. Sarah, in all the hubbub, had fallen back into sleep. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eggs, bacon, pancakes, hash browns, diced up fruit, juice, and an assortment of other iconic breakfast classics were currently being neatly arranged on plates for the current hungry residents of the farm. Rachael had tried. She'd become somewhat nuanced when it came to food over the past few months, and she wanted to do her best. After Taffy and Sarah had left to go out, Rachael had entered the kitchen with something to prove. Her current attire was her now usual affair of tight fitting shorts and a top that only did a mild service to covering her belly, but a new addition was a frilly white apron Taffy occasionally wore when making meals. While it only did so much to add \u201cprotection\u201d to Rachael's form, she felt it better completed her ensemble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole cooking process went smoother than she initially expected, with Taffy's teachings seeming to rub off a bit on her. Though she wondered if she might have made a little too much. There were three of them, right? Mora, Miles, Minos, and okay, maybe some for herself. She'd already eaten a teensy bit earlier, but a little more couldn't hurt, right? Right. Of course she neglected to realize she cooked more to the portions she regularly now ate at, but a hearty breakfast did the body good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBreakfast is ready!\u201d Rachael spoke, her voice slightly louder than usual. As she walked out of the kitchen towards the adjacent dining room, tray of food in hand, she expected to see most of the inhabitants waiting for her to deliver, but instead, all she found was Mora Linda sitting alone at the front of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe curvy cowgirl was nonchalantly pursuing the Sunday paper at the moment, only casually taking a look towards the big kitty before her. \u201cOh hi Rach', yeah, sorry, the other two said they had some business to take care of, so they couldn't make it.\u201d That was partially true. Miles and Minos did have work on the farm that day, but Mora had requested (and in the case of Miles, bribed), that they go catch a meal elsewhere. The busty bovine wanted a little alone time with Rachael. \u201cConsider this a test run on your culinary skills.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, sure,\u201d Rachael gulped. The unfit feline was actually a little unsure, really. She'd done her best to avoid Mora as much as possible due to the bit of bad blood they'd had. This morning in her room though had almost fried her brain circuits. Mora just striding right up to her, so confident, so dominant, touching her and casually caressing her like it was nothing. It made her feel so weak. Unlike with Taffy, she knew there was an edge to this woman, and considering their past experiences, and the debt she already owed her, Rachael knew she was firmly seated at a rung lower on the ladder than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael placed a bountiful plate filled to the brim with scrumptious breakfast delicacies before her employer, with that just being one of several currently up for grabs. Mora, of course, raised a brow. \u201cGeez Rach', you make enough for everyone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big kitten shrank back a little. \u201cAh, hopefully? There's more if you're hungry...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, this is fine,\u201d the cowgirl grumbled, looking at the array before her. Nothing unusual to say the least, but it had an extra dash of skill and care taken into it that was not uncommon with most items made by a certain bunny woman. Shrugging, Mora took a big forkful of hash browns and bit into them. A surprise look of enjoyment forming on her face. \u201cCome on, sit down. Eat. I'm not gonna do it alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully sitting to the side of her employer, her bum having trouble fitting into the unfortunately tiny chair, Rachael did her best to try and eat with a bit more refinement than usual, something Mora though was certainly not doing. Pancakes, fried eggs, sips of orange juice, it was obvious Mora was enjoying herself. Taffy had been careful to design meals nutritiously balanced for most of the residents of Las Lindas, sans Rachael of course, but Rachael's portions were far more giving, which pleased the red haired matriarch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't uncommon for cowgirls to be a bit on the... bigger side of things. It was their nature! Mora though prided herself on her figure, and what little \u201cadditions\u201d seemed to comes, were curves that were in, to most people, all the right places. Still, she tried her best over the years to not indulge. With Taffy though taking over the cooking duties at the farm, a bit of a dam formed up around her as far as food went. Day after day she ate mouthwatering meals and delicacies, but they always left her wanting a bit more. Here though she had someone trained by Taffy, who had no qualms about limiting her portions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich, to sum it all up, meant Mora made a pig out of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n First she downed her plate, then what was supposed to be Miles', then, the biggest of the lot, the plate that was supposed to be Minos'. Afterward she requested some extras from the kitchen, which Rachael freely obliged. The portly kitten herself had finished her plate plus an extra, but she was shocked to see Mora just tear into things. Maybe she liked it? Hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all was said and done, Mora was leaning back in her chair, hand on her slightly bloated stomach, with a satisfied look on her face. \u201cYou know Rach', I think we might have gotten off on the wrong foot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black-furred kitten said nothing, but had her eyes locked to the woman beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe might have had some issues, but I think you're alright. You sure know your food, at least.\u201d Mora took the time to lean over and poke her lightly on the belly. \u201cI think we should consider this a fresh start maybe. You in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael beamed at this, happy that she was finally starting to mend some fences. \u201cYes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's a good girl,\u201d Mora remarked, patting her on the head. \u201cNow listen, since most everyone is off doing stuff, there are some things that I want you to help me personally with around the farm.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Rachael was just glad that the burned bridges between them were starting to mend, and as her subordinate, she did her best to help out by double checking the work, providing a gentle ear as Mora complained about her daily grind, and preparing snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite a few snacks, actually... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed breakfast hadn't quite sated the cow girl as much as one would have expected, as the pattering of a particular kitten's toes could be heard going to and fro from the kitchen, collecting little treats for her superior (and maybe some for herself...). A chunk of it was just casual junk food, like chips and cookies (along with a tasty helping of milk!), but sometimes Rachael would be required to make slightly more elaborate items, like grilled cheese, or a salad (she made sure not to forget the extra croutons and ranch!).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaffy had become rather controlling with regards to 'her' kitchen; it really had become one of her primary domains, and she always had a rather strict handle on what passed through the lips of Las Lindas' patrons, but with the matriarchal bunny currently out of the picture for the briefest of time, the actual matriarch allowed herself to indulge a bit more, egged on (mm, eggs...) by the fact that the girl she'd had a bit of a rocky road with (ah! Ice cream would be good...), had turned out to be a pretty decent cook, and the end result showed she could act like quite a 'cow', though that wasn't too surprising, all things considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had gotten to be a bit past midday, and Mora had become a teensy bit nippish. She hadn't munched on anything in about thirty minutes, of course, and as such, called for work to be adjourned for lunch. She requested pasta, which Rachael sheepishly said she'd try at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a bit of work, but the corpulent kitten had whipped together a hearty, and even a bit large for herself, serving of lasagna meant to be split between the two, though it easily could have fed a family of four or more, with its layers of cheese, dough, and sauce completely rich with filling calories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*munch* \u201cMm, oh! This...\u201d *bite* \u201cThis is pretty good, Rach'!\u201d Mora said, as she scarfed down the Italian dish before her, the occasional flick of sauce making its way onto her furry cheek. Her stomach was looking quite bloated right now after a good half day of binging, but the cow was still steadily going along, as if making up time for past meals lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-thanks!\u201d Her compatriot smiled timidly back at her, grateful, but still somewhat shocked at the messy display she was seeing. She couldn't talk much about the amount of food, as she was going through the dish at just as much of an even pace, but Mora was eating just so... sloppily. She didn't want to say anything, but there was a bit of a splotch of red tomatoy goodness stained right no the girl's white sweater!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was why Taffy made her wear a bib...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was even tempted to offer up her's, when the sound of a car pulling up perked her ears. \u201cOh! That must be Taffy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm?\u201d Mora asked back, a large chunk of pasta shoved right in her face. Obviously too distracted to notice anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of keys turning and doors opening quickly led to the sugary sweet tone of a certain white kitten filling the air. \u201c<i>Hiiiii</i> sis!~ \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe're home, everyone.\u201d Taffy's more even voice spoke out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore shuffling could be heard as the two made their way through the house, and eventually ending in the dining area. Taffy looked much the same as she did before she left, only carrying a rather hefty set of bags. Sarah though appeared a bit different, as she was donned in a fairly conservative green dress with big puffy shoulders, and frills that lined themselves across its various edges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRachael I-\u201d Taffy though stopped for a moment upon seeing her 'employer's' state. She'd been eating. A lot. And obviously not in a way befitting of most respectable adults. She looked slovenly and clearly bloated, with the marks of food showing on both her belly, as well as stained upon her features and clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, she was a mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cOh uh, hey there Bun.\u201d *gulp* The bloated bovine said, as she swallowed her last bite of pasta. For some reason, the way Taffy was looking at her made her feel like she was the kid who got caught with their hand in the cookie jar. Sure, she didn't <i>technically</i> do anything wrong, but she binged without the lapine's consent, and that seemed to have become a bit taboo in this household.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bunny matriarch for the most part ignored what she said and turned to Sarah. \u201cHoney, could you please take these up to your room?\u201d She asked, indicating towards her bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing, momma!\u201d the white kitten responded, taking the parcels. She wanted to talk to her sister and tell her about all the cool things that happened while they were out, but Taffy was her mom, and good kittens did what they were told!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, hun.\u201d She said, turning now towards Rachael and pressing forward towards her. \u201cAnd how are you sweetie, were you a good girl while I was away?\u201d Taffy's fingers began to gently run through the chubby kitten's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Bun?\u201d Mora tried to interject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes'm.\u201d Rachael responded, closing her eyes and enjoying the attention and the feeling of the hands of the older woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's very good. I see you're even wearing your bib. So well behaved.\u201d The older woman's eyes turned towards a certain other girl in the room, while smoothly taking one of the napkins her black-furred ward had set out beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTaffy?\u201d Mora tried to ask again, though this time it seemed she got the other woman's attention finally, as the bunny was slowly approaching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy my, what am I going to do about <i>you</i>? Such a messy calf.\u201d Taffy just let out an exacerbated sigh, and with complete disregard for the other girl's personal space, began to wipe the bovine's cheeks clean like an attentive mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-Taffy?!\u201d Mora interjected, trying to get up from the treatment, but it seemed her gorging was finally starting to bite back at her, as the bloat she was feeling barely allowed her to get half an inch out of the chair before an \u201cOoph\u201d sound could be heard from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if she wanted to try again, she was prodded by a light tap to the forehead from Taffy's spare hand, telling her 'no'. \u201c<i>Ah ah</i>, not now sweetie, you just stay right where you are. I have a few questions I'm going to ask you.\u201d She said, finishing her cleaning. Her hand then went right to Mora's belly, giving it a sudden and firm caress. \u201cLike where did <i>this</i> come from?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMora just let out a sharp gasp as her taut tummy was touched. She was <i>so</i> full. \u201cI was hungry...\u201d She mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe expression emitting from Taffy's face was that of all but smug dominance, as she started groping the girl's stomach in an almost lewd fashion. This was just too good of an opportunity to pass up, and if she did this right, it could possibly end up killing two birds with one stone. \u201cI allowed Rachael to make you breakfast, but I didn't say anything about more after that. That's very naughty of you, Mora, making my kitten work like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a more logical state, the bovine could have easily countered that <i>she</i> was the boss, and that what Taffy was saying (and doing) was completely out of line, but she certainly wasn't going to be given a chance to think clearly, not now, anyway. Doubling down on her assault, Taffy dived in with both hands now kneading her flesh with twice the gusto. She was awarded with a primal, and highly embarrassing (for the cow girl) \u201c<i>Moooo</i>!\u201d cry that filled the room around them. The bovine turned a deep and tarnished shade of red from this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd look at those <i>clothes</i>! So sloppy. And messy. How old are you again?\u201d Taffy's hands were churning the cattle's belly in a straight rhythmic fashion; hard and fast, and unrelenting. She wasn't going to allow the wires in her head to start connecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMora started to sputter a reply, but couldn't get the words out, as she felt Taffy's left hand grope at the pasta stain on her shirt, which, coincidentally, aligned just perfectly with one of her breasts, causing the cow to gasp a loud moan from the intimate action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat made this treatment technically even more embarrassing for her was that she was actually a bit <i>older</i> than Taffy, it was her farm, after all, but Taffy seemingly chose to ignore these little factoids. \u201cI guess it can't be helped that a young calf like you is so untidy. We'll have to fix that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolding the fur between her hands even harder and quicker now, the perversity of the act on display clear as day, the bunny egged on. \u201cBut you know, you normally don't eat like this. Do you like Rachael's cooking better than mine? Do you?\u201d It was a rather double edged inquiry, as said chef was currently in the room also, watching the show before her in utmost fascination, as well as with a bit of a blush on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMora was at the brink of delirium at this point, and it was getting hard to think, but for some reason, she felt like she <i>needed</i> to respond to this question. \u201cN-no! I mean- Ooph! I like- I like both! It's just- <i>Moooooooo</i>! You don't make as much for me...\u201d That last part was squeaked out in a weak and defeated tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaffy abruptly stopped cold, taking a moment to savor watching the other girl catch her breath for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe domineering lapine wasn't done with her game quite yet though, as she slowly and evenly lifted her 'boss's' chin up. \u201cSo my little calf wants bigger meals?\u201d She asked, staring directly into the emerald eyes before her, tears forming ever so slightly at the sides of them from stimulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMora could only gently nod, completely speechless and lost in a tangle of submission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, Taffy's hard edge softened, and she leaned in to kiss the girl on her forehead. \u201cThen why didn't you just say something, silly? I'll make all the food you <i>need</i> from now on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bunny pulled back from the shocked and heated cow in front of her and just smiled. \u201cIn fact, I think there are going to be some other <i>big</i> changes around here from now on too. I hope you don't mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said this, two recently absent persons of interest, Minos and Miles, passed through the hallway, carrying a rather large and heavy set of cardboard boxes. The latter struggling significantly more than the former. \u201cWhere do you want this stuff, Taffy?\u201d The bull inquired, not commenting on what was going on between the girls, having missed most of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can start setting things up in the girls' room. You're a real sweetheart, Minos.\u201d The bunny only received a nod as the other two moved forward with the items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaffy then turned towards Mora once more. \u201cOur first change for you though will be a change of clothing.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mora's heart was racing. She'd never seen Taffy act like this before. Everything about what just happened was so wrong. She was the boss! Taffy was a glorified housekeeper! Here she was though ordering people around, talking down to her, and even fondling her up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was absurd! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd brazen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd out of line!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...So why wasn't she doing anything to stop it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now she felt like her brain, maybe even her whole body, had been glazed over into a puddle of gooey mush. She was already acting fairly lethargic from the binges she'd had that day, but after that... <i>intense</i> chat (and rub... and kiss...) from Taffy, she was feeling like she couldn't even put up a fight against a wet piece of paper, let alone question the matriarchal bunny's authority. She barely even acknowledged Miles and Minos coming in, only passingly wondering if they heard her loud 'moos' from earlier, with whatever the rabbit woman saying to them going right between her ears, though her mind did perk up a tad when she said she was going to get a change of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about this whole situation made the blood rush to Mora's head. Taffy was treating her like Rachael. She, Mora Linda, head of Las Lindas, and employer of all these people, was being taken down to the level of the 'Big Fat Kitty'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was feeling oddly hot right now for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis whole time, she'd watched, even subtlety encouraged, Rachael's downfall into the state she was currently in, partially out of spite, and partially out of fascination. Watching her get bigger. And softer. And weaker. And kowtowing to whatever Taffy or anyone else said. Letting those events play out for her own amusement, as well as semi-excitement. Just watching was one thing, though, it'd be a whole other matter if she allowed <i>herself</i> to be involved on the receiving end of whatever game Taffy was playing. It could shift the whole dynamic of the household. <i>Her</i> household.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something a bit exciting about it, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Taffy call her? A calf? Just thinking that made her feel weak in the knees. What was Taffy planning for her? Did she even want to know? All she had to do was assert herself just a tiny bit, and this could be over in under a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was awfully stressed out, wasn't she? All that paperwork. Managing the farm. That binge from earlier was probably just one large manifestation of all that pent of worry and emotion. She hadn't really had a lot of free time to relax, recently, that was for certain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, she might have just noticed this now because she was in the position she was in, but she couldn't help but wonder if by letting Taffy smother Rachael, she wasn't yearning, just a little bit, to get involved with the act. She practically dared the rabbit to do something when she butted in on the dress up session she was having with Rachael earlier. And now she was getting that push back in full force. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was whether or not she was going to do anything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cowgirl bit her lip as her mind whirled around these thoughts. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad to let go for a little. Taffy was trustworthy. Of course she was. She was probably overthinking things a bit too much anyway. What could really happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, breaking the farm owner out of her own thoughts, Taffy spoke. \u201cNow come along dear. I mostly bought things for Rachael and Sarah while I was out, but I did dabble a bit in getting an outfit or two for you. Who'd have thought though you'd need it so soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaffy's hand was reaching out to Mora to help her up just then. It was now or never. Just do something, anything other than willingly submit to show that she wasn't interested. It was simple. She had a million miles of more leverage here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go. I want to get all of my little ones changed so they can look nice and pretty.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMora's heart was beating faster than she ever thought it could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly took Taffy's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes'm.\u201d</span></div></div>",

And for a few certain members of Las Lindas, that phrase takes on a literal meaning to the words \"extreme makeover\". And within said week, the lifestyles of Rachael, Sarah, and Mora have been drastically altered, courtesy of one lapine woman named Taffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as the sun rose over the Las Lindas estate, it shone through a window on the second floor, taking a glimpse into what had become of both Rachael and her sister Sarah. Where once a pair of normal-sized beds were present, now laid a pair of giant baby cribs stood, both large enough for someone of Rachael's size and bulk. And speaking of the corpulent black feline, Rachael was still asleep, currently wearing a set of infantile clothing in her size, which appeared in the form of a large purple onesie. And underneath the onesie was a thickly padded diaper, held together by 6 diaper tapes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOriginally, Rachael was shocked by Taffy having to make her wear the infantile undergarments. However, Taffy's maternal charisma swayed the big fat kitty. But due to the diaper's bulk, it forced Rachael's fat legs to spread outward a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough as for Sarah, she was given the same treatment, only the white feline embraced her newfound position, wearing a pink frilly onesie with a bulky diaper underneath . However, Sarah's body looked a bit more....softer than it previously did 7 days ago. She had a small chubby belly, her arms and legs looked slightly thicker, her face looked a little  fuller, while her hips, waist, and butt looked a little bigger, and her breasts looked slightly plumper than previously. Overall, Sarah was putting on some of that \"kitten fat\", as Taffy would put it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the enveloping sunlight entering the room, Rachael was forced to wake up, sitting up with some difficulty due to her diaper's bulky padding. From there, she stretched her fat furry arms outward, letting out a deep yawn from her plump lips, looking with a set of drowsy eyes. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rachael smiled dimly, letting the early morning glow of the sun bask over her, as she stared absentmindedly forward in her crib; a glazed look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer crib.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer onsie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Her diaper</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many new experiences had washed over her lately, it was a little crazy trying to keep up. She'd gone from a calculating vagabond and fitness freak, to being treated like a little domesticated kitten by the woman she professed to have a crush on. And that says nothing about the copious amounts of weight she'd gained!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the crazy thing was, she didn't really hate any of the changes. In fact, for the first time in a long time, she actually felt <i>happy</i>. The black-furred feline had spent so long worrying, so long struggling, so long moping over every little thought since she broke her leg, that when Taffy, sweet and gentle as she ever was, casually told her she was going to put a diaper on her, something just clicked in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted someone to take care of her, to tell her that everything was going to be alright, and to make all the hard decisions for her. Why would she ever want to be a grown up cat, when being Taffy's little kitten was so much easier? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, it made her sister happy. Looking over at the chubby form of the still sleeping girl, Rachael couldn't help but smile. Truthfully, Sarah never really grew past being a kitten in the first place, so seeing her sitting in her fluffy diaper, and resting in her nice safe crib, was practically natural in Rachael's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it had become natural for herself now, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe padded girl had to admit, she really had turned into Taffy's 'Big Fat Kitty', and in a way, that was kind of liberating. Kittens didn't have big adult worries, they didn't have big adult fears, or struggles, or questions about silly things, like how they could ever confess to being in love with a woman who declared her job in life was spoon-feed and baby-talk to them. As she was now, she just had to do as Mommy-Taffy told her, and all her needs would be taken care of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that's what she'd been doing. She let her mind soften just as much as her body, at least around Taffy. If she was told to eat something, she'd eat it. If she was told to wear something, she'd wear it. If she was told to suck on a pacifier, she'd make sure to open wide for her dummy. True, this wasn't much different from what she had been doing a week or two prior, but now she let her inhibitions run free. She didn't think about belittlement, or embarrassment, she just did as her mommy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife had become simple, and she had become a 'good kitty'. The sheer idea of her even confessing to Taffy, of her proclaiming her love to the bunny, seemed far and away impossible now. She lost that chance long ago, but in return, she supposed she gained something else. Taffy had become her and her sister's momma, and she didn't think either of them had been this content in their lives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe, in the end, this all had actually worked out for the best. She and Sarah had someone to watch over them, and make sure they were both being well taken care of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were just a few little wild cards to factor...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRise and shine, girls~!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn walked Taffy, wearing, oddly enough, Mora's white sweater. The pink haired hare had reasoned that many of the clothes her new calf had previously worn were much too 'adult' for her, and as such, she'd confiscated them, as well as many of the other belongings she deemed unacceptable to be owned by the clearly immature cow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid bovine had marched in lock step right behind her, hair covering her eyes, and a deep red blush showing on her (now slightly chubbier face); the shade complimenting the frilly red dress she was now adorned in. A far cry from the many sultry outfits she previously flaunted in her more grown up period of life, this poofy garment was babyish to the core, while also almost contradictorily having an aura of tantalizing lewdness to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trim of the skirt audaciously barely went down to her now much softer thighs, and if the silly calf were to make the simplest of wrong gestures, the rhumba panties covering her thick diaper would be put full on display to anyone who wanted to look, and all things considered, there was a fair bit more to look at with the girl now! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHidden under the soft fabric of it all, on Mora herself, was now a gentle coating of adipose that showed Taffy was keeping up with her promise to feed her calf all she <i>needed</i>. Daily meals and in-between snacks from the nurturing woman had slowly begun to chisel and crack at the trim, womanly figure Mora once displayed; giving way to a cute new addition of pinchable 'baby fat' on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven the cow's eating habits though, there was promise of much more of her to pinch to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo top off the ensemble she was donned in, a cute little copper bell was placed around Mora in a necklace-like fashion, that jingled and jangled every few steps as she moved. This was a recent regular addition that Taffy had found absolutely 'adorable', and made sure to have her put it on each and every morning. She kept on having to remind herself that when she went out shopping again, that she should buy something similar for each of her kittens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff in the corner, a low mumbling could be heard from one of those said kittens right then. \u201cMm, mornin' momma...\u201d The young Sarah spoke, now partially roused, as she wiped the sleep from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael soon followed suit, with an equal \u201cmorning, mommy,\u201d but her eyes were currently locked on Mora. She was curious as to what she was thinking, what she was feeling. Out of all of them, the bovine woman probably had went through the biggest set of changes, and by far the fastest. Mora had seemingly taken to being under Taffy's thumb like a cow to a milker, and the bunny woman was quick to take advantage of it. If she could do so much to the (former) matriarch of the estate in just a week, she had to wonder what the coming months had in store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were also the questions of what her relationship with Minos had turned into, but Rachael was hesitant to even think about stirring that beehive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaffy meanwhile was pulling the bars down from her kittens' cribs. \u201cNow girls, we've got a big day ahead of us! It'll be fun, I promise, but before anything else, let's get you two dressed and ready for breakfast!\u201d</span></div></div>",

In response to the chubby feline's question, Taffy's looked at Sarah with a tender motherly smile and answered, \"*Giggle*  You'll just have to wait and see, little Sarah. Now then, let's get both you and your sister all dressed up, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Mommy!\" Sarah replied, willingly allowing the maternal lapine woman to begin undressing the chubby blonde kitten, leaving Sarah in nothing but a large baby pink bra and a thick pink diaper around her plump feline waist and hips. From there, Taffy proceeded to rummage through the nearby closet for some clothes suitable and appropriate for Sarah, which eventually resulted in the lapine pinkette to grab a red T-shirt and a large pair of baby blue overalls. In appearance, the overalls looked to be made of a combination between denim and fleece, as it sported a large pocket on the front. However, the most noticeable thing about the overalls is the large buttoned-up flap on the front of the overalls, which was used as an easily accessible way for diaper changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, Taffy had Sarah wear the red T-shirt first. Sure, it was somewhat loose on Sarah now, but Taffy figured that her plump blonde kitty would eventually fill in the gaps quite nicely. Then, she inserted the overalls on Sarah, assisting the chubby kitten with putting each leg through a pant leg before pulling the overalls upward and button up the overalls straps. Finally, she had Sarah wear these short pink baby booties on her paw-like feet, completing to process of getting Sarah all dressed up for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after finishing with Sarah, Taffy then shifted her focus toward Rachael, preparing to dress up her \"Big Fat Kitty\" as well. However, unlike Sarah, Taffy decided to give Rachael s more feminine outfit for today, as she stripped the purple onesie off of Rachael. Then, the lapine woman grabbed a large frilly purple dress, which was large enough for someone of Rachael's size and girth, while also allowing her thick diaper to be seen some as well. And for the finishing touch, Taffy's tied a large silk purple bow to the back of Rachael's long black hair, adding to overall adorable appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once her kittens were now fully dressed in their adorable infantile clothing for the day, Taffy then proceeded to give both the rotund Rachael and the plump Sarah a loving maternal embrace, finding their current garments to be quite irresistibly adorable and cute, while she kissed them each on the forehead and said, \"Aww! Well, aren't you quite adorable in your outfits, my kittens. *giggle*\" \"'Tank You, Mommy!\" Sarah gleefully replied, intentionally displaying this infantile lisp in her speech, easily embracing her new lifestyle as Taffy's \"Big Fat Kitty\" alongside her much bulkier sister Rachael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Rachael simply kept herself quiet throughout the moment, her eyes concentrated on the fattened infantile bovine that was Mora Lindas, who was still blushing with great embarrassment upon her fuller cheeks, which were partially shrouded by Mora's voluminous locks of red hair. And yet, Rachael couldn't help but subconsciously suck on her plump left thumb, as if the infantile mannerism was soothing the rotund black feline. Of course, Taffy instantly took notice of Rachael's infantile behavior, where she responded maternally by grabbing a baby blue adult-sized pacifier she bought for her big black kitten at the Adult Baby store, Young At Heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want your Paci, Rachael?\" Taffy asked, which prompted the rotund black feline to nod her head in confirmation, all while she still had her left thumb lodged inside her mouth. From there, Taffy displayed a caring maternal smile toward Rachael, carefully pulling the black kitten's plump hand and thumb away from her mouth, where Rachael then willingly opened her mouth wide enough to allow the pink haired lapine woman to insert the pacifier into her waiting mouth, which was exactly what Taffy had done with such ease thanks to Rachael's willing compliance. \"There, all better.\" Taffy replied, watching as Rachael began to happily suckle on the pacifier dummy with gusto. From there, Taffy then proceeded to guide her two kittens and calf toward the Kitchen, speaking toward Rachael, Sarah, and Mora in a motherly tone as she said, \"Come along now, girls. We have much to do today, and I want to give each of you a nice, healthy breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after following closely behind the pink haired hare, waddling due to both their increased girth and the overall thickness of their diapers, Rachael, Sarah, and Mora soon arrived in the Kitchen, where Taffy greeted the padded trio to an abundant feast for breakfast. Splayed out upon the large wooden table, there were various assortments of delectable treats that were highly recommended for a hefty breakfast given their increased stomach capacity and appetite, ranging from stacks of cinnamon pancakes smothered in chocolate maple syrup, to blueberry waffles coated in a thin layer of butter and whipped cream, to even Taffy's trademark and most delicious dessert, Black Forest Cake, being somewhere in the midst of all those delicious cuisines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, due to their increased appetites, Rachael, Sarah, and Mora began to drool slightly in a mix between greedy infantile hunger and eager anticipation. However, being the dominant maternal figure to the two kittens and calf, Taffy stopped them before their stomachs took control, where the pink haired hare then spoke toward her kittens and calf as she said, \"Ah ah ah, girls! I need to put your Bibs on first and get you seated, then you can eat. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Mommy...\" Sarah replied, feeling sorry for such bad behavior, her white feline ears drooping downward to the sides of her slightly plump head. Fortunately, Taffy managed to cheer her chubby white kitten up out that mucky mood, bringing Sarah back into her usual peppy childish self once more, skipping her way to the nearest chair off toward her right side, then sat her diapered behind down onto the wide chair, with Rachael and Mora soon following suit, waddling their way over to their respective chairs as well. Once her three diapered charges were properly seated at the table, Taffy soon pulled out three large infantile Bibs from a nearby drawer, then proceeded to tie on a bib to each individual member seated at the table: First Rachael, then Sarah, and finally Mora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Taffy approached the refrigerator and pulled out three large adult-sized baby bottles, each filled with succulent Chocolate Milk, as the pink haired lapine passed out all three infantile bottles to Rachael, Sarah, and Mora respectively. Once everything was properly in it's place,  Taffy finally gave them her blessing to begin breakfast as she said, \"Alright, girls. Dig in!\" And right off the bat, Rachael, Sarah, and Mora commenced their gluttonous barrage upon the stacks of breakfast food with childish and infantile gusto, while Taffy consumed a foot tall stack of pancakes with the mannerisms of an adult, using a knife and fork to cut into the flapjacks for easier consumption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, some minutes after beginning such an abundant breakfast, Rachael had begun to encounter some difficulty reaching the rest of the food at the table, due to the combination of a somewhat full stomach and her rotund belly pressed against the table. Of course, being the maternal figure she now was, Taffy stopped eating, as she laid her plate on the table and approached the struggling Rachael, who began to whimper a little from such hindrance, despite her best efforts. Fortunately for the rotund kitten, Taffy had approached her, gently stroking the fat black feline's jet black hair with compassion and maternal intimacy, as the pink haired lapine gently spoke to Rachael with a motherly tone and said, \"...It's alright, Rachael. It's alright. No need for tears. Do you want me to feed you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to her situation, Rachael timidly nodded in confirmation toward the motherly hare, where Taffy then proceeded to take a fork, stab it into two waffles, and then lifted up the two waffles in the fork's grasp. \"Open wide, sweetie. Here  comes the Waffle Express!\" Taffy said, baby-talking toward Rachael, as the rotund black feline eagerly opened her hungry mouth wide like a baby bird accepting food from it's mother, feeling the delectable treat on her taste buds being carefully crammed into her mouth with relative ease, which left Rachael with a full mouth and puffed-out cheeks in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget to chew your food before swallowing, my dear.\" Taffy said, easily reminding the rotund Rachael to chew her food before swallowing. However, due to her mouth currently filled to the brim with food, Rachael had to do a lot more chewing, as her jaws performed big heavy chomping bites out of the waffle remains residing within her maw, which made these muffled crunching sounds as she chewed, until Rachael chewed enough times to easily swallow the mashed waffles down her gullet with a satisfying gulp. Once the deed was done, Rachael looked back toward the motherly Taffy, bearing a pair of plump blushing crimson cheeks, then asked, \"...More...Pwease...\" Upon hearing such an adorable response from the rotund diapered kitten, Taffy displayed a caring and motherly smile toward Rachael, continuing to slowly feed the big black feline until she was truly stuffed.</span></div></div>",

With a satisfied, cheerful, and maternal demeanor, Taffy eventually assisted each of her two kittens and calf up onto their plump feet, some needing more assistance than others. \"Excellent job on finishing your breakfast, girls. And since you've been very good, how about watching some cartoons?\" Taffy said, her tone being ever kind and motherly toward her padded \"children\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, being the childish and easily excitable member of the three, Sarah began gleefully hop up and down, her chubby body lightly jiggling from the sudden motion while she excitedly yelped, \"Yay! Cartoons, Cartoons!\" From there, Sarah happily waddled into the Living Room to turn on the television, having a giddy childish spring in her step, along with dragging Mora with her into the room. However, just as the rotund Rachael was about to join them, she felt Taffy's hand on her plump shoulder, letting the big diapered feline know that the pink haired lapine wanted to see her for a brief moment, where Taffy gently spoke toward her and said, \"I'll be leaving you in charge of Sarah and Mora. Alright, sweetie?\" \"...Okay, Mommy.\" Rachael replied, just as Taffy then wrapped the large kitten in a motherly embrace before freeing her to join Sarah and Mora in the Living Room, allowing Taffy to clean up the dishes on the table and prepare Lunch for her kittens and calf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, while Rachael, Sarah, and Mora were currently preoccupied with a simple animated cartoon displayed on the television, Taffy was preoccupied within the Kitchen, alternating between cleaning the dishes and meticulously searching through her cookbook, intent on creating new deliciously filling cuisines for her little ones... Well, not-so-little ones, but they were HER little ones nonetheless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow normally, she would usually use the dishwasher to clean the dirty dishes since Las Lindas has multiple mouths to feed, but there was always something about cleaning dishes manually by hand that seemed most soothing to the pink haired hare, allowing Taffy to peacefully contemplate on her personal thoughts. Within her subconscious, the lapine woman couldn't help thought about how \"healthy\" and \"youthful\" her two kittens and calf were becoming by the day, causing her heart to feel all fluttery on the inside. Nothing could ruin such a happy and fulfilling moment of bliss. However...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taffy... We need to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA masculine voice rang out, instantly snapping the pink haired hare back to reality, where she stopped cleaning the dishes for a moment or two, then calmly turned around to confront whoever was speaking to her. Fortunately, she recognized whose voice it was, looking at none other than the athletic bull Minos, the \"brawn\" of Las Lindas. However, Taffy could easily see that the muscular male bovine wasn't alone, for Miles was also present, his black and white furry arms crossed in front of his chest. Having this instinctual feeling that they wanted to talk about a certain subject, Taffy continued to display a calm but cheerful demeanor toward both Miles and Minos, where she then spoke toward them and said, \"Of course, Minos. We can talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Minos and Miles seated themselves at the table, prompting Taffy to be seated as well, where she calmly spoke toward the two individuals and asked, \"So... What is it that you want to converse about, Minos?\" \"You know exactly why we're here, Taffy.\" Miles answered, his tone of voice sounding more assertive than usual, though Minos was able to wrangle him in before he potentially snapped at the pink haired hare. Then, Minos spoke toward Taffy with a calm but stern tone in his voice and explained, \"Taffy, we're here to talk to you about what you're doing with Rachael, Sarah, and Mora.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, despite the revelation of why Minos and Miles were talking to her, Taffy managed to keep herself calm and collected, even though the male bovine and feline were already well aware of what exactly the pink haired lapine was doing to Rachael, Sarah, and Mora. \"...I see. Well, it would explain why Miles seems so...tense.\" Taffy replied, her mind coming up with the correct explanation regarding her handiwork upon Rachael, Sarah, and Mora. However, Miles couldn't help but become a little ticked off, thinking that Taffy was insulting her despite Taffy's good-hearted nature, where he slightly raised his voice and growled, \"Tense?! You think I'm-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, just as Miles was about quickly stand up out of the chair and continued his sentence, Minos stopped him before his anger got out of hand, forcing Miles back down into the chair as the male bovine said, \"Miles, that's enough! You promised not to snap at her like that.\" Of course, being one of the more wizened members of Las Lindas, Minos managed to get Miles to calm down, where the muscular bovine then looked back toward Taffy and asked, \"Care to explain to us why you're treating Rachael, Sarah, and Mora like they're...well, babies? Wanna explain why you're doing this to them, Taffy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, she would need a moment or two to collect her thoughts to answer such a question. However, Taffy had anticipated that such a confrontation like this would occur eventually, so the pink haired hare kept reminding herself over the past week that she was doing this to help Rachael, and that Sarah was willing to help Taffy in Rachael's \"recovery\", while Mora was doing this because she lost a bet to Taffy, using the bet excuse as a way to cover up the true motive behind turning the head honcho of Las Lindas into a big diapered calf. Finally, with her premeditated thoughts front and center in her conscience, Taffy then...</span></div></div>",

She needed to word things quite carefully so as not to ruffle any fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it all comes back to Rachael's therapy, I'm afraid. The poor dear has been in <i>such</i> a frazzled state, that I realized maybe it would be best to try and start from the ground up with her.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lapine placed her hands forward on the table in a show that she had nothing to hide. \u201cDid you know Sarah and her never really knew their parents? What I think they need most right now is someone to love them, and give them the care they missed out on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that means treating them like <i>babies</i>?\u201d Miles' voice was dripping with doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe though just kept on smiling sweetly. \u201cWell I did say 'start from the ground up', didn't I? It was Sarah really who jumped at the idea, if you want to know. I think she needed a mommy more than anyone. Those clothes she's wearing? She picked them out.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA memory of the silly little thing eagerly trying on outfits filled her head as she spoke this. \u201cFor the moment though, it might just be better to treat those two as if they were the kittens I'm treating them as. We don't want to make them feel uncomfortable in this <i>tumultuous</i> time in their lives, do we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...It'd be for Rachael's health?\u201d Minos cautiously asked. He hadn't exactly bought into the whole idea, but he thankfully wasn't planning to bolt out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy yes, for Rachael's health. <i>And</i> Sarah's. I'm sure if you got a little closer, you'd see they're <i>far</i> better off now. Rachael is much sweeter, and Sarah is so well behaved!\u201d The pink-haired hare was beaming now, like a mother doting over her kids- which wasn't too far off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinos though ignored it all. There was still one rather large elephant left in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe bovine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about Mora?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question had been weighing on the bull's mind for over a week now. Something had distinctly changed with the woman whom he <i>thought</i> was his girlfriend. Just like Rachael and Sarah, it seemed she had fallen under a strange spell cast by Taffy, where she followed her around like an obedient calf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn some ways, maybe <i>even more</i> severely than the other two... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the bunny in front of him, she was wearing a set of Mora's old clothes, and seemingly had slunk into sleeping in the cow's own master bedroom. He didn't know exactly what was going on, but he had a good idea after being asked to set up a crib adjacent to the queen sized bed. Considering Taffy wasn't the one parading around in diapers, the chances of who it was for were pretty narrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was <i>another</i> thing. Mora was wearing <i>diapers</i>. Frilly, crinkly little things with ruffled rhumba panties! She was dressing like a full on baby bovine, and it left him <i>terribly</i> confused. It didn't help that she kept on blushing and shuffling away from him whenever he tried to talk. He cared about her, but this was definitely a lot to swallow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo preoccupied with this, Minos wasn't able to catch the slight glint in the eye Taffy had, before she returned to her normal, matronly demeanor. \u201cIn Mora's case, it's quite silly, actually. We got ourselves in a little bet, and right now she's living up to the losing terms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, Miles just snorted. \u201cWhat kind of bet has someone prancing around in diapers and sucking their thumb?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm glad you asked, Miles.\u201d Taffy started, cool tone kept, despite the other's attitude. \u201cMora is a <i>very</i> stressed young girl, having to manage a farm practically all on her lonesome. That's why I challenged her to take one single day off. Let her relax for a little while, and calm down.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole story was a complete fabrication, but explaining to the two that she practically seduced her employer into submissive babyhood <i>probably</i> wouldn't have gone over well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I caught her going over papers like a regular workaholic only an hour after our talk though, that's when I <i>knew</i> I had to step in. Since she lost, I told her, for her own good, that I was going to give her a bit of the same treatment my two kittens were getting, and for the time being, I'd handle all the troublesome 'adulting' she no longer needed to think about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen no one interrupted her to speak, Taffy continued. \u201cSo for the time being, you can think of me as your temporary Mora, I suppose! I'm taking care of the various paperwork and funds, while keeping the rambunctious set of little ones in line.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinos just paused to ponder. At least it all sounded like a story of... <i>some kind</i>. A way to sort the absurdity. The specifics were definitely out there, but Taffy's tone, with its sugary sweet edge, couldn't help but make it all look more reasonable than it probably really was. \u201c...That seems like an incredible amount of work for you to deal with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it is,\u201d Taffy chimed. \u201cBut there <i>have</i> been some perks! Mora, very sweetly, offered more sensible sleeping arrangements, for someone taking on the role of head of the household from now on. She was also kind enough to donate some of the personal items she no longer really had a need for.\u201d She shook her features in a wry fashion. \u201cI swear, a calf like her doesn't have any business running around in the dresses I found in that closest!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see...\u201d There was so much here for Minos to take in, that he didn't even really catch on to the little addendums Taffy mentioned, like saying she was the head of the household 'from now on,' or that Mora donated things that 'no longer had a need for.' All he cared about was that he at least had some semblance of an idea of what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMora was having a little 'vacation' from adulthood, and Taffy was taking the reigns at the farm in the interim- which was curious, but far from the most pressing matter at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe he was approaching this wrong. Getting answers from a middleman wasn't always the most helpful, and he'd been almost equally as shy around Mora as she had. \u201cCan I... go talk to her?\u201d He asked, slowly standing himself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course!\u201d Taffy intoned, quick to shuffle over. \u201cTheir show should be finishing up right about now anyway. Would you like me to come with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just shook his head. \u201cI'll call if I feel the need, but I'd like to get a chance to talk without her running off to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell just remember to treat her nicely.\u201d The 'mother' said; raising her finger on upward in a gesture of warning. \u201cShe's a fragile calf.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA fragile calf... right.\u201d His voice had a slightly unfocused echo to it, as he moved from the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting just a moment, Taffy allowed herself to sigh, as she saw him finally exit out of sight. A part of her wondered if it was the smartest idea to let Minos be unsupervised with the 'kids,' but she knew Rachael, her biggest 'little girl' (in several ways), would come waddling if something was wrong. Right now she still had a plate in the room she needed to keep spinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*ahem*\u201d Miles coughed; crossing his arms. \u201cListen Taffy, you might be able to convince muscle-brain over there that this isn't completely crazy, but <i>seriously</i>! You turned those three into a bunch of big fat babies! What is going on with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bunny kept quiet, letting her former boyfriend's accusations stew in her ears, before slowly deciding to pad on towards him; the young man still seated in his chair. \u201cMiles, sweetie, there's no need for you to feel so... <i>on edge</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince I'm in charge now, I think I should tell you that things are going to be run slightly... <i>differently</i> here than they used to, and first on the agenda is to make sure that everyone has a <i>calm</i> and <i>relaxing</i> routine to live by. It's for the household's health!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her words were weaved, he hardly had time to notice when she started leaning down towards him; her gentle hand reaching to cup and tickle the edges of his cheek. \u201cI can think of a few ways we can maybe  help with <i>your</i> routine. Take out some of the <i>stress</i>.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like that, <i>kitten</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feline could barely stammer a word out, as his face flushed as brightly as he ever thought it could.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mora Linda, if she had to put it nicely, would say she was going through a very... <i>unique</i> phase in her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently sitting beside a set of exceedingly chubby kittens, whose features were too ensconced in some vapid 'edutainment' program to really care, she looked about as out of place as anyone else in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Which might cause some alarm bells to ring off, depending on who you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween mindless sing-a-longs, hummed by both the TV, and Sarah's off-key voice, she could hear a distinct 'crinkly-crack' come up from underneath her; a reminder of the fluff secured snugly around her waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever unlikely, the buxom, full figured cowgirl, and owner of this considerable estate of land, was now prancing around in a thickly padded, adult-sized baby's diaper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft unhidden by the childish, but embarrassingly short dress she'd been dolled up in, the tresses and frills of its skirt meshed together in a feathery outline, that instantly led one's eyes to drift downward, and notice the white cotton subtlety peaking out between her thighs. It was the comforting smell of baby powder however, that provided the final tip off, as she, much like the majority of Las Lindas' female population, had the sugary scent tickling her nearly night and day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPacifiers, silly cartoons, bottles of milk, and plenty of babyish bibs, the very grown up woman had somehow managed to entangle herself in a very 'grown down' set of circumstances, that, even now, she wasn't quite sure how she regress herself into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...There was another level of concern though that was niggling its way into her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClothes could be changed, and powders could be puffed away, but more permanently, something <i>else</i> about her was being altered. If she reached for her middle, beneath the layers of her dress, she could find that her fingers sank into another kind of padded softness which now cushioned over her frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was getting fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it wasn't uncommon for cowgirls to be a bit on the... <i>bigger</i> side of things. It was their nature. Mora though, in months and years past, had prided herself on her figure, and what little 'additions' seemed to come, were curves that were in, to most people, all the right places. It appeared recently though that the extra food a <i>certain someone</i> suggested she 'needed', had been transgressively transferring itself to her waistline... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore, she was svelte, but with a frame that could cause any person's eyes to linger a tad too long. She certainly wasn't skinny, not by model means, anyway. Her thighs always had an ample amount of meat to them, and her breasts were a prize that instilled envy in just about any other woman around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow though, she seemed much... gentler. Cuter. Like Rachael when this was all beginning. She was sporting a coating of fluff on her tummy that didn't look to want to dissipate no matter how much she sucked it in, and her hips too, which had always bordered the line between thick, and heavy-set, were far more deeply leaning towards the latter, with her dress doing nothing to create a more flattering illusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut more than any of these, her whole disposition was starting to change; coming off less prone to sultriness, and more prone to cuddling. It was a fine line to ride, but the very way she held herself was becoming meeker, as a result of the casual lessons and 'tuts' Taffy ingrained on a day to day basis. As the layers of weight were adding to Mora's frame, it appeared the natural weight of her maturity was equally peeling away, all thanks to the farm's new replacement matriarch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Taffy</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust hearing the name made Mora all lightheaded and tingly. That woman was the cause for <i>everything</i>, and simply trying to process the various feelings she invoked left her spinning. From the sheer mix of humiliation and shame she could instill in someone, to the pull she always did that brought them right back from the edge, so they could be smothered with motherly affection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former farmer had always thought herself to be very sexual- in the very least she had the body for it, but never in her life did she feel more heated, more <i>turned on</i>, then that day when, all of a sudden, Taffy came to her charged with this spark of... <i>something</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was <i>so</i> commanding. <i>So</i> absolute, and made her feel <i>so</i> small, but at the same time, had this maternal aura that made Mora crave for more. It was hypnotic, and she knew, despite the trepidations screaming in the back of her head, that she wanted to follow the lapine's words to a 'T'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a state of submission she found astonishingly alluring, with the woman conducting it all tugging things in just a way that made her breath hold at a stand still. Mora had concluded that Taffy had a knack to push buttons well enough in people so as to create a uniquely wonderful gooey squirminess, that the cowgirl especially reveled in. Edging things along in such a way that the choices she was offered never felt forced, but were just another push in a willing game of total surrender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMora remembered being taken by hand, and dressed in clothing not too dissimilar to what she was wearing now. That was day one. Then came the extra meals, and the reduction to baby talk; days two and three. Finally, the diapers on day four. That was the real test to see how far Taffy's 'calf' was willing to take things, so when she bowed her head without an ounce of protest, that was the moment when the bunny knew she officially had a new 'little one.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt came off almost as casual, when Taffy told Mora that she was going to be taking the cowgirl's queen-sized bed, but that she needn't worry, since she'd have a 'nice comfy crib' set up right beside to 'always be with her.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA servile, eager to please 'daughter,' out to seek the approval and praise of her make-shift mother, was the simplest way to describe Mora's status currently, and also brought matters to the now.</span></div></div>",

The only thoughts left twinkling in her mind were of what the future had in store. Taffy seemed quite comfortable with keeping the current scenario going for the foreseeable future- and maybe even progressing it, but there were still quite a few hurdles that couldn't be outright ignored. Chief among them being the brooding bull boyfriend, Minos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Who Mora, so lost in thought, hadn't picked up had been spending his last few minutes, watching over her in silence; seeing the glazed look in her eyes, and noticing the dribbles of drool pruning her digit, as she nursed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Minos!\u201d Sarah yelped; fully aware of him since he entered, but her cartoon meant that he was shifted to priority number two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH- hi.\u201d Rachael echoed; her own situation with the man also quite awkward, but thankfully starting to simmer, as the kitten's attention shifted more to wanting to please her 'momma.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Mora though who stayed in silence. A red blush covering her face, and a downward look of learned timidness taking up her features. This man was by far causing the most confusion and doubt to shoot through her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe adult-calf knew she still cared deeply about about him, but she was at a loss for even how to <i>begin</i> explaining her new lifestyle changes. Living under Taffy's care made her feel <i>so good</i>, in a way that being with Minos prior had never provided, but the thought of having to face that fact in front of him always caused her to skitter off towards her 'momma' in an appropriately childish fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether she felt like it or not though, it seemed her padded rear was about to come face to face with reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe <i>really</i> wanted a bottle right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi there... girls.\u201d Minos was hesitant. He himself not sure how to handle it all, but he knew breaking the ice was a crucial first start. \u201cYou all look very nice today. Especially you, Mora.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to his eyes, it was true. Spending a few moments admiring her unperturbed, his girlfriend really had become a lot cuter. Minos always was a little distasteful towards some of her lewder, and more outrageous acts of behavior, but it seemed Taffy had really come to dull the edges off her in a way that he couldn't really describe, but didn't necessarily hate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT- thank you.\u201d A bottle, a blankie, her mommy, <i>anything</i>. Mora was feeling <i>very</i> nervous at the moment. Her heart was thudding about as fast as could be, but she had an odd urge to lean in to the praise. Was he playing along? \u201cMomma-Taffy helped dress me.\u201d Saying that sent a warm bashfulness through her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour momma did a very good job.\u201d Minos was crouching down; making sure to look the girl in the eye, as his voice held itself with a very soft spoken tone. He was talking to a calf, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, girls...\u201d He was indicating towards all of them. \u201cI still don't fully understand all... this.\u201d A hand touched upon the shoulder of Mora's poofy dress, \u201cbut I want to let you know that I'll help if I can. Taffy shouldn't be raising children like this on her own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a slight pause, as the man between all of them casually recognized them as 'children,' before a certain white-furred feline quickly jumped on his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYaay~! Daddy-Minos!\u201d Sarah yelped; latching her soft, chubby form towards his arm in a possessive hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis just caused the bull to blush about as crimson as Mora now regularly did; simultaneously trying to balance himself with the weight of the kitten around his arm. \u201cW- well I don't know about 'daddy', but um, I definitely will be there.\u201d He glanced over towards the calf in the room. \u201cFor you.\u201d Then to the others. \u201cAnd all of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Minos. \u201cRachael said, the biggest kitty, and least 'immature' of the lot, walking towards him, and putting her hand on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes... thank you...\u201d For the first time since she noticed him, Mora stopped shying her eyes away. \u201cDaddy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe oxen just grinned lightly; finding the name more palpable on a repeat hearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, do any of you girls need a change?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the faces in the room except his lit up as red as the farm's ripest tomatoes.</span></div></div>",

Those were the only words that came to mind for the black and white feline known as Miles, just as the replacement matriarch of Las Lindas continued her relentless doting upon him. And yet, for some strange, unknown, and peculiar circumstance, he couldn't help but feel utterly flustered and immobile regarding this awkward conundrum he inadvertently found himself in, unable to respond with protest like he was clearly capable of previously. Within his subconscious, Miles had this instinctual gut feeling that this was part of the indigenous that converted Rachael, Sarah, and Mora into their current infantile states in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now... Now he was about to unwillingly undergo the same exact process that ultimately transformed and domesticated the two \"kittens\" and \"calf\", as Miles felt Taffy slowly and carefully strip him of his jeans, sneakers, and T-Shirt, still bearing a greatly embarrassed blush on his feline face, whilst leaving him in nothing but his boxers and socks. \"Now then, let's get you into some more...fitting clothes, shall we?\" Taffy said, where she then casually strolled over toward the nearby closet, opened the closet doors, and pulled out what appeared to be a pair of baby blue overall shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging from it's overall appearance, Miles could easily see that the infantile garment was, without a doubt, Adult-Sized. On the front of the infantile overalls, there was this large fleece flap clasped to the rest of the garment by two large clasping buttons, which meant that it was obviously designed for easier access to having one's diaper changed. \"Great. Now she's gonna baby me just like Rachael and Sarah.\" Miles thought to himself, an obvious sign of disdain and disgust in his mental tone of voice, while he watched as the maternal pink haired hare searched through one of the drawers until she inevitably grabbed a white T-Shirt for Miles to wear underneath the baby blue overalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, let's get you all dressed up, shall we? *giggle*\" Taffy said, obviously having this sense of maternal enjoyment in her demeanor and behavior towards Miles. From there, Taffy calmly and maternally spoke toward the feline and commanded, \"Now, please raise your arms Miles.\" At first, he attempted to resist the pink haired lapine's demands. However, this inevitably proved futile, as Miles subconsciously raised his arms upward, thus allowing Taffy to insert the T-Shirt sleeves through each arm, then pulled the shirt downward toward his head to poke through the final opening of the clean garment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after finally equipping the white T-Shirt onto Miles' slender frame, Taffy then proceeded to equip the infantile baby blue overalls onto the male feline. First, she unbuttoned the overall's straps so she could easily equip the infantile garment onto Miles with efficiency. From there, the maternal lapine pulled up the bottom half of the infantile overalls, covering up Miles' boxers in the process. However, Miles could easily feel how baggy and loose the baby blue garment was on him, which obviously meant that it was to be worn over a pair of thick bulky diapers. But then, just as Taffy was about to seal Miles into the infantile garment, both individuals were approached by someone familiar, which came in the form of...</span></div></div>",

To elaborate, she first witnessed the drastically noticeable yet infantile changes and alterations in the Las Lindas household, with both the physiques of two feline siblings and a certain brown bovine, as well as the order of the Las Lindas hierarchy. Nonetheless, there was so much forced changes that she had to inevitably cope with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, while she watched as Minos changed the plump infantile Mora into a clean thick diaper from a safe distance, the youthful Spirit noticed that Mora was clearly blushing in embarrassment as she landed back onto the carpet floor, slowly waddling away due to the plush thickness of her diaper subtly forcing her plump thighs and legs to spread outward some, which made Digit cock a left eyebrow in confusion as she thought, \"...What has happened to you, Mora? Why would you allow yourself to be thrusted into being dressed up as a baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, this left with Digit pondering on the subject at hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, as she discreetly entered Taffy's bedroom, Digit gathered her thoughts and began to search through the webbings of the Internet. After all, even though she was classified as a \"Spirit\" like the rest of her kin, Digit was also partially an A.I (Artificial Intelligence), which allowed her to access the inner weavings of the World Wide Web with relative ease. While in the depths of cyberspace, Digit began to thoroughly search for anything related to what Sarah, Rachel, and Mora were enduring. Of course, this resulted with her delving into the more... \"kinky\" side of the Internet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she finally found the necessary answers she was searching for, the overall results weren't at all what she expected... To her utter surprise, there were actual legitimate online communities that condone such adult infancy, known only as \"ABDLs\", or \"Adult Babies &amp; Diaper Lovers\" for short. Digit's reaction to such a revelation was nothing short of shock and pure disbelief, especially considering that there was a legitimate internet community based around the concept and idea of reliving one's childhood and infancy. Now that she thought about it, this did make a lot of sense for why Sarah would dress up in such infantile clothes and wear diapers. After all, knowing the blonde feline, she always had this sense of youthfulness in her bubbly and childish personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... When it came to Sarah's older formerly athletic sister, Rachel, and the former matriarch of Las Lindas, Mora? ...That...felt like a much more bigger enigma to the resident Spirit of Las Lindas, despite being already aware of Rachel's phase of depression some weeks back. Though on the other hand, Digit theorized that the reason why Taffy was babying Rachel in the first place was to probably build up the black feline's self-esteem to normal healthy parameters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, out of the three individuals, Digit pondered why Mora would allow herself to be placed in such an infantile predicament in the first place. Was it blackmail? No. Taffy was too nice and compassionate to commit such an act. Did Mora lose a bet to her? Possibly, considering the female bovine's somewhat competitive nature. Was Mora into this \"Adult Baby\" fetish as well? ...Probably, probably not. Digit wasn't entirely sure on that sensitive subject. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, Digit knew that she had to get some answers by herself, so...</span></div></div>",

Her body was just so round and big, that she felt ashamed every time she stepped out of the ranch. Plus her clothes barely fitting simply exacerbated the feeling that everyone was watching her jiggling form. During the car ride over she couldn't help but stuff her face with the baggies of scrumptious animal crackers that Taffy had prepared as a snack for the drive, but even still, they did little to cure her worry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, she had to get clothes. That's why they were out in the first place, Taffy told her. She said that she and Sarah were such good kittens, that she wanted to reward them with a few new sets of apparel. Rachael could hardly disagree, because she knew she desperately needed them, but she still started to drag her feet a bit whenever she got an odd look or glance from the few shoppers who were passing by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome along, dear.\u201d Taffy urged, reaching back for a moment to take her charge by the hand. Said kitten blushed at the lightly intimate action. She probably would have been a lot more embarrassed because of it, if it wasn't for the fact that just to the left of her, Sarah was happily marching along, hand also linked with Taffy's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo where we going, Mom?\u201d The perky feline asked. This was the second time in recent memory she'd been to the mall, the last time being for her birthday, where she got to have lots of fun looking at all the cool stores and going clothes shopping. She remembered the incident where Taffy and Rachael were reluctant to let her try on and buy her own clothes, which caused her to get quite peeved, but today was a little different. Today she was a kitten, and mommies knew best when it came to taking care of them. Plus Rachael was different as well. A lot different from the way she used to act a few months ago. She was a kitten now too, and kittens weren't allowed to boss people around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh just a little specialty store that I've been looking forward to visiting. It should have plenty of what you two girls need.\u201d The lapine kept a smile up as her cryptic remark perked the ears of the two girls at her side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore either of them could inquire further about what she meant, the group turned a corner into a secluded portion of the vast and winding mall they were walking through, and sitting at the end of a long and mostly empty hallway, was an absolutely peculiar store. An assortment of soft, pastel colors engulfed the building, with its windows filled with mannequins wearing footed sleepers, and an assortment of other childish clothes and dresses. Overhead, drawn in the form of stylized baby blocks, was a sign reading \u201cYoung at Heart\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering beyond just the front, one could see that the store catered to more than just clothes, with aisles filled with supplies of anything one could imagine for those wanting to replicate their younger years, but at a much larger size: baby bottles, bibs, pacifiers, cribs, and of course, diapers, were neatly organized throughout the store, with promises of more to be found if one wanted to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two are going to look so cute!\u201d Taffy beamed, turning to look at her kitties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael simply gulped in response, really feeling like she needed some more of those animal crackers right now.</span></div></div>",

Today feels like a special day for some reason.\" Taffy said, laying a plate in front of Rachael, who was seated at two chairs at the table (the embarrassment was slightly less than trying to fit in one chair and breaking it). Taffy had served her a stack four high of thick french toast, homemade of course and bigger than most pancakes. It was drowning in syrup, snowed under in powdered sugar, and buried under fruit. Taffy normally worried over everyone's diet, but she seemed to enjoy using Rachael as an excuse to practice more delectable dishes. She also knew that Rachael had grown quite a sweet tooth, so it often worked to bring her mood up, at least temporarily. She managed to catch Rachael smiling at the food, unaware of herself. She thought the obese kitten had gained the cutest smile thanks to big, easily dimpled cheeks. She almost felt like watching Rachael eat. Taffy wasn't sure why, but those kind of impulses often came to her. She was just spending so much time with Rachael, she convinced herself, getting back to the stove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael, meanwhile, had already dug in. Her troubles seemed to lift off of her when she was eating. Only food and Taffy could bring her out of her funk. Beyond that, Rachael hadn't gotten to this size with some light grazing. She had slowly gotten used to her expanding appetite, and tendency to eat even when she didn't need to, and it had brought an unexpected side-effect. A few times, as she had started blimping up, Rachael would find herself polishing off a gallon of ice cream or something similar when she was full before she even started. The result would be this painfully full state, but this pain came mixed with and followed by this odd, full-body happiness. She could just lay back, belly taut and full, feeling like she was actually satisfied for once. The pain would subside and be replaced with this lethargic, slightly addled peacefulness that could last hours. She couldn't recapture that feeling often, but every once and a while Rachael would push herself to try and get this feeling back. She didn't care if she'd feel fatter in the morning - she always felt fatter. The problem was that this state left her all but comatose for a good couple hours, so she couldn't do it often, and especially not during a busy day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what the hey.\" Taffy whispered to herself, watching Rachael eat and smiling at the kitten's eagerness. \"She's been doing so well recently, she deserves a treat.\" she got to stacking a plate full of six more pieces of french toast.</span></div></div>",

Her mountainous belly sat in her lap, wobbling about as she downed over a dozen pieces of french toast and plenty of fruit and sugar besides. She had to sit back from the table to accommodate her heavy frame, meaning more than a little of her food ended up on herself, down her chin and onto her shirt. Taffy just tutted at her, not mad at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You make such a mess sometimes Rachael.\" she said, holding a cloth to her face. Rachael turned her head away, as if trying to escape, and took the cloth from Taffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a kid, Taffy.\" she complained, wiping herself off. Taffy chuckled and petted Rachael's head, going right between the ears. That soothed Rach quite well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You certainly aren't.\" she cooed. Rachael wondered what she meant by that. She'd think that over later. There was the task at hand to focus on, namely, getting herself out of her chairs. Not too hard, but that had been a surprisingly large breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, my kitten, we have a lot to do.\" Taffy said, helping Rachael heave herself up. 'her kittten'? Rachael almost blushed at the pet name. Something was special about today, but she couldn't think of it either. Something had Taffy in a great mood. She was all smiles as Rachael righted herself. Rachael looked down at herself. Well, she couldn't see a lot past her boobs, but her belly felt especially heavy today, thanks to that breakfast. She knew it'd be slapping on her thighs all morning, jiggling about in a manner she just couldn't help but think was distracting. Rachael hoped that whatever was special about today wouldn't involve a lot of walking. She was really starting to dislike walking.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Today, today....\" Rachael muttered to herself as she put away the dishes. \"Is it arbor day? Uh, thanksgiving? Oh, is it an anniversary?\" she couldn't figure out what was so special about today. She finished the dishes still deep in thought and took a seat. Taffy always allowed her a few minutes breather between tasks. At first Rachael had tried to ignore them, but she couldn't deny she needed them. She huffed, almost always out of breath, and did what to her was becoming an unwelcome habit - deep in thought, she drummed her fingers along her belly. She was practically stroking herself, and she always forgot it. It was as if her body was betraying her, getting some use out of these mounds of fat attached to her. But she couldn't help herself, idle hands always seemed to end up testing herself. Typically, Rachael solved this by giving them something to do - like feed her a snack. Rachael heaved her heavy self away from the table (which, at the rate things were going, would soon be impossible for her under her own power) and headed to the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little something....\" Rachael said, sticking her head right in the fridge. She looked around, spying leftovers mostly, half a loaf of bread, and in the back...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, we still have cake from.....IT'S TAFFY'S BIRTHDAY TODAY!\" Rachael yelped with sudden realisation. She jumped up like she didn't know she could - and smacked her head against the fridge shelf. Cussing and rubbing the bump, Rachael forgot her snack. She looked around. No decorations, nothing had happened at breakfast - there wasn't a single sign of celebration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No....no one's remembered....\" Rachael said. \"Not even me, after all she...\" she balled up her hands, feeling like she wanted to punch herself. Or anyone else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, where is she now?\" she thought aloud. Rachael rushed out, huffing and heaving, just in time to see Taffy getting into the ranch car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey....hey Taffy!\" Rachael wheezed. Taffy paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello hun.\" she smiled. \"Did you want to come into town with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Uh, s-sure.\" Rachael said. She really didn't, but she felt so stupid for forgetting today she needed to do something. Taffy had to help Rachael into her seat. Taffy seemed her cheerful self as she guided Rachael in, helped her with her belt buckle, and squeezed the door closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we are\" Taffy said as she got in the driver's seat, patting Rachael's belly. Rachael wished she wouldn't do that....because it made her feel good about having a belly. Which was weird, but not important now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Taffy...\" Rachael started as Taffy pulled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy birthday.\" with those words, Taffy nearly swerved off the road in surprise. She collected herself, but for a moment Rachael had seen her bottom lip quiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you dear....\" she said. Rachael sighed. The trip stayed in awkward silence until they got out of their car in town. Taffy also helped Rachael with getting out, which involved a lot of both of them trying to shift Rachael's belly into the proper position. Rach could hardly stay focused....Taffy moved and pressed against her soft form like she was kneading dough. But she kept her mind on the issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Taffy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no one noticed your birthday, right?\" she asked bluntly. Taffy's ears drooped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...we don't know for sure....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, they probably won't notice if we spend a little time out on the town, eh?\" she asked. Taffy was taken aback. Rachael typically treated going out like a punishment, forcing her body to be seen. This was the most spunk she had shown in months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know dear, we really-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taffy.\" Rachael stood steady in front of her, thumping one foot for emphasis (which made quite a resounding thump). \"You deserve this. You deserve so much more.\" she was turning beet red, but held her ground. Taffy teared up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...hun...\" she reached out and touched Rachael's face. \"Thank you. Sure, let's have some time out to ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Where do you want to go?\" Rachael asked, hoping it was somewhere quiet. She was actually just shy of quaking, but something drove her to do this. Taffy deserved this, she needed it. She couldn't bear to see Taffy as sad....as sad as she always felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about the park?\" Taffy said, pointing off a ways towards the edge of town. Rachael perked up. Parks were quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Do you want to call a cab?\" Taffy asked sweetly. Rachael furrowed her brow - it was only a ten minute....walk....for anyone normal sized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no. It's fine! Let's go.\" she said. Taffy sighed, trying to hide her worry, as Rachael staunchly waddled off towards the park. Her giant black booty bounced up and down like jello on a trampoline as she tried to keep up a hurried pace. Taffy's heart just melted watching the girl. She looked so serious, even with her pouchy cheeks and two chins. She hadn't been like this in a long time - putting her all into what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she's putting it all....into me Taffy realised. It hadn't clicked, but....Okay, I'll have the best day today. For Rachael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took about a minute and a half for Rachael's pace to slow down. Taffy kept by her side, apparently fine with the leisurely tempo Rachael set. Rach was winded, but she wasn't going to give up! Taffy needed her big day. If only she could just....sit down for a minute....Rachael's eyes wandered about as they walked down the street. She saw her opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Taffy! How about some ice cream for a birthday treat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, dear, I don't really eat sweets...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon! You gotta treat yourself today!\" Rachael grabbed Taffy by the wrist. Taffy just giggled to herself. There was only a short line, giving Rachael just enough time to scan the menu. She smacked her lips, staring at the sundaes, the list of flavours, all the toppings...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next?\" the cashier asked. Rachael waddled forward, opened her mouth - and froze. Her terrible self-esteem kicked in. Here she was, fattest girl around, practically drooling as she got up to the counter, and she was in fact about to order enough ice cream for a middle school football team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll take two banana boat specials.\" Taffy said from around Rachael's girth. Rachael nodded quickly. Taffy drew out her purse as the cashier rung them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no!\" Rachael objected. \"Not on your birthday.\" she dug into her pant pockets (which required her to wobble her body way more than she felt comfortable with - these pants were skin tight!) and drew out her ill-used wallet. It had enough....barely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got it.\" Rachael insisted, paying for their ice cream. They were soon handed two large, elongated bowls with a full banana each that was split to accomodate five scoops, cherries, three kinds of syrup, and so much whipped cream it doubled the size of the dish. Rachael grabbed both and they found a seat by the window. Rachael reluctantly took two, trying not to notice all the people she was sure were looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey dug into their ice cream right away - at least, Rachael did. This wouldn't even qualify as a snack to her, but for a few moments she could ignore what an ugly fatty she felt like and just enjoy her meal. She was halfway through, and Taffy had only taken a couple tiny bites. Rachael drew herself out of her gluttony to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you like it?\" she asked. Taffy smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" she saw Rachael's eager worry. \"I was going to let you finish it...\" \"...love it. It's just been a while.\" she took a heartier scoop. It was tasty, Taffy just tended not to indulge. But Rachael so badly wanted for her to enjoy herself....what could it hurt? Eating normally, Taffy was still far behind by the time Rachael finished. So the kitten just sat there, occasionally watching Taffy, occasionally looking out the window. And on occasion, seeing Taffy smile, Rach would smile back. It motivated Taffy to keep at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that was....oof, quite good.\" Taffy said, standing up cautiously. She had been full twenty bites ago, but she just couldn't help herself....this meant so much to Rachael. The kitten even now got their trash for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Well, the park's waiting!\" she said. Hopefully she could make it...but she knew how much it meant to Taffy.</span></div></div>",

It was a nice green area by a river that wandered far away, undeveloped area all around providing a little peace while still so close to the city. It was on its edge after all. Taffy took a quick look around, and spied a park bench that faced the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we go take a seat?\" she asked. Rachael nodded, not having the breath for a verbal response. In her exasperated state, her walk grew more unsteady, so her legs pounded against her belly and sent it quaking constantly. Her waddle was wide-legged as she tried to give her belly more room, but this only served to make her sashay her hips back and forth. She took up most of the bench when she sat down, and could hear it creak as she put her weight on it. Taffy sat next to her, perched on what space was left. Rachael looked taller than Taffy when sitting only due to her massive rump. Speaking of which, Rachael was wedgied bad - hopefully she'd find some time to fix it, though no opportunity seemed ready to present itself. She gave a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Taffy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we finally got to the park, and I can't even...\" Rachael stopped as Taffy giggled and laid a hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Rachael. This is what I wanted to do! How often do we get to relax, just sit and take it all in? Even when you're resting you're busy. I like a bit of peace and quiet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, my kitten. You're never a bother.\" Taffy stroked Rachael's head once and smiled before turning to watch the river. Rachael blushed, perplexed. She always felt like such a burden - a big, heavy burden surely weighing Taffy down. Oh, she knew Taffy didn't complain, but that was because Taffy never complained, right? Yet she seemed so sincere....she wasn't sure, but Rachael was beginning to wonder if really, maybe, Taffy didn't mind. Maybe, though she dared not hope, Taffy enjoyed her company? She couldn't possibly enjoy it as much as Rachael enjoyed hers....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaffy giggled, breaking Rachael's train of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deep in thought Rach?\" Taffy asked, patting Rachael's big belly on the top of it's curve. Blushing, Rachael was too confused to answer right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always drum your fingers when you get like that. It's quite cute.\" For emphasis, Taffy ran her fingers up and down Rachael's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh! That tickles!\" Rachael complained, turning red. \"I don't like....I don't mean to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Rachael....\" Taffy said, smiling at her. She closed her eyes, and very suddenly leaned against the kitten, resting her head on Rachael's shoulder. Even that had enough padding to be as soft as a down pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much for today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But....we've barely done anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you hun, I like a little peace and quiet. Just a little bit of the slow life. Call me simple. And I couldn't have had it with anyone else.\" she stayed half-snuggled against Rachael. Rachael was glad Taffy's eyes were closed, because then she couldn't see how red Rach was. But she looked down at Taffy, smiling and almost sleepy-looking, and the blush began to fade. Carefully trying not to disturb the bunny, Rachael began to reach across with her other arm (a tedious task as she had to mash her boobs nearly into her face with her arm) and reached for Taffy's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the good life.\" Taffy said suddenly. Rachael stopped instinctively, her hand just above Taffy's head. She paused, smiled, and lowered her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I, I guess it is.\"</span></div></div>",

Chocolate cake was her favorite and after the hard day she just had there was nothing she wanted more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! You should talk lard butt.\u201d Miles said matching her insult for insult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least <i>I</i> do some hard work around the house!\u201d Rachael said raising her voice and tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPshht! Maybe for <i>you</i> math is hard work; I actually have a real job!\u201d Miles said with an smug air about himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them arose from their chairs almost ready to come to blows, but before the fighting escalated any further Taffy came up with the easiest of solutions. Expertly she raised her knife high, and cut the piece in two, the swift act silencing the cats. Taffy regained her smile and served the split serving to each of them. Both of the bickerers chewed their halve of a slice of cake while keeping a look of disdain towards the other. Neither was completely happy with the results, knowing that <u>they</u> had deserved the full slice. The both of them would have to settle this one way or another\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Miles approached Rachael after dinner that night, ready to take care of this problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was real nice what you pulled at dinner!\u201d He said heated up and ready to finish their previous argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m not the one who looks like a whiner after your little bitch fest.\u201d Rachael said equally heated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI ...guess so\u2026\u201d Miles said, suddenly stung with the realization that his outburst hadn\u2019t scored him any points with Taffy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then\u2026 we should settle this ahead of time don\u2019t you think?\u201d said Rachael. She too was realized she had been an ass, and had been a bad example for Sarah at the dinner table, all over a piece of cake. She couldn\u2019t help it though; chocolate was her weakness especially the rich moist heaven that was Taffy\u2019s frosted chocolate cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how do we settle this?\u201d Miles asked interested to see how this would play out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWell\u2026it\u2019s\u2026uh\u2026simple.\u201d said Rachael as she began piecing together an improvised idea on the spot; she blurted out the first thing she could think of. \u201cUh the person \u2026that weighs the most should get it right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmmm\u2026\u201d Miles could see where she was coming from. So it was a competition she wanted huh? Well he wouldn't back down from this little challenge of hers, but they would play by his rules\u2026  \u201cNow wait a minute, muscle weighs more than fat. I mean look at Minos guy must be over 300lbs and he hardly touches sweets. We need to go by real results; we need to go by size.\u201d he said miming an imaginary heavy weight wrestling belt around his trim waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see\u2026so the one with the biggest gain in waist size wins huh? I get it, the biggest stomach has more room that needs filling. Right?\u201d Rachael said playing along with this game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight. So let\u2019s say 3 months. Winner gets all rights to leftover desserts.\u201d And as Miles said this, Rachael could sense he was really throwing down the gauntlet, taking things a step up from just a little bet. She could do even better...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why stop there? Let\u2019s go a step further,say doing laundry duty for the other for the rest of the year?\" she said compulsively raising the stakes just that much higher. Normally, Rachael wouldn't trust Miles within,well, a mile within in her clothes, but now with digit supervising it was easy as bringing it to and loading into the washer and dryer which was still a hassling chore. Rachael didn\u2019t think twice about the bet, too caught up in her competitiveness to worry about the future of her trim and slim waistline. She just wanted to wipe the arrogant grin right off Miles face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you\u2019re talking!\u201d he said delighted at the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd just to make it official... \" Rachael began and then gave a short whistle. \"Digit!\u201d she called. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDigit here and reporting for duty!\u201d said the electric blue and white nano spirit, as she flew out from a nearby clock. \u201cSomething you need Rach?\u201d she asked in her sprightly high spirited voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, we were thinking about going clothes shopping could you take our measurements for us?\u201d Rachael asked not daring to tell Digit the true purpose. Instantly she zipped around them, her finger making their fur stand on end wherever she dragged it along their bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant she was done and she gave a calming ring as she finished. *Boop bleep* \u201cComplete.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd Could you save those for us please oh, also start a countdown timer for three months from now too?\u201d Rachael asked taking in all preparations for this competition between her and Miles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Ding* \u201cDone and done.\u201d Digit\u2019s voice rang. With that Rachael informed her that was all and waited till the resident spirit was completely out of sight before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then it's set, biggest belly wins.\" Rachael said in a manner-of-fact way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me.\" Miles said before heading off towards his room for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that the belly-belt-size battle had begun! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cThree weeks into this stupid bet and still nothing!\u201d Rachael thought, as she studied her lithe figure in the full length mirror in her room. It was true her bodies\u2019 high metabolism and her naturally energetic nature made it so she was having little success in her competition. Miles seemed to be doing quite well on the other hand.  Now looking quite pudgy, his stomach had sprouted enough so that it was slightly distended, notably peeking out from under most of his shirts, serving as a constant reminder to their bet, and a sign of his growing lead. He couldn\u2019t be happier about it, and he smugly smiled at Rachael from across the table at every dinner. It was a look that said \u201cOnly two more months till I win, and look at what I lead I have already.\u201d Rachael grimaced, there was no way she would be giving up her chocolaty desserts there was no way in hell she\u2019d be doing Miles dirty laundry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReinvigorated at the thought of what was at stake, Rachael tried to double her intake that night as she made her way to the dinner table.A pot roast was already laid out, along with mashed potatoes and corn, all of them steaming hot and obviously freshly prepared. She noticed that Miles took roughly double what she had taken herself that night. A mountain of mashed potatoes for herself and what she concluded was probably akin to an entire ear of corn. Rachael\u2019s portions paled next to those of Miles. She still tried to eat with great gusto, but Miles seemed to pull away when it came to putting it away, eating with a new intense fervor and  easily helping him to seconds and thirds of Taffy\u2019s cooking. Rachael, throughout the entire meal kept one eye on her competitor. His shirt was pulled tight across his torso, straining at the buttons of his jeans ever so subtly. What\u2019s more, it looked like Miles spare tire was growing as it perceptibly rolled over the waistband of his tightening jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-my! You certainly have been eating well Miles.\u201d Taffy said spooning more mashed potatoes onto his plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, *hmph* well, a big hardworking guy like me needs too. *chomp*\u201d he said between bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou too Rachael. Are you guys working out more or something? Oh,uh, did you want some more too?\u201d she asked  Rachael carrying what was left of the pot of mash potatoes. Rachael was too busy cursing her metabolism.  After only one measly plate, her body was telling her that it\u2019d had enough. It was hopeless for her to try and stuff herself any further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cUgh, no thanks Taffy.\u201d Rachael said moaning from her full stomach. She had actually had been turning down desserts every night this week, and after a dinner like she had tonight things were no different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh then, did you want dessert?\u201d she asked concerned that something might be troubling Rachael. Rachael shook her head, almost getting sick at the thought of gorging herself on a slice of apple pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>I\u2019ll</i> have her piece.\u201d Miles offered from across the table, still with an impossibly unsatisfied stomach.  He snickered as he helped himself to another slice, watching Rachael leave the table with the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was getting <u>serious!</u> At this rate Miles was sure to win. Tonight she would have to do something to keep up with Miles; he seemed to be putting the pounds on at an unbelievably fast rate. That was it! Miles had to be up to something on the side! Maybe she could spy on him and see what he was doing to boost his gains...Or maybe she\u2019d just look for her own way to gain a competitive edge over Miles. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She went about her day normally, only taking breaks to keep a watchful eye on Miles whenever he left the room. Much to Rachael's dismay, Miles seemed to be as much of a slacker as he ever was and appeared to be doing nothing out of the ordinary to boost gains. It wasn't until much later that night that the answer to this puzzle of hers was revealed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael lay awake in bed that night panicking over the thought of losing Taffy's tasty treats, when she suddenly herd a slam from the door downstairs. She got up from her bed and peered out her bedroom window. Much to her surprise she saw the distinct chubby silhouette of Miles bouncing and bounding towards the ranch's garage. Sarah had long drifted to sleep, so it was easy for the lithe Rachael to silently sneak outside. Following Miles form, she found herself tracking him heading towards the garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael peered in through the garage's small window to observe what exactly the cat was up to. Darkness abounded inside except from the soft glow coming from the mini-fridge light. Miles had kept a mini-fridge in his garage/\"workspace\" well stocked with beer and soft drinks for summer days, but now it was full with quite the midnight snack...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking closer Rachael could see...</span></div></div>",

She stormed into the garage catching Miles off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what exactly are these!\u201d she said pointing directly towards the cold canisters of weight gain shakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles mug curled, looking as it did right before he would make a snarky remark towards her, but then his face changed. He seemed to mellow out and calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They\u2019re weights gain shakes, and they\u2019re not against the rules\u2026Look you can have the rest just to make it even.\" he said offering her the still unopened can in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\u201d Rachael began surprised at this showing of fair game by the usually conniving cat. \u201cGlad to see you\u2019re playing fair for once\" And after that she too paused for a second and calmed down before adding a \u201cThanks\" as he handed her the can of thick looking liquid. She cracked it open and casually sipped at its contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuck!\" she shouted sticking her tongue out and spitting in disgust. \"This is horrible! How could you drink this stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh\u201d said Miles scratching his head in modesty, \"Whatever it takes to win right? No pain. No gain.\u201d he slapped his stomach in a display of his \u201chard work\u201d and its results. Rachael\u2019s was mildly impressed by the chocolate colored cat's determination. She could appreciate the fact that Miles had at least dedicated himself to something, even if it was in an attempt to beat her, he managed to down twelve of these nauseating mixtures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to be shown up, Rachael doubled down and decided she would chug the large drink in one go. Tilting her head back she let all of the bitter chocolate tasting liquid flow into her mouth, forcing herself to swallow to keep herself from drowning in the stuff. Half way in she could already feel the gooey liquid pooling in her gut, stretching her stomach till it was reaching its limits, but she continued, dead set on finishing the can. Rachael couldn\u2019t see as she chugged but Miles was watching as she downed the drink. It was his turn to be impressed as his cat counterpart finished the drink it in one shot, a task he'd never thought possible with a drink so thick and filling. He had to give Rachael one thing, she certainly wasn't a quitter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh, and then to the victor go the spoils huh?\" Miles said at a loss for words and shoddily extending his portly paw for a sporty shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael used her arm to wipe the shake residue from her mouth before shaking paws, feeling absolutely bloated from this stuff. As she shook his paw, she realized Miles usual obnoxious attitude had dramatically dropped since their bet began. Could his new pudginess be the cause, perhaps acting as an insulator to his usually toxic demeanor? Whatever it was she was beginning to like this new \u201chealthier\u201d Miles. She wouldn\u2019t say he was good looking\u2026well maybe a little; his broader backside did make his bubble butt look a little\u2026cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two seemed lost in thought as they stared each other down letting their handshake last a little longer than normal, but afterward neither of them said anything for the rest of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had just finished tallying up the farm\u2019s expenses from the previous week and was feeling rather hungry. As she walked (now with a slight waddle) into the kitchen when she got there she happened to find that Miles wide rear end was occupying most of the fridge\u2019s entrance<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re not so lazy that you\u2019re just eating just from the fridge now.\u201d Rachael said mockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles rounded face turned from the fridge door and towards Rachael. \u201cNahhh, there\u2019s nothing good here, and Taffy\u2019s not making anything till later tonight.\u201d Miles said as he flicked the fridge door shut. \u201cBut hey\u2026.do you want to\u2026maybe go eat somewhere?\u201d he asked turning towards the kitchen\u2019s floor shyly and bringing a flabby arm to scratch the back of his head nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael pondered the offer over. A hot meal sounded good right now, heck getting off the ranch would be good right now. Sarah was well pre-occupied with Randall, and she had finished her own work for the day. She could put up with Miles if it meant a big lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess I can go\u2026\u201d she eventually agreed, trying her best to not sound too happy at the idea<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the two clambered into truck with both of them feeling slightly squeezed in the front seat. In a matter of minutes the two had arrived at the largest buffet in Gossamer and were seated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long until they both began piling their plates high with a variety of thick and calorific foods. Roasted chicken, barbeque beef, and delicious seafood, they were in a way holding a sort of mini completion between themselves as they ate. As she chewing through her roasted salmon platter Rachael found herself eating far more then she\u2019d been ever able to, (which was due in great part to those shakes from the previous nights.) She was rather enjoying the feeling of her stomach stretching as it was filled with more and more with warm food. She was making sure to match Miles plate for plate but soon they both looked to have reached their limit. As they reclined in their booth each of their full furry stomachs were looking bigger and squishier than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael brought a paw and rubbed her stomach gently. It was quite soft and gave way to her touch now. She smiled to herself greedily anticipating it growing much much bigger in size. Looking up Miles seemed to be doing the same as he was nursing her swollen stomach. If they both kept eating like this they would be huge in no time. As she gazed across the table the sight of the overstuffed kitten gave Rachael an idea\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiles\u2026\u201d Rachael began</span></div></div>",

Miles had reached the door first and actually held it open for Rachael. \"Ladies first...If you fit.\" He chided to her as she entered.  Rachael tried to think of something she could say just as snootily back, but she lost her train of thought as she entered the sweet shop and saw gallon after delicious gallon of  rich ice-cream kept behind a glass counter. Inside any fullness from the previous meals had seemingly disappeared, she simply couldn't decied what to try first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Double chocolate, double scoop sundae please.\" she ordered finally, the fox behind trhe counter nodded and went to retrieve his scoop when<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Well then I'll have a mint chocolate triple scoop sundae\" Miles blurted out then turned to Rachael with his oh-so-sly grin before adding \"I guess I'm just a <i>little</i> more hungrier than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh so that\u2019s your game huh?\" Rachael said now ignoring the worker behind the counter to stare Miles down. \"Well then I'll have a four scoops!\" she said not jutting a finger into Miles soft flab for effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\" he said, (having to stifle a laugh from Rachael's prodding finger touching his very ticklish tummy. \"Let's see you put your money where your moth is.\" he said actually really wanting to see her eat all of that ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">Uh...we only go up to five scoops\u2026</font>  said the fox timidly from behind the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"> ***</div><br>\r\nDelicious~ was all Rachael could think as she swallowed another delicious mouthful of fattening ice cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven after their little \"fight\" the plus sized pair still ate together, even offering each other samples of their sundaes. It was now painfully obvious that both enjoyed the new <b>bigger</b> version of each other but neither would be the first to admit it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee Rachael was preoccupied eating ice cream Miles saw a chance to gloat. \"Oh, man Look at all this!\" he said leaning back in his chair and gripping a roll of fat that had formed on his stomach. \"Yep, It\u2019s sure gonna be sweet when I win..\" he said trailing off as if he'd already won and was remembering it nostalgically.  The teasing only redoubled Rachael\u2019s effort and she ate with increased fervor, fat chance she was gonna let that happen.

But now..,now she couldn\u2019t get enough to eat, she wanted <b>MORE MORE MORE! </b> Miles once slight lead in size had disappeared, along with Rachael\u2019s six pack abs.  Now with only two weeks away from the weigh in to claim Taffy\u2019s  delicious and supple desserts, Rachael was actually a little bit bigger than Miles now!  Still neither had admitted that they\u2019d actually liked the heavier set partners, using the bet as the only excuse to why they were seeing so much of each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they spotted a golden W glowing on the horizon and they pulled in for a feast. They both put in towering orders of burgers,fires, and a few shakes each. As their fast food arrived they squeezed into a booth (each easily filling their entire side) and began eating with incredible  speed. Chewing through burgers and downing shakes rapidly, their stomachs began to swell taught as they  were filled with fattening fast food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael noticed as Miles finished his second of many burgers that he'd been staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Giving up all ready?\u201d she asked annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo...uh, you just have something on your face.\u201d Miles said pointing a finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u201d she said shrugging at the weird comment and reaching for a napkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay I got it.\u201d Miles offered, and in the next moment Miles had leaned over and kissed Rachael squarely on the mouth,getting the left-over chocolate shake  on her warm, moist, plump lips. When it was over, Miles pulled apart leaving a slightly stunned Rachael sitting there with a half eaten burger in her hand completely forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Didn't see that coming,\" Rachael said, her mouth hanging open  in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Miles began apologizing \"Sorry, I\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could finish Rachael leaned over and kissed Miles right back. It was the start of a wonderful relationship.</span></div></div>",

No words were exchanged between them as when rode back, but both were noticeably blushing through their fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently Miles was in his room, simply laying in his creaking bed an trying to figure out what had caused him to kiss Rachael, not that he minded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> guess I really do like her...</i> he thought as he looked up. <i>And it took a food eating bet to make me realize it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued to muse to himself there was a knock at the door. Curiously the fattened gray and white cat got up and opened the door to show Rachael, still in her constricting clothes that exemplified her killer ass and soft, blubbery belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rach? What're you doing here?\" Miles asked, somewhat uncomfortable, his already overworked heart was beating even faster than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to talk, can I come in?\" she asked more meekly than usual. Miles nodded awkwardly and watched his overweight lover waddle into the room. The bigger of the two cats sat on her boyfriend's bed, making it sag noticeably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you want to talk about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Us.\u201d Rachael said. \u201cBasically ground rules. \u201cLike we keep this secret for now. I don\u2019t think I could stand it if the others teased us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what you mean, but we can still do stuff in private right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d mind that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we\u2019re alone now, and the others are asleep so\u2026\u201d Miles trailed off, grabbing Rach\u2019s rotund ass. Rachael gave him a kind of glare despite enjoying his boldness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou pervert.\u201d Rachael said smiling; the plump black cat then patted a spot beside her. \u201cI guess there\u2019s no harm in a little fun.\u201d Rach said before kissing him. Miles kissed back and started undressing and groping her while she tore off his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe always imagined that Rachael would be good, but her being fat didn\u2019t diminish the pleasure he was getting from this little makeout session, but in a bit it wouldn\u2019t just be making out. Within minutes both were entirely naked, nude with nothing but their fur to cover them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles had to admit, Rachael looked much better with her clothes off, but she didn\u2019t notice him looking her body over as Rachael was preoccupied looking at Miles\u2019 manhood. Judging from her expression she was far from disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026Want to go all the way?\u201d Miles asked rhetorically, Rachael gave a playful smile and cut off the lamp with a meaty hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after that....</span></div></div>",

Damn she was heavy now, and his own big belly didn't do much to support her as she pressed down upon him. He could feel how her once proud and pronounced muscles were clenching up and flexing beneath her flab, if this was her first time she wasn't acting like it.  \"Easy now...\" he warned her As their two stomachs collided Miles noted that Rachael's warm blubbery fur felt like a huge blanket  and for Rachael Miles was the opposite, much like laying on a giant furry pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when does it start?\" she asked coyly. \"Guess <i> the rest of you </i> didn't grow, along with you huh?\" she teased Miles, unfazed by his \"dynamic entry\". Truth be told Miles had never <i> really </i> had 'problems performing,\" but now buried low and below all his new fat he couldn't tell if he was rising to attention either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Give it time'' He explained clenching his teeth'damn she was heavy. While waiting for the 'magic' to start he decided to keep things in the bed busy. His hands explored Rachael's chocolate pudding like body, weighing her new enormous knockers in one hand, and groping as much of her spongy and jiggly ass cheeks in his other.  After about ten minutes of this literal heavy petting both of them were beginning to sweat but Miles could at least feel himself as he started to perk up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey! Oh! WOW!'  Rachael moaned as the silky black hair on her back began to rise, all in response to a certain tingling sensation in her nether regions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey!'Oh!'That's'that actually feels...p.pretty good.' She muttered between two blushing dimpled cheeks and a stupid grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'S-same here!' Miles agreed though things hadn't gone exactly as he'd often fantasized with Rachael. He <i>had </i>expected a rough and fast round of love making from the strict and stern Rachael, but things had turned out to be sweet and slow.  In and out he casually rocked his hips; Rachael and her stomach slowly sloshing along. It was hours later before the round of long large love making was over.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ahh-' the both sighed simultaneously. Rachael rolled off of Miles and on to the bed in a blissful ecstasy. Their forced to cuddle from the beds small size, the two fell asleep cuddling each other in their flabby arms.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Finally the day of the weigh in had arrived and Racheal and Miles were standing by the scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince their little night together Racheal and Miles managed to make them common, yet secret occurrences. Around the others they decided to keep up their arguments and constant put downs, but when alone all they could do is stare into each other's eyes lovingly and sweet talk. Almost all of the other members of LL were aware that they were seeing more of each other, both inside and outside the bedroom, but said nothing out of fear<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso since then they'd find every excuse to go on more outing, mostly centered around food. Both of them had become something of regulars to every eatery in town, they were building a reputation as good customers. The result was that they both had gained a fair amount, but no matter how he tried Miles wasn't able to catch up to Rach's appetite. It was now painfully obvious that the once fitness obsessed girl was as big as a house. Still he'd go through with his word and finish the competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the rule is ladies first, but since you're the closest thing you can do it Rach.\" Miles said snarkily, giving her a slight glare. The pudgy chat noir only scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please. Like you fit the description of a man?\" she replied before putting one pudgy foot on the scale and then another. She waited for the number to come up and smiled. It read 529 lbs. \"Hah. Eat it Miles, like I'll be eating that dessert tonight!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles had to admit he didn't stand a chance looking at the triumphant raven haired woman. Her body was beyond plus sized, her large soft billowing stomach and love handles had grown exponentially since their contest's start, as did her once nonexistent breasts, now massive and milk swollen enough to compare to Mora's. Miles could only remember fondly how good her knockers felt, so soft to the touch and fun to squeeze. But as always her ass was her main attraction, by far it was the biggest part of her body without looking ridiculous. Her massive thunder thighs complemented them well and added to the jiggling and swaying as she walked in a seductive manner. Even her precious face was laden with fatty cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lover knew it was futile, but still he stood on the scale. It read 493 lbs. Rach had gained over 100lbs more than him. He began to sigh when he saw the number shoot up to 628. Looking down past his expansive gut he saw Rach had put one of her pudgy feet on the scale and acted as if she didn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Miles, can you tell what the numbers say or what?\" she asked keeping up her arrogant facade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"628lbs. Looks like I win.\" he told her, a huge grin on his face. For a moment Rach grinned as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well good job fatso. You earned your dessert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks alot fatass.\" he told her in a similar tone, but as he did he kissed her deeply. A moment later they noticed Taffy walk by and broke apart. \"Er Taf! I was ju-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We weren't-\" Rach began before the bunny Prime laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok, it's none of my business really. But I am impressed that you two did so much just for my cooking.\" Taffy said. \"If you like them so much I think I'll make extras just for you both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You mean it?\" Rach asked, her eyes sparkilng as if she was given a gallon of Gr8. Miles's expression was about the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. You two deserve it. Besides...I doubt one or two pieces will satisfy you.\" Taffy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee thanks. So when can we get them?\" Miles asked greedily. The rogue was practically salivating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I have one now.\" she said showing it to them. She handed it to Miles. \"Since you won.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...but I think Rach needs it more than me.\" he said handing her the prize. \"After all a lightweight like you needs it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, aren't you a real gentleman.\" Rach said smirking, she then shoved a piece in his open mouth as he tried to reply. \"So there's your reward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that....</span></div></div>",

That's why they were in Gossamer to go shopping, and to maybe pick up some new clothes at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plus sized duo were strolling through the mall and were eating anything they could buy since it was just after payday. Miles had his arm around Rach's oversized middle, the sassy female smiling as she sipped some of a milkshake with one hand and fed her boyfriend a few cookies with the other one. As they continued to waddle along Miles's hand managed to part of Rach's ebon furred belly that wasn't covered by her shirt. She felt a slight satisfaction from the contact, but withheld a cookie from Miles as he craned his neck to bite it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's the big idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what happens when you touch me there,\" the black cat scolded, \"it always makes me feel like kissing, among other things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's bad because?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're in public. I don't feel like having people stare at us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it matter if they do? We shouldn't keep from being with each other just to keep folks from staring.\" Miles reassured holding her hand. \"Besides there have been pairs with much bigger differences.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is true.\" Rachael said as she drained the last bit off her sugary drink and kissed Miles. The two cat Primes held that kiss for quite some time until both of their stomach's began to growl. \"Hm weird, we just ate and I'm already hungry again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it. Your next meal's on me.\" he said as he took her inside a nearby fast food place. The duo ordered one of everything on the menu and finished it in record time. The two of them had enjoyed the meal, but when it time to came to pay up the gray and white cat noticed something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Rach look, there's an eating contest next week.\" Miles said, \"It's a team event though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, works for me.\" she said managing to stand, \"what's the prize?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well from the looks of things a ton of cash.\" he said, \"and it also says...\"</span></div></div>",

She had a basket of apples in her arms, headed to the barn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm almost done. What's up Digit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I learned a new trick with nanozell nanites. Here, come on, let me show you.\" the exciteable ghost swished around like a caffeinated hummingbird. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, just give me a second, c'mon.\" Sarah turned back towards the barn and heaved her load in. It was midday, and most people were indoors for a break. Sarah, typically, had slept in and had already used up her 'break'. The end result was that the barn was empty and people were scattered about the ranch. Sarah put down her basket in its proper place and turned to Digit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, what's so exciting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look.\" Digit said. She reached forward and grabbed at Sarah's exposed stomach. Sarah giggled as a tingle came over her. Digit began to pull back, and to Sarah's surprise, her stomach came with the ghost! Well, not quite, but Sarah's skin stretched around like it was a rubber suit, and she could barely feel a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-whoa!\" she said excitedly. Digit let go and Sarah's skin snapped back into place. Digit giggled, rushed away, and came back with a hose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, check this out!\" she said, holding it up to Sarah's mouth. Sarah got the idea and, out of sheer curiosity (she was a cat after all!) let Digit put the hose in her mouth. Digit let the water flow and Sarah gulped it down as fast as she could. After several minutes, Sarah realized she wasn't getting any fuller, or at least it didn't feel like it. She took the hose out and looked at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, so weird!\" Sarah's belly had inflated steadily like a water balloon. She looked like she was heavily pregnant, a big round belly on her skinny frame. She pushed it and found it easily sloshed around, her skin still having plenty of skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crazy!\" Sarah said. \"Haha, I could freak Rachael out like this.\" she said, putting herself in a pose. Digit giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so weird, and so easy. I can do it to pretty much any body part, I think. Or all of it....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.\" Sarah heard this, but an idea had gotten to her. She sure could freak Rachael out - or she could do a little more. She and Rachael had played jokes on one another in the past, but Rachael was much better at it - she also did it less, but that meant Sarah always got caught. Since coming to the ranch she and Rachael had played a lot less. This was the perfect opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Digit, want to play a prank.\" the mischievous kitten asked, her face going into a devious smile. Digit was surprised, but grinned and giggled. They were a dangerous, adorable team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst off, Sarah knew she was going to have Digit do her rubber trick on Rachael, but where?</span></div></div>",

C'mon, she'll freak out and it'll be so funny. Then the water just....y'know, passes....and it's all back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh, okay. I'm in.\" Digit said. \"How do we do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll wait until she's asleep. Rachael actually used to sleepwalk a lot. She doesn't much anymore, but it means she's used to walking, talking, and even drinking when asleep. We can trick her into taking a long, long drink. I didn't feel any fuller, so she won't either and won't notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. We'll meet outside her room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At midnight.\" Sarah said. The two conniving cuties nodded. Sarah looked down at herself. She still had a big sloshy belly....she decided she'd just go off and hang out in the fields for now. She didn't want to freak anyone out just yet, or have to give away Digit's trick before they used it. She found herself waddling about as if actually pregnant, having to shift her weight due to her big round belly. Sarah purposefully put some wobble in her step, feeling it bounce around and slosh back and forth. She patted her belly. It was fun, the same way she loved water beds. She'd sure have fun with a sloshy Rachael belly...assuming Rach didn't throttle her for this, she thought deviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Sarah's concern, she wasn't much deflated that evening. She had had to sneak in to her room and feign sickness to avoid being revealed. She was a bit smaller, and in fact was starting to feel the need to a bathroom break, but something about her stretched belly made it such a perfect tankard that apparently she had no need to move the water along. Sarah decided she'd ask Digit about it....later. She snuck out in the middle of the night, trying to be quiet despite her water weight. She met Digit outside Rachael's door. Digit had a length of tubing with her. Digit frowned at Sarah's appearance. Sarah put her fingers to her lips, signaling quietness. They carefully opened Rachael's door, with Digit being able to undo the lock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael was sound asleep on her back, sheets half-off. Sarah snuck in, sounding far too loud to herself as the floorboards creaked. Digit handed her the tubing and signaled she got out the door and right. Sarah got the idea - there was a bathroom really close to Rachael, this much tubing would reach from the sink. She headed out and to the bathroom, finding that the tubing fit snugly over the sink. When she got back to Rachael's room with the other end, Digit was hovering over Rachael's midsection. She gave Sarah the thumbs up, and came over to grab the tubing. Sarah headed back and after a moment turned the tap on. Once again, back to Rachael's room. Digit was trying to coax the tube into Rachael's mouth, with no avail. Sarah waddled over hurriedly. Digit looked at her in confusion, but Sarah smiled. she reached over and tickled Rachael under her chin with one finger. Rachael began to giggle in her sleep, and then let out a great yawn. Digit took the opportunity, and Rachael closed her mouth around the tube right as the water began to come in. Sarah and Digit tried to hold back their snickering as Rachael drank. After just a few minutes, Rachael's belly began to swell under the covers. Gulp by gulp Rachael's belly began to surge up, like a mountain rising out the plains. Sarah measured it against her own belly, and when Rachael was nearly twice as big - that is, she had a belly over eighteen inches wide that sloshed audibly and jiggled down to her lap - she decided to call it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah nodded to Digit and grabbed the tubing, planning to pluck it gently from Rachael's mouth. Unfortunately, Rachael had quite a grip. Like an infant sucking its thumb, Rachael instinctively wanted to keep the tube in her mouth. Sarah grunted, risking a harder tug to pull it out. To no avail, Rachael had in fact bitten down on the tube by now and wasn't letting go. Sarah gulped and looked over. Rachael's belly was now eating up most of the sheets, a perfectly round sphere swelling farther and farther out. Her bellybutton was a visible bump in the smooth dome, popped out by the swelling. Digit flitted over and gave Rachael's belly a poke. It still had give, and jiggled right back like rubber. Sarah, briefly mesmerized, let go of the hose and waddled to Rachael's gut. She put her ear to it. She could hear the gallons of water inside. Rachael had a lake in there! Sarah put her hands on Rachael's side. There was almost no resistance to her touch. Rachael's belly gave way easily, the water just sloshing away. It really was like a big water bed. Sarah;s heart beat faster in her chest, but she wasn't sure why. Nerves, it must be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigit tapped her shoulder and pointed forcibly to the tube. Sarah remembered herself and jumped a little. They needed to get that tube out before Rachael got much bigger! Oh why oh why had she turned the tap on so fully? It never even occurred to Sarah to actually go turn off the water - she wasn't the brightest like that, especially when her mind was set like it was now. Sarah began a steady pull on the hose, hoping that a gentle but forceful movement would get the tube out without waking her sister. But Rachael was a real fighter! Sarah began to lean back, putting her weight on the tube. That nearly worked, giving Sarah an idea. She gestured for Digit to wait, and waddled off hurriedly to another bathroom down the hall. She bent over and got her mouth over the tap. She turned the tap on as full as she could manage, gulping down water at a rapid pace. Aware what to look for, she could actually feel the inflation a little. It was almost like a tickle, but instead of making her twitch it just made her want more. Still, she managed to keep her mind on task. A few more minutes and she heaved herself upright. Her belly pressed against the sink, much more bloated. She huffed, proud of her handiwork, placing her hands on her hips for support like a pregnant woman. Her big belly had a teardrop shape due to its weight, growing out from under her boobs until its widest point, actually below her waist due to how low it hung. It rested easily over her lap, but didn't quite reach her thighs. With a struggle, Sarah heaved herself back to Rachael's room in a slow waddle. Oh god! She bounced around as she walked without meaning to, this giant weight throwing her off. Sarah took one hand off her hip to rub her belly. Maybe once she revealed to everyone how she pranked Rachael, they wouldn't mind if she kept a stretchy belly for a while? Something about this was just so fun....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah waddled back to find Digit desperately tugging on the tube. Her eyes bulged when she saw Sarah waddle in. Sarah panted - being this heavy was hard work! She looked forward to clambering back into bed. She knew she wouldn't be sleeping on her stomach! Then again....Sarah imagined what it'd feel like to have her bloated, bouncy belly underneath her, propping her up.....she blushed and pushed that thought aside, unsure of where it had come from. Sarah grabbed the tube from Digit and just leaned backwards. Water weighs a lot, and the heavy kitten had a lot of water. With a small 'pop' the tube came free of Rachael's mouth. The black kitten simply smacked her lips and stayed asleep. Sarah was thrown backwards on her backside by her momentum. She whined as she rubbed her rear - she wasn't squidgy back there, and it had been a rough landing. Letting the tube leak water onto the floor, Sarah looked up in awe. It had taken her quite a while to get back, and Rachael's belly had grown...</span></div></div>",

A huge orb of belly now towered towards the ceiling, covering pretty much the entire bed, hanging over the edges at its widest part. Rachael was pinned under her own belly, but didn't seem in pain - rather, she was sleeping snugly, apparently tucked in by her new water-balloon-belly. It sloshed gently in a rhythmic way, as if it literally had an ocean inside it. Sarah heaved herself up. She could only imagine how much that weighed as she cradled her own swollen midsection. She reached over and patted Rachael's belly. It had the consistency of jelly, her skin rubbery but made softer by her fur. There was still not a single sign of tautness. Sarah imagined she could just climb up on top of Rachael's belly, bounce around on that jiggly mass....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah?\" Digit hissed. \"What do we do?\" she brought the kitten out of her unexpected fantasy. Sarah shook her head, and then looked panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run! Duh!\" she replied. She and Digit fled Rachael's room, scooping up the tubing and trying to hide any sign of their existence. They ran back to Sarah's room and didn't take a breath until her door was closed. Sarah sat on her bed, cross-legged, which created a cute little nest for her heavy tankard of a tummy. Sarah could understand how Rachael could sleep like she was - her belly was cool from the water but comfortable from her fur, and had the most pleasing texture against her thighs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're gonna get in trouble.\" Digit whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we were gonna to anyway. She's not going to pop, is she?\" Sarah asked, for the first time legitimately concerned for her sister. Digit shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way. She could be a hundred times as big. But what are we going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.\" Sarah said, pushing aside images of her sister as 100x the water balloon she was now. The images consisted of her sister laying atop her belly, skinny and so strange as she rested on that comforting landscape of herself, which would go on for miles....why her sister was nude in these images was anyone's guess. But! Sarah was definitely <i>not</i> thinking about her sister getting a tan as she lay ass-skywards on top of herself. No, not at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were going to get in trouble anyway. We've just done something worth the trouble now! Don't worry, in a week no one will remember.\" Sarah said. Digit looked unconvinced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, everyone will believe me if I say I pushed you to do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's not fair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're okay with taking the blame?\" Sarah smiled. Digit floated there, puzzled, outfoxed by the young trickster cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...we'll see. Maybe it won't be bad.\" Digit gulped and left Sarah. Sarah sighed. It would be interesting to see what tomorrow would bring. In the meantime....</span></div></div>",

Sarah was naturally the first one to greet her when she arrived at the farm, very excited to see her new niece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, isn't she?\", Rachael giggled, letting Sarah touch the baby's cheek, \"It was hell getting her out, but it was worth it...\" Before long, everyone--well, everyone except an extremely jealous Miles--was wanting a chance to see the kitten. Rachael proudly showed her off to the others, purring as she and Randal were congratulated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon had to retreat to somewhere private, however, because her kitten wanted to be fed, and she didn't exactly feel comfortable feeding her in front of everyone. She went into the washroom, lifting her shirt and carefully raising her baby's face to her nipple. As she felt her child suckling, she was suddenly reminded of just how small her breasts were compared to everyone else's, and began to wonder if perhaps she should make them larger somehow so her kitten could have more milk. She remembered hearing about a new breast enhancement product that had been released recently, some kind of all-natural risk-free herbal product. \"Perhaps I could give that a try...\", she said to herself, \"Though maybe I should ask for some advice first, just to be safe...\"</span></div></div>",

She begrudgingly acknowledged that fact and, after making sure her new daughter was fed, and being looked after by her father, and got herself ready to start her exercise routine again in order to burn off nine months worth of baby fat. \"Don't worry, Randal. I'll be back to as fit as I was before I had our baby in no-time! Just you watch~!\" And with that, she set off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSports bra and shorts in check, the black cat-woman began her morning jog around the house. She felt liberated to finally be able to jog around again... but she definitely had to admit that she'd miss being coddled like she was during the later stages of her pregnancy. So enamored she was with reminiscing about it that she failed to notice the steadily increasing tightness in her sports bra as she jogged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n60 minutes of running later Rachel panted to a halt back outside the front door of the farmhouse, her mind briefly wandering to how nice it was for Mora and the others to let her and Randal stay even after the revelation of the new baby's existence. She made a note to  figure out a way to thank that bovine in future. Wiping the sweat from her brow, she glanced down  at her chest, and the sweat running down her cleavage. \"... Wait... <i>cleavage</i>?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes! Cleavage! It was pouring out of her sports bra, which it most definitely hadn't been before. Pulling her top forward, she was amazed to find her chest just kept going. \"This can't be real!\" They had to be as big as Mora's easily! If not bigger, given the way they seemed as large as her head! And they felt full, too. \"Fuck yeah, they <i>are</i> real!\" She smirked as she gave them a squeeze. They were super-sensitive, and judging by the fresh dampness at the front of her top where the noticeably-tented fabric of her puffier nipples stood, she was full of milk, too. \"Hah! Yes! Big as Mora <i>and</i> I'm a mother~! Talk about lucky!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebration was had between Rachel and and Randal as the busty cat displayed the results of her growth, and after several minutes of showing off and gloating to all of the other members of the house (Especially Mora and Alej), she went about her usual routine, or rather, went about making a new routine that could account for all the time she was gonna spend with her new family. As well as spoil her new daughter now that she was producing so much more milk for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner with the rest of the house, a much milkier dinner session with her daughter and a <i>very</i> milky and grope-filled cuddling session with Randal, Rachel laid down with the father of her child in their shared bed, marveling at her swollen rack, which had steadily gotten bigger over the course of the day, though the rate was clearly slowing down significantly after that first hour in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...I guess the girls aren't growing as much as they did this morning\" Rachel giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True~ But they're still pretty lovely even at this size~\" Randal remarked \"What are they, the size of large watermelons, now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I'd go as far as to say 'small beachball-sized'... Think I should have another few pills?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Nah, for all you know, you might have more growth spurts later on... besides, you did say earlier today that you still wanna get back into your exercise routine, even with these mammoth mammaries of yours.\" To illustrate his point, Randal reached around and squeezed both of the huge breasts together, eliciting a moan and a purr from the catgirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anh~! Alright, alright~ You win~ Who knows, maybe I'll have another growth spurt overnight or something... anyway... it's time to hit the hay, so to speak. Though perhaps you'd like a... hehe... a glass of milk before going to sleep~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you'd never ask~\"<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\nOver the course of the night...</b></span></div></div>",

OH!\u201d Came Digit\u2019s voice as she computed what must have happened.

Now unwittingly unleashed on Rachael, the nanozells began to malfunction, and slowly ever so microscopically slowly, Rachael\u2019s bottom began to swell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah\u201d Rachael thought oblivious to what was going on in her behind, \u201cDigit\u2019s magic touch had never done that before! Oh well, that spark was probably nothing, in fact she was feeling better already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Digit!\u201d Rachael said moments later as they both walked/floated back into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnytime Rach\u201d Digit replied beaming cheerfully as always. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings continued normally that night for Rachael and most of the next morning as well.

Her shoulders grew further apart and her already ripped six pack raised further out both compensating for this new additional mass growing till she now reached a height of 6\u00e2\u0080\u00992 a total difference of seven inches from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Waking up from her cat-nap, Rachael yawned, then as usual gave her body a nice big stretch.

All these questions flowed through her head, as she studied herself in the mirror when her concentration was broken by one little action. A seam on the left back of her jeans was starting to give way. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she thought watching the reflection of the tares in the full length mirror. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese are my favorites <b>NO!</b>\u00e2\u0080\u009d but it was too late. Like a bridge collapsing under too much strain, so too did the stitching. The backside of the jeans was the first to fall apart as her booty the just won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quit, wouldn't quit stretching the jeans until it was free. This was followed by her own thick muscly thighs tearing the rest of the pants apart. Now near tears for the loss of her one favorite outfit, Rachael gave up and went back to the baggier shorts she had worn before which still offered her rump a little wiggle room. Picking up a button blasted off from her black pants, she looked under the bed for more buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Under her bed were the cans she purchased earlier that day. Does she manage to put two and two together, or does she remain oblivious to what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s causing her growth?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She pawed underneath her bed, but found no buttons. Instead she felt the metallic cans she bought earlier which were somehow still cold . Pulling them out she looked at the front deciding to study them again and read the small warning she once skipped over. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFOR EXTREME MUSCLE GROWTH--USE SPARINGLY!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Extreme was putting it modestly, Rachael studied herself again, she looked positively powerful! Though still far from the beefy hunk of Minos she was definitely a close second by comparison. Just how did the high prime let this stuff get sold? Well she had met the prime herself and did find her quite\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 eccentric to say the least. Well, she had this stuff now, and was the only one who knew about its secret in the household. The question now was what would she do next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She guessed that her growth wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t too much of a difference that the others would notice, but she might want to explain what happened to her sister Sarah. Sarah would be the most likely to point out the change in her big sister and was guaranteed to freak out in her own easily excitable manner. So if Rachael explained things to her now, everything would go a lot smoother. However\u00e2\u0080\u00a6<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0However, she might never get a chance like this again\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Of course she would have to explain to everyone what happened, and then Mora would undoubtedly make her throw it out. But if she drank the rest of them\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Her imagination picked up the rest from there, she saw herself growing right in front of her taller and more filled out \u00e2\u0080\u009cboss\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the ranch, dwarfing the cow in size completely as she grew to fifty feet. A mountain of muscles covering her body, she was unstoppable. Then she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d always get her way on the ranch, and be pampered, protecting Sarah from anything, and then it would be her and Minos alone, and then he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\u00e2\u0080\u00a6<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She woke from her daydream drooling. That was silly she thought, this milk couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make you that big could it? Well she definitely wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t drinking all of them, but maybe one more couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hurt just to see if the last one was a fluke or not. And if she did just so happen to grow, it might be to her advantage to do so in front of another certain member of the house just to get a point or two across about a news shift in power. Hmmmm\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rachael finally decided to\u00e2\u0080\u00a6<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She could always explain to Sarah later, Sarah always eventually understood why Rachael did things, sometimes things that were against the law. Now would be one of those moments, if the milk would actually make her grow again, Rachael had to be sure the stuff would work again, before claiming to be the new head of the household. She decided to take it slow for now and just drink one can of the stuff for the experiment, but the question was who should she try it on; never Taffy who had always been the nicest to her and Sarah, or Idward and Randall who were also kind to the kittens, Minos was right out as of course was Sarah. That left two, Miles and Mora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rachael had already thought of the revenge on Mora. Though Mora had given them the roof over their heads, that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d get anything she wanted out of them. And that included Minos! It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem fair she thought remembering a certain fight she had with Mora. It was over an innocent enough kiss between her and Mora\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on again off again boyfriend Minos. It also wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fair how Rachael had been the one who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d seemed to do all the intensive training and was still showed up in a fight by Mora. The fight had ended in a tie, but Rachael had been caught off guard on how strong the cow was. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fair that Mora had just been born that way, and was able to almost out muscle the one who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d worked all her life for her buff body. Now she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d turn the tables on her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But then a lot of that was her imagination speaking again. She didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily have to be evil with her new sizable stature, in fact that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what Minos would want from her. That didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean she could freak somebody out with it. Turning her thoughts towards Miles, a cat on the ranch who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been awfully cold to her and more importantly crass to Sarah. Getting him to obey her would be a positive to the whole house!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The choice was hers alone and she began smiling deviously at all the fun possibilities she had.

He pulled out a large salmon he'd been saving for a nice day like this. Turning around he eyed the fem feline at the table and couldn't help but remark. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know that weight gain stuff won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make you grow breasts right?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked her sardonically pointing to the supposed weight gain shake can in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cLaugh all you want runt. This stuff is for working out, not that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d know anything about that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d she snapped back in a passive aggressive remark. She then slowly took a slight sip from the can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cI work out!\" Miles cried defensively, \"I work out a lot! \u00e2\u0080\u009d he said again flexing a bicep from underneath his jacket and giving the small lump a kiss.Things were going just as Rachael planned, she just had to keep a straight face and see the plan through. She would challenge Miles and then simply grow right in front of him she couldn't wait to see the look on his face when she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rachael secretly smiled as she sipped again from the can \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlright then tuff guy prove it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she placed one of her thick arms on the table into the universal pose for arm wrestling. Miles was stunned at the sight, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d known Rachael had been frequently working out, but now it seemed doubly so. That muscle milk stuff was really working for her! Maybe he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d could get some of that stuff later, but for now he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d found himself in a position he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d often been in: having to back up that big mouth of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour on!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said coolly, trying to keep up his dude with an attitude persona. Sitting down on the table and pulling his sleeves up, they both could tell the differences between their two arms. Rachael\u00e2\u0080\u0099s looked overfed, compared to his slightly toned limb and they both knew it. She looked calmly at him with a sly smile that said she was going to enjoy this. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099d didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to chicken out now but didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to give her the satisfaction of winning either, he switched to his last weapon, his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we make this interesting,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he began Rachael was unmoved only taking time to finish off the last of the second can. \u00e2\u0080\u009clet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say I win, how about you give the rest of that stuff.\u00e2\u0080\u009d he pointed towards the drink. Rachael was unfazed, by this sudden bet, to her it was just the squeaks of a mouse before being pounced upon. Seeing her uncaring face, Miles decided to raise the stakes to get the girl to back out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnnnd you have to be my personal slave for a whole week!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said smiling, hoping he had antagonized her to her limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rachael only returned the smile, before asking nonchalantly \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe same goes to you then, my slave for a week if you lose? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only fair right? If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re so confident you can win, it shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be a problem.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This was getting better and better for her, but now she just wanted Miles to shut his trap and get on with it, she could already feel a slight pain in her stomach that could only mean the she was to grow again soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This had backfired on Miles and now he found himself speaking before thinking. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDeal!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said putting on a brave face and they both locked hands.

It was her biceps turn to flex, and they gave twice performance that Miles\u00e2\u0080\u0099 did, the small veins that crossed her arms now perking up with blood, delighted to be challenged. Rachael watched as Miles struggled to keep the impending weight from forcing him to the table but was failing miserably.

Rachael reached over the table and easily held him by the scruff of his shirt.

Knowing that now he had no choice in the matter he slowly pressed his thumbs into one of her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rachael was in heaven! Here she was eating a delicious salmon (which was gone in a matter of seconds) in front of Miles, <i>while </i>he was giving her a wonderful foot rub.

Then inhaling she leaned back in her chair, and again began to grow, a tingling sensation engulfing her entire body. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere it comes!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rachael thought and watched as the bad boy Miles Lionheart turned into a kitten at the change in front of him. At first Miles had barley noticed it while kneading the fur of Rachael\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foot, but then he swore they looked bigger, bigger then his even! Then he was sure they were actually getting heavier on his lap, forcing him to the seat now with no chance of escape. A scary thought then bolted across his mind, if her feet were growing, then what about the rest of her. Looking up from the feet now occupying most of his lap, and easily the size of his entire chest, he looked up to see a grinning Rachael who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legs were lengthening, and who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head was growing farther towards the ceiling as her paws pressed further against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u00a6You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d Miles tried to speak, but was to flabbergasted to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But the now completely muscled bound vixen only nodded her head in acknowledgment of his worse fears. The already giant Rachael was growing again.

Well, first she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t leave Miles here on the floor and spoil the surprise for everyone else, so now ducking over to fit through the house, she easily lifted Miles and then placed his motionless body on the couch and threw a blanket over him in the perfect appearance of him taking a nap. Typical of him, she though Miles even got to slack off on slave work too. But she was in too much of a good mood now to want to wake him up now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She decided she could go confront Mora at this new size, or she could go check on her cache of drinks and make sure they were still safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now Sarah's huge  too? \u201d Miles groaned to himself panicking at the sight of the towers of muscles before him.  \u201cThis has got to be a dream\u2026\u201d he said aloud squirming on the floor and pinching his self in a useless attempt to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael picked him up by his collar, and held Miles face to face. \u201cNope this isn\u2019t a dream my little slave. This all one hundred percent real.\u201d  Rachael said as she brought her other arm in front of his face and flexed a bulbous bicep in front of him. \u201cGo on, feel it.\u201d she invited Miles. Seeing no other choice, Miles gulped as he felt the impossibly rock hard muscle flexing inches from his face, assuring himself this was defiantly real. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael continued setting the cat down easily as if he'd weighed nothing. \"A deal's a deal Miles, and now I'm making sure you get put to good use. Sarah why don't you give our servant here a test run?\" she asked turning to her sister excited to see what she had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah tilted her head and brought a brown finger to her chin to think. \u201cUmm, it would be really nice if I could have some ice cream right about now\u2026\u201d she said in her usual girlish manner, not fully aware of the extent of the power she had over the tomcat. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nMiles face flashed with a look that said \u201cYou got to be kidding me!\u201d Eyes twitching he turned to looked at Rachael wordlessly asking her if Sarah was serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you herd the lady. Why don\u2019t you get her some ice cream?\u201d Rachael said, then narrowing her glance down upon him as she spoke added. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t want any trouble would we Miles?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles shook his head nervously at the question, and went right to task on Sarah\u2019s command for ice cream. Watching him rushing straight into the kitchen the two sisters decided to relax on the couch while they waited.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMiles returned instantly to the sisters who were splayed out on the couch. Carrying a bowl filled to the brim with Mint Chocolate chip ice cream, he carefully handed it to Sarah, whose hand now dwarfed his in comparison.  \u201cThank you!\u201d she said and simply smiled as she quickly began to devour the dessert. Miles could only watch the odd sight as the youth\u2019s ten foot tall imposing body hunched over the bowl of ice-cream she so desired and quickly slurped the frozen treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee that was fun.\u201d Rachael said to her sister when Sarah when she had finished. \u201cAnd he has to do anything we say for the next week\u2026\u201d Rachael added to grimly remind Miles what was in store for him.  He knew there would be no way out of the stupid bet he\u2019d made, and now he worried if he\u2019d end up being under their control forever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gazed at the two who looked quite comfortable resting their monstrously sized bodies over the entirety of the couch, but Miles knew any minute now one of them would command him and he would have to be on their beck and call.  Rachael turned towards him grinning smugly down at him from her relaxed position on the couch. Miles shuddered, he could only imagine the horrors her revenge seeking mind could put him through. On the other hand at least the even larger sized naive Sarah wouldn\u2019t give him any task too demeaning, would she? Thoughts of her using him as her personal dress up dolly flashed through his mind and he winced. Things did not look good for Miles, he could only wait for someone else from the farm to appear and divert the two's attention for just a little bit then maybe he could find those cans...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts of revenge were interrupted by one of the now tiger sized cats giving their slave the next order.

Rachael was fine with that, maybe she\u2019d even take a cat nap here on the couch while Sarah was making Miles miserable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe would be the perfect model!\u201d Sarah giggled in delight<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Both Rachael and Miles said in disbelieve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! That\u2019s great!\u201d said Rachael. \u201cMiles is the perfect dummy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo wait Sarah! Whoa!\u201d Miles said as he tried to reason with Sarah, but she\u2019d already clasped a massive hand around his wrist and was rushing him up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget the makeup sis!\u201d Rachael called after them, chuckling at her sister\u2019s naivety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being halve carried/halve dragged into the white kitten\u2019s room, Miles took a second to get himself together. Sarah had said something about a model or something like that, what did she mean? The hulking form of Sarah squeezed through the doorway\u2019s frame before closing the door as gently as she could behind the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect we\u2019re alone\u201d Sarah throatily purred to Miles as she backed him into a corner and blocked his only way of escape. Any other time this would have been a great situation for Miles, Sarah was a slightly ditsy he knew that, but whether she knew it or not she had a smoking hot bod. But now there was a lot more of said body, and a lot more muscles along with it sculpting scatterbrained Sarah into the definition of power only further adding to her sex appeal. He gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake it easy. This'll be fun for the both of us\u201c she cooed as she turned around. Using her over enlarged fingers she delicately rummaged through her closet. \u201cAha!\u201d She shouted in excitement! Miles now dreadfully understood by what Sarah had meant by model as she pulled out a lacy pink ball gown dress from her closet. She held it out towards Miles, obviously intending him to put it on and see how it fit on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSarah!\u201d Miles exploded, \u201cThere\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha\u2026What?\u201d Sarah whimpered looking more hurt than angry at the outburst. Obviously this new body of hers hadn\u2019t gotten to her head, yet. \u201cBut, but Rachael said\u2026\u201d she began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles quickly realized he would not want to upset either one of the powerful pair. He\u2019d better keep a cool head and go along with this game for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, what I meant to say no way in hell I\u2019m getting dressed with you watching\u2026\u201d Miles said covering his outburst with a much calmer tone of voice. \u201cAnd maybe you could just let me go into my rooms, and you can pick something out from my closet. Sound good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, that might be good\u201d Sarah said turning her head to the side imagining the idea. \u201cBut this first!\u201d she said, again thrusting the positively glowing gown towards him. \u201cOh and I won\u2019t peak!\u201d she added. True to her word, she turned her figure around and into a cramped corner of the small room, placing her gargantuan paws over her eyes. \u201cJust tell me when you\u2019re ready!\u201d she added gleefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell at least she\u2019s not completely disagreeable Miles thought. He stared at the frilly fabric in his paws realizing that with Sarah diverted he only had a short time to think of a way out. Scanning the room he saw the door was now left unguarded, he could try and make a run for it and just hope that another member of the house was up. Or he could entertain Sarah, at least for a little while, and just put the sparkling pink nightmare of a dress on. It was certainly better than anything Rachael might have planned for him...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wasn\u2019t growing like she\u2019d planned to, but she was going to put Miles in his place, right here, right now! It was her bicep's turn to flex, and they gave twice performance that Miles\u2019 did, the small veins that crossed her arms now perking up with blood, delighted to be challenged. Rachael watched as Miles struggled to keep the impending weight from forcing him to the table but was failing miserably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut suddenly, Miles' struggling paid off--his muscles visibly pumped up a little as he tightened them further, pushing against Rachael's arm as hard as he could. Working up a good sweat, he slowly inched his way to victory. And then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael's arm hit the table. She had actually somehow lost to Miles! \"No fucking way!\", she cried out, her next growth kicking it just a bit too late.

A deal's a deal, bitch queen, lead me to your remaining drinks!\", he commanded her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was right, no backing out of this. She was under his control for an entire week. The musclebound 8-foot catgirl led him up to her room and grabbed the drinks from under her bed. \"Here\", she growled, \"Take them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Rachael.\", he purred, \"Now, how many would I like...?\"</span></div></div>",

He eyed her hulking form carefully as he made for the cans alert in case this was some kind of trap. As soon as the cans were in his grasp he made sure to put some distance between the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he had the power all to himself, he thought excited at the idea of a totally buff body all women would go crazy over. Quickly snapping a can open, he chugged the concoction greedily, gulping it down quickly and ending with a refreshed sounding \u201cAhhh.\u201d The second can he downed with equal vehement, snorting loud breaths through his nose as he swallowed more and more. Again he let out a gasp for air after finishing the strangely somehow still cold beverage. Wiping his mouth clean of any of the milks residue he said \u201cOne more\u201d psyching up for the feat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiles!\u201d Rachael gasped suddenly worried for the cat. She had planned on using Miles as \u201cGuinea pig\u201d of sorts to see if the drink affected other as it did herself (that is why she\u2019d planned on losing, and so easily offered him the drinks to the fellow feline.) But if two had made her this big, the results of three were unpredictable. She pounced towards the cat who was already guzzling away at the drink, finishing it as fast as he\u2019d started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis stuff\u2019s great!\u201d Miles said, licking his lips clean of any spare milk. \u201cRach\u2026What are you-?\u201d Was all he got out when he suddenly noticed the angry looing Rachael headed towards him, she pinned him to the ground and brought him face to face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d she asked demanding to know why he\u2019d so stupidly slurped the strange brew all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, hey, I\u2019m just making sure everyone knows that I\u2019m going to be the big boss around here now is all.\u201d he said smugly to her face. Then to add to his rudeness he accidentally let out a small milky belch right into Rachael\u2019s face. \u201cWhoa\" he exclaimed as his stomach rumbled, enjoying what his body had just done. But his pleasure soon turned to pain as he felt the onset of the effects from the milk begging to kick in. Rachael backed away from him as he howled and clutched his stomach doubled over in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiles we have to get you somewhere else! Who knows what will happen if you stay inside!\u201d Rachael said recognizing the pain that came before her own growth explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh\u201d groaned the cat in response too busy with the sharp pain shooting through his body to deliver an answer. More worried for her rooms\u2019 sake, then Mile\u2019s well-being Rachael lifted up the moaning cat (quite the easy task at her size) and carried him outside the house. Searching quickly she decided to head for the immense barn house and store him there. Laying him down, and making sure the barn doors were closed she waited to see what became of the black and white cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long until Rachael realized\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rachael stood back from the pain riddled cat, feeling somewhat responsible for Miles current condition. Of course the other halve of her felt satisfied that he was getting what he deserved too. The wails emanating from the cat went on for a few more seconds, and Rachael thought she had misjudged the act and she had made a mistake by bringing the cat all the way out here, it didn\u2019t seem like he\u2019d be growing at all. Well that suited her just fine. Sure now she would \u201cpretend\u201d to be his slave for a week, but she\u2019d have more fun hanging around Miles anyways at this size, always there to be a constant reminder of how much bigger and stronger she now was then him. That\u2019s when suddenly the cries of pain stopped and were replaced by moans of pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a distance Rachael watched as Miles sat up in the big hay filled barn. \u201cOoooooh yeah!\u201d came a throaty cry from the cat. Rachael stared at him to see what could have given the recently incapacitated cat something to cheer about. Her eyes expanded as she realized what he was so happy about. He was growing.  Barely noticeable at first but then the process grew faster and faster as Miles roared with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both watched, as his upper body swelled with mass tearing his shirt to shreds.  His legs pumped up even bigger, his back became even denser, and his ass seemed to swell impossibly bigger against his straining jeans. He stopped for a second to take in the size of his colossal muscles and thicker body hair. His cock throbbed bigger and bigger at his own self-image becoming almost fully hard now.  All the while Rachael observed hypnotized, watching the poor briefs stretch outward to their limits.  She decided to withdraw to the shadows for now, and not draw any attention from the beastly figure. Unexpectedly Miles hit a double bicep pose making his muscles explode in size across his body; the swells of muscles writhing in anguish across his arms. He flexed them over and over watching the veins travel across his fur, finally hitting one last massive pose and letting out a groan. Miles hit the muscular pose with his boner still throbbing out of control, the outline of his cock looking monstrous, threatening to tear apart the last remnants of his pants at any second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww yeaaaah\u201d said the muscle-bound cat in a deeper voice, now looking more and more like the largest large lion prime ever, then the wiry cat he once was.  \u201cWait till I find Minos, I owe him some payback!\u201d he punched a fist into his baseball mitt sized hand imaging the sweet revenge he would have. Not just on Minos, but everyone who\u2019d pushed him around at his smaller size.  Now ten feet tall and as wide as a small car the towering Miles felt unstoppable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOr was he?\u201d thought Rachael still hidden behind the hay bales. She\u2019d taken down guys bigger than her plenty of times before and now was no different. Size in a fight did not make for experience and she was pretty sure she could take the behemoth head on if she had to. She peaked up from her hiding spot behind a bale of hay; to better size up her would be opponent. Seeing that his arms and chest impossibly looked thicker and denser than just a few minutes ago, his pecs expanded with even more muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking his new body for a test drive, Miles flicked his longer beefy tail behind him crashing it thunderously into the ground and cutting a small split into the barn floor. Overjoyed with the results, the still nearly naked Miles went to the weights that were used in the barn as a gym of sorts. He went to the weight set and loaded a bar with the heaviest loads available, which was at least five hundred pounds. His muscles flexed and strained, but the cat seemed to easily lift the bar after a moment, in fact he now did it with one hand, making look as easy as flicking his wrists.  He couldn\u2019t get over how insanely powerful and strong he was feeling, knowing he could probably punch through a wall with his bare hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael witnessed this display of power and decided to switch strategies. Maybe she could take him now, but the cans back at the house were key if she wanted to absolutely bring the cat down to size.  She had to take care of the cans first before the fell into the wrong hands and Miles got any bigger then he already was, but to get to the house meant she had to make it out of the barn unnoticed. A small door was only a few large strides in front of her, but she would have to get to the opposite side of the barn right were Miles could possibly see her. She acted quickly, hoping Miles was too self-absorbed in himself to notice her as she tip-toed past him while sticking to the shadows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was only a few feet away from the door when she heard\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His new thicker tail flicked the barn door shut easily handling the heavy door Rachael had planned to escape through. Even though she was a sizable eight feet tall she still only managed to come up to the cats spotted chest.

A world of pleasurable deeds swam in his head as a greedy grin spread across his face. Excited at the ideas, his shaft slowly rose to attention, steadily filling with even more blood, rising higher and curling upwards till it rested just below Rachael at eye level pointing straight towards her like a directing arrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it seems my body made up its mind. Why don\u2019t you give me some loving?\u201d he asked eager to experiment with a member that matched his own ego in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Rachael asked incredulously, hoping she incorrectly heard what he just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou heard me, now blow me, bitch!\u201d With that he pointed proudly down at his plumped penis, his alpha attitude resonating within the command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it didn't take a genius to know that as things were now, Miles only had to give her a light tap and she\u2019d probably be knocked out. He had too much power over her to resist, so she knew who the cat in charge was for the moment. The one thing giving her hope was that she also knew anything he would do to her now, she\u2019d be sure to return double, no <b>TEN TIMES </b>later. All she had to do was wait for an opening, or maybe someone would find and save her, but right now it didn\u2019t look likely. Hesitantly she approached his pumped up penis and hefted it to her mouth level, the weighty wang took some effort to heft, even with her new increased strength. Then under Miles looming watch, she placed her lips around it, only able to reach a quarter of the way down the salami sized shlong, the head already dripping with pre-cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles smiled approvingly as she opened wide and enclosed his head. Immediately he shook at sensation of Rachael\u2019s tongue, forced to slather his shaft. Rachael\u2019s mouth was full to the max with Miles meat, and Rachael looked near tears as she was close to choking on his chode. Miles\u2019 tail beat against the ground back and forth faster and faster as he neared his limit, meanwhile Rachael was nearing her own limits, disgusted at the look of satisfaction on Miles face, and how she was forced into doing this. Solid and firm she could feel every vein as Miles tried to jam more and more expectantly into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cUHNHhnff!</b>\u201d Miles finally boomed abruptly drawing Rachael\u2019s attention. She was helpless as she watched his massive balls inflate, and felt his dick expand in her mouth, she was caught off guard for what be happening next and was only barely able to pull away. With a lion like growl Miles rocketed a gallon of his white gunk, drenching Rachael with excessive amounts of cum. He squirted first in a constant stream like a fire hose, which was then backed up with two shuddering \u201caftershocks\u201d of spurts immediately afterwords. Finally Miles stopped and Rachael, as well as part of the barn, stood completely covered in white hot mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiles, you fucking asshole!

His new muscular body raging with testosterone supplied his giant body with a giant sex drive, and Rachael could see he was already hungry for more. Miles was lustrously grinning at her, looking like the cat that swallowed the canary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeeee\u2026With this new awesome body of mine, I\u2019m just <i>soooo</i> fucking horny!\u201d He said and took a step forward pressing his bulk against Rachael, she wondered now why she\u2019d ever maid that stupid bet\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, my whole time here, I don\u2019t think I ever seen you naked...\u201d Miles said smugly, and then added \u201cLet\u2019s change that. Lose the clothes my little sex slave.\u201d <i>Now</i> things were getting good Miles thought. He remembered all of those times where he\u2019d only be able to glimpse peeks of Rachael\u2019s half-naked booty when she wore her swimsuit, or the way it wobbled around in front of him wrapped tightly in her skin tight sweat pants.  He\u2019d often dreamed about chasing it around, but now he finally had it in the flesh. Finished with stripping, Rachael\u2019s muscular amazon sized ass hung out for the world to see finally naked, the black perfection laid before him in all its glory. And now thanks to the special drinks Rachael had, it was now bigger and as well-toned as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving so often been cock blocked by the ice queen Rachael before, he would take his time and savor this. Drooling at the mouth,he brought one of his big strong hands and clutched her round cheeks, kneading the doughy fur and muscle; it felt so soft and so good beneath his fingers. The sensation to Rachael (though she hated to admit it) was not too unpleasant, in fact she could even feel herself getting turned on, much to her dismay. Decidedly giving in, she closed her eyes and fantasized it was not Miles but Minos who was behind her behind. Slowly Miles took his head and traced along her perfect ass' outline, coming close to but never quite entering her, which he knew always drove women crazy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just j-j-jam it in!\" Rachael cried now begging him to get on with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles too had enough of the teasing and was ready for some real action. Rachael yelped quietly as Miles muscular arms quickly gripped her sides and again as felt the mammoth bulk pressing against her rear. Rachael felt him enter and begin filling her up, not violently but with a master carefulness, more and more, slowly getting increasingly tighter. Secretly a part deep inside of her loved the way it felt and it was Rachael\u2019s turn to drool now, as her tail began flicking back and forth passionately. Miles felt her impulsively flex her cheeks together, squeezing tighter against him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhhhh!\u201d Miles groaned slightly, \u201cSo this is what you like is it?\u201d he said as he began slow rocking his hips forward stuffing his impossible bulk further and further into her. Ignoring his words Rachael was more concerned with her rear which felt like it was on fire, and the feeling grew with each deeper thrust. Her head swam in ecstasy and she felt bloated with Miles titanic member as it began pounding into her depths. Miles was enjoying the sensation emanating through his member, as every single part of him felt like it was melting. Sloppy and wet, they could both feel Miles peaking as he slowly built up inside of her into a mounting rush, when suddenly\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Creaaaaaak*, the back door of the barn had opened, and the two were interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the back entrance was\u2026</span></div></div>",

From the door of the barn, he could vaguely see what appeared to be the gigantic forms of Miles and Rachael still mating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMinos, help! You\u2019ve got to stop Miles! He's--\u201d Rachael managed to moan out loudly, just as Miles reached orgasm and filled her body with his hot sticky cum again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww yeahhhhh!\u201d Miles cried out, intently focused on finishing his pleasures first, before dealing with the disturbance. \u201cOh, it\u2019s you\u201d Miles said in a sleazy tone. He pushed Rachael aside as he turned to face the bull. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to give you some payback for a long time!\u201d and for effect he flexed his newly gained muscles in a sign to bring it on, now standing taller than giant Minos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael wasn\u2019t sure but she thought Mino\u2019s eyes were almost glowing red with anger. Sprawled out, her overinflated form crawled along the barn floor to the door, still sloshing and swollen with Miles' seed. Rachael watched as Minos gave a running start towards Miles and delivered a punch square on the cat's jaw. The massive cat look surprised that blow had actually hurt, but he recovered in time to react to the second punch. Soon the two were locked into a battle of raw power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was Rachael's chance! If she could only get back to those cans in time, she could grow big enough to take down the enormous Miles for good. She could only hope Minos could hold off Miles until then.</span></div></div>",

Soon his clothes were strained as he continued hulking out and the sensation of his clothes constricting around him roused Minos from unconsciousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his one unblackend eye and breathlessly looked about him before he spoke. \u201cRachael, what\u2019s happening?\u201d he asked in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just gave you the last bit of what made Miles and I grow\u2026 I\u2019m sorry\u2026I, I thought you would be better than I would be.\" Rachael explained. \"Miles has gone crazy with power from this stupid stuff and it\u2019s sorta\u2026my fault.

He raised to his new full height as the growth subsided,now easily equal in size to Miles in height and muscle if not larger. He was gigantic, he was naked, and he was ready to get aggressive.

The black and white wall of muscle that was Miles, was swiftly vaulting towards them, and soon the titans would be clashing for a second time. A look of surprise and then one of malice was upon Miles\u2019 face as he pounced forward. Rachael quickly backed away to give the giants room for this final battle. She watched from a distance as the two locked arms and began to grapple for position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho would reign supreme?

Minos somehow felt a second heat surging in his body, and much to the horror of Miles, Minos looked to be victorious, completely eclipsing the thumped Miles in his shadow. Minos raised a heavy hoof and brought it slowly pressing down into the cat's back. Then next thing he knew, Miles felt the incredible strong grip of Minos\u2019 more than well-muscled arms at his sides pinning and locking him into place. He tried wriggling but to no effect, he couldn\u2019t escape from Minos superior stronger grip. Miles was no longer the biggest and strongest of the ranch, he\u2019d been outmatched by Minos yet again now on a much larger scale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoing somewhere, you cowardly cat?\u201d Minos voice quaked, above and seemingly all around Miles.Pinned in the  prone position and  pushed deep into the ranch's soil he could feel the bull\u2019s hot and angry breaths against his defenseless backside. He gulped knowing what he might soon be feeling next. Minos muscles fueled by the straining, filled with more of the milks hormones. All of his body was  urging Minos to go through with a sexual dominating act; it was a chemical..no...<u>animal</u> need to put Miles in his place. He looked towards Rachael who was savoring this moment of revenge. He could just barely see as she gave a thumb up in approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it\u2019s settled, shall we make it a brown eye for a brown Miles?\" he jokingly boomed over the defeated and caught cat. There wasn't a question about it now, he ached to do  this, he wanted to fully conquer this cocky cat once and for all. The beefcake's blood-filled member stood fully erect begging for action and release, feeling full with power. He lined himself into to place, with one wild thrust  he'd begin the erotic act.

Over the past two month\u2019s she\u2019d slowly begun to sprout a small pot belly. Rachael ever the watchful older sister made note of it and decided she would be asking Sarah to join her for workout sessions soon. However, what Rachael didn\u2019t know, yet, was that the young Sarah\u2019s recent expansion wasn\u2019t just food related. Although she was eating a lot more, eating with a hunger that seemed to be for five, no, six! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, Sarah had been \u201cfooling around\u201d with the men of the ranch and knew now that she was pregnant. Now she\u2019d further come to realize that she wouldn\u2019t just be the mother of one but maybe even of six! But this was something of a joy for Sarah and her lover. Something about it, having these little balls of life inside her filled her with a great happiness, something she felt Rachael wouldn\u2019t be able to understand if she told her. So for now at least she kept it a secret from her older sister successfully, able to keep the births within her growing belly a secret from the rest of the house. This was growing more difficult with each day now that her breasts had also swelled full with milk, growing in anticipation of feeding her soon to come children. Along with her breasts growth was the spike in the growth of her appetite. Sarah could clean her plate faster than anyone else on the ranch, and she was always having thirds and sometimes fourths at every meal breakfast lunch and dinner. Even then her body demanded more, with Sarah and her secret lover sneaking into the kitchen at night to satisfy her cravings for all things sweet and fattening. She needed to be gaining constantly making sure she kept her new kids healthy before birth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow as she tried tugging down one of her t-shirts to cover her new lady lumps and bump of a belly they resisted and protruded stubbornly. Maybe she\u2019d borrow some of her lover\u2019s clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving her room Sarah quietly sneaked into the room of her true love and father of her children\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Curiosity getting the better of her Sarah came closer and was surprised when she saw that there was more than just conventional makeup being sold at the kiosk but what looked to be pill bottles.<br>\r\n\"Welcome to miracle cosmetics.\" The woman behind the counter, a Very buxom bunny, said as Sarah got closer.<br>\r\nStill driven by her curiosity Sarah stared down through the transparent countertop at the pill bottles wondering what a cosmetics shop was doing selling what looked to be medicine. \"Bust growth supplements?\" Sarah read from the pill bottle's label.<br>\r\n\"Yep Miracle Cosmetics doesn't just sell makeup are cutting-edge cosmetic medication can give you the body of your dreams.\" The counter woman explained. \"And trust me they work I didn't get these without a little help.\" She said pushing out her chest for emphasis. Sarah was convinced anyone that had knockers bigger than Mora had to know what they were talking about when it came to big boobs.<br>\r\n\"I'll take it!\" Sarah said immediately.

She soon found Rachel and not wanting to explain her purchase to her overprotective big sister decided to hide the pill bottle. She slipped them between her boobs not at all appreciating the irony that a woman fretting about being 'small' had a bust big enough to serve as an impromptu pocket.<br>\r\n\"There you are.\" Rachel said as she caught sight of her sister. \"My shopping's done let's head back to the farm.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure thing sis.\" Sarah said periodically readjusting the pill bottle as they walked so that  it wouldn't slip out of her cleavage, disguising her actions as readjusting her top.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nSoon Sarah was back at the las lindas farmstead, alone in her room and eager to try out the pills.</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile, Taffy had torn through a mail parcel she had been keeping under her bed. She knew this was her mother's things, and should be treating them with more care, but this had been bothering her for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is!\" she said. She began leafing through a small leatherbound journal. \"Amazing! I never!\" every page revealed new secrets to Taffy. It was like an archeologist finding a lost tomb.

She stared at her door. No one came, so no one heard. She tried to calm herself. She reread the page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She used breastmilk. All this time. That explains it. But....well, we all drank her milk. Just more than we thought. Oh, I'll never make them now...\" she said, getting depressed. She looked down and prodded her breast. They were nice, though they had gotten her into situations. But no sweet milk came from them. Or ever would, at this rate. She'd either have to get pregnant just to cook, or....or...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just need the milk.\" Taffy whispered, a twinkle in her eye.</span></div></div>",

Yet she couldn't help but feel like she was being watched. Just her nerves was all. But she was sure she wanted to try this. Having realized she had basically grown up on her mother's milk, Taffy saw little wrong with using it. In fact, the more she thought about it, the better the idea seemed. She could save so much time and money with her own milk. It'd set her cooking apart, just as her mother's cooking had been astounding. But beyond that...Taffy was a mother. Not literally, of course. But she had an instinctual drive so strong that it was no wonder the group saw her as the motherly caretaker.

She was careful to add it only to her dishes before serving, so no one would notice. And while she added as much as she could stomach, that wasn't a lot per piece of food. She started to wake up with the taste of it in her mouth, which would persist until she went to sleep the next night. No amount of brushing helped. So Taffy had to dilute it more - but that meant eating more food. The herb wouldn't work out well unless she took a lot of it within a relatively short period. She ended up having to stuff herself at meals, and the foods it went with were typically pretty hearty themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few days, Taffy thought to check herself in the bathroom mirror. Initial signs were good. Her breasts were getting tight against her bra; something was happening. But then she looked down. She was also straining against her waistband, looking a little bit softer all around. It could just be that she was gaining a little weight, especially as she had always been top heavy. Taffy just had to know. She took off her top, and then undid the clasp on her bra. Her heavy bosom fell free. Almost afraid of the result, she reached up to test one nipple....</span></div></div>",

Her teat slowly began to weep under Taffy's stimulation. She recognized it not as milk but as pre-milk - promising but not the real deal yet. Still, it made Taffy determined to continue what she was doing. It was working! Taffy briefly paused. Maybe since she was already pretty much at it.....no, no, she thought. she put back on her bra, realizing that her now erect nipple would distract her for a while to come against the tight fabric. Still, Taffy knew what she could distract herself with - a nice giant breakfast stuffed with herbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Taffy continued at what she was doing, her determination giving her cause to eat just a little more than she had previously managed, all for the sake of seeing that wetness turn white and creamy. The rest of the staff began to wonder at Taffy's apparent appetite. The men quickly checked among themselves if anyone had slept with Taffy recently, and if protection had been involved. That resolved, most people came to their own conclusion, assuming Taffy was just going through a phase or perhaps stressed out. A couple began to worry she was depressed, lonely even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Taffy knew was that people were paying her more attention recently. She assumed it was because of her burgeoning bosom and general sunny demeanor - the effects of the herb seemed to be building, and she was seeing more and more change quicker and quicker. She was careful to hide everything from the staff, even given the extra attention. She decided to by bras with nursing cubs next time she outgrew hers - which wouldn't be long! In fact, after a couple weeks, Taffy checked herself while getting dressed this morning and realized...</span></div></div>",

T-taffy?\" Idward mumbled. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had sex...\" Taffy said blushing, but she didn't seem regretful about it in the least. \"Don't you remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure do...\" Idward replied smiling, but a moment later he rubbed his head. \"But sadly I also have a headache.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here....Would you like to rest a bit before we get up for the morning?\" Taffy offered, putting her grey furred hand upon his.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Certainly.\" Idward said cuddling up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that Idward and Taffy began to see each other more frequently, in a more romantic light.

Her already large breasts had picked up a bit more than their share of her slightly increased weight, adding further strain to the already tight semi-sheer lacy bra she was wearing. Seeing this brought a slight grin to Mora\u2019s face, and washed away any negative feelings she might have had about her slight chub. After all of the hardship that she had gone through, she deserved the recent good times, and if she ended up putting on a little weight because of it then so be it.

He had left with another of his cryptic messages and vanished again, and Mora hadn\u2019t been able to track him down again.

At first, her dreams were made from fragments of recent events as expected, but they soon shifted to things totally out of the ordinary for the young bovine lass. In one, she was seated at the head of the dining room table, but she was totally alone and there was a vast feast laid out, the table groaning under the weight of all of the food. The smell of all of the wonderful foods before her caused her stomach to give a hungry grumble, followed by another louder one. Because of this and how wonderful all of the food looked, she didn\u2019t wait any longer before digging in. The first bit caused an explosion of flavor to overwhelm her, as did the one after that, and the one after that, and so on and so forth. Each piece of food proved more delicious than the last, so she lost herself in the pure delight of eating, not realizing how much she was gorging on. It was only when she ran out of food within reach that she finally stopped to take a breath and grasped what she had done to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach was an overfilled sphere jutting out from her body and straining around the mss of food within. It didn\u2019t hurt, it just felt slightly unpleasant, but the hunger continued to gnaw at her even still. Somehow the rest of her body had been hit by her glutton as well, dozens upon dozens of pounds of pure fat bloating her body; her clothes having shredded under the force of her expanding body. She also found that she had been pinned in her chair by her flab, growing under and around the arm rests still she couldn\u2019t budge at all. She was about to call out for help when Taffy walked in, wearing nothing but a tiny frilly apron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing Mora in such a state, Taffy tutted before saying \u201cMora, you were supposed to eat everything I made for you.\u201d Mora was about to respond but the rabbit cut her off by continuing, \u201cI guess I\u2019ll just have to make sure you eat every last crumb then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Mora could say anything in response to that little shocker, Taffy had already grabbed a serving spoon and shoveled more food into Mora\u2019s open mouth. Taffy soon set a superhuman pace, plates and bowls emptying their contents into Mora\u2019s maw. The bovine\u2019s body reacted to the surge of food by swelling even larger even faster, the chair creaking and groaning under the growing load. Taffy vanished after a while, only to be replaced with Rachael, dressed in a tight little sport bra and matching bottoms. The dark furred feline didn\u2019t say a word, just giving a mischievous grin before stuffing double handfuls of food into Mora. The corpulent cow never noticed that the piles of food on the table never shrank now; they were actually growing with each piece consumed by the black hole that was her mouth. Rachael was soon replaced with Idward, who was replaced with Randal, followed by Miles, then Alejandra, each dressed as revealingly or more so and more than willing to stuff Mora with more and more food. Each person also gave her words of encouragement along with the food, spurring her to new heights and weights. The chair soon gave up the first against her bulk, dropping her to the ground as a quivering fat and food filled blob, and the feeding finally stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMora could only lie there on the floor groaning, unable to move much more than just wobbling her massively swollen body. She suddenly felt a pressure on her mammoth stomach, different than just the food pushing out, this felt more like someone climbing atop her, riding the swell of her body. Barely able to open her eyes due to her cheeks squeezing them nearly shut, she was barely able to make out Minos leaning down over her massive fleshy breasts. Judging from the feeling, Minos seemed to be completely naked and clearly aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026Mora, look what you have done to yourself,\u201d his familiar voice whispered, though she could still feel it causing every inch of her body to wobble from the vibration. \u201cI suppose the only thing I can do then is to reward you for a job well done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t even speak because of the weight on her lungs and the pressure from her savagely stuffed stomach. Minos didn\u2019t need her prompting though as he moved closer to her head, causing him to lie partway within the deep crack of her cleavage. He then took great pleasure in continuing her gluttony with desserts of all kinds. With each bite, Mora could feel her body growing a bit larger and tighter, skin and flesh groaning as she was packed with more and more food and fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she thought that she couldn\u2019t eat another bite without risk of exploding, Minos stopped and gave her a kiss before saying, \u201cExcellent job Mora, we can continue again soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the obvious strain her body was under, Mora hoped that they would continue very soon, her hunger starting to flare up again. With that, the dream faded away slowly, leaving the image of her immense bloated body swimming in her mind.</span></div></div>",

The room was circular in structure, surrounded by three levels of seating chairs, and the center circle (wide enough to fit a semi-truck and trailer) where she was currently strapped to a strange table. Her arms and legs were bound tightly to her desapointment and her mouth gagged. The only source of light in the dimly lite room was a single lamp shade at the center of the ceilling. Finally getting her bearings Mora looks around trying to understand how she got here. The last thing she remembered was getting ready to go into town to meet Alej for a meeting at a one of her company's warehouse that's was supposed to be abandoned. After she put on her blue jeans, her black T-shirt, and finally her white sleeveless vest Mora went and told everyone she'll be out for a couple hours and took a taxi to the warehouse. When she got there she remembered the door being opened, going inside, heading to the office room, finding Alej unconscious on the floor, quickly rushed to her side, then a sharp pain in her neck, finally feeling groggy fell next to her friend. The last thing she saw as her vision became blurry was a strange dart in Alej's neck and a group of cloaked, and masked strangers then darkness.<br>\r\n After remembering what happened. Mora looked to her right and saw three of the cloaked members that ambushed her and Alej walked out of a door from the top level and down the stairs to the center circle. As they reached the table.

She looked at them and they at her. Her frustration growing she had things she wanted to know. 1) Why were these people doing this? 2) What is there reason? But more importantly as one of them removed the gag.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n3) \"WHAT THE HELL DID YOU BASTARDS DO WITH ALEJ?\" She yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She yelled loud enough to scare a stampied of lions she was so pissed. The three figures startled by her outburst regained their composer. The one on her right spoke first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't worry she's fine I promise you that. I can also assure to you that we have no inflation of killing or cause you or your friend any harm.\" A calm female voice spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Mora looked at the masked female and said as calmly as she could. \"Then why did you kiddnap us ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe masked female explained \"Because you and your friend need to be put in your place my dear.\" She said with a bit of saticfaction in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Hearing this Mora began to show signs of worry from this group. The masked female gave a tested of her hand to the other two. As if by command they both went left out through double doors leaving Mora alone with their apparent leader. Alone the leader began to walk around Mora as if examining her. She placed her left hand on Mora's right thigh and gently squeezed it to measure thickness. From the thigh she moved down Mora's leg and did the samething. When she got to the left side she placed a hand on Mora's stomach feeling around the top and sides of it. All the while Mora had an embarrassed look on her face. As the leader continued her examination Mora felt like she was the measured for some kind of fitting. That ended when the leader placed one hand under Mora's left butt cheek and the other on her left breast then began rubbing them. Dispite earlyer Mora was know upset with what's happening feeling she being violated. The leader continued rubbing and squeezing those areas analyzing and gathering data on thickness, texture, size, and weight. She stopped her analysis looked at Mora chuckled then said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well well you and your friend are indeed blessed in both areas.\" The leader said with a que in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Mora was both embarrassed and furious with her captore.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mora felt so self conscious as she sat at a table in the back of the restaurant, barely looking up from her wineglass as she toyed with the stem. The slinky black backless dress she wore had been a gift, and not something she usually wore. The top piece of the dress looped around her neck and hugged her breasts, breasts that had gotten a bit bigger as of late. In fact, her whole body had gotten a bit bigger as of late, something that was only adding to her embarrassment. It also didn\u2019t help that she was sitting in a rather fancy restaurant, beyond her usual fare when eating with the rest of the people at the farm. She had been invited out though, and she wasn\u2019t about to turn down this invitation, so she had to make the best of it. Time continued to slip past as she waited, and waited, and waited some more. She had already refilled and drained her wineglass several times and was starting to experience a bit of annoyance as well as concern. Mora tucked a loose lock of hair behind her ear and scratched around one of her small horns, then stood up ready to leave and maybe make a phone call. She stopped when she heard a familiar voice, and took her seat again as she saw Alejandra being led to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about the wait, got tied up at work, couldn\u2019t even call,\u201d Alej said as she took her seat across from Mora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was starting to wonder,\u201d Mora responded coolly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t be like that, I wouldn\u2019t miss this, you know that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black and white bovine tugged slightly at her dress, similar to Mora\u2019s but in a deep blue and with a slightly different cut. Alej also hadn\u2019t put on any weight as Mora had, so her dress hung a bit differently as well, showing just a little tantalizing glimpse of her cleavage, white with just a hint of pink coloring the soft view. Her stomach was also just as trim as it had been, compared to Mora\u2019s that pushed out the front of her dress and lightly rested on her thighs. Alej had also let her hair grow out a bit so that the black and white tresses hung down to about her shoulder blades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMora was still surprised from time to time how this had happened. When Minos left again, putting the end to their relationship for what seemed the last time, Mora ended up pretty well torn up. No one could break the bovine woman out of her funk till Alejandra gave her some tough love and got her to come to her senses. At first this strained their recently mended friendship, but that was quickly smoothed past as Mora started to feel better as the days went by. It took a while, but Mora also noticed how often Alejandra would tempt her with food; things like a box of candies to \u201cheighten her mood\u201d or a tub of ice cream after a hard day. Mora was just enjoying having Alejandra as a friend again, and the farm had been going spectacularly, so she wasn\u2019t all that concerned with indulging a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real shock came when they went out to a little diner after heading into town for a bit of business. That night had started out simple enough, just the two of them chatting about the recent events over their orders. Alej had been acting a bit more restless than usual, and it seemed that she had something on her mind. Mora didn\u2019t pry; figuring that the other woman would say what was on her mind if or when she needed to. She didn\u2019t have to wait long though as after they were finishing with dessert \u2013 with Alej somehow convincing Mora to get both a slice of pie and a big milkshake \u2013 Alejandra suddenly reached across the table, grabbed Mora\u2019s shoulders and pulled her into a deep kiss. After the initial shock wore off, Mora felt her toes clench from a wave of unexpected pleasure. She also ignored the fact that Alej grabbing her had resulted in a cup of water getting knocked over, soaking her shirt and sending a chill down her front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the kiss broke, Mora was a bit stunned, certainly too stunned to react as Alejandra dashed out of the diner, leaving Mora behind. It was a couple days later that Alejandra showed up at the farm, and explained how she felt about Mora. Mora was as stunned at this as she had been at the kiss, but warmed to the idea in time. She also hadn\u2019t been expecting the offers of food to only increase as their relationship entered a new stage, resulting in her steadily increasing weight. She was torn though, between the unease about her ballooning size and the joy she was getting from Alejandra, and she didn\u2019t want to mess that up. Some small portion of her mind was also actually starting to like the feeling of her stomach being packed full \u2013 and usually a bit beyond \u2013 of whatever food Alej was offering, and tonight wasn\u2019t looking to be any different. Alejandra had just finished ordering, and had apparently two full meals for Mora in addition to one for herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou al; right, you looked like you were lost in thought,\u201d Alejandra said, after sipping some of her wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, just thinking about\u2026<i>us</i>, you know. It\u2019s still a bit of a shock sometimes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026I know that feeling, but doesn\u2019t it feel good the rest of the time?\u201d Alej said, as she lovely caressed the back of Mora\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMora nodded at that, before asking Alejandra about what had kept her. Alejandra\u2019s response as well as the following conversation kept the two of them busy until the food arrived. There was a steaming hot plate for Alejandra and two larger plates for Mora, with the waitress having a somewhat quizzical expression but not saying anything as she set the plates down and moved along. Mora gulped slightly as she saw what Alej had ordered for her, but the hopeful expression on the other woman\u2019s face made Mora dig in, slowly at first, but with increasing speed as the wonderful tastes filled her mouth.</span></div></div>",

Tila was currently serving an elven customer who looked to be reaching his limit worse yet he was looking to be an angry drunk. She could to tell he was going to be trouble, and made a move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, why don\u2019t you fetch me another mug of Meade wench\u201d the rude elf orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve had enough\u2026pay your tab and leave.\u201d she commanded, raising her voice only slightly as to not rouse the other patrons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you when I\u2019be hab enof\u2026you\u2026you ugly coyote!\u201d the elf yelled nearly tumbling from his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTila will tell you once! Now one yells at me like that in my guild hall, and now I\u2019m asking you to leave\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you *<i>hic</i>* I\u2019m not leaven\u2019\u201d the elven elementalist said still in a stupor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO.K. we do this the hard way!\u201d Tila\u2019s gargantuan body lumbered quickly over the bar, and grabbed the meddling alchemist by his long elven ears, and the back of his robe. She hoisted him to the hall\u2019s door and tossed him high into the air and onto the cold wet ground outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet that be a lesson, maybe next time you\u2019ll know your limit\u2026\u201d she scolded him and headed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying there on the ground his drunkenness driven out by anger and rage, the elven elementalist uttered a chant under his breath. \u201cFoul feline temptress! May your mouth run dry and the sting of your spirits be ten times as wicked.\u201d With that incantation a blue glow flowed from his fingers tips and flew into the air, hitting Tila covertly in her wide muscular back. This would be a sight to see for sure, he'd given her an insatiable thirst and made her body respond to liquid as if it were ten times the amount she was drinking, she'd would be as big as a whale within days, and then he'd make her beg him for mercy. Well he\u2019d have his revenge on the bar wench yet, but now he had to find another place to stay\u2026<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\nAs she closed up her hall that night, Tila was exhausted. After taking a warm bath in her luxurious ivory tub, she helped herself to a tall stein of mead to relax. Then another and another and another still! She was beyond parched, and every mug seemed unable to quench her thirst. Perhaps she was getting drunk the room for the room was beginning to spin, and she was feeling strange. She decided to sleep away this strange thirst she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she lay down in her grand bed, her body by and large felt peculiar, it wobbled as she rested on her bed. It was almost as her stomach had expanded from the alchol she\u2019d drunken. In fact, her whole body felt puffier, swollen? Oh well, hopefully she would feel better in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTila\u2026</span></div></div>",

Inside of Tila\u2019s noisy tavern/guild hall the haggling sessions between the two had been legendarily long and usually with neither of them getting the exact deal they hoped for, even so the two were quite friendly with each other. Now between them was what appeared to be an ordinary truffle, but the conjurer had insisted that there was more to it than what met the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know I don\u2019t take anyone at their word, especially yours\u201d the powerful purple leopardess added with a harrumph. \u201cI\u2019m gonna need to see some proof of these \u201cpowers\u201d before I buy this \u201cgolden\u201d truffle of yours hun\u201d she clawed at the air to form to form quotes, her large looming form and sharp claws also serving as a reminder why nobody tricked Tila.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf cour-\u201d his voice rose and cracked as this sight, no matter how many times he saw it, always jolted him, \u201c*Ahem* \u201cOf course! When used correctly in a Gnome\u2019s magic spell, it\u2019s said to grant near impenetrable skin!\u201d he raised his voice hoping to attract attention from Tila, or any other buyers. He took a blade from his waist, it glowed with a red tinted magical power. \u201cHaaa!\u201d he shouted as brought his blade upon the truffle. To no one but his own surprise the truffle split in two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha, what?\u201d he gasped in puzzlement at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTila remained unimpressed by this show. \u201cWell, I think that settles things\u2026\u201d she said rising up to full height and an evil smile on her face. \u201cI\u2019ll give you two gold. One for the truffle and your little show, and one for you to leave my guild hall for a week after that little swindling you tried to pull.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mage had no way out, surprised as he was the truffle hadn\u2019t broke he couldn\u2019t possibly explain it. He shrugged before saying \u201cDeal madame. I guess me and the gnome who traded this to me have some unfinished business\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell do take care than sugar\u201d said Tila politely handing him the two pieces of gold. Then her face turned into a serious stare and her voiced jumped to a much more threatening tone as she added \u201cRemember though one week. If I see hide or hare of you in my guild hall\u2026\u201d she trailed off not needing to finish, the dark magician understood what would await him or anyone who disobeyed Tila.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bowed slightly, keeping his head low as he exited through the halls massive wooden doors. He puzzled over what had gone wrong as he exited the large leopard\u2019s domain, had that gnome cheated him? No, he\u2019d assuredly had felt something within the magical object, even if it was in the form of a truffle. It wasn\u2019t long till he realized his unfortunate mistake. Of course the truffle had split when he cut it; in his rush to seal the deal he\u2019d used his own enchanted knife! OH, if he\u2019d only used any other regular weapon on hand, he could have shown how impenetrable it was! Such was the fragile complications that were the laws of magik... Maybe he could go explain to Tila, but wait! She\u2019d told him to stay away. Not one to her anger (or test his luck) he decided against revisiting her. Tila was the most knowledgeable trader he knew in fact... BLAST IT! She probably realized the mistake he\u2019d made, and what a steal she\u2019d gotten for too! That was probably the case, oh well they\u2019d both laugh over it in a week, and with his mind at ease he headed off on his next quest to return in a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a long night for Tila and she was ready to relax. Getting ready for a nice long bath, she began to undress when she found the two pieces of the truffle rattling around in her pocket. Thinking nothing special of them she placed both halves of the truffle in her mouth, chewing the exotic tasting treat with delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh...\" she sighed as she relaxed into the extremely large bathtubs hot water she had to admit, even if he\u2019d try to scam her the mage had \u201csold\u201d her a delicious tasting truffle. Soon Tila was asleep, and unbeknown to her the truffle she had swallowed did indeed possesses great power. As it churned inside her stomach it slowly worked its magic, in this case causing anyone who swallowed it to grow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning\u2026</span></div></div>",

In order to become a Knight, Joy must embark on a quest to prove that she is capable. Though along the way, Joy had unwittingly taken a different path after taking the advice from the writings of carved stone that she mistook of being part of the quest. It was a mistake with consequences that would shake the very foundation of Neo-Earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a load of crap!\" Joy fumed as she walks through the dense, vine filled forest with no end in sight. \"<i>Take the path to eastern lake the rock said. Take the path to the canyon the rock said.</i> All I found was a pond and a goddamn ditch!\" Joy proceed to trudge through the path that was directed to her in the seemingly vain hope of finding the end. \"If I ever find the guy who wrote that sign on the rock, I'm going to kick him square in th- GYAAGH!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath the antelope's legs, the floor collapsed downwards like a trapdoor that immediately closed the moment the victim fell through. Joy should have saw this one coming she thought as she plummets into the chasm below. However, Joy isn't really all that interested in dying helplessly in a hole and thus used her staff to jab into the walls to at least slow her fall. Joy's efforts have saved her life and managed to hop safely down the bottom floor. The question is though, how exactly is Joy going to get out? She looked around the dimly lit room to see that she can climb on some ledges to get back up but ledges can only go so far up, leaving a giant gap between being trapped and freedom. There is an alternative though, and that is in the form of a cave but it could lead to a dead end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy decided to go through the cave and begins to notice the walls are made with blocks of stone indicating that people have built this place. \"That's one hell of a way to make an entry way to this place, at least it shows that I'm on the right path... hopefully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Joy walked through the hallway, the place becomes more visible and strangely cleaner for the matter. The architecture begins to show indications that the hall is built in a Nordic style like as if it was built by ancient Vikings. Regardless of the strangely well maintained masonry, Joy's attention was taken by something that she never expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn iron chandelier hangs above a large stone table and on is what appears to be a full set of armor. First is the helmet, a jet black sallet adorned with an illustration depicting a long,  western dragon. Second is the black, plated pauldrons with gold lining the edges. Third is the dark green, full body scale mail that reach down to the knees. Fourth is the black metal plated war kilt bearing similar dragons that's on the helmet. Fifth is the black, plated boots that reach up to knees. Finally is a bronze medallion of a flaming sun. To Joy, the armor is the most awesome thing she ever saw in her entire life! To make everything even better, written along the side of the stone table says \"Bear the armor of the Dragon Queen to prove your worth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy didn't hesitate to take this opportunity and dons the armor but she quickly begins to notice something. \"Everything else seems to fit perfectly fine but why is it so loose at the top?\"</span></div></div>",

Joy turned around to curiously look at the strange phenomenon and that's when everything changed. A bolt of lightening fired from the chandelier into the stone table and ricocheted from it towards Joy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gyaagh!\" Joy screamed as the sudden surge of energy ran through her body. Joy fell to the floor but managed to put her arms in front of her to prevent her face from being smashed against the floor. \"Wha... What the... hell was that? Raaugh!\" Another surge of energy ran through her body, this time more so in the legs. Strangely enough, there was no pain from the surge, it simply felt overwhelming. Joy managed to get herself back up. \"Damn, what the hell is going on?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy's legs began to have that surge again, this time it feels as though that there are things growing in them. \"Are those... <b>talons?\"</b> Razor sharp talons began to grow out of the plated boots where her toes were so suppose to be and it looks as though the boots are changing accordingly to the shape of Joy's new feet. It didn't stop there, the transformation worked it's way up Joy's leg. They're becoming longer and more so thicker, indicating that the legs are becoming stronger. \"Okay... I like the new set of legs but do I really need the talons?\" Joy said as she began to blush as her legs are becoming stronger but also becoming very attractively voluptuous even under the armor! The once short knight in training is now a whopping eight and a half feet tall! \"This is starting to get really weird. Is this even part of the training? Huurck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA surge of energy shot through Joy's body again causing her to arc back. The surge almost took her off balance but thanks to her new legs, Joy can still stand. Joy's tail begins to under go the transformation, this time her tail show reptilian characteristics and Joy finally got the hint: She's turning into a dragon! \"Oh my god, is this what happens when I wear this armor? This is fucking awesome! The fuck...? Am I not done yet?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be proportionate to the legs, Joy's torso and arms began to grow making her height reach at twelve feet with definite signs of more muscle mass though still having a sexy appeal to it. Reptilian scales began to show more though still slightly covered by Joy's original fur along with sharp claws at the tips of her fingers. \"Well, I guess this would make sense and all bu... Hyurck! YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!\" Another surge of energy went through Joy again. Joy noticed a swelling sensation in chest and notice that her breasts are growing. She began to hold her forming breasts as they growing at a rapid rate. \"Oh, wow! I'm getting bigger than my mom. Damn, they're getting huge!\" The breasts grew to the size of beach balls and becoming very firm, firm enough that they can take a strong hit from a melee weapon. \"I don't want to sound cliche but I've heard of boobs of steel but this ridiculous!\" With Joy's massive boobs now stretching the plate mail, one final surge shot through Joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What fate do you wish to choose, warrior?\" a voice rang out in Joy's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's there?\" Joy responded as if someone was there watching her transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am the spirit of the Dragon Queen and you are my successor.\" answered the spirit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What fate do I get to choose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is the choice of becoming a guardian to the world or become its conqueror, choose wisely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to become...</span></div></div>",

Through out the day, not one soul walked in the place, not even the high school kids who would use the library's computers would ever came. The books are neatly in placed in the proper shelves, the windows glistened from a recent cleaning, and chairs are placed accordingly along the tables. \"This should be the easiest job in the world but I'm bored out of my mind!\" Pepper-Ann thought to herself as she lays her head against the desk. \"This is the most boring day of my life...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM! An explosion rocked the library as if it got hit by a artillery shell. Shelves are knocked off their bolted foundations, the windows turned into shattered shrapnel, and almost everything else but the wall of the library have been blown to pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit, are we being invaded?!\" gasped the frightened fox who is now climbing out of desk she used as protection. \"What's going on?\" Pepper-Ann said aloud as she looks around the now severely damaged library. She quickly scans the area and immediately towards to what seems to be the epicenter of the explosion, a deep crater where the reading tables were suppose to be. Pepper slowly walked towards the crater, she has no idea what's in there, the possibilities are endless, and some of them are putting her on edge. It could be a wreaking ball that got loose, it could be a meteor, or it could be a live bomb that hasn't detonated yet! The librarian got on her stomach and crawled towards the edges of the newly made pit and saw the most baffling discovery she ever saw in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the center of the crater, a massive entity kneels on the deepened floor and it remained there as though it were a statue. It's head bears a black helmet with two long horns sprouting out with smaller horns lining up on each main horn. On the side of the helmet are long black ears and flowing brown hair coming from the back of the helm. Pepper-Ann scans the armor the entity is wearing, the thick pauldrons, the plated boots, the scale mail, the... giant breasts? The fox begins to fume and already coming to a conclusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You crazy, top heavy, lumbering bitch!\" Pepper-Ann yelled. \"You think you can use this library as a cushion for your giant boobs? I have to find a new job no thanks to you!\" The librarian continues to banter and hasn't noticed the entity had already moved. \"I don't care who you think you are! Hell, I don't even care if you're the fucking High Prime!\" Pepper-Ann turns around to head towards the nearest available exit. \"I'm going to get the police have them haul your sorry a... *gasp*!\" The entity is right in front of her with it's head at Pepper-Ann's eye level. Pepper sees the small artistic details on the helmet but then became too distracted by the two glowing, maroon eyes peering through the helmet's eye slit. The front of the helmet somehow horizontally slides opens to reveal a face of a stern antelope woman who owns the glowing eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ADDRESS YOURSELF!\" bellowed the entity which of course frightens the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah- Wha...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, address yourself! If you are willing to rant your opinion about me, at least give me the courtesy to tell me who you are so I would know who I would be killing if you persist in your banter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecomposing herself, Pepper-Ann obliged, \"Pepper-Ann, and if we're going to do this courtesy thing you may as well tell me your name so at least I would know who I'm going to do a beat down on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entity brought her right arm to the her left and pulled out a bar of some kind from the left arm's armored brace. She quickly swings the bar to her far right which seems to magically turn the bar into a giant halberd with arcs of electricity sparking from the blade. The entity reveals a grin, \"Joy, <i>future</i> Supreme Overlord of Neo-Earth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPepper stands there in shock after seeing what Joy can do. After a few whimpers Pepper spoke,\"That is... FUCKING AWESOME!!!\" Pepper-Ann said with a big, bright squee face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right?\" Joy, also bearing a squee face despite having a confrontational talk with the librarian. \"I can teleport too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Wait, is that why there's a giant ass crater here?\" Pepper-Ann points out the seemingly obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... right... I really need to work on the landing more, I thought I had it down. Sorry,\" Joy apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet it's those boobs of yours that helped you make that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually no, I was trying to aim for the basement of this place and I've... undershot it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you would have walked in here like everyone else does, I could have, you know, help you find what you are looking for.\" the fox said in a snarky tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I'm sure you regularly serve twelve foot tall, super villains with the agenda of trying to take over the world...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OF COURSE!\" yelled Pepper-Ann.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Joy responded with confusion of why the fox said that in a loud and deep tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't go on the internet much do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough, I'll consider of sparing your life if you help seek the book called the <i>Codex of the Banished Ancients</i>. It suppose to have history about someone called the Dragon Queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, what makes you think that I'll help you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy smiled and took a deep breath. She then blew a maroon cloud at Pepper-Ann and the cloud worked it's way into the fox's mouth. Pepper-Ann felt a strong growing sensation in her chest and her blouse began to tighten. It didn't take long for Pepper to find out what it is happening, her breasts are growing rapidly to the size of basketballs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serve me and I'll reward you more!\" Joy said as Pepper-Ann begin to squeeze her new breasts to see if they're authentic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I will serve! I actually know a lot about the Codex itself, I use the stories in it for board games with friends of mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friends you say? Hmm, I would require minions to help further my cause of world domination.\" said Joy with an evil grin with a devious plan behind it.</span></div></div>",

Well, these are just the opposite, slowing one\u2019s metabolism as well as being incredibly dense with calories.

She\u2019d be willing to try anything if it was for Davin. Popping two into her mouth the berries tasted unlike anything she\u2019d ever had before, a mix of mulberry jam and sweet peaches. And the juice within them was as thick as honey or molasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing the two pleasant tasting berries she instantly felt a heavy dullness in her stomach and headed back to her hotel room. Feeling very sleepy she tucked away the other berries in her room\u2019s top dresser drawer.

She chewed the two juicy berries, again enjoying their exotic taste as she did so, soon Ann buried herself in blankets while she drifted asleep with thoughts of just her and Davin alone on the beach turning through her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*Beep! Beep! Beep!* </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alarm beside Ann\u2019s hotel bed blared, jostling the country girl awake. Remembering where she was and why the clock had nosily gone off, she glanced at the time. It was time to meet Traci for lunch already; she was going to be late if she didn\u2019t hurry! Not wanting to leave one of her best friends waiting another second, she roused herself until she was wide-awake, wobbling wildly as she did so.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn was in such a rush going to meet Traci she didn\u2019t bother to give herself a once over. <i>If she had</i> she would have noticed a lot of changes in her reflection. One of the many being that her lime green zip was having a hell of a time trying to hold in the round taut globe that was now Ann\u2019s gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the dining lounge she found a sign informing guests that lunch was not being served inside but rather outdoors on the pool and patio, in a lovely luau themed buffet. Beautiful spreads of diced and sliced fresh fruit, a smoothie/margarita maker, as well as a fresh roasted ham were all there waiting for guest to partake in. Scanning the tables Ann found that Traci was there too waving for her attention, Ann took a seat on one of the plush patio chairs. Only till she sat down did she take in how tight her clothes felt on her, the zipper cut tightly against her front, and tightening against her tawny fur. Her rear end squished into the seat filling it from side to side, something the formerly slim Ann was unused to, but now pleased with as a sign to her devotion to Davin.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow Ann\u2026you\u2019re already looking umm, healthier. You came hungry I take it? \u201d Traci said treading carefully to not offend her companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, <b>*huff* </b>just a second Tiggs...\u201d Ann took a sharp breath in and slowly slid her zipper down lower, making sure to keep her lady parts in, but let her middle out.  And out it came! A fat stomach now equal in size to Coco\u2019s spilled forth and into the gal\u2019s lap. Ann grinned at the sight, the berries and food had worked overtime and stuffed her speedily why she slept, she made the right choice by taking those berries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhooo, looks like this little gals grown!\u201d she said giving one of her stomach rolls a smack.  \u201cTarnation Traci you know what? I\u2019m even hungrier than before if that\u2019s possible! Let\u2019s do this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d TIggs said clasping her paws together. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to tell me what you\u2019ve been up to lately, maybe over a tall margarita maybe! Oh and I\u2019ve been dying to try some of that ham and maybe some of that poi stuff too, what do you think sounds good Ann? Ann?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTraci saw Ann was too busy staring off to hear what she\u2019d just asked her. An odd look was on Ann\u2019s face as she saw the two who were headed right for her table\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were none other than... </span></div></div>",

One hand typed away at the keyboard, the other stuffed itself into the end of a bag of cheese puffs. It had been a new bag at the beginning of the night. Cocoa hated the tax season. She had left it nearly to the last minute as usual, and she had to keep track of everything herself, given her online business. She shoveled in another handful of puffs and kept tapping away as she licked her fingers. Quite a pile of crumbs had nestled themselves in the crook of Cocoa's shirt where her belly stuck out. Between the stress and Cocoa's tendency toward comfort food, tax season wasn't complete with ten more pounds nestled permanently on her body - mostly her hips. But Cocoa's mind wasn't on that.

She rubbed her eyes and sighed, accepting the poor night for what it was. She didn't tend to put up resistance, even against her own life. She glanced up at her computer. 10am, earlier than usual. Also, her address was now listed as ggbhashfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff ffffffffffffffffffffff. Cocoa decided she had enough time to go shower.

So she decided to get into some better clothes than a T-shirt and sweatpants. Of course her jeans just reminded her of how fat she was, at least in her eyes. She reconsidered getting out....no one wanted to see her fat self. Cocoa headed over to her fridge and opened the door. And then groaned, thunking her head against the freezer door. Her fridge contained all of half a jar of pickle slices, some mustard, and orange juice. She could order groceries online, but she must have forgotten this week what with reorganizing her entire finances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll go out.\" she muttered, once again acquiescing to life. she grabbed her keys, wallet, and headed outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCocoa wandered about town, trying to keep to the sides and out of people's way.

The bunny had some loose leaf paper and was sketching something. She glanced at Cocoa again and made no attempt to hide it. Cocoa stopped her jaw from dropping. What was going on? Was the woman...drawing her? Could she do that? Should Cocoa move? She blushed and tried to ignore it. She gulped down her coffee, ignoring the nearly scalding heat. The rabbit kept sketching. Cocoa glanced up. What was with her fur? Was is painted? Was it make up? Such smooth patterns, lines and swirls that hugged her body, drew the eyes. Not in indecent ways, mind you - she had curves that smoothed the bend of her elbow, and rings and swirls about her neck and cheeks that made her look exotic. It was like looking at some strange new work of modern art. Cocoa looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nibbled at her muffin, but suddenly the rabbit girl left. Cocoa glanced up, looked around, and looked to her table. Some papers had been left! Cocoa looked around again to see if anyone was watching, and then got up and tried to inconspicuously wander over to the other table (it was in fact quite obvious she was being 'sneaky' but Cocoa was too focused to know this). Cocoa picked up one of the papers. It was a zen symbol, but made spiky, with what Cocoa realized looked greatly like the way her fur tufts came up. Another sheet had another black-and-white symbol, clearly east asian in inspiration, smooth and round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are...beautiful....\" Cocoa mumbled.

The essentials being milk, bread, jam, a couple of other bits, and about six bags of chip and a few two litres. She could go shopping properly later. She could feel those sketches in her bag. She felt like a thief. She should have just let it happen, like she always did. But...something felt so strange, so personal about those designs. She nearly ended up wandering into the wrong cash register line, and then almost tried to pay with her driver's license. This was why she stayed inside!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing home (not that Cocoa could move with any great speed for any great distance) Cocoa ended up dumping the groceries on the kitchen table and going for the sketches. She sat down at the couch (a bag of chips just ended up in her hands, she swore they appeared out of thin air) and went over them more carefully. There was a kind of...spiky softness to them. She couldn't explain it. Round, round, everything was circles or bulbous shapes, but something would suddenly end in a curving point, or something else would be outlined like it had had its fur rubbed the wrong way. There was something....intensely personal about these designs. So abstract, so strange, yet the panda bear felt like they legitimately belonged to her....or had come from her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a week since that strange encounter. Cocoa's taxes were done. But now she really needed to drum up business. Graphic design - logos, digital art, even the occasional concept model for some small-time video game - 3D and 2D were both fine by her. Problem was, while Cocoa's technical skill with her tablet was top-notch, and she was fairly good at the basics of aesthetics, her work never popped out at people. That was why corporations were her main patrons - they didn't want anything that stood out that much, after all. Just like herself, Cocoa couldn't help but think, trying to come up with something. Different enough to stand out, but not really special. Then her eye caught something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmudged with chip and cheese dust, a couple papers lay on the edge of her desk. She had almost forgotten them....those woman's designs. They had sat there since that first day - she had meant to do something with them, but what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't....but....\" life seemed to have handed Cocoa the perfect opportunity. And Cocoa never argued with life. She was really hitting an artist's block otherwise, so....she picked up one paper, blue off the dust and set it in front of her. She booted up photoshop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour hours passed with Cocoa almost unmoving. Her arm kept going, and her eyes glanced back and forth occasionally, but she seemed lost to time. Slowly, ever so carefully, she transformed the picture with all the accuracy of a photocopier. But then she moved to different programs, and began to transform it. Not change it, but turn it from a paper drawing to something 3D . She could <i>see</i> what was supposed to happen. This was supposed to be in front. These were in shadow. The wisps here curled away - those over there were in-line with one another. A strange, almost furry, almost silken zen-like symbol emerged onto her computer. It was spherical, and didn't seem to turn quite at the rate it should have, the shading moving so smoothly that instead of the black-and-white of the typical yin-yang there was one smooth gradient that seemed to wrap around on itself all around the piece. Cocoa finished the last touches, and took what seemed like the first breath in hours. This was.....stunning.....but she didn't feel like she could submit it. It felt so...personal. But Cocoa shook herself out of this. She didn't really have a choice, if she wanted to stay employed. Taking a deep sigh, she prepared to send it to her website as \"new for this season\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------<b r></b>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a week later, and Cocoa was taking a quick break in front of the TV with another bag of chips. She felt horrible. The design....was brilliant. She had gotten positive feedback already - and her site did not attract that many views. People were calling it a \"fantasy\" design. Like it belonged in D&amp;D . This was dangerously enticing.....Cocoa wondered what Dischorida would do. Getting famous....off of what wasn't even really her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get famous myself!\" Cocoa blurted. \"That's what she'd say. What kind of low-down thief steals credit!\" she was interrupted from her emerging schizophrenia by the doorbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...?\" who visited her? She hadn't ordered anything, and it wasn't time for her D&amp;D session yet. Cautiously, she opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, hello there.\" the figure in the doorway made Cocoa freeze. The tall black bunny from before! Despite her fear, Cocoa couldn't help but look on with interest. The woman's fur looked almost painted, or dyed, but not quite either. And no dye could be so fine. It was impossible to just look at one part of her. The tribal-like lines across her body, the smooth swirls and curls - as soon as you tried to follow one, it led you everywhere, even hidden under her clothes there seemed to be an unbroken chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you're my muse.\" the woman said, holding up a piece of paper. It held a printout of Cocoa's design on it. Cocoa swallowed hard. What would Dischordia....?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-pardon me. But I think you're mine.\" she admitted. The woman smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should talk.....\"</span></div></div>",

The question lingered in the air before Cocoa, who was still too dazed and shocked to act. Angel seeing she wasn\u2019t getting any answers let herself in. As she effortless entered Cocoa\u2019s den her presence seemed to fill the room. Cocoa unconsciously shut the door, but continued to stare at this stalker of sorts.  She wasn\u2019t sure but she thought that the tattoos on the stranger\u2019s black body here were somehow different, but just as artistic as the one\u2019s she\u2019d seen before. Her eyes snapped back to attention as she refocused on the main problem: What exactly was she doing here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo those pictures you drew uh\u2026\u201d Cocoa began, tiptoeing towards her own guilt as she returned to her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Angel, and yes what of them?\u201d she said grinning; Angel was going to let this Coca person admit her own guilt, something within her just loved seeing other people uncomfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWell they were really good.\u201d Were the words Cocoa ended up going with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank yourself\u2026Coca was it?\u201d Angel said reading off the printout of Cocoa\u2019s designs and website details all while making herself at home on Cocoa\u2019s couch. \u201cUs artist often inspire one another\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026you think I\u2019m\u2026 c\u2019mon.\u201d Coca said blushing from the compliments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes but your other designs aren\u2019t what I\u2019m here to talk about.

You my dear, love to eat, I can tell.\u201d Cocoa caught her drift and her eyes drifted down ashamedly at the floor.  If she had a bit more self-esteem she might have asked why Angel had come here just to insult her, but instead only remained silent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u201d Angel gasped seeing the timid panda bear turn upset. \u201cThat was supposed to be a compliment. Let me put it another way you are a guiltless gourmand.  You see, that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with society. They\u2019ve made everything taboo! Free enjoyment of sex, drugs, even food. Well it\u2019s there loss, my big bear, I think you\u2019re beautiful and if you just really like food too, than more power to you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026you really think so?\u201d Coca sniffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes! I need to draw with you again my muse.\u201d Angel said leaning in closer eyes shining with artistic intent. \u201cAnd considering the fact  of those drawings I did before, and how you didn\u2019t <i>exactly</i> use them with permission.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCocoa wouldn\u2019t be drawn again not by this stranger she barely knew, not here\u2026 But then again she had used those drawings, and in a way Angel\u2019s determination reminded her of Dischordia\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, fine!\u201d She agreed balling her pudgy paws into fists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFucking Fantastic!\u201d Angel shouted immediately getting up \u201cI\u2019ll be right back with my brushes and some other things\u2026\u201dand with that she was already out of Cocoa\u2019s doorway. Still a little self-conscious, Coco helped herself to the remains of the potato chip bag at hand but still did not feel any better or less hungry for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCocoa saw the tall and black bunny had quickly returned with said in brushes in hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as Angel returned  she took note of the pudgy panda before saying...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was early morning, the sun was just starting to dispel the thin mist that had formed, and the early birds were getting the proverbial worms. This included Cocoa Pau-da, a panda hard at work at her computer in her home. The woman split her time between sketching on the tablet in her lap, and devouring any information she could find about a new update to one of her favorite online games. It was during a particularly vigorous sketching session that her eyes shifted slightly and fell once again on the white curvy expanse of her breasts, an expanse that had gotten somewhat bigger recently. Cocoa also noted yet again how her whole body had been steadily expanding during that same period. She still felt a bit uncertain about it, but much less so than at the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all started a number of months ago\u2014though it seemed longer than that to Cocoa; she had just gone through a bad breakup, and had thrown herself completely into her games. She was also eating far more takeout that she probably should have been, but she didn\u2019t feel like going out very much, and just wanted to get away from the real world for a time. After a while of this, some of her friends finally convinced her to move on and get back out in the world. She had done it grudgingly at first, but kept at it, knowing that they were only trying to help. Over time, all of them started to become less concerned about the panda as she came out of her self-imposed shell again. One of them however kept up spending more time with Cocoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started out as just little friendly invitations out for coffee or a movie or something, but over time Cocoa noticed it was starting to be less friendly and more romantic. She also noticed that the invitations were more often than not involving food, and increasing amounts of it: little boxes of chocolates became big boxes of chocolates, asking if she wanted desert became ordering desert and asking her to eat it, a small soda and popcorn at the movies became a large soda and popcorn along with a big box of candy or two, and so on and so forth. It had been subtle and slow, so Cocoa didn\u2019t notice it happening, or didn\u2019t want to admit that she noticed it happening, perhaps too caught up in a giddy mix of emotions she thought she wouldn\u2019t experience again. She was also surprised to find that she was liking the attention as well as the food; what the food was doing to her on the hand, she was still unsure about, her free hand probing the soft fur and fat of her larger stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings had taken on a more serious tone as well; last night was just the latest in a small number of times they spent together, making passionate love together till they both passed out from exhaustion. Cocoa blushed as she remembered some of the things she had experienced the night before, as well as similar events throughout the preceding weeks. Something had also occurred to her last night; she realized that the sex had been getting even more passionate and lust filled as her weight slowly crept up. She had come across mentions of FAs, FFAs, feeders, feedees, and so on during her time spent online, but had never put much thought into it; and yet, now it seemed almost certain that she in a relationship with someone who seemed to enjoy her pudge and most likely wanted even more of it on her body. The thought was shocking to Cocoa, but also a bit thrilling on some level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was stirred out of her whirling thoughts by the sound of a creaking floorboard from behind her, as well as a familiar scent tickling her nose. Before she could react, a pair of arms fell onto her shoulders and encircled her neck. Those arms belonged to someone distinctly\u2026</span></div></div>",
