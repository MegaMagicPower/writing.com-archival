            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was before school on a late April Friday morning in Shermer Illinois when everything changed. It was a pretty nice morning in the near-Chicago small town, the spring dew catching the rays of the rising sun, a low mist creeping across the shadows of the trees, birds singing as they fluttered among the blossoming leaves. Even the temperature was great, it was on track to get to 78 degrees fahrenheit today. Just a great day to walk to school, as the lone teen sitting on the front porch of his modest home was preparing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill Strasserman was your everyday teen. He was nearing the end of high school and outside of having a persistent bully problem his only real concerns were an annoying little sister and lack of a girlfriend, though they were small problems in the grand scheme of things. After all, college loomed on the horizon and Bill was confident that he'd find <i>someone</i> interested in him there. Hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis more sci-fi and video game hobbies and lack of any real interest in sports did however give him some worry. He didn't hate sports, he enjoyed watching baseball and basketball, and he was friends with several players on each teams, including Tom Ackerton, his best friend since Kindergarten. But he just didn't care for participating in them. It was actually a little embarassing to him that his lowest grade was in P.E. simply because he hated having to participate in sports! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been his lack of interest in 'manly' things such as sports and his slightly small physical stature that had attracted the attention of Rob Bolstrum in the first place. Rob had targeted Bill early on in middle school, the hulking giant having already been held back twice. It was only in his sophmore year that things had changed for Bill, but not for the better. Jonathan Ingerman, or 'Big Jon' as he was known by the student body, had moved to Shermer. And it had taken him very, very little time for the intimidating and just as strong as Rob rich kid to take over as king of the bullies. He had tricked Rob into fighting him for dominance and had outplayed Bolstrum, and now Rob was little more than an errand boy, doing all the things that Big Jon commanded of him. At first the students had welcomed the change in leadership only to realize that Ingerman was ten times as worse than Rob had ever been, and about five times as smart. Not to mention the money and influence his father, Ragnar Ingerman wielded over the school administration and the town as a whole that caused a blind eye to be turned to Big Jon's clearly criminal enterprises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then one day, Bill had been able to trick Big Jon, during one of the routine shakedowns that the more easily preyed upon student population had grown accustomed to by getting Ingerman to monologue while unknowingly on camera, the bully king boasting about himself, his power, and how he'd keep picking on the weak to get what he wanted. \"It's just good business\" Big Jon had said with a shark-like grin towards the camera. And the end result had been enough evidence that had forced the school to take action, suspending Big Jon for a week before the local press had gotten involved. And while Bill became a bit of a high school hero for that, Big Jon definitely had it out for him. He was the reason that Bill was still reliant on others to transport him around, his already in poor shape car getting vandalized in the middle of the night and ending up a pile of scrap that would cost far too much money to fix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no real job and no way to pin it on Ingerman, Bill was stuck using his bike or having others, like Tom or his parents, take him places. And when it came to school taking his bike wasn't much of an option either, and Bill wasn't about to leave his last mode of rapid transportation at the mercy of being stolen or otherwise destroyed by Ingerman's fury. So he had walked to school most mornings, unless the weather had been terrible. It wasn't too far and honestly, the exercise had done him <i>some</i> good. The last few months Tom had even joined him, though this was not entirely out of a desire to keep Bill company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom had been having significant relationship issues with his long time on and off again girlfriend, Gloria Vanapolous. This last breakup had been particularly rough and seemed pretty final; Gloria was trashing Tom around school to her girlfriends, which had quickly filtered to the rest of the student body. And through the grapevine the stories had been twisted to a point that had left Tom an outsider, even on his basketball team as his teammates girlfriends were busy making their lives painful if they even spoke to Tom outside of practice. To ease his isolation and to sneak into school with a little less of the mean girl bitching that had greeted him in the student parking lot, Tom had decided to walk to school with Bill. Bill had been happy for the company and to give Tom the opportunity for a little comraderie and venting before school started, but his friend's thoughts had become particularly...dark the last week. Almost to the point where Bill was starting to get annoyed. And more than a little worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill checked his watch, the classic Timex that his grandfather had bought him for his birthday reading 7:32AM. Tom was running late, already he could hear his mother and father and little sister Kimberly finishing up their morning routines and frankly, Bill didn't want to deal with another harping at \"Just take your bike\" or \"You should get a job and get that damned car fixed\" or \"Honey, just let me take you to school\" or a high pitched \"NYAH NYAH NYAH LOSER STINKFACE\". Just thinking about it, on top of everything else, made his blood start to boil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill was just getting ready to leave his friend behind and make his way to school alone when it happened. One moment the porch's white railing had been clear, just the typical slightly cracked and fading white paint shining with dew and sunlight as Bill bent over to grab his backpack, and when he rose up he saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, right in front of him, was a stone. And not just any stone, but a gemstone. It was a brilliant emerald green teardrop that caught the light and refracted it against Bill's torso. It was impossible to miss, and Bill knew that it had <i>not</i> been there before. The teen leanded in closer and picked the gem up. It was cool to the touch, and almost completely opaque, though bringing it up to his eye BIll could see another, smaller gem embedded in the core of the emerald; this one also a teardrop though cloudy and gold in color. It glowed, but the light from the sun seemed to curve around it instead of passing through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird\" Bill said to himself, \"I know this isn't mom's it's too expensive looking. And where did it come from? Hell, I wonder how much it's worth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut any thoughts of selling it were quickly pushed away as his anger over the rather mundane things in his life seemed to flare back to the forefront of his mind. Why couldn't life just be easier? Why did he have to suffer because of some idiot neanderthal, or wait around like a doofus for his sadsack failure of a friend? OR take shit from his familiy? Bill's hand curled into a fist around the gemstone and he grit his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I wish...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut right then Bill's anger was pushed away by a loud \"HEY BILL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerked out of his angry state, Bill looked up and saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"HEY BILL\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerked out of his angry state, Bill looked up and saw his friend Tom rounding the corner across the street, backpack hooked over one shoulder and looking like he had his own personal raincloud above his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking finally...\" Bill muttered to himself as he hustled down the front steps and quickly made his way across the street. Tom looked even worse up close, Bill saw; the other teen's face was pale and bags hung heavily under his bloodshot eyes. The disgraced jock's clothes were wrinkled, and Bill was pretty sure those were the pants that Tom had worn yesterday. It was clear that even by the now normal standard, Tom had a particularly rough night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two friends exchanged a fistbump and made their way along the concrete, their footfalls and birdsong the only words between them for a few minutes before Bill finally broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, check this out.\" Bill said, holding the strange green gemstone over to Tom as they walked. Tom took it and spun it around in his hands for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. This your mom's or something?\" The other boy asked, stopping and holding it up to the sun, his tired eyes squinting as he watched how the light seemed to curve, not refract, through the smaller, central gem. Tom let out a low whistle before the two started walking again, Tom continuing to inspect the artifact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I literally just found it. It was sitting on the porch! I was thinking that maybe we go back to your place after school and then drive out to the mall so I can have the jewelers look at it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...About that...\" Tom muttered, his fist closing around the gemstone and his exhausted face growing dark. Bill knew that look, it was the look Tom got every single time that Gloria was involved in something. He shook his head and placed a hand on Tom's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what happened this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom sighed and shrugged Bill's arm away, \"My parents were out last night so I walked to McFly's to get something to eat. Turns out the G-Squad had the same idea.\" The G-Squad was Tom's private way of referring to Gloria's groupies, her little clique that hung on every word Tom's ex had to say and then spread it around the school at the speed of gossip. McFly's was a local indoor/outdoor burger joint that stayed open late and sometimes featured local artists. It was decently popular with high school students for it's cheap prices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit\" Bill said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. So I didn't actually realize they were there until I had already started eating. They surrounded the table and gave me so much shit, man. Then they fucking followed me halfway home! I bet they would have kept following me if it hadn't been for Ingerman and Bolstrum. So then they gave me shit. But apparently a ten dollar bribe wasn't good enough because they egged the house AND the car! And of course no one actually sees it and mom and dad actually buy into Gloria's bullshit so they think I'm making all this shit up...So I had to clean all of that mess up and dad took my keys. I maybe got like thirty minutes of sleep, all because of her bullshit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of the boys noticed the green-gold glow coming from Tom's closed fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom. You gotta repo-\" Bill tried again, but he was again shot down as Tom flew deeper into a rage fueled by lack of sleep and emotional trauma that was the other boy's life. Bill had seriously been trying to get Tom to report all the abuse he had been taking to the police or get a counselor or just...something. It wasn't healthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like no matter what I do, it's wrong! I mind my own business, I'm being cold and distant and a brat. If I try to just talk with her about all this, she gets to play me off as desperate and that I won't leave her alone! I can't even get angry because then who the fuck knows what she'll say! I just don't understand what to do, Bill!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Bill noticed the glow coming from Tom's fist. Was the gem causing that? He needed to calm Tom down so he'd drop the rock before it exploded or something like the space rock did in the rebooted Spiderman movie. \"Tom\" He started, but was again cut off as Tom said the fateful words that would change both of their lives forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit! I wish that...\"</span></div></div>",

With a flash of light and heat reality shimmered away around Bill, who found himself unable to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill was no longer standing on the street next to Tom. Instead he was back home sitting on the porch. But something was wrong, he couldn't move! Instead he was frozen as a feeling warmth crashed over his body, painful at first but then incredibly relaxing and soothing. But he couldn't feel anything beyond that. If he hadn't been caught up in the feeling of his imminent changes, he would have seen the world around him had frozen as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad Bill been able to look down, he would have seen his male mass strip away, his overall height shortening while his legs seemed to stretch out. His feet shrunk in his black/gray sneakers which immediately became a pair of peppy white shoes with pink highlights. His bulky jeans tightened around his waist, which seemed to shrink inwards but then immediately curve outwards once more. The jeans hugged his now long, slender legs as his body hair ceased to exist along his legs and arms. His arms slimmed down along with his hands, ten soft red pools appearing on the tips of his fingers. The hard wood of the porch softened somewhat as his posterior swelled, the excess mass of his male body pooling there while even more former muscle and fat surged into his chest, sending two large mountains rising into the morning air while his stomach became taut and toned.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething between his legs caved inward, leaving a warm void. His shoulders and neck slimmed, while his face changed, the once broad and strong bones reconfiguring into a far more feminine shape. His lips plumped and became coated with gloss and lipstick.  Strong cheekbones pushed themselves up beneath where once flawless skin now resided. His nose slimmed while his eyes grew slightly larger, changing from brown to blue, eyelashes growing longer as the changes continued upwards, his ears shrinking in size while accessories materialized on his lobes. His short brown hair exploded from his scalp in a slightly curling cascade of silky locks, pooling on his new shoulders and draping down his arced back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final change was Bill's shirt, formerly just another t-shirt, now a white and black stripped designer top that had a risky neckline to his newfound cleavage while a strong supportive bra formed beneath his new organs. A light dusting crossed his face as very soft make-up was appled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, reality seemed to start once more. Birds chirped fro mthe trees, a slight breeze blowing away the last of the morning fog, Tom rounding the corner across the street...And the stone was nowhere to be found.</span></div></div>",

She leapt to her feet, grabbing her backpack and purse, nearly bounding down the much larger steps of his front porch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BYE MOM, TOM'S HERE!\" She shouted in her singsong voice, not waiting for a reply. She quickly raced across the quiet street and practically tackled Tom, leaping into his arms and planting a large kiss on his handsome, sexy lips. He was looking so great today, a fresh haircut, his skin tanned, his muscles rippling under the letterman jacket he wore. She could just stare into those dreamy brown eyes, even if they did look so cute and confused, forever...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom, on the other hand, did not have the luxury of being fully adapted to the situation. One moment he had been with his best friend Bill a block from school, the next minute he was back on Bill's street, and this gorgeous brunette had tossed herself at him! Instinctively Tom knew that this was Willow, his girlfriend. They had been best friends since grade school and it was clear they had were meant to be soulmates to anyone that took even the slightest look at them. She was a cheerleader, he was on the basketball, football AND baseball teams, it was an almost too sappy, too perfect love story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then there was the previous reality, where Tom was depressed, almost suicidal, and the only bright spot in his life being the times when he'd hang out with Bill. The one person that had never bought Gloria's bullshit, the one person that knew the truth. Bill was Tom's brother and the primary reason why Tom hadn't killed himself, never wanting to put his best friend through something like that. So strong was the bond that while this beautiful girl snuggling against him felt so right and so good, he couldn't help but feel horrible about what had become of Bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in Tom's hand, the Ahn'Ger Stone's ethereal green-gold light faded away, leaving no trace that it had been involved at all...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tom Ackerton, handsome but depressed basketball hero, was severely conflicted as he walked to school with Willow Strasserman, his gorgeous and charming cheerleader girlfriend, formerly known as Bill. A back and forth tennis match was occurring in Tom's mind, his conscience weighing whether or not he should use the wishing rock he now possessed to change Willow back into his male confidant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom dwelled on this heavily during the trip. He imagined that he was in one of those old cartoons, with an angel on your right shoulder representing your personal ethics, and a devil on your right shoulder representing your selfish desires: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngel: \u201cBill's your best friend! You have to change him back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevil: \u201cBut Willow is your best friend too, and she's so hot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngel: \u201cYou're stealing Bill's identity away from him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevil: \u201cReality has been rewritten. Willow doesn't remember being Bill, and nobody but you remembers Bill. Who is really suffering here? Did I mention that Willow is really hot?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis indecisiveness, this impulsive nature of Tom's, was what had spurred him into making that stupid wish in the first place. Tom had always been impulsive, jumping at every opportunity the first chance he could. Bill had compared his temperament once to the Large Hadron Collidor. Bill had tried to explain to him what CERN's purpose was. Tom had tuned him out, joking condescendingly to Bill that he wasn't a nerd and didn't need to know about that stuff, but he had gotten the gist of it. It was particles that move around at super high velocity speeds crashing into each other. Yep, that sure was Tom all right, and now he was paying for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew memories had immediately created themselves in the aftermath of Tom's fateful wish. He now realized that he was in another reality altogether from the one he woke up in. One, indeed, where Bill Strasserman never existed. One where Tom had never gone out with Gloria Vanapoulos. One where Gloria never made him crack up with her insecurity and need for drama. One where Gloria's G-squad never soiled his reputation. One where the diva like girl had never even gave Tom much thought apparently. The Vanapoulos offspring didn't dare, as the entire school knew that Tom and Willow were an item. Tom and Willow in this reality were Ken and Barbie, the school's pretty boy and the school's preordained Homecoming Queen, the one her fellow seniors voted \u201cMost Likely To Succeed\u201d out of high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom almost couldn't believe this. He had a magic wishing rock! The fact that he held in his hand some ancient artifact that could bend reality to his whim...not only was it almost too much power to handle, but it went against everything Tom Ackerton grew up believing in. Tom had prided himself on his skepticism. He was never a brain like Bill was, but his parents had instilled in him a burning desire to constantly challenge himself, to improve himself, to never settle for \u201cgood enough\u201d, to be a paragon of both body and mind. Part of this ambition included a desire to dispel himself of any delusions or superstitions. Tom knew that ghost sightings were just figments of the very fallible human imagination and our primitive pattern detection skills. He knew that UFO abduction stories were likely a combination of sleep paralysis and watching too many movies. He knew that 99.9% of all psychics and mediums were scammers, using cold reading and mentalism to fool gullible marks, and that the remaining .01% were likely just delusional. He was disinclined to believe in the paranormal right from the very start, and yet here he was. He had irrefutable proof in the existence of magic. In his hand held a stone which bent light around it, carried an unnatural coldness, and could do just about anything. It was an astounding feeling to know he held something so godly right in the palm of his had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrior to this morning, Tom had never been one for fantasy, for whimsy, for flights of fancy. He never had that much interest in speculative fiction. That was more Bill's thing. When Bill tried to get Tom to watch Rick &amp; Morty with him one day, Tom became bored within minutes, and asked to change the channel so he could watch rugby instead. Now his brain was lighting up with possibilities, dreaming of parallel universes and time travel like Bill's favorite show Doctor Who. The Stone was exciting...but also a burden. A heavy responsibility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom looked down. His Stone free hand was wrapped around Willow's smaller, more delicate hand. He looked up at Willow's pretty face, who was staring at him like a lovesick puppy. She started talking. Then she started giggling. She made Tom giggle along with her, and then she kissed him deeply, their lips locked in perfect synchronicity. Life was good for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the lovely couple reached school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now though, now he had options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom continued to stare at the utter perfection that was Willow Strasserman as she walked inside the glass doors. Lost in his daydream, the young man didn't mind his surroundings carefully enough as he immediately found himself surrounded by Big Jon Ingerman's gang, all of whom had seemingly dropped from the sky. Tom honestly didn't know how people that bulky and that slow were that talented at sneaking up on people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRomeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou is our fucking money, Romeo?\u201d said the deep, unpleasantly obnoxious and arrogant voice directly behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom snapped himself out of it remarkably quickly. If the voice didn't give it away, the looming shadow that cast itself over the front entrance to the school sure did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Big Jon\u201d answered the basketball star, not turning to face the bully. \u201cGood to see you too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Jon snapped his fingers nonchalantly, and two of his intimidating looking underlings pinned Tom's arms and forced him to turn around and look Jon in the face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's better\u201d said the lead bully, appraising his quarry up and down with a predator's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon walked up to Tom and threateningly laid a hand on his shoulder. His blonde, rough hewn Nordic face was close enough for Tom to take a whiff of his breath. Jon smelled of lutefisk, a disgusting Norwegian dish, Tom remembered Bill telling him once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo punk, how much you got this week?\u201d the bully asked him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm broke, Jon. Please. I'll have more money on Monday. I swear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom suddenly felt one of Jon's flunkies patting down his jeans and searching through his pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe's clean, boss\u201d said the gorilla like teen Randall Jones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom mentally breathed a sigh of relief, glad that the all powerful gemstone he had been carrying was still tucked inside his fist. None of the Junior Achievement Club seemed to notice it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better have something by Monday, or you'll be leaving for summer vacation on a stretcher\u201d warned Jon, his voice serious and deep. \u201cOr worse. Maybe I'll cut your little slut's face, give her a little Joker smile for you two lovebirds to remember me by.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you're busy sitting in jail?\u201d Tom snarked. He instantly realized he shouldn't have said it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat'd you say, Ackerton?\u201d said Jon, his face turning just the slightest shade redder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom's heart stopped. He loved Bill. He loved Willow. He couldn't let anything happen to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't like guys who hurt girls\u201d Tom said, defiantly once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat would do about it if I did do something, pussy?\u201d asked Jon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question hung in the air for a long period of time before Jon spoke again. Tom just gulped. Magic rock or not, Big Jon was a scary dude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's what I thought. Just a pretty face without any balls. Get out of my sight, you fucking dork\u201d, lightly smacking Tom on the cheek in a show of dominance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon's gang all pulled away from Tom, allowing him safe passage inside the building. Tom took two long strides towards the glass door when his impulsive nature came rearing its head once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was furious at being shown up. Aggravated being humiliated by a sadistic freak like Big Jon. That's when he saw the stone in his hand glowing between the cracks of his fingers. Even if Bill had turned into a girl and he had never gone out with Gloria, he'd be damned if he still had to deal with harassment from this future death row inmate.  Big Jon made him sick! This was his one chance to finally do something about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish you'd punch yourself in the face for ten minutes straight\u201d said the basketball star. He said it softly, but the tenor of his voice was anything but ambiguous. Tom Ackerton meant it definitively. The Stone flashed brightly and then extinguished itself. Smiling to himself, Tom walked inside. He didn't need to witness what happened next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat'd that asshole mutter to himself?\u201d asked Rob Bolstrum as he saw Tom walk inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe's probably just crazy\u201d ironically added another bully, Leon 'Loco' Scarfo, who himself had a severe personality disorder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob looked toward his reluctant boss as Jon immediately gave himself a self inflicted black eye with his own fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck? Why'd you hit yourself?\u201d asked Rob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don't know!\u201d yelled Jon, his other fist now punching himself in the mouth, damaging his teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon's left hand grabbed his right wrist, attempting to restrain the almost sentient fist from punching himself again. He watched his fist tremble mightily in his grip. It was the most bizarre thing he ever saw. If he had been a movie fan, Jon may have been reminded of a famous sequence from Evil Dead II.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of sheer curiosity wondering what would happen if he let  go, Jon did, and he was greeted by another painful black shiner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Tom spends the rest of the day using the Ahn'Ger Stone to settle other petty grievances like what he just did to Big Jon. Feeling guilty, he eventually talks to Mr. Ellis, the school guidance counselor, about whether to transform Willow back into Bill, using coded language and metaphor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: At the end of an otherwise uneventful day at school with no other opportunities to use the Stone, Tom goes to meet up with Bill, now Willow, only to find one of Big Jon's thugs waiting for him instead! </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tom grinned to himself as he left the baseball field, duffel bag of equipment under his arm and ball-cap pulled tight around his head, blocking out the low afternoon sun. He couldn't believe how great his day had been, the run-in with Ingerman this morning notwithstanding. His life was totally different now that Willow was his girlfriend and Gloria hadn't mucked up everything! Instead of just basketball he was now still on the football and baseball teams! His teammates were laughing and talking to him, Mr. Lonnigan wasn't glaring at him (well, more than usual, at least), and he didn't feel so...exhausted like he did before he'd made that fateful wish this morning outside of Bill's...Willow's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom tried not to think about the fact that he'd just erased his best friend and replaced him with a beautiful woman that was head over heels in love with him. On the one hand everything was better now, his life was back on track the way it was before Gloria had gotten her claws into him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of Gloria...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria herself had been reduced in status, now that Willow was around the raven haired girl was no longer the queen of Shermer High. Instead she was just another girl, the 'bitch' of Shermer High's cheerleaders with far less influence than she ever had before. In this new reality Gloria's attitude had left her without a boyfriend, though the now mean-spirited rumors were that Gloria was either a lesbian, or was seeing a boy from another school...Or was too much of a 'mommy's girl' to be allowed to have a boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom shuddered as he remembered the few times he'd had to interact with Gloria's mom. He had thought Gloria had been a controlling bitch, Ariadne was a meg-bitch. Or maybe even THE mega-bitch. She had been the most intimidating, hateful woman Tom had ever met, and Gloria was almost a entirely different person around her. Polite, quiet, hooking up with Tom had been her one act of defiance...And he had been tolerated by the Vanapolous matriarch in that previous reality only because he had been Shermer High's all-star athlete. And even then the few times he'd eaten dinner over there she'd glared at him like a hawk watching a mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Willow was captain of the cheerleading squad (and so good at what she did that Shermer High now apparently had a cheer team, all thanks to her). She was super popular and loved by most of the student body, and even though most of what had actually made Bill, well, Bill seemed to have been replaced by a love of makeup, cheerleading, romance and other almost stereotypical girly things, his/her life seemed much better as well.  Her parents were still the Greg and Martha Strasserman that Tom had known all his life, though they seemed much more proud of Willow's accomplishments than they ever had been of Bill's more academically focused ones. Tom felt a little bad that the new memories in his mind knew that there was now a trophy case standing in the main entryway of the Strasserman's house, filled with trophies from Willow's various gymnastics events when she was younger and now her numerous accolades as a cheerleader. That seemed to be Willow's only real shortcoming, she struggled in subjects that Bill had once excelled in like math, science and history...And while Bill had owned a entire bookcase filled with science fiction and fantasy novels, Willow only owned a handful of young adult novels, like Twilight or Hunger Games, or the first few Harry Potter books before she'd grown out of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They just got so sad and boring! And who wants to read when you can just watch the movies?\" Willow had told Tom one night when they were curled up on Tom's couch watching one of the funnier Marvel films, the one with the talking raccoon and...Groot? Tom never really payed attention before, and especially not with his dream girl cuddled against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven her relationship with her little sister was better! Before, when Bill had still been Bill, his relationship with Kimberley Strasserman had been..strained at best. The girl was a bit of a obnoxious brat that loved nothing more than to make Bill's life miserable whenever she could. But now Kimberly looked up to big sister and was already planning on being a cheerleader herself once she got into high school. And she acted more mature as well, mimicking Willow's grace and poise and breezingly pleasant personality. All in all, becoming Willow had seemed to be the best thing to have ever happened to BOTH Bill and Tom.There was no more looking over her shoulder for Ingerman, or at least hadn't been before Tom had run his mouth to Big Jon this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as rich as the bully had been, now the self-styled 'crime lord' of Shermer High was nowhere to be seen, the bully having been carted off to the hospital after reportedly breaking his nose and knocking out several teeth with his own fists. Tom knew there was no way that what had happened would ever get back to him, after all who would believe that the all-star all American athlete superstar of Shermer High had used a magic stone to force Big Jon to punch himself in the face?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut regardless of how things had turned out, how absolutely perfect things had been all day, Tom couldn't shake the feeling that maybe he should have just walked away without making a wish on the odd green gemstone which was now secure in his backpack and wrapped up in a pair of smelly ball socks for extra potential thief deterrent. The teenager tried to distract himself from the creeping, familiar anxiety with about how wonderful it would be to see Willow again, her perfect smile, her taste as they kissed, the warmth of her body against his. Her laugh. Tom knew he was probably grinning like a fool the entire walk from the ball field to McFly's, but he didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was, finally, happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least he was until he rounded the corner and saw the hulking redheaded form of Rob Bolstrum leaning against the brick wall of the restaurant, a cigarette in his club like hand as his hateful eyes locked onto Tom the moment he'd stepped into view. Panic gripped Tom's chest as he remembered Big Jon's words from earlier in the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'll cut your little slut's face, give her a little Joker smile for you two lovebirds to remember me by.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething hot fell into the pit of Tom's stomach as the thought of Willow being hurt, being pinned down and having her face mutilated by Big Jon's goon squad blasted it's way to the front of his mind, and he curled his hands into fists as Rob threw his cigarette to the ground and slowly, steadily, stomped his way towards Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ackerton!\" Rob called out, \"you and I, we need to talk about someting\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? What about?\" Tom hissed back as the giant bully came to a stop in front of him. Tom was no slouch, he couldn't be, not when he was the star of all three sports at the school, but Rob was, like Big Jon, in another weight class. Tom reckoned he could give the big man a good fight but much like the guy that Tom Hardy had played in that one Batman movie, Tom would simply be broken before him.And Rob was a LOT faster than the big palooka looked, maybe in a different life the big man would have been another fellow athlete, probably on his way to being an unstoppable football player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom knew his only real chance in a fight would be to use the Stone and wish Rob away, or into something else. Maybe change him into a little kid or something. He just needed to get the damn thing out of it's hiding place in his sports bag. And if Big Jon was actually following through on his threat to hurt Willow...Tom could do nothing for her if Rob wiped the asphalt with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Turns out you did something today. Did something to Big Jon. I heard what you said. You wished he'd punch himself in the face for ten minutes and that's EXACTLY what he did\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom tensed up in alarm. It was happening! Jon had somehow figured it out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just tell me where Willow is and I won't break your fucking jaw\" The teenage growled, dropping his sports bag to the ground. He'd go for the legs first, maybe trip Rob up, get in a few kicks and then-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom's mental preparation was interrupted as Rob began laughing, a harsh barking sound as the ginger titan's face lit up in amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah there tiger! Like you, heh, like you could ever, he, do anything to me. You stupid little, cunt!\" Rob said as he was consumed by laughter, his muscled form bent over as he guffawed into the asphalt. This gave Tom just enough to open his duffel bag while, dig through his clothes and retrieve the gemstone from it's smelly containment. The magical artifact burst to life in his fingers, the strange light shimmering from within before Tom closed his fist around it and hid the glow from the world and Rob's sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rob rose back up, wiping a stray tear from his eye, the bully held out a huge hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Christ moron, the bitch is fine! I sent, heh, I sent my buddy Jules to go lock the locker room doors. She's gonna be a few minutes, which gives us a chance to talk. I know you made Ingercunt punch himself in the face this morning. It was nice to see that insufferable asshole taken down a peg! So I want to buy in. Whatever you're doing, however you're doing it, I want to see that fucking asshole bleed! I want payback for when he kicked my ass and stole my guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom blinked in surprise. Was this a trick?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you say, Ackerton? You wanna let me in on how you did it? Or teach me? Help me get rid of Ingerman and I promise I won't bother you or that walking tit-factory girlfriend of yours ever again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Tom, for now, agrees to help Rob take Big Jon down. The enemy of his enemy, however surprising it might have been, was his friend right? He'd just have to keep the Stone out of Rob's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Tom errs on the side of caution and decides to get rid of Rob with an angry wish! \"I wish you were someone else! Someone smaller and nicer!\" In a flash of light, Rob is transformed!</span></div></div>",

But then he remembered all the times that Rob had bullied the less physically capable students at school, the way he had made the old Bill's life hell...And now having locked Willow in the locker room at school?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Tom knew that Rob didn't hurt girls (unless he absolutely had to) the fact that he'd locked the love of his new and improved life up triggered the impulsive, protective side of Tom's personality. And with this magical gemstone, he didn't NEED Rob's help to deal with Ingerman. Or anyone else for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you, Rob! It'll be a cold day in hell before I trust you!\" Tom spat out, tightening his fists as Rob's face shifted from as nice a grin as the redheaded bully could make back into a infuriated scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! I'll do it myself!\" Rob roared, balling up his fists and rushing towards Tom faster than anyone his size had any right to be. Tom had tangled with Rob once before and hadn't come out on top, and that had been just a casual beating.Tom knew that he wouldn't last long; Rob was in another weight class entirely, and he was out for blood. There was only one thing he could do, something that he had thought impossible just a day earlier..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as Rob closed the gap between the two of them, Tom squeezed the magical gemstone tighter and cried out \"I wish you were someone else! Someone smaller and nicer!\u201d. It wasn't the perfect wish but in the heat of the rapidly closing moment Tom had simply blurted out the first words he'd thought to say. And as Rob reared back, hammer-like fist closed tight to deliver a jaw shattering haymaker to the smaller athlete the bully was struck by a bolt of viridian light that shot from Tom's closed fist.  it was struck Rob's hulking form and Rob's silhouette was the last thing Tom saw as the flash forced his eyes closed, leaving a burning after-image in the darkness of Rob recoiling from the strike, his body suddenly shorter than it should have been as the change immediately began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n. But as quickly as it had appeared the light faded away, leaving nothing but the late afternoon light from the setting sun and the long shadows it was casting in the parking lot of McFly's. Tom opened his eyes slowly, blinking away the after-image of Rob's warping form before going wide as he saw what was standing in the exact same spot that the hulking redheaded brute had just been green smoke curling off shoulders that were much smaller (and rounder) than they had been just a moment before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last of the afterimage of Rob's original body faded away into his new form, Tom's eyes went wide as he saw that Rob Bolstrum had been transformed into a...</span></div></div>",

Standing right in front of him, the very spot where the towering Rob Bolstrum had been about to destroy Tom in order to take the magical gemstone for himself, was now a cute twelve year old girl! She wore a white shirt that had '#GrlPwer' printed upon it in hot pink and sparkles and a pair of capri pants, blonde hair that curled ever so slightly and seemed to glow in the late afternoon light framing a impossibly cute face that looked so much like Tom's mother Elaine with just a smidge of his father's genetics mixed in. And two large, deep blue eyes that seemed clouded over and unfocused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait, he...she looks like mom! Does that mean-\" Tom's thought in alarm before a dull throbbing washed over his brain as new memories were created as the new reality settled into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sweaty from Little League baseball practice, Tom's dad had taken him home where his mom explained that she wasn't getting fat like Tom had thought, but that he was going to have a little sister! And then months later staying at his best friend Willow's house while his mom and dad went to the hospital, his grandpa taking him there the next morning and seeing the curly blonde little baby in his moms' arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your little sister Tom! Say hi to Roberta!\" His mom had said softly, and Tom had simply stared in awe at the little sleeping creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemories of getting woken up by intense midnight squalling, the smells of diaper changes, spending more time with his grandparents and at Willow's house so his parents could have something of a break. Watching Roberta grow from a tiny pink screaming burrito into a drooling toddler making grunts as she struggled to walk and talk. her first word being 'mama' and the numerous extravagantly pink birthdays. Introducing her to Willow and her own new little sister that had been born a few weeks after Roberta. Willow squealing in delight that she now had TWO 'dolls' to play with and Roberta and Kimberly quickly becoming best friends that did EVERYTHING together, having nearly identical interests, likes and dislikes and being practically inseparable as they grew up together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first day of school, Tom showing her how to sneak cookies from the cookie jar, helping her ride a bike, play video games, and Tom's life slowly becoming inundated with girly toys and way too many Barbie dolls. The petty, but loving sibling bickering and both of them annoying the other in ways that only a brother and sister could, and teaching her how to be a just as pretty on the inside as she was on the otuside, to be kind, honest and caring towards others just like Tom was. And the intensely burning, protective feeling he felt towards Roberta, or 'Bobbi' as every called her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobbi Ackerton, his little sister.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom staggered back as the wave of memories made his head spin. He shook the strange disorientation off, wondering why it felt different from the new memories of Willow burying themselves in his mind. Maybe each wish had a cumulative effect? The farther one went from the original reality, the more disorienting it was? Tom blinked away the last of the dizziness and looked down at Bobbi as her incredibly blue eyes began to sparkle and clear as she seemed to spring to life in front of Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in a voice that was the complete opposite of Rob's gutteral snarls, she began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: \"What did you do to me!?\" Bobbi screams in alarm, clearly remembering her past life on top of her new one. Despite this however, Rob seems forced to behave like the perfect little sister, girly to a fault and exceedingly nice, just like Tom had wished for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: \"Tommy, when will Kimmy and Willow be here?\" Bobbi asks innocently, and conversing with her further shows that Rob Bolstrum has been erased entirely. Only Bobbi Ackerton exists now, and the two siblings were meeting with Willow and her little sister for dinner before going to the park. A play date for the girls and some romance for the two teens.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As new memories flood into Tom's mind, does Rob remember who he used to be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Rob looked remarkably like a twelve year old fusion of...Tom and his dad! Gone were Rob's trademark red hair, replaced with a short blonde buzz cut similar to Tom's own hairstyle, and gone were the scars and hateful green eyes that everyone knew so well. Rob was still lanky, but now there was a layer of chubbiness that replaced his once bulging muscles.

Tom felt the changes as they washed over his body, a deep pulsing rhythm and fire not unlike the sensation of feeling returning to his body after being numb and asleep. His hair grew longer as his near-buzzcut bloomed outward, pulling his head back was it cascaded downward with surprising weight. His masculine frame shrinking as his muscles diminished in size, leaving him feeling smaller, weaker. There was suddenly a void between his legs as his pants suddenly felt very tight around his waist and rear, and his chest became irritatingly itchy before Tom's floating form jerked upwards as two...somethings rose from the flesh on his torso. His face felt like he'd suffered from severe sunburn until it suddenly vanished, leaving his lips feeling wrong and the perspective of the green-gold world around him somewhat larger than it had been seconds ago. Tom winced with new eyes as the sharp, stabbing pain of a migraine shot through his head, only to be replaced by a strange...fuzziness that dissipated just as quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom was aware that his clothing was different as he regained control over his newly changed form as the tingling subsided as Tom felt his smaller feet regain purchase on the ground. The overpowering light began to fade, the verdant filter that had been applied to Shermer leeching away as reds, blues, browns and all the other colors of the suburb burst back into existence. Time returned to normal as Bill's nearby body began to move once more, arms shooting upward to cover a scrunched up face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, just like that, it was over. The sound of bird song, the distant noise of morning traffic and all the other sounds of the town and nature returning to the world. And a painful coldness bit into Tom's hand, the one that had been holding the strange gemstone BIll had found just minutes earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom was acutely aware that it was larger in his hand than it had been just a scant few seconds ago. As the world returned to normal, Tom look down at himself in shock, taking in the two breasts that now protruded out of his body and the canyon of flesh that now hung between them. Locks of long hair slipped into his vision as he gazed downward and he pushed the stray hairs out of his eyes, freezing at the sight of his flawless, hairless, and much more slender arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom's new eyes grew even larger and panic began to seep into his mind when Bill finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: \"Tom?

You look like a girl!\" Tom has become a teenage girl, the same age as Bill! The geek's eyes nearly popped out of their sockets as he stared at what had become of his best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was roughly the same height as Tom, maybe only an inch or two shorter. Tom's former closely cut hair now spilling out in blonde locks that reached his new slender shoulders. Tom's face now clearly resembled his mother, Elaine Ackerton, with wide blue eyes, a cute, slightly up-turned nose and full lips that were coated in lipstick. Tom's face was now less angular, taking on more of a rounded, heart-shaped face and his cheeks seemed naturally rosy as two gold earrings glinted in the morning sunlight. The rest of Tom's body had changed as well. Where before Tom had been wearing his varsity jacket, now he was wearing a pink and white t-shirt that displayed his sizable but not huge breasts, and his arms were smooth, hair-less and definitely smaller now as the muscle mass had shriveled away. Not to say that Tom's new body looked weak, though, as the jock's new body was clearly still very athletic. Tom's abdomen was missing the six pack that he'd worked hard to create, though the mid-rift visible by the one size too small shirt definitely revealed a taut and toned stomach. Tom's legs were no longer encased in a pair of full length jeans and instead his new, smooth flesh was exposed as the pants were now reduced to shorts that ended just above Tom's new knees, and the sneakers he had been wearing just moments ago had shrunk and turned white with pink highlights. Even Tom's backpack had changed to match his new color scheme, white and pink and...fuzzy? What were those tassles sticking out of the not-fully-closed zipper? They almost looked like...cheerleading pompoms?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bill gawked at his friend's changes, he couldn't help but mentally compare his friend's new body to a early 2000s Jessica Simpson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wonder if this is what Tom would have looked like if he'd been born a girl?' Bill wondered silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...what? How did-?\u201d Tom examined himself, or rather, herself. \u201cWhat the hell just happened?\u201d The former male's free hand shot up to cover his new mouth in shock at the sound of his new, much airier voice, before feeling around for the non-existent adam's apple on his slender neck. He slowly pulled the hand away to stare at it, confused, amazed, and more than a little scared by how small it looked, and the pink nail polish that tipped each perfectly manicured finger...Or the three gold bracelets that slid down his forearm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How am I gonna play football now? I'll never be able to get my hand around the ball!' Was Tom's first thought before he began looking the rest of himself over and shivering at how sensitive his skin felt now...And how jiggly the two mounds on his chest were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think the stone has something to do with it. It was glowing when you wished you could understand women.\u201d Bill explained, pointing at Tom's new tiny hand that still held the strange, magical rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this thing grants wishes?\u201d Tom examined the stone, uncurling his slender, pink-tipped fingers slowly until the gemstone was exposed to the sun. \u201cWell why did it turn me into a girl? I wished to understand women, not become one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe it thinks the best way to make you understand women is to make you be one.\u201d Bill guessed with a shrug as he tried not to stare at Tom's new butt as it hugged the fabric of the new shorts. The last thing he needed was to get turned on by all this, even if his friend was really, really hot now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, it couldn\u2019t just alter my mind to make me instantly understand them? Sounds like a ripoff.\u201d Tom complained, striking a girlish pose without realizing it, cocking a hand on one of his curvy hips while he glared at the artifact that had given him said hips. \u201cIn any case, let\u2019s fix this. I wish I was a guy again.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, nothing happened. \u201cWell that\u2019s just great. I guess it was only good for one wish.\u201d Tom said, his face scrunching into a pout that looked more cute than upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr we just don\u2019t understand how it works. It wasn\u2019t glowing when I found it, but then it started glowing while you were holding it. There must be some kinda trigger or something.\u201d Bill said, pointing towards the magical rock. It was strange how it didn't seem to glow or reflect the light from the sun, like Ton's new earrings and bracelets were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what kind of trigger could it be?\u201d Tom asked as he shifted in his new shoes and sent his new breasts jiggling again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ugh this is, like, so weird!' The moments-ago-male thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know...\" Bill began as he moved closer to Tom's new body, \"But...\"</span></div></div>",

After Tom had gotten angry and made the wish to understand women, there had been a flash of light bright enough that it had momentarily blinded him! And when the light faded and his vision returned, his best friend was no longer standing next to him! Instead there was a tall, leggy and clearly several years older than him brunette in a yellow shirt and black skirt and a small black leather purse hanging from one shoulder, staring down at herself in shock. Bill watched as she stared into her huge rack and pushed a handful of luscious brown bangs out of her before stopping to stare at her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom? Holy shit, is that you? You look like a woman!\" Bill's voice was a hair's breadth away from a yell. This was too unreal! The strange gemstone he had just found on his porch had to be the cause of it, and clearly it granted wishes, there was no other explanation for why his best friend had been changed simply by wishing. The brunette, startled by Bill, looked up with wide brown eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bill! Bill what happened to me!? Oh god, I'm a chick!\" Tom said, his new airy voice wavering on the verge of panic. This was impossible, he was a...He had...Oh god, what was going on!? In just the span of a few moments the distressed teen's high school social life problems suddenly seemed so far away to the disgraced football star. Tom lifted a hand that clearly could no longer palm a football and squeezed one of his new, huge breasts and gasping as a shock of pleasure ran through his body. His free hand, the one holding the gemstone, found its way to his new posterior and began giving it a similar exploratory squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...Dude, it had to be what you said! That weird rock I found, it has to be the cause of this! You wished to understand women, so it turned you into one! What does it feel like!?\" Bill's concern began to mix with excitement at the prospect of having a wishing rock. He had to get it back from Tom and try to use it for himself. He could rid himself of the bullies forever! He could help Tom! He could make Gloria less of a bitch! The possibilities were utterly endless for the teenage geek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom continued to pat his new body down. \"It feels weird, that's what it feels like!\" He tried not to wail or draw more attention to the sight ofa grown woman feeling herself up in front of a teenager, \"I don't like this Bill!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if the gemstone did this, maybe all you have to do is make another wish?\" Bill said after a moment of through, \"Or give the thing back to me and I'll wish you back to norm\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom's panic visibly lessened as he realized the strange rock Bill had found had done this. He lifted his right hand off his gloriously perfect feeling ass and brought it up to his face, opening it to show the gemstone laying lifeless on his newly small hand. \"Holy crap, you really think so?\" Tom stared incredulously at Bill who nodded in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...don't know, Bill. I've got this feeling like it's not that simple\" Tom said as someting in his head buzzed as he contemplated making a wish to change back. \"Even if this thing is real, how does it work? Do I just wish for something and it happens?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you asking me? I literally just found the thing like five minutes ago!\" Bill fought the urge to just grab the gemstone. He could trust his friend to make the right decision after he changed back. Grabbing now could make things go really, really wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom went still and quiet for a moment, thinking about his options.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tom stared at the gemstone in his new, smaller hand, torn between thinking about it and all the strange new sensations that were running through his clearly adult body. The sensitivity of his new nipples, hidden somewhere beneath the yellow fabric that was now draped across his body, or the soft feeling of his new rear as it pressed against the confines of the skirt he now wore. The warming void between his legs and the soft, cool morning breeze as it curled around his bare legs and sent his newly expanded hair fluttering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This...Feels really good!' Tom said to himself. 'It almost feels normal?' The last thought should have sent a shiver of fear through his body, but there was very little reaction other than his new lips pursing together in thought. He should change back, he wasn't this chick, he was Tom Ackerton and the football star of the school! But at the same time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom, make the wish and change back! This is way too weird!\" Bill said, and Tom's train of thought derailed as he was jerked out of the comforting sensations of his new body and truly back to the matter at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Yeah I really should. Thanks, Bill\" Tom said, shaking off the strange thoughts in his mind as he curled the red-tipped, well manicured fingers around the green gemstone. The changed teenager clenched his eyes shut and squeezed the Stone as tight as he could, and with with every ounce of his being he willed the magic to work once more as he made the wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I was a guy again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Tom and Bill braced for the flash of light, but nothing happened. Tom opened his palm and the gemstone continued to lay there lifelessly, the only thing that made it stand out was the strange glittering from the golden core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom's mind went fuzzy again, and he released his grip on the magical rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Bill asked as his face filled with worry and confusion as Tom's (admittingly very pretty) face un-scrunched. \"Why aren't you changing back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's not going to work, Bill\" Tom said, his airy voice suddenly taking a harder edge. \"Maybe it only worked once. Maybe it requires something to work, or-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That might be it, you were really mad just a second ago! That must be how it works!\" Bill interrupted, much to Tom's annoyance as a frown creased his pretty face. Bill could be such a child! It was rude to interrupt! And Bill was always doing that! Not to mention doing fuck all to actually help him out with his problems at school! This could be his blessing in disguise! A way out of the endless nightmare that had been his life for the past two years! A painful spike ran through Tom's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy didn't Bill understand that!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tom's annoyance shifted over to anger far more quickly than either the boy or the new woman expected, the Stone flicked to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SEE!\" Bill shouted, and his friend's voice made Tom's bejeweled ears tremble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have to be so loud? God, you're so inconsiderate, Bill!\" Tom barked back, clenching his fist tight around the gemstone which had turned from cold to warm once more. Bill's eyes widened and he took a step back from the angry woman that had been his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If the Stone is really powered on anger, I really don't want to piss him off. He might use it on me!\" Bill's mind raced in alarm. His first instinct was to try to grab it from his friend before anything else could happen, but Tom was faster than Bill and always had been and Bill wasn't willing to put the hastily cobbled together theory that maybe Tom's new body wasn't to the test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! Woah, ok, my bad. Sorry\" Bill said apologetically, and Tom's stance relaxed somewhat, although the green-gold light still shone from the tiny fist clenched around the gemstone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apology accepted. Thank you\" Tom said with a feminine huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least we know how it works now, right\" Said Bill, hoping to continue talking his friend down from making the situation worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess. But frankly, I don't think it would have worked anyway, Bill\" Tom said as he opened his fist and stared at the gemstone, the light emanating from the artifact, shimmering like the glitterlamp that Gloria made Tom buy for her, rays of strange light shinging upward into the darkening morning sky over Shermer as the predicted rainstorm began moving in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ugh, fucking Gloria...' Tom thought darkly and the anger welled up again. But before his train of thought could go down the path of bitter rage and hurt, Bill stepped closer and pulled Tom's attention back to his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you say that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because of my wish. I wanted to understand women, right? Well then by that logic I have to truly understand what women want before I can change back! So I guess I need to go do...whatever it is women do before I can change back into Tom\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...You ARE Tom!\" Bill protested, to which Tom just gave a exhausted sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I really look like a Tom right now? I look more like a Tammy than anything else...\" Tom sighed. It was clear Bill wasn't getting it. Something in the back of Tom's mind, maybe the source of whatever was making his brain feel so...fuzzy, was telling him that this was correct. If he wanted to become Tom Ackerton again, he needed to embrace his femininity and experience life as a woman. It was clear the magic rock was still responding to his anger, so Tom could still use it to make other wishes. But changing himself back? Not until the terms of the previous wish had been fulfilled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious. Give me the rock then, I'll change you back! Let me help you, Tom!\" Bill urged. Every second the former football star seemed to stay in this body, the more he seemed to be...different. Even now Bill could see Tom's body taking on a more womanly posture. He had to get his friend out of there, but his offer to help only seemed to make Tom angry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so NOW you want to help!? What happened to having my back with Gloria and all the shit she's given me? Or the goddamn assholes that pick on everyone? You're selfish Bill, you don't want to help me! You just want this thing back!\" Tom closed his tiny fist and waved it it front of Bill's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom, I-\" bill started, but his sentence remained forever incomplete as Tom gritted his pearly white teeth together, reared backwards and held the magical gemstone high in the air and made a wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: \"I wish you'd go to school and let me do this!\" Tom yells, and Bill suddenly feels compelled to let Tom have his womanly journey, suddenly more concerned with getting to school than rescuing his friend. Before he leaves however, Bill asks for the Stone back as a stranger approaches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: \"You want to help me Bill? Okay! I wish you were trying to understand women as well!\" In a flash of light, Bill becomes an adult woman in a white short skirt and a red top, with dirty blonde hair and sandals.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You can't be serious. Give me the rock then, I'll change you back! Let me help you, Tom!\" Bill urged. Every second the former football star seemed to stay in this body, the more he seemed to be...different. Even now Bill could see Tom's body taking on a more womanly posture. He had to get his friend out of there, but his offer to help only seemed to make Tom angry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so NOW you want to help!? What happened to having my back with Gloria and all the shit she's given me? Or the goddamn assholes that pick on everyone? You're selfish Bill, you don't want to help me! You just want this thing back!\" Tom closed his tiny fist and waved it it front of Bill's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom, I-\" bill started, but his sentence remained forever incomplete as Tom gritted his pearly white teeth together, reared backwards and held the magical gemstone high in the air and made a wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I wish you'd go to school and let me do this!\" Tom yelled at the top of his new voice, drawing the attention of someone that was just down the street from the two. As the flash of light erupted from Tom's hand, the stranger turned and began swiftly walking towards Tom and Bill. And Bill suddenly felt the intense need to get to school take over his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit, I'm gonna be late!\" Bill said, not entirely of his own accord. He turned to look down the street in the direction of Shermer High, the previous destination for the two boys, before turning to look back at Tom who was standing in a very womanly pose, hip cocked to one side with a manicured hand upon it, staring at him in anger and the gemstone still glowing dangerously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you better get going, Bill.\" Tom growled, but whatever else the boy turned woman had planned to say was interrupted as a masculine finger tapped Tom on the shoulder, causing him to shriek in alarm as she spun on the newcomer, fist raised in defense. And Tom's first thought, as he took in the sight of the handsome, muscular man in front of him, was hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, miss. I heard you scream from down the street and I wanted to make sure everything was all right. Are you okay? Is this boy bothering you? Do I need to call the police?\" The stranger said as he pointed towards Bill, who had a very anxious look on his face as though he needed to pee extremely badly as he fought the mental urge to take off running in the direction of the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I can get to school later, I've got...I've gotta save Tom!\" Bill hissed inside his head, his eyes wide with worry at the stranger who was talking to Tom and distracting him. 'Maybe if I can grab it while Tom's not looking I can change him back! And then we can get to school!' Bill's mental logic train seemed to somewhat satisfy the compulsion to get to school and he visibly relaxed as his muscles un-tensed and he managed to stand still, no longer inching his way down the side walk. Bill watched in silence as Tom lowered his feminine fist as the stranger appeared to not be a threat and cast a sidelong look at Bill, annoyance on his pretty face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Oh, no I'm perfectly fine. I was just walking my...nephew here to school, but I think he can make it the rest of the way on his own. Right, Bill?\" Tom's voice was pleasant but there was a layer of ice beneath it as the Stone continued to glow in his hand. The stranger peered directly over Tom's shorter frame and gave Bill a disbelieving look, a thick brown eyebrow raised towards the harsh military-like buzzcut that topped his muscled physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah. Yeah I can make it. But before I go can I...Can I have my rock back? I promise I won't do anything with it\" Bill asked, silently hoping that he was putting on enough of an act to convince whoever was running the show in Tom's brunette topped head that he was no longer a threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom turned to stare directly at Bill, eyes narrowing before he said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: \"Sure Bill, but I wish you'd stop trying to help me!\" Tom says, the Stone flashing again and planting the command in Bill's mind to stop trying to help Tom change back. Tom then hands the Stone to Bill and wishes him a good day at school before turning back to talk with the athletic stranger some more as Bill walks away, defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: \"Bill, I wish you'd just get lost!\" Tom hisses in anger, and the Stone grants the wish in a flash of light. Bill disappears from sight, seemingly lost to the world. Satisfied, Tom turns back to the stranger and continues speaking with him, both oblivious to what just happened. Meanwhile, with Bill...</span></div></div>",

All thoughts of helping Tom, in any way, be it turning him back into a teenage boy, or otherwise, vanished from Bill\u2019s mind in an instant. The wish made him no linger care about helping Tom, so instead, thoughts of how to use the stone to his advantage filled his head.. As Tammy watched her wish take effect, she smiled and handed Bill the stone. \u201cHave a good day at school.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Tammy. Have a good...day?\" Bill muttered, then took off in the direction of his school as he simply became content to leave Tom...Tammy as she was. As he turned the corner and shot her one last look, Bill wondered if he'd ever see his best friend again. But then the feeling was gone and instead his mind was filled with endless possibilities to use the Stone for. Now that he knew how it worked...Well, anything could happen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy watched the teenager disappear around the corner and then turned back toward the stranger and smiled, her plump lips parting to show her perfect white teeth \u201cThank you for coming to my defense though. That was nice of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no problem. Just doing what any decent person would do.\u201d The stranger said. \u201cMy name\u2019s Todd.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy thought about how ironic it was that this man\u2019s name sounded similar to her previous male name. She held out a slender hand tipped with bright red fingernails that shined in the morning sunlight. \u201cTammy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a beautiful name.\u201d Todd said, flashing Tammy a smile that made her shiver with delight. And she shivered again when his much larger hand engulfed hers and gave it a gentle but firm squeeze as the two adults shook hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Todd asks Tammy out, continuing her earlier thoughts of how this man was hot, accepts, and she goes on her first date with a man, as a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: As Tammy continued her earlier thoughts about how this man was hot, new memories surfaced, revealing that she was now married...and had CHILDREN! So she politely turns him down and rushes to her new home to explore her new life.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You want to help me, Bill? OK! I wish that you were trying to understand women as well!\" declared the newly christened Tammy in a hysterical, some might even say bitchy tone of voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe emerald bauble that the former football star held at arm's length exploded dramatically into a fiery anomaly. To onlookers, it seemed as if the attractive brunette woman that Tom had become was holding a miniature green star in the palm of her hand. Or, if you were geekily inclined like Bill, kryptonite. Or even an Infinity Stone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, the stone Tom was holding was clearly unearthly in nature. The pulsing green light it was generating shot out in a wide beam, enrapturing Bill in its mystical glow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former Tom watched in sheer awe as his friend's body altered shape as he himself had been altered just a scant few moments ago. It seemed as if all of Bill's masculinity was being stripped away from him in a blaze of verdant flame. The boy's facial features became progressively more feminine as his skin softened, his nose became pert, his eyes became wider and more doe like, his lips became fuller, and his cheekbones became higher and more defined. In his face at least, Bill now appeared like a much younger version of his mother Martha, or an older version of his sister Kimmy. But things were just getting started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unwanted transformation then spread over Bill's body at large. Surprisingly, the tall teenager didn't lose any inches in height. However, what little masculine bulk he had was lost in the effort to design his new slender female form, either going straight to his chest or to the curvaceous new posterior he now owned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever body hair Bill had had evaporated into nothingness, and his skin became just as smooth and well maintained as his face. Tom noticed that he  was even slightly pale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill's waist and shoulders narrowed, and his hips grew outward into child bearing range. He hands slimmed down, becoming soft and delicate, his fingernails long and well maintained, coated with purple varnish. Internally, all of Bill's male sex organs morphed into their female equivalent. Needless to say, he would now need to sit down to pee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe short chestnut brown hair on top of Bill's head recolored itself into an alluring shade of dirty blonde. It grew out in long, curly waves, trailing far past his now dainty shoulders, eventually settling on Bill's now rather curvy waist. A set of bangs creeped over his forehead, and settled just beneath his bushier, blonder eyebrows. There was no mistaking Bill for a \"he\" anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it was time for Bill's clothing to change shape. His vintage Simpsons T-shirt shimmered like a mirage until it decided on becoming a featureless, long sleeved red women's top. Likewise, Bill's pair of black trousers also shimmered until it decided on becoming a knee length, white pleated skirt, his distinctive pair of red sneakers likewise transforming into a pair of designer Jimmy Choo heeled sandals. Lastly, the strap of a cute crossbody handbag found itself sitting atop the new woman's right shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ahn'Ger Stone's eerie chromatic light immediately faded away, its job finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo any pedestrians or commuters who passed through Robinson Avenue at that specific moment, they would notice two young women gawking at each other as if they had just seen a ghost. One was brunette and the other one blonde.  <br>\r\nNeither one was older than their mid twenties(Or at most, late twenties). The people who knew these two young women knew them as Tammy Ackerton and Willow Strasserman, the former Tom and Bill no longer existing in this reality. But neither former teenage boy knew that yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe newly female Bill squeaked out a complaint in her reedy new voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom, what the hell did you do to me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former Tom, as her increasingly fuzzy memory kept insisting that her real name was Tammy, stuttered out a profuse apology. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry! Bill, I don't know what came over me! You just made me so angry, always insisting that you're right and never listening to what <i>I</i> have to say! I'm freaking out here, OK? My mind is acting so weird right now. I'm having all of these flashbacks to things that never happened to me, and I...I just panicked! When you started mansplaining to me how this stupid magic rock works...I just couldn't. I couldn't let you get away with that. But I'm sorry I took your life away from you. I'm...I'm just so sorry! Please forgive me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom was on the verge of crying, which wasn't exactly...abnormal for the disgraced and ostracized sports star. He had a sensitive side to him that Gloria mocked him for constantly. Yet, the tears welling up in his wide blue eyes seemed different somehow. Somehow this all seemed familiar to Bill, as if \"Tammy\" was a naturally histrionic person, someone who often went to him for a shoulder to cry on whenever something in her life went wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't right. That was a false memory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shit! The magic is already affecting me too!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill needed to get that gemstone back. And fast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK, Tom. I forgive you. You're fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill sashayed over and gave his transformed friend a supportive hug. Just the very act of walking in heels felt off to the changed teenage boy, and the tactile experience of having breasts and long hair and a skirt even more so, but what did feel right was supporting his friend. What they were going through was completely bizarre, and they both needed their heads on straight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel better?\" asked Bill in his softer voice as he held onto his friend more tightly than he had ever done except once before, the night Gloria officially broke up with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much. Sorry for the chick flick moment\" answered Tom, wiping a stray tear away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Considering we're both chicks at the moment, it's kind of appropriate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey let go of one another after what felt like an excessively long time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I please have the stone back, now? Tom, my own memories are starting to muck up too! I'm beginning to forget my own name!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't be ridiculous! You're Willow Strasserman! Just say it. The magic can't be that strong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See! You're forgetting it yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I didn't! Your name is Will...iam Strasserman. No...I meant Will...iam Elias Strasserman. Damn, that's weird. It's like I'm being censored from saying your name. I got it! You're Willow Gwendolyn Strasserman! D'oh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill Strasserman sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I definitely don't want to be a Willow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom wrinkled his cute button nose at the gaffe he had just made, and reluctantly agreed with Bill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Willo...Bill. I still really believe that we need to see what it's like living as the fairer sex for a while. That's literally what I wished for. I'm pretty sure this is one of those *You need to learn an important lesson* type things. Like...like Dorothy having to accept that there's no place like home! Once we realize what women are all about, this curse will go away! We're not idiots! We're strong-willed! We won't forget who we are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill listened to Tom's melodious new voice expertly defend her...his position on things. He didn't exactly agree. Bill was sure that the stone was powered on anger and not on some weird kind of storytelling logic as Tom seemed to believe, but what choice did he have? Sure, he could argue with Tam...Tom until the sun came down, but that wouldn't go anywhere, they'd be stuck in an eternal stalemate. And he couldn't imagine a world in which he could physically confiscate the stone from Tom. Even as a woman, Bill felt somehow...not weaker exactly, but very unwilling to hurt her friend? He didn't know why, but he was starting to feel oddly protective of the former jock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" replied Bill flatly. \"One day as chicks. But if we haven't learned our lesson by sundown, I'm taking it from you and making my own wish. Deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former Tom smiled through pearly white teeth. She extended her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a deal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill shook it, enjoying the softness of Tam... Tom's handshake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Bill/Willow and Tom/Tammy spend a day as women in this strange new reality. They discover new identities, jobs, social circles, and struggle to maintain their original selves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: The teenage Rob Bolstrum is strolling down the street when he sees two hottie old chicks with an expensive looking gemstone. What's a bully to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Something else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two boys turned mature adult women stood on the sidewalk, inspecting their new forms and struggling with their new minds, both oblivious to the subtle changes that happened to the world around them. And both of them oblivious to the ogling, hidden eyes of Rob Bolstrum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the original reality, Rob was already long since in Bill Strasserman's basement, lurking in the darkness on orders from 'Big Jon' Ingerman and trying to hatch a plan of his own to turn the tables on the cruel rich kid that had taken what little Rob had had in that stupid fight. But now that Bill and Tom no longer existed, Rob was making his way towards Shermer High for another day where he was more or less king of the school. Or maybe more like a duke or baron, considering his arrangement with Jonathan Ingerman in this reality. Without Bill or Tom to play hero and weaken Rob's powerbase, Big Jon had simply proposed a mutually beneficial business arrangement, the rich kid playing it safe and not willing to take Rob on while he still had the full fear and respect of Shermer High's bullies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now Rob and 'Bolstrum's Bullies' simply acted as enforcers for Big Jon, forcing the stupid population of the high school (and some of the more spineless faculty and staff) into doing what Ingerman wanted. And that meant that Rob got to do whatever it was HE wanted, so long as he played it smart and didn't let things blow back onto Big Jon. Meanwhile Ingerman himself had joined Shermer High's football and basketball teams, quickly becoming a star and was currently nailing the queen of the school, Gloria Vanapolous. And in this reality, Gloria had lacked a Tom to bully emotionally in order to prop herself up and give her experience at manipulating men, now she was just another bitchy cheerleader who fawned over a hot guy that could fuck her brains out (and buy her anything she wanted in return).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the minor change of just two teenage boys transforming themselves into attractive older women had given Rob his best life. He was paid well by Ingerman, enough that he was finally out of Shermer's skid row, the Shermer Fields trailercourt and was living in his own apartment on the main street of Old Shermer! He had even scored a semi-decent truck to cruise around in for practically nothing, another 'gift' of Big Jon to his prized enforcer. After all, what good was having his own private army is said private army was stuck hoofing it everywhere? There was also the smartphone, but Rob had never been one for the Internet life, using it most for the GPS, weather, and occasionally watching Youtube. There were far more interesting things for the brute to focus on in his life, and the Internet was simply not one of them. Drinking as early (or as late) as he wanted though, that was certainly interesting and the world was already spinning slightly from the beers Rob had drank for breakfast a few minutes earlier before he'd piled into his truck and taken off for the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was from said truck, as he had cruised down the road on his way to the high school, that Rob had spied the two hot chicks doing...something on the sidewalk that seemed extremely hot. He'd zipped around the corner and had parked the truck somewhat haphazardly on the curb, leaping out to his current vantage point where he could observe the women that had once been his enemies from a distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck yeah blondie, pull that brown haired bitch in\" Rob whispered to himself as he felt his cock begin to stiffen in his underwear. To Rob, he had no idea who these women were, but they were hot. And in his mind, hot chicks were always A: Dumb as rocks and B: Secretly attracted to each other. Or C: Cunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd honestly, it wasn't as if girls had been lining up to date him, even in the small 'slut court' that hung around his gang. Even as 'baron of the bullies' Rob had found it difficult to land a girl for anything more than a cheap fuck or a blow job. The position he was in, the power, came with a 'fear' tax and outside of just momentary pleasure, girls were just too scared of him. Really the only girl that had ever given him more than the time of day had been his old trailer court neighbor Amber Reid, and she'd moved away the first chance she'd gotten and was clearly NOT looking back. So Rob simply had to take his thrills where he could get them. And besides, without a ball and chain he was open to play the field however he liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd right now, that meant scoping out the two hot chicks, even if they weren't going to simple start ripping each other's clothes off and fuck right there on the sidewalk like Rob's mind was picturing, even as the blonde and the brunette parted from their emotional hug and...shook hands?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh c'mon, kiss or somethin'!\" Rob groaned loudly at the strangely masculine gesture between the two chicks. Rob didn't expect the blonde, who he expected to be nothing more than a brain-dead bimbo, little more than just walking tits and ass, to suddenly make eye contact with him down the street. He could see her brown eyes open wide and those plump, dick sucking lips form a perfect 'O' before she whispered something to her brunette companion, who turned around, her big breasts jiggling within the yellow fabric of the blouse. Something flashed a bright green withing the brunette's fingers as her surprised face furrowed into a scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no sense hiding anymore\" Rob chuckled to himself as he straightened up out of the crouch he had been in and sauntered around the corner, making sure to put his full muscled might on display in the morning light. Had he not been been inebriated, both with beer and overconfidence, Rob may have realized that this was a bad idea, that he should get back in his truck and continue on his way. But instead he simply sauntered on, only stumbling once as he made his way down the sidewalk. He saw the blonde's eyes go even wider as she bit her lower lip, her eyes seemingly locked on Rob's pecs as they pressed against the fabric of his red shirt. Rob gave her what he felt was a winning smile despite his chipped and somewhat misaligned teeth (brought on by his own rough and tumble lifestyle and the many fights that it involved). Already his mind was ablaze with pick up lines and visions of himself and the two lovely ladies in front of him sprawled out in some bed naked as could be. Hell, just nailing one would make him even more of a legend within his gang, let alone the rest of the impressionable school populace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello ladies\" The redheaded giant said as charmingly as he could as he approached Bill and Tom, or rather, Willow and Tammy. He made no effort to hide his wandering eyes as he scanned their attractive bodies, \"Did I just get ina wreck? Cuz I'm seeing a couple of angels right now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fucking hell\" The blonde said, bringing up a tiny palm to cover her face, \"You have got to be kidding me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not kidding anyone, gorgeous. How 'bout I escort you and your friend here back to my truck?\" Rob pointed a slab-like finger up to the darkening sky as a early spring thunderstorm rolled in from the west, \"Hate for you ladies to get...heh, wet\" Rob said, giving Tom a lewd smile that sent a wave of disgust and anger rolling over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at the same time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy...TOM couldn't deny that a part of him was really interested in touching Rob's bulging muscles. The moment that Willo-Bill had pointed Rob out, his/her first instinct had been anger, but then watching how their former enemy carried himself, the swagger of confidence...Rob wasn't the cowed dog he'd been yesterday and a reality ago when he and Big Jon had waylaid Tom near McFly's. No, this was a Rob that was reminiscient of how the bully had been before Big Jon had arrived. And that, for some strange reason, was turning To-Tammy on. She felt something begin to get warm between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Tammy\" Willow hissed loudly, purposefully avoiding Rob as she turned to face down the street, \"Last thing we need is for the trailer trash idiot to get involved!\". But the moment that Bill had finished speaking, he realized the error in what he'd said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit!\" She whispered. She'd definitely not meant to just openly insult her former bully like that. It must have been the magic messing with her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob's confident grin faltered. \"Hey Barbie, y'don't know a goddamn thing about me!\" Rob reached out with a meaty hand and spun the blonde around, her eyes wide in surprise, \"Got a lot of fucking nerve calling me stupid you braindead bimbo! You don't get to fucking judge me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! ROB STOP!\" Willow cried out as the Bully squeezed her shoulder and pushed a large finger into her pretty face. He was close enough now that Willow could smell the smoke and booze on Rob's breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'LL STOP WHEN I FEEL LIKE IT! You think just b'cuz you've got money, just cause yer hot, you think you can give me orders!? I'm king around here! YOU serve ME!\" Rob tensed him muscles and pushed down on the blonde's shoulder, cause her shapely legs to buckle as he pushed her down to her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Right where you belong! Right where you both belong! BENEATH ME!\" Rob snorted as he reached out with a massive hand towards Tammy, alcohol, horniness and ego clouding out what good judgement the juggernaut possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, the whatever arousal that had been building within Tammy's nether regions vanished completely as she watched her best friend get assaulted by their former bully. Tammy gripped the magical gemstone that had gotten them into this mess tightly as it began to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy knew what she had to do as she darted backwards, expertly manuevering on her heels as she evaded Rob's grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: \"Fuck you Rob!

Tom was in a horrible place, cast out by his peers and driven into a deep depression. He understood Tom\u2019s anger and desperation, his need to be loved again. But another, more rational part of Bill knew that anything that made a gemstone glow brighter than the sun was bad news. As the light grew and grew until it blinded Bill, he knew that all he could do was let whatever happened happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light died, as though someone had flicked its off switch. Bill blinked a few times, the echo of the stone\u2019s power still in his eyes, and took in his surroundings. He was back on his porch, looking out at the rising sun and the neighborhood it shone on. Bill scrambled to look at his watch. It was 7:42, as it had been the last time he checked. Somehow, the stone had sent him and Tom back in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Bill could process this impossible development, he heard two voices cry out at the same time, \u201cHEY BILL!\u201d He whipped his head towards the sound, and saw Tom side by side with who he could only assume was Gloria Vanapolous. A wild branch blocked Bill\u2019s view of her gorgeous face. In the split second before she came into view, Bill had a terrible thought.

Could she be naturally deformed? A victim of a terrible accident? Maimed, brutalized, or abused? Any one of those could make even Gloria humble enough to care about Tom, but surely the Stone knew that wasn\u2019t what Tom meant? Unless it was actively malicious, in which case there were much bigger problems to address than Glora\u2019s physical appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill clenched his fist in an attempt to brace himself. He didn\u2019t want to shut his eyes, in fear of offending a possibly deformed Gloria. She pushed the branch away from her face, showing off a perfectly smooth, pale arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No deformities yet. Hopefully the Stone knew to keep it that way,</i> Bill thought. Though he hadn\u2019t been the one to make the wish, guilt wracked at him. It gnawed at him enough that he didn\u2019t notice Gloria\u2019s olive skin had become a milky white, the same color as Tom\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stepped into view, Bill couldn\u2019t contain his gasp. Not because Gloria\u2019s facial features were malformed, not because she was covered in scars, and not because she was bruised. The reality was far, far worse. Seeing her next to Tom, the two of them laughing, it was obvious Tom\u2019s wish had been granted. It was also obvious that Gloria had become his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gloria that Bill knew was an average 5\u20195, but that was the only average thing about her. She had perfectly styled black hair that reached her waist. Her face was angular, almost predatory, with brown eyes and a straight, wolfish nose accentuated by striking makeup. This Gloria was nearly a full foot shorter than the 6\u2019 Tom, and had taken most of his features. Messy blonde hair, a heart-shaped face, an upturned nose, and full, pink lips. Worst of all were her eyes, the same bright blue as Tom\u2019s. But unlike his, Gloria\u2019s were focused solely on Bill, with a sparkle and intensity that Bill only knew from romance movies he\u2019d seen his mom watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria Ackerton, Tom\u2019s goddamn sister, was in love with Bill. All he could do was gulp, step off his porch, and hope someone would make him angry enough to make a wish soon.</span></div></div>",

Lobbing insults the brute was a waste of time. As Mark Twain said \u201cNever argue with a fool, onlookers may not be able to tell the difference\u201d.  So he just stood there, momentarily forgetting about the fortuitous gemstone he had just found. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWELL COME ON!\u201d shouted Jon. \u201cGET UP OFF YOUR PORCH, STOOP KID! AFRAID OF LITTLE OLD ME?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill didn't want to admit that he was. Sometimes he wished that Jon knew what it was like to be scared of bullies. This was like a bad, school play version of Back To The Future, but Bill didn't have the effortless charm of Marty McFly, nor did he know how to skateboard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes went by with neither man moving, staring at each other like two outlaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamnit Tom, where are you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill figured that his buddy must have seen or heard Big Jon and ran in the other direction. Tom was athletic and the former star of Shermer High's football team before the recent falling out with his on and off again ex, Gloria, but he was still no match for the local Frankenstein's monster. Especially not with Big Jon's lackeys there. Tom was heroic but Bill knew that Tom would put his own self-preservation ahead of some heroic sacrifice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was 7:39 A.M now. If Bill didn't muster some courage real fast, he was going to be late for school and get a strike against him. His school had a policy of three strikes, and you get automatically suspended for a week, and he couldn't bear his parents berating him for that on top of all the other garbage he was facing.  Something inside Bill suddenly erupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWILL YOU FUCKING LEAVE ME ALONE ALREADY?!\u201d screamed Bill so loud that his parents and Kimberly could hear him from inside the house. Behind him he could hear the alarmed sounds of his parents calling out to him and the scraping of chairs against the kitchen floor followed by the thumping footfalls as the adult Strassermans hurried to see what was causing such an outburst from their son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Bill ignored them and dug deep into the well of hate and anger he had towards Big Jon as he roared out;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I WISH-\"</span></div></div>",

It wasn't a very well thought out wish, but it was the only thing that Bill's brain could construct in the heat of the moment as the front door of the Strasserman household opened behind Bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I WISH YOU WERE A NICE PERSON, JON! SOMEONE PEOPLE ACTUALLY CARED ABOUT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like the gem was suddenly colder, colder than it could possibly be. And then there was an eruption of verdant light that caused Bill to wince in pain before it faded away. And then Bill's jaw went limp as the world around him began to change. The assembled bullies vanished into thin air and the heavy hand of Bill's father vanishing from his shoulder. And then the largest change began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched transfixed, as Jon Ingerman's outline became vague. His proud Nordic ancestry, rippled and shifted. He had to blink his eyes clear, to be sure what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs in that instant Jon was replaced by Joanna Ingerman. The stunningly beautiful blonde, a Valkyrie from many a fantasy, busty and ... and standing near his home. He knew so many people would be jealous that she was here, that she was looking at him, talking to him. He took in her uniform, filling it in a way like no other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising an awkward fist he waved to her. Only unknuckling his fingers as he waved. Out from the unclenched hand a pale emerald stone dropped, it's flickering centre dying back to pale lifelessness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it landed, softly rolling, Bill's memory flooded back. He recalled Big Jon, ripping his eyes from the stone he looked back up. In his place was Joanna, waving back at him, with every sincerity. A coy smile on her face, a faint flush to her cheeks that wasn't due to the Sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarrowing his eyes, he couldn't deny that she was every bit as real, as Jon had felt. The chill tightness in his stomach too real to be forgotten, ignored or dismissed.</span></div></div>",

Bill wasn't completely sure it had. The Ahn'Ger stone had tampered with his memories a little bit. Deep down in his subconscious, he still remembered Big Jon and how that neanderthal had destroyed his car and had been trying to provoke him into a fight just a moment ago, but those memories gave way to a new reality. One where Big Jon had never existed, and Joanna Ingerman, the hottest girl in school...was his girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there handsome\u201d smiled Joanna as Bill approached her. Joanna was several inches taller than Bill and had to bend down to kiss him, though Bill didn't mind. She grabbed his hand and enveloped it into her own, warmly embracing her former enemy in another reality. Bill smiled back, and the two began their journey to school together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I actually kind of like walking to school instead of driving there\u201d said Joanna as she walked hand in hand with Bill. \u201cIt's such a gorgeous day out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt sure is\u201d said Bill, lost in a daydream that felt too good to be true. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill's new memories continued to inform him of the current reality. Somehow, by some complete stroke of blind luck, he and Joanna had hit it off back in the eighth grade and had been going steady ever since. He recalled double dates with himself, Joanna, Tom, and Gloria. He remembered the first time he had invited Joanna for dinner to his  parents house, with Joanna extending the invitation to dine with her own parents at her house. He remembered going to the prom with her last year, and how much his parents complained about the cost of his tuxedo. He remembered the first time they had sex with each other, though neither had told anyone yet. Bill recalled vivid memories of  himself inside her sex, and Joanna knowing how to pleasure Bill beyond his wildest imagination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis entire teenage life up until this juncture had been obsessed with finding a girlfriend. Bill was definitely not one of those red pill/incel idiots that you find on the internet. He didn't feel entitled towards having a girlfriend, and it didn't dominate his entire life, but he had been getting very lonely as of late, watching Tom and Gloria date, break up, get back together, and then break up again all in a circuitous loop all while Bill was forced to resign himself as Tom's wingman. But now he had one, and it was his former enemy, transformed into a gorgeous maiden! Somewhere deep down inside him, Bill simply couldn't believe this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two had reached school, both laughing over some silly story that Joanna was telling him that happened to her over cheerleading practice the other day. When they both reached their lockers to grab their books for the day, Bill was approached by another bully, Rob Bolstrum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the old reality, Rob had been one of Big Jon's minions. Rob was even dumber and more brutish than Jon had been, though since Big Jon was older and had a stronger physique, he had reluctantly acquiesced to Big Jon after the latter had beaten Rob to a pulp in a vicious schoolyard fight to prove his dominance. But that was then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob slammed Bill about against his locker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey pipsqueak. I've got bills to pay, so you're going to help me out. You're going to be giving me your lunch money every day from now on until...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob couldn't finish his threat, as he was suddenly thrown against the adjacent locker by none other than Joanna Ingerman herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you touch my man again, you'll have to face me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoanna, gorgeous as she was, looked every bit as intimidating as her formerly male self had. Her eyes carried a steely determination, and try as he might, Rob could not free himself from the tall girl's amazonian grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSwear an oath to me that you will leave Bill alone and never bother him again\u201d she demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-sure thing, honey\u201d he said. \u201cI swear. Bill's dead to me. I'll never look in his direction ever again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoanna wanted to grab his balls and squeeze them until they liquefied, but when she recognized the look of subjugation in Rob's eyes, she let him go. Rob, embarrassed, walked down the hallway and around the corner with his tail between his legs.  The entire student body started clapping and hollering their support for Joanna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish my girlfriend could do that for me\u201d said Tom Ackerman to another student within earshot of Gloria Vanapoulos, who fumed at being shown up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill grinned.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Weeks passed in this glorious new reality that Bill had found himself in. No more bully problems (one of said bullies now being his extremely attractive girlfriend), three days left until graduation and the freedoms of being out of high school...Even Tom's life was better due to Joanna using her own girl squad to counter Gloria's bullshit and eventually redeeming the teenager in the eyes of the entire school! Things had simply gone so right, so fast that the strange stone had simply slipped Bill's mind and laid dormant at the bottom of his backback, which was currently sitting precariously on a chair in the Strasserman living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, on a lazy, rainy, mid-May Sunday afternoon, Bill lay on his bed listening to the rain hit his bedroom window. Well, listening was the wrong term. Joanna was draped across him, her bare incredible breasts pressing up against him, a long, toned, mostly naked leg slowly stroking his own as a slender hand caressed his chest as soft lips repeatedly met his. Luckily his parents were out at a movie and while he did have to watch Kimberly, Bill had made the most of the free time. This woman, and Joanna certainly was a woman, truly completed him. She giggled as he teased at her panties, slowly stripping them down her legs as one of her powerful yet gentle hands slipped into his boxers and grasped the hard shaft that was waiting in the darkness. They had more than enough time, and Kimberly was more than taken care of at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Kimberly? While she was a bit of a brat and she and Bill often fought over...everything for little reason at all, they shared one thing in common: Video games. It was Kimberly's 'dark' secret that she liked something that was popular with 'stupid boys'. And she wasn't very good at them, but it seemed to be the one thing that brother and sister could do that didn't erupt into a sibling fight. They'd played various video games together in co-op, but with Joanna now in his life, Bill had been letting Kimberly play some of his more mature single player games. Much like she was this afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" Kimberly gasped as she wandered down the streets of Karnaca, city in the video game Dishonored 2. The pre-teen marveled at the colorful buildings and the fantastic art design the game had, her young mind immersed in a world that had been so meticulously crafted that it felt alive. \"This is so cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly had had her doubts with the opening level, the dull, colorless streets of Dunwall and the oppressive atmosphere of the polluted, troubled city. She'd blazed through the level, dying several times and killing most of the guards due to not fully grasping the concept of stealth or the binary nature of the game's morality system. But then the comic-like cutscene and the weird space level where the skinny guy had given her magic powers? That had kept her interested enough to make it to the next level where Karnaca's tropical beauty had simply pulled her in and never let go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love this place so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at the apex of her joy the skies above the Strasserman house simply to split apart as the flash of lightning filled the entire house, the breakers popping and the power going dead as the loudest thunder Kimberly had ever heard shook the house and everything in it. Kimberly screamed, but it was all gone in a second, the rolling thunder fading away to the sound of heavy rain once more. Shaking her head, Kimberly picked up the console controller and tried to power everything back up, eager to resume her adventure in that amazing world...But nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay Kim?\" Bill's shout came from upstairs. So long as she wasn't dead or something, Bill had more important things to worry about. The power would come back on in a few minutes anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but the power is out and the Xbox won't turn back on!\" Kimberly screamed back as she furiously pressed all the buttons on the controller and the console itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The power will come back on, just go color a picture or something!\" Bill yelled before turning back to Joanna, who had a very impatient look on her face. \"Sorry, brotherly duties\" He grinned sheepishly, and was rewarded with a eye roll and a deep kiss as Joanna slowly slid guided Bill's cock towards her slit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, downstairs Kimberly was mad. She paced the living room and said every bad word she knew while she waited for the power to come back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not freaking fair!\" She grumbled, \"I bet the characters in the game don't have to worry about this!\" She was so consumed with her childish, petty desire to continue playing the game that she hadn't noticed that Bill's backpack and been knocked off of it's precarious perch by the thunder, it's content spilling all over the carpeted floor of the living room. It had largely just been papers and stuff Bill had cleaned out of his locker, most just piling halfway out of the backpack as it lay in a pile on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut one item of note had managed to fully escape from the pack: A deep green stone. It, despite it's shape and the carpet, had somehow managed to shoot halfway across the room, right in Kimberly's path. It caught the faint light just right, shining weakly and drawing the girl's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" Kimberly asked no one as she reached down and picked up the pretty gemstone. She marveled at it's design and how the light seemed to curve around the gold teardrop in the center. \"Where did this come from?\" She wondered before her mind instantly starting making connections back to the game that she had been denied. The pre-teen clenched her hand shut, grasping the gemstone tight as she went back to her private tantrum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why isn't the power on!? I want to play my game!\" She whined somewhat loudly, hoping Bill would hear her, but she had no idea that Bill wasn't hearing much of anything outside of the heavy breathing that was currently filling his room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This sucks so much! I bet in the game they didn't have to deal with this! That place looked perfect and so pretty! Not like this stupid place with it's stupid weather!\" Kimberly continued to rant on, unaware of the green-gold glow escaping from the cracks between her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet if I lived there I'd be a princess and I could just make them fix the power right now! I wish that...\"</span></div></div>",

All of Bill's problems, at least those that were actually problems, seemed dealt with in the best way possible and the stresses the teen had felt melted away as the stupid grin on his face grew wider. And Joanna had no recollection of who she used to be, only that she was beautiful and strong, smart, rich, popular and wonderfully in love with Bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a happy ending, or so it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the Ahn'Ger Stone, or perhaps whatever power that had guided it into the Human reality, was not content with happiness. As it could only be activated with anger, with hate, it needed those emotions, perhaps to survive, perhaps simply out of 'hunger' or a need to sow chaos and now the weave of reality was being manipulated by it, ever so slightly, in order to find or cause a reason for the Stone to be used once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill's backpack jostled as he spent his day at school, going to classes, walking down the hall, making out with Joanna, all these motions causing the Stone to shake loose from it's spot in the backpack and slide towards a worn out corner that BIll had never noticed was forming in the wall worn fibers. A nudge here, a rub there, the Stone's edges slowly, and passively tore a hole through the backpack's surface and without a sound, slipped out onto the cold tile of Shermer High as Bill and his new love continued on their way, drunk in love and utterly oblivious to what had just occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there the Stone laid unnoticed until a chance beam of light made the gemstone shine brightly, drawing the attention of it's new owner, who had just had a very bad day.</span></div></div>",

He stroked back his mop of curly brown hair with his hands and rested them on top of his forehead, the constant background anxiety in his mind coming to the fore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat there, staring at the stoic but empatheic face of Dr. Gold, ashamed that at sixteen years old, he already needed to see a shrink to help cope with his problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same song, different tune, doc. I get ignored by the people I want to be around, and because life is so wonderful, I receive plenty of attention from the people I DON'T want paying attention to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're still having problems with making friends at school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" sighed Matt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to talk about that?\" asked Dr. Gold, no hint of emotion in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sure. I think I'm doing a little better than last week. There's one girl I've been starting to open up to. Her name is Paige. She's a year up from me, but I take some of the same AP classes as her, so it's not weird. We have a lot of the same interests, and I like her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good\" nodded the therapist, writing something down Matt couldn't see. \"What kind of interests?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know, geek stuff. Dumb jokes and shitposts we've seen on Reddit. The latest Adventure Zone podcast. Sometimes we even get around to discussing our schoolwork! Nothing earth shattering, honestly, but I didn't have anyone else to talk about that stuff, in real life anyway, and neither did she, so it was a mutually beneficial kind of thing. She's sweet. I wouldn't say that anything romantic is going to come out of it. I'm not attracted to her, and I don't think she's into me that way either, but I'm glad that I don't have to hide who I am anymore. I can let my freak flag fly, so to speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any romantic interests?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to talk about it\" Matt replied curtly. Vanessa Chandler laughing at him after he asked her out was too painful to discuss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Gold nodded, understanding Matt's pain. In the six months Matt has been a patient, his frustrations with his inability to attract women was a frequent topic of conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is your bullying problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, the six hundred pound elephant in the room\" joked the teenager. He sat up straight, revealing his black eye.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"This\" pointed Matt, \"was just the latest thing that's happened to me. On Monday, one of the players on the basketball team gave me a swirlie in the boy's bathroom after I mouthed off to him. I still got the faint taste of Lysol in my mouth. On Tuesday, one of the punks somehow put a smelly fish in my locker the day after I tried to talk to him in chemistry class. On Wednesday, one of the cheerleaders started shit talking about me after school ended and tried to get her gang to go after me. That girl is a known bitch though, so I didn't take it that seriously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why would this girl have her gang go after you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I had the audacity to talk to her ex-boyfriend in front of her, who she is mad at for dubious reasons and wants to ostracize from everyone. What I did was like the equivalent of me walking into North Korea or some country American's aren't supposed to be in and opening a pizza shop. It just looks bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\" answered the forty year old professional, somewhat shocked by the social realities of Shermer High. He wrote down something else onto his notepad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her boyfriend is a nice guy though. I'm a little surprised since he's a football player and all the other football players at school treat me like shit, but he's not bad at all.  I could see the isolation was really upsetting him, so I thought he deserved to be treated like a human being. That's why I'm not upset about what I did\" continued Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who assaulted you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bully named Rob Bolstrum. Big kid. Bad seed. Head full of rocks. Trailer trash. His family is probably inbred for six or seven generations. He's so big that I wouldn't be shocked if he was actually 35 and he's been held back for twenty years in a row.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt laughed bitterly through his pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Gold asked what happened to provoke such an assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story\" replied Matt. \"It all started at school today. I wasn't there to see it, but apparently before first bell Rob tried to shake down this Senior kid named Bill Strasserman, but Bill's girlfriend Joanna kicked his ass in front like thirty people and got Rob completely humiliated. At least that's what I heard happened. My theory is that instead of licking his wounds, Rob went down his list of victims to the next easiest target and picked me to take his frustrations out on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt recalled the verbal abuse from Rob this morning with goosebumps immediately rippling on his skin. Rob's nasty, meanspirited voice alone was enough to trigger traumatic flashbacks. Snapshots appeared in his memory bank of how the sadistic bully manhandled the skinny, gawky Sophomore, shoving him roughly against the locker just before his 11:00 A.M class, and how the bully roughly confiscated Matt's weekly allowance from his pocket. Matt remembered the fear he felt this morning, the utter powerlessness of his situation. He recalled the rage. The anger. He felt pure hate he had against Rob, hatred so intense it made him take a swing at the Cro-Magnon looking thug, the end result just pissing Rob off and ending with Matt's ugly black shiner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" Matt continued, \"Bullying I'm used to. This isn't the first black eye I've ever had. Just ask my father when he did the same thing to me two years ago. What's really, truly disturbing me this week, doc, is Bill Strasserman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who is he to you?\" asked Dr. Gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the thing, I DON'T know him. He's a Senior, a couple of years ahead of me. He's a geek like me, but we've never talked or had any personal interactions with one another. Yet, I feel like we <i>should</i> know each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't explain it, but something about this life of mine has always felt just a little bit off. For as long as I can remember, this deep seated feeling in my gut that this life here in Shermer wasn't...there's a dark underbelly to it. And then I worried that I shouldn't have known about this. That there was a glitch in the matrix. A mistake. Something I was never meant to discover but somehow did. I know that this reality we're living in isn't the <i>real</i> reality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you must be thinking, that I've seen too many Keanu Reeves movies. Believe me, I tried to convince myself that the paranoia was just my overactive imagination, but I can feel it every day. I feel it when I wake up in the morning, and I can feel it when I go to bed at night. When I watch TV. When I do  my homework. It's like...this has all happened before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like deja vu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. But weirder. I feel like I don't belong here. Like this isn't MY story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Many thoughtful individuals such as yourself often undergo existential crises. It's normal to feel out of place, especially in a small town like Shermer\" replied Dr. Gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but it's more than that. It's something bigger. Stranger. Something cosmic, something supernatural. I know that I've lived similar lives like this one before, that I've had <i>many</i> past lives, and they are all tied together by a common thread.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you believe in reincarnation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. For years, I've always had these weird dreams. These dreams always had two common elements. The first one was a magic green gemstone that grants wishes. The catch, because there's always a catch, is that the stone can only grant wishes when you're angry. It just appeared one day out of the blue. Like it came from nowhere. All this crazy stuff happened in the dreams. I made wishes I didn't mean to because I was angry. I either wasn't thinking straight, or someone else wasn't. In my dreams, I got transformed into all matters of different things. Women. Dogs. Inanimate objects. The world got taken over by aliens. I ended up as a cartoon character. I woke up on this big spaceship far in the future living with my future wife. There was a weird chicken lady. Just bizarre stuff. And always, ALWAYS, Bill Strasserman was involved in these dreams. Always.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Gold briefly wondered to himself where his patient was going with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then today, eureka! I figured it out. By complete, doodah coincidence, I stumbled upon it, just laying there innocently in the hallway at school. The answer to all of my questions. I always wondered how someone like Bill, a pasty faced geek if there ever was one, landed a girlfriend like Joanna Ingerman. The gemstone! The green gemstone from my dreams. It had to have been that. Bill had to have rediscovered the gemstone and wished this reality into existence. One where he's popular and respected and loved. Otherwise, I figure, a hottie like Joanna would never give him the time of day, let alone be as head over heels in love with him the way she is. Which means that my dreams must have been real. Maybe sometime way back when, Bill and I really were friends. We were always best friends in my dreams.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So\" asked Dr. Gold cautiously, worried about Matt going off the reservation. He didn't want to confront Matt directly about his delusions, but he had to get the teenager back on track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt...how did you realize the dream were real?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because of this\" answered Matt proudly as he pulled out the Ahn'Ger stone from underneath the sleeve of his blue hoodie. A sly grin spread across his teenage face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Gold examined the stone. It was emerald green. Teardrop shaped. Almost completely opaque except for a smaller gold gem that could be seen in the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you want to know the great thing about this, doc? I know how to operate it without screwing up what I want. I'm <i>always</i> angry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It is colloquially known as Shermer High, and there are many ones just like it dotting our landscape. The prison is occupied between the hours of 8:00 A.M and 5:00 P.M by its population of Shermer's progeny and their wardens known as teachers, but currently, just as those very prisoners and their wardens go home to lick their wounds from a day filled with heartbreak and woe, the prison is being haunted by a single, lonely resident, a sad disheveled little creature known as Eugene Kazinski, finishing the rounds of his toil. Eugene is a desperate man, a profoundly unhappy man, one who's soul has been burdened for too long by the unfortunate hand of poor choices and bad luck.

The background noise of other people's hectic lives. A...what was that term he had heard on the news lately? A Non-Playable Character? Yeah. An NPC. He was an NPC. Someone with no life of their own. Someone whose entire purpose of existence was in the service of some greater hero. Someone who nobody thought much about as they went home to their cheating wives and bratty siblings. \"Unimportant side character\" was the leitmotif of Eugene Kazinski's entire life. When he was lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he wasn't so fortunate to be wallpaper, Eugene was known better around Shermer High by his nickname, Gene The Creeper.

Horrible, disgusting rumors, courtesy of one Gloria Vanapoulous that Eugene was a pedophile who spent his spare time leering at other people's children on the playground and had once tried to abduct Kimmy Strasserman on the way home from Horace Mann Middle School. These rumors had gained traction, as all of Gloria's sycophantic girlfriends on the cheerleading team couldn't take one look at the middle-aged janitor's sunken in,  blue grey eyes or his stubbly salt and pepper beard without gagging on their fat free yogurt. Thus, a legendary creature was born. One that was black of heart and cruel of temperament. A boogeyman. The incestuous nature of small town gossip had not helped these accusations, and now even grown adults had begun suspecting poor Eugene of the most terrible things. According to these rumors, Eugene Kazinski, who went out of his way to avoid stepping on ants, gave a friendly hello to everyone who crossed his path, and still sent his elderly mother nearly half his paycheck every week, was secretly a cunning predator waiting to lure children to their own defilement. Residents of Shermer began avoiding the glorified transient. They gave him the cold shoulder when he politely tried to make conversation on the bus ride to work. They gave him dirty looks, and if he didn't take the hint, they would dismiss him with a tone of voice that would chill the most oblivious narcissist to their bones. Parents of Shermer High told their children to never be alone around the mean old janitor, who probably kept photos of them with the eyes cut out in his creepy sex dungeon/utility closet. The only reason the high school didn't outright fire Eugene Kazinski is because, of course, there was not a single shred of evidence that any of these claims were actually true. Gossip alone could not hang a man, and the victim, used to a lifetime of \"Dumb Pollack\" jokes, just let the accusations slide off his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least he tried to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he actually wanted to do was cry his eyes out and find someone understanding to hug tightly, but he found those comforts lacking. He had no one close to him in this nightmare of a life to confide who he could feel safe around, and he couldn't cry, because a lifetime of verbal abuse had already calloused his mind against the cruelty of others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking inside his dank, dark utility closet, Eugene switched the light to his personal bathroom on. The gemstone glowed green like kryptonite, except in the center where it glowed gold. He stared at himself in the mirror as he held it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time in his tenure at Shermer High, he was finally beginning to feel angry at his plight. Today, he had finally had enough. Tomorrow there would be hell to pay. He would no longer be anyone's punching bag. Not after today's humiliation from that punk Rob Bolstrum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier last month, Eugene had begun receiving text messages out of the blue from the Spanish teacher, Gabriella Vasquez. Gabriella was at least thirty years younger than Eugene, and indescribably gorgeous, but like Eugene she claimed she was being eaten away by loneliness as she too found herself a pariah in Shermer. Racism and simple culture clash was preventing her from getting a foothold in the American dream. She described, in heartfelt(And heartbreaking) eloquence, how she understood what Eugene was going through, how searingly painful it was, and that if he ever wanted to go out for coffee, Gabriella would gladly treat him to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis initial text had set Eugene's heart ablaze. He must have re-read it a hundred and fifty times throughout the next day, as even when he was growing up, he never had any friends, let alone someone who understood his inner turmoil, the stormy disquiet perpetual throughout his life. Eugene had been thrown out of the house by his verbally abusive drunken father in Chicago the moment he turned eighteen years old, and since the old bastard had worn down his self esteem, Eugene had never truly believed that he COULD find someone who understood his doubts, his fears, his ambitions, and the simple joys he took in life. The simple things nobody else thought of like a smile of a strangers face as they passed him by. So he shuffled from one menial job to the next, aimless in his quest to avoid being hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Eugene hated the taste of coffee, he suggested something else. Something more intimate. Instead of coffee, Gabriella and he began a correspondence, texting penpals. Within a week, both of them became fast, close friends. Eugene never pushed anything into romantic territory, although he was desperately tempered to, for fear that Gabriella would become creeped out by him, just as everyone else had. But he enjoyed the talks, the ability to get things off of his chest, and the opportunity to laugh. He had the most charming laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabriella had requested to keep this friendship a secret. She him to not acknowledge one other in public. Keep it between themselves. Eugene agreed. He didn't look in her direction or even smirk during school days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYesterday, to Eugene's delight, Gabriella had finally popped the question herself! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eugene, let's go out on a date tonight. Wait by my class at Noon to discuss plans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Eugene discovered in Room 219B was not Ms. Vasquez. It was that troublemaker with rocks for brains Rob Bolstrum, and the no good punks who followed him around. Rob held up a cell phone, with Gabriella's text superimposed on the screen, a cruel smirk plain on his face. The gang of bullies began laughing at the older man as they saw his hopes, feeble as they were, crushed into the dirt like so much rubble. They mocked him for his insecurities, and called him a pedophile. He ran away like so many bullied children, past football star Tom Ackerton, wondering with grim pessimism what those assholes were laughing about now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob had been angry today that he no longer had Bill Strasserman to pick on because the geek's cunt of a girlfriend Joanna Ingerman ball busted him, so the red haired thug decided today was the day to reap the rewards of his little catfishing enterprise. It couldn't have gone better. The look on the old guy's face was priceless!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, as the building was totally empty, the 55 year old Eugine Kazinski, glowered in the mirror of the tiny utility bathroom. He didn't know why, but this stone felt powerful to him. When he had seen it laying there on the ground, it had almost spoken to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pick me up\" he heard in a low whisper, and so he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had no idea whose gemstone it was, and he certainly didn't know that it had transformed Jonathan Ingerman into a beautiful cheerleader who worshipped at the alter of Bill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll he knew was that it was special. It might even be magical. Eugene didn't believe in magic, but it was all he had left at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish my life had turned out better!!!\" he screamed out loud in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his complete shock, the stones glow exploded the dark room into a blinding aurora of green-gold light, and his hand turned bitterly cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the last anyone had heard of Eugene Kazinski.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Compared to humanity, the Ahn'Ger Stone was patient. It could wait for decades, even centuries between owners, but today, after Bill Strasserman inadvertently found a way around the gemstone's ulterior motives to spread chaos, to actually <i>improve</i> upon his lot in life instead of destroying it, the intelligence within the stone had to change plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once, it had to actively recruit fresh blood to stumble upon it, for it realized that young master Strasserman eventually would have noticed the hole in the bottom of his backpack, would have rediscovered the Stone laying in the hallway, and would have placed it inside a lockbox for safekeeping, never to be used again. This future could not be, hence its reaching out to Eugene Kazinski.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene stared at his reflection in the mirror, aghast at what the wishing stone had done to him. He was no longer himself. Hell, he was no longer even at Shermer High. This bathroom was far too clean to be his utility closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blasphemy was cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve, get your butt out here!\" exclaimed a teenage girl as she forced herself inside the Ladies restroom of McFly's, and dragged Eugene out with her. Still in shock, Eugene followed the girl dragging him by the hand to a small table that nonetheless had six chairs and four other teenagers sitting there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Eve\" apologized the girl, letting go of Eugene's now soft, tiny, feminine hand, which he felt immediately embarrassed by. \"I just wanted to let you know our food was here. We've only got a few minutes before we've got to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go?\" asked Eugene in sheer confusion, as he brushed a lock of shiny red hair out of his face. In front of him was a large cheeseburger, which he took a cautious bite out of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To play practice! Come on, Eve, don't tell me you've memorized all of your lines already?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Eve. Not everyone's naturally great at everything like you are\" snarked another girl, this one tall and blonde, and sitting next to a good looking, if rather nerdy boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" yelled Eugene louder than he had meant to, in a voice that was unmistakeably not his own, in a body <i>definitely</i> not his own. Everyone at the table looked concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene had never asked to be turned into a pretty teenage girl! To be fair, he had grown up into a fairly superstitious man who believed in all sorts of weird things, but this was beyond the pale. He made a wish with that stone out of sheer frustration with his life. It had been a child's prayer. A fool's errand. A one in a trillion, wishing upon a star type deals. He didn't actually expect his angry wish to do anything, even with that light show the stone gave off. Where was he? <i>Who</i> was he? Who were all of these kids acting so friendly towards him? He recognized their faces around the school, but didn't know any of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no! He did recognize one of them! The dark haired girl! The one who started all of those rumors about him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your problem, little miss perfect?\" asked a sulky Gloria Vanapoulous. \"Is the robot short circuiting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gloria, knock it off. I think I know what's going on\" answered the nerdy looking boy. \"Eve is just really stressed out. I mean, look, she's got a lot on her plate. She's cheerleading captain, she's the valedictorian, she does all that charity work, she's probably going to be prom queen, and she's going to be moving soon to go to Stanford. All that, AND she has to deal with you? It'd make anyone jumpy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene took all of this information in, but it was so much to handle at once that she didn't know how to react. He took another bite of this girl's bacon cheeseburger. A drop of ketchup fell onto the yellow top she was wearing, which Eugene discreetly licked with this girl's fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, so he clearly needed some time alone to figure out what the hell was going on. He didn't recognize the name \"Eve\" matched any of the students who attended Shermer High, and he sure as heck didn't recognize the redheaded vixen staring him in the bathroom. Yet, he couldn't believe that this \"Eve\" and he were the same person. He couldn't believe that reality has been altered. That stuff only happened in comic books! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother boy, this one also fairly good looking with dark skin and dark hair who up until now had been casually munching on some curly fries, finally spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Gloria should play Patty Simcox. That way, Emily can pick on her the entire show and get away with it since, hey, it's in the script.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl to Eugene's right giggled a little bit. Gloria huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So anyway\", said the girl, apparently Emily, \"I guess we'll be going now. Thanks for the burgers, Joanna. By the way, so cool what you did earlier, standing up to Rob Bolstrum like that, in front of God, and everybody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it\" smirked the blonde Joanna, who this entire time had her right hand massaging Bill's junk. \"Anything for my Bill!\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily grabbed left Eugene's hand(Eugene meanwhile holding desperately into the Ahn'Ger Stone with his right), and both girls gently glided out of McFly's with the boy, who Eugene learned was named Rod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene couldn't have been more conflicted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, I hate her\" muttered Gloria the moment the three teens had exited the long running Shermer diner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't have made that anymore obvious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck off, Bill. I've got a reason to be upset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody likes being second best, I understand your concerns completely\" replied Bill, a smug grin on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am <i>not</i> second best to that little whore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gloria, the only thing you're better than Eve Kazinski at is breaking up with people and mommy issues.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria looked furious at that comment, with reminded Bill of something. He subtly nudged Joanna to let go of his junk for a minute. He grabbed his bookbag from underneath the table, and dug around through his belongings for the Ahn'Ger Stone, his gateway to the good life he was now living in. He didn't want to use it right now, he just wanted to be sure it was still in his possession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't. Upon further inspection, he found the hole in the bottom of the bag, a hole large enough for the stone to slip through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderneath the table, the teenage boy's eyes bulged out in anger and fear. Who had it?! He nearly banged his head on the bottom of the table, distracted by this new concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he got out from underneath the table, Gloria slapped him in the face mildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You pig. Never talk to me like that again. I don't care <i>who</i> your girlfriend is. Nobody insults me without leaving on a stretcher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill briefly touched the stinging red hand-shaped mark on his skin before changing the subject to more important matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did...did either of you see a green gemstone laying around here?\" he asked with genuine nervousness in his voice for the first time since this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, like the one Eve was holding?\" asked Joanna innocently. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...it's important. It's a family heirloom, and I have to go get it back\" stuttered Bill, lying, now single minded on getting it back into his hands. He knew that Eve, Emily, and Rod were back at school by now. He had to get there, fast! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving Joanna a quick peck on the cheek, he said \"I have to go to school and get it back. See you two later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he ran out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was out of the sight, the two girls turned to one another out of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he's cheating on you\" replied Gloria obliviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bill ran the the mile and a half back in the direction of Shermer High as fast as his legs could carry him, the trio of Eugene, Emily, and Rod were currently practicing for the school play, which this year was going to be Grease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was playing Betty Rizzo, Rod was Danny Zuko, and to Eugene's horror...he was supposed to be playing Sandy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was finished getting dressed in the changing area, humiliated at wearing a very girlish looking 1950s blouse and skirt set, Eugene looked at the stone in his hand that did all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I were a man again!\" he whispered quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing. Not even a flicker of light passed by the gemstone's reflective surface area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish...\" he whispered again, but was cut off by Emily once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve, relax. You're going to do great! You have a great singing voice, and you and Rod have awesome romantic chemistry together. Here, I'll just put this rock right here in this drawer. It's pretty, where'd you get it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\" stuttered Eugene. \"I found it laying around on the floor at school..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ACTORS ON STAGE! ONE MINUTE WARNING!\" announced the drama director Ms. Barry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me later! Here, put on your wig\" muttered Emily quickly, grabbing a blonde woman's hairpiece and shoving it on Eugene's head. \"PERFECT! Now you're Sandy. C'mon, let's go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Bill finally makes it back to school, and tries to sneak backstage to somehow find the Ahn'Ger Stone without drawing attention to himself. Meanwhile, Eugene is forced to behave as Eve Kazinski for a few hours while performing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: During a short break during play practice, Eugene manages to reacquire the Ahn'Ger Stone and make a frustrated, panicked wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Meanwhile, back with Gloria and Joanna...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Okay everyone, just...just take a few minutes and then we'll take it from the top, all right?\" The drama teacher and director of the play, Ms. Jeanette Barry sighed as she waved the collected cast of students away, trying not to glare at Eve Kazinski's back as she quickly darted backstage faster than anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What has gotten into that girl?\" Jeanette muttered to herself as she massaged her forehead in a vain attempt to get the stress headache to go away. For the past hour the drama teacher had been dealing with watching as her star pupil, someone who had memorized all the lines, had every last bit of the stage choreography memorized, and had been giving the original Sandy a run for her money suddenly turn into a talentless, graceless klutz who knew none of her routine and was suddenly putting the entire production (and possibly Jeanette's job) at risk. The teacher turned director considered slipping out for a rare smoke when she her Eve's telltale voice begin screaming from backstage, followed by a crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what I need...I better go have a talk with her...\" Jeanette said as she summoned what remained of her patience and marched backstage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Eugene was trying his best not to have a panic attack as he bee-lined for the box at his makeup station. He was a girl! He was a popular girl! And the star of the play! And it was bad enough that his new body felt entirely alien to him, despite it being nice to not be constantly be wracked by aches and pains and instead feel so full of energy. But it wasn't his body! Everything was so large now that he was smaller, his balance was off from the set of not insignificant pendulums that now hung off his chest, his cushioned bottom, or, as he pulled off the scratchy blonde wig, all the HAIR. Eugene tossed the wig to the floor and pawed as the cascade of fiery red curls as they fell over his his cute face, and blinked away tears from his big green eyes as he struggled to keep his composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe the rock did this!\" He muttered to himself, not believing how soft his voice was, even with all the painful off-key singing he had been doing for the past hour. Eugene rubbed his adam's appleless throat with a slender hand and for a moment was just entranced by his own reflection. He WAS pretty, though he leaned more towards the 'incredibly cute' side of the spectrum rather than the 'drop dead gorgeous' that the blonde girl, Joanna, was. But now wasn't the time to get distracted, there was no telling how long Ms. Barry would allow the students to rest before starting the torture all over again and as a main character, Eugene would be stuck embarassing himself for who knew how much longer. The former janitor shook his head, sending his curls swinging side to side, and looked down at the makeup station and it's large central drawer, pulling it open and scanning the very disorganized pile of used makeup for the strange emerald that had transformed him from Eugene into Eve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!\" Eugene said a little too loudly as he spotted the gemstone, and snatched it up with one swoop of a small hand. Eugene spun around, a smile on his face that, had it been directed at a boy (or a girl), it would have melted their heart. \"Okay, gemstone, I don't know how or why you did this, but I think I'd like to go back to being me now...\" He said, and he did mean it. This had been a scary, exciting, very strange adventure, but he just wasn't a teenage girl, he was an old man and before he did anything else with the gemstone, he needed to fix that problem first. And despite having already tried once without success at McFly's during his fumbling performance on stage Eugene had come to the conclusion that perhaps the gemstone worked like a battery and that it had to recharge after each wish, though for how long was something the teenage elder didn't know. He just hoped that an hour had been long enough.. Eugene held the Ahn'Ger Stone in both hands and pressed it together against his squishy chest and closed his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I was myself again!\" He whispered, and braced himself for the change...That never came. After a few moments Eugene opened one eye and looked down, expecting to see his old body, only to be met with his twin peaks of femininity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH COME ON!\" Eugene yelled at the top of his girly voice, and he felt the need to throw the gemstone at the nearest wall as he clenched his much smaller fist tight, so tight that he failed to see the golden glimmer that pulsed from the artifact's interior. His little outburst had drawn attention however, and as he flopped down on the small stool that was in front of the makeup station, Eugene saw his apparent 'best friend' Emily creeping over with a concerned look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve? Hey, what's wrong with you today?\" Emily asked as she approached the frustrated looking Eve. Emily was indeed concenred, since this was so out of character for her best friend, the girl that she practically considered her sister after growing up as next door neighbors and being involved in, well, pretty much everything together. The brunette placed a concerned hand on Eve's shoulder and the redhead shrugged it off rudely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if I told you, I bet you wouldn't believe me\" Eugene said bitterly, looking away as hot, angry tears welled up from somewhere inside. This wasn't fair! Sure life was rough as an old man, but it had been HIS life! Now he was apparently trapped in the body of 'Little Miss Perfect', as the Vanapolous girl had called him, stuck in a life full of things that he was completely clueless about, surrounded by kids he only knew in passing and most of which had, at one point or another, made his old life hell. And what about his living situation? His mother and father had passed early in his old life, were they somehow alive again? Or was he with complete strangers!? The lack of control or knowledge about who he was now, and the stupid magic stone's inability to correct it's mistake continued to sour his mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, okay?\" Emily said, grabbing the stool from the vacant makeup station next to Eve's and sliding it close. \"I know you're nervous but you got this! Now just chill out and when Ms. Barry calls us back you can get out there and break a leg just like you always...Oh gosh!\" Emily said as she leaned around Eve's luxurious curly mane and saw the tears pushing through her best friend's makeup. \"Oh, come here!\" Emily wasted no time in grabbing a handful of tissues from the makeup station and spun Eve around, much to the crying girl's surprise, and began dabbing at the salty face water and the mess it was leaving behind. \"Oh girlfriend, you're ruining your makeup...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DON'T WANT TO WEAR MAKEUP! I DON'T WANT ANY OF THIS!\" Eugene roared as loud as he could in his unwanted new voice and batted Emily's hand away harder than he meant, sending the girl toppling to the floor with a loud thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, what is wrong with you Eve!?\" Emily spat back, \"That fucking hurt!\" She pulled herself up off the floor and moved a few feet away, \"I don't get it, you were so excited about practice during class today! You BEGGED me to be here! I could be at home catching up on MY homework instead of playing second fiddle to your majesty!\" The shove seemed to have broken something in Emily, as if suddenly years of repressed jealously were suddenly unleashed. \"You're...you're acting like a brat!\" Emily spat the last word out, knowing that Eve hated the word. She had spent so much time cultivating her image to NOT be seen as another fairly wealthy pretty girl with no brains, but the insult seemed to just pass over her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M NOT EVE! THIS ISN'T MY LIFE! THIS ISN'T WHAT I WISHED FOR!\" Eugene screamed again as the sheer insanity of the situation overwhelmed his self-control. In his fist, the Ahn'Ger Stone began to burn brightly, though the man turned girl and his new best friend were too enraged to see it. What they also failed to see was the looming form of Ms. Barry appearing from from behind a costume stand as she stomped towards the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL SOME PEOPLE WOULD DIE TO BE YOU, 'LITTLE MISS PERFECT'\" Emily screamed back, and gave a smug little snort as that particular insult seemed to get under Eve's skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I AM NOT LITTLE MISS PERFECT! GODDAMNIT I JUST WISH-\" Eugene screamed as the Ahn'Ger Stone flared to life in his small, dainty hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: \"I DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS!\" In a flash of light, Eugene suddenly switches spots, reappearing in a full body cast while Emily preens herself in her Sandy costume, saying \"I can''t believe I'm your understudy, Eve! This is so exciting! I'm sorry about the accident, though. At least you get to sit in the front row!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: \"THAT YOU HAD TO DEAL WITH THIS!\" In a flash of light, Eugene suddenly doesn't care so much about getting back to his old body. Meanwhile, Emily begins freaking out about...being a girl?</span></div></div>",

For years Emily had tried to bury her negative feelings with guilt. Eve had been a true friend to her since they first met, someone who in private was just as kind, thoughtful, and generous as her sparkling public image suggested she was. Still, Emily couldn't shake the deep seated desire to be the star for once. She didn't want to play the Ethel to Eve's Lucy or the Robin to her Batman for the rest of her life. She deserved her place in the sun too, damn it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, as Jeanette Barry stumbled upon the star of the play Eve Kazinski feuding with her best friend Emily McLeod over...something one of them had done(Ms. Barry having long ago given up on trying to understand the intricacies of the adolescent brain), she noticed the glowing stone sitting in Eve's clenched hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jeanette could scream or react, the mystical gemstone's magic felt the sufficient amount of anger pouring through Eugene's very soul, and just as quickly as it had the last time, reality shifted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene barely noticed the flash of emerald light erupting from his hand before he suffered from perspective whiplash. A moment ago he had been sitting backstage in front of the vanity mirror and makeup table. Now he was watching Emily and the rest of the other kids from the play, all still in costume standing around on set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were up on stage. Meaning <i>he</i> wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, where am I now!?\" moaned Eugene. His eyes darted around. He was in the audience of the Shermer High auditorium. How did he get here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK everyone, that's a wrap for today!\" shouted Ms. Barry as the petite drama teacher strolled past the transformed custodian to the front of the stage. Wasn't she just backstage with him?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we've got a play. Emily, I want to recognize you in particular for doing a fantastic job filling in for Eve. I doubt very many actors could have learned all the lines and choreography as well as you did on such short notice. I would say you're going to break a leg, but considering the circumstances, instead I'll just say that you deserve all the praise in the world. Everyone give Emily a round of applause.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the cast erupted into polite applause for a blushing Emily, who Eugene now realized was not dressed in the free spirited greaser clothes of her character Rizzo but in the ingenue outfit of Sandy Olsson, blonde wig and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Second, I'd like to thank Eve herself for having the courage to visit us so shortly after her horrific accident. She really is a trooper and, if I say say so myself, a real hero. Everybody give it up for Eve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe applause this time was more enthusiastic, with Emily herself leading the charge. Eugene heard a voice behind him saying \"I'm so proud of you, sugar plum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene swore he recognized the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt couldn't be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt <i>couldn't</i> be him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene tried to crane his neck, and in the process realized that he couldn't. He couldn't move his neck. Or wiggle his toes. Or touch his face. He couldn't do anything. To Eugene's horror, he realized as his big green eyes trailed downward that his body was paralyzed. His heavily bandaged legs were outstretched and laying upon two metal footholds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was in a wheelchair, covered head to toe in a white body cast! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD!\" he screamed out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone on stage turned towards Eugene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, are you OK?\" asked Ms. Barry, a concerned look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THIS IS A NIGHTMARE!\" cried Eugene through copious amounts of tears. \"HOW DID I BECOME PARALYZED?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene was now genuinely terrified instead of merely angry, silently cursing himself for ever touching that evil gemstone. He was now convinced that it was an artifact of some capricious demon from another dimension who sent it here for its sick amusement. On one deep antediluvian level, he didn't want to ever see it again, but how else could he get back to his old life without it?! Speaking of which....if he was paralyzed, how could he even use the stone if he had the chance? His body felt absolutely no sensation from the neck down. He tried once again to wiggle his fingers but failed to get any reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe familiar voice behind him spoke again in a calm, measured voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry everyone, the doctors said that Eve would experience some temporary memory loss after the accident, but she'll definitely recover from it in three weeks max. Her MRI scans showed no significant brain damage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn stage, a random kid who was portraying one of the greaser characters asked how long it would take for Eve to recover entirely. The voice spoke up once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The doctors said about six months depending on how well she does with physical therapy. I know my Eve has an iron will. She's still very young and is otherwise as healthy as a horse, so her mother and I counting on her to be back to fighting shape before Thanksgiving.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve?\" asked Emily from up on stage, looking in Eugene's direction. \"I'm so, so, <i>so</i> sorry that you're going to miss out on the play. I'm honored, really, truly honored to have been your understudy, and I know I'm going to make you proud. And not to mention that even though you're not going to be around for it, you've got my vote for prom queen. You earned it, girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother round of applause erupted from Eve's castmates <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK\" Eugene asked himself silently. \"What the hell was going on now?\" The last thing he remembered before this was having a meltdown over his humiliating foray into musical theatre and his failed wishes to return to his original body. He remembered Emily misunderstanding his misgivings as stage fright. He then made a wish to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...that he didn't want to do this anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it! I need to be angry to make a wish!\" thought Eugene to himself, his eyes growing wide at the realization. He needed to make a wish when he was angry. It was so easy. So simple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet so far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Eugene even <i>have</i> the gemstone anymore? He noticed a woman's purse hanging off of the wheelchair. Maybe it was tucked inside? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to go home, baby doll? I think we've had enough excitement for today\" asked the familiar voice that was haunting Eugene's memory. He hadn't heard that voice since...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...since he was eighteen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene's father walked in front of Eugene's wheelchair and kneeled down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god\" whispered the middle aged man turned teenage girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene's father Marcus Kazinski, looking the same age he looked when he unceremoniously kicked Eugene out of the house the moment he came of age(Though significantly more sober and cleaned up), gave him a warm smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I know how painful this all is for you, but I want you to know that you did the right thing. You're a hero, Eve. You saved that little boy's life. He'd be a bloodstain on the asphalt if you hadn't ran across the street to push him out of the way of that truck. It's a miracle you're even alive. Somebody up there must be looking out for you\" chuckled Marcus, looking up at the auditorium ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someday, all of this pain, all of this sacrifice, it's finally going to pay off. You're a beautiful young woman, both inside and out, and I'm going to be damned before I let you become a paraplegic. Now come on, let's go home. I've got your favorite ice cream and the big flat screen TV all ready for you in your bedroom.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus than began wheeling Eugene out of the auditorium, through the empty interior of Shermer High, and finally into the mostly barren parking lot. It took an embarrassingly long time for Marcus to haul Eugene's wheelchair up the ramp and into the backseat of his Toyota Sienna and buckle his daughter up, but once he did, he closed the door, climbed into the drivers seat, and drove Eugene to his now much nicer, more expensive home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Eugene still has the stone! It's now just a matter of getting someone to make the right wish on his behalf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: While everyone was distracted, an exhausted Bill Strasserman managed to sneak backstage and grab the Ahn'Ger Stone for himself before anyone could notice him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Something Else.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He didn't want to be the star of the school play, he didn't want to be part of the student body, he didn't want to be in this stupid argument with his supposedly new best friend Emily McLeod and he didn't want to be a girl! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M NOT EVE! THIS ISN'T MY LIFE! THIS ISN'T WHAT I WISHED FOR!\" Eugene screamed again as the sheer insanity of the situation overwhelmed his self-control. In his fist, the Ahn'Ger Stone began to burn brightly, though the man turned girl and his new best friend were too enraged to see it. What they also failed to see was the looming form of Ms. Barry appearing from from behind a costume stand as she stomped towards the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL SOME PEOPLE WOULD DIE TO BE YOU, 'LITTLE MISS PERFECT'\" Emily screamed back, and gave a smug little snort as that particular insult seemed to get under Eve's skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I AM NOT LITTLE MISS PERFECT! GODDAMNIT I JUST WISH-\" Eugene screamed as the Ahn'Ger Stone flared to life in his small, dainty hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: \"THAT THIS STUPID PLAY WASN'T HAPPENING!\" Eugene screamed in his new girly voice. The Ahn'Ger Stone flashes to life and suddenly Eugene finds himself in a cheerleader outfit in the otherwise empty gym!

It was cheerleading practice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Eugene never completes his wish, as Ms. Barry interrupts the fight and forcibly takes the Stone for herself, not knowing what it is.

For that matter, neither did Emily McLeod, who was perplexed at why her best friend had totally lost her mind. The strange artifact warped the very fabric reality all around the two oblivious mortals, and for a moment, Eugene felt disoriented. Then everything went dark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the world returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a brief moment ago, he was backstage in the Shermer High auditorium, crying his eyes out like the emotional teenage girl that he was stuck as, humiliated at being trapped in this body, the stupid wishing stone having interpreted his angry, frustrated desire for a better life in the most bizarre way possible. Then, his cringeworthy attempt at musical theater acting had made things even worse, making him feel like a total incompetent loser in front of over a dozen students, not to mention Ms. Barry. That was followed by an extended feud with some teenager named Emily who <i>claimed</i> to be Eve's best friend and seemed to have jealousy issues. Whatever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the magic gemstone that had called out to Eugene had transported the down on his luck custodian inside a large, cavernous hall dotted with basketball hoops, bleachers on either side, and various intersecting red markings covering the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was inside the Shermer High gymnasium. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'll be damned\" he whispered softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for the janitor to put two and two together and recall the wish he had just made that the school play wasn't happening. The former man took a deep breath and cursed himself for his bad luck. It seemed that the stone only responded to wishes when it wanted to, like the capricious trickster genie's of legend. At least Eugene knew that the magic gemstone was still working. He wasn't where he wanted to be, but he felt slightly better knowing that at least in theory there was a way out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realization that he had literally teleported twice today hit him like a ton of bricks. First he had teleported from his utility closet to that burger joint McFly's where all the kids hang out, and now from the auditorium to here! Eugene was never much of a sci-fi fan, but all this jaunting around reminded him a little the original Star Trek series he occasionally watched on TV as a kid, when the poor red shirts of the U.S.S Enterprise would beam down to whatever planet they were exploring that week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as he hated being stuck as a teenage girl, Eugene felt that it was kind of neat knowing for sure that the supernatural was a confirmed real thing that existed. He had always been a religious man, and more than a little superstitious, so knowing that his beliefs were probably more true than untrue was a feather he could put in his cap for the rest of his life, knowing that all those hours at church weren't a waste of time. It also made him feel special, knowing that he was living through a once in a lifetime opportunity. He had never had very many memorable life experiences prior to today, and this was certainly the single weirdest day he'd ever had up until now, so it was definitely right at the top of the list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene took moment to simply appreciate where he was. The lonely ex-grown man stared up in awe at the sheer craftsmanship that went into constructing Shermer High's gym. The high ceiling. The pristine walls adorned with the school crest. The polished linoleum floors. The rays of the afternoon sun poured through the metal grating framing the windows in a way that the older man found aesthetically pleasing. As a man, he had often grumbled to himself about how spoiled these kids were when he lived in a crappy little two room apartment and they had a state of the art gym that they took for granted, but now he simply admired that it existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the right of Eugene were more than two dozen teenage girls, all dressed in the school's green and yellow cheer uniforms, all of them in the middle of one of their routines. A bouncy pop song by...Eugene wanted to say Ariana Grande...was playing in the background, setting the rhythm to to the complicated footwork and impressive displays of agility and athleticism these girls were engaged in. A part of Eugene remembered when he was back in high school. Back then, all he could think about were girls. He daydreamed about the ones he liked in class, and he tried numerous times unsuccessfully to go out with them. Self consciously, he admitted to himself, he had spent countless hours rubbing one out as he fantasied about one particular Senior girl named Sally Hendricks he was attracted to in his bedroom late at night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was over forty years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls he saw now who were practicing for the big football game on Friday were awfully pretty too. Every single one of them waving their pom pom's and doing high kicks were at the very least incredibly adorable. Eugene hated thinking that way. These girls were all young enough to be his daughter, maybe even his granddaughter. And now he was one of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus H Christ, what a day\" he quietly moaned to himself in that incessantly cutesy voice that distinctively belonged to Evelyn Sophia Kazinski, the most popular student in Shermer High. How he knew Eve's full name, he wasn't sure, which worried Eugene a little. He flexed his slender fingers and his eyes suddenly shot open in alarm as he realized his hand were empty! Eugene's eyes widened in alarm as he stared at his empty palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Where's the gemstone!?' His mind screamed in panic before he spotted a large pink duffel bag with the name 'EVE' stenciled on the side of it. 'Oh wait, its...its probably in there with the rest of my...clothes'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Adriana Grande song ended with the cheerleaders forming in several cupies, each flyer coquettishly holding her right hand on her hip as the stood on top of her three comrades. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelf consciously, Eugene looked down on the body he was still stuck in, taking in how his shorter, curvier frame clung ever so attractively against the green and yellow fabric of Eve's own cheerleading uniform, her not insubstantial breasts tenting out against the image of Shermy the Salamander, the school mascot. He reached behind him for a fistful of Eve's curly red hair, and quickly realized that it was tied up in a loose ponytail. His legs looked nice. Today he was wearing some black knee high socks, which looked so cute... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What the hell?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene again was disturbed by this, how he was becoming so concerned about his looks, almost as if the Eve part of his brain was slowly taking over, but he was immediately pulled out of his reverie by a harsh, spiteful voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bitch, stop playing with your hair! You weren't paying attention at all!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stunned Eugene whipped his head around until he saw the source of the voice. It was a pretty, exotic looking dark haired girl, a little taller than Eve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you talking to me?\" he squeaked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark haired girl scowled. \"Earth To Eve: Duh! We're performing in front of the entire school in a few days, and our captain isn't paying any attention to see if our choreography is right! It looks like you've been staying up all night sniffing glue! Why do you look so clueless right now, you dumb pollack? Is the pressure getting to you? Huh? Have we found a chink in Little Miss Perfect's armor? Huh? Huh?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Eugene didn't know how to react. He was so so much smaller in this new body. He felt more vulnerable like this than he had as a man, and despite himself, his body began to visibly tremble in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" he stuttered nervously in Eve's quivering voice. Gloria looked like she was enjoying watching Eve squirm before she was cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gloria, shut up!\" demanded a feminine yet strong and authoritative voice. Eugene, heart pounding by Gloria's brutal tongue lashing, turned his head towards a very tall, stunningly pretty blonde who had emerged from the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the girl from McFly's! Joanna Ingerman, the daughter of that rich guy!  Joanna gently lowered her flyer, a small Asian girl, down to the ground before marching right over to Gloria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As Co-Captain, this is me giving you one final warning, Vanapoulous. Everyone here, myself included, is sick and tired of your nasty attitude. Eve is a fantastic captain and ten times the woman you'll ever be. She earned her place being in charge of us. How many competitions have we won this year under her leadership? That's right, three. Three more than you ever earned when you were captain, and look at all the other shit she does! What do you do besides slut shame everyone and abuse your poor boyfriend?! You're not the Queen Bee, Gloria, you're just an insecure little brat! Now you apologize to Eve or I'm kicking you off the team!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoanna briefly pointed directly at Eugene then confidently strolled back to her quartet. She smiled at who she believed to be Eve Kazinski with a friendly and knowing grin. Slowly, the other cheerleaders on the team began to clap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene was in sheer awe of this. He hadn't been here for five minutes, and he was already knee deep in the petty drama of girl world. He didn't want a single part of this, especially from Gloria Vanapoulous, who he now remembered as the little bitch who spread those nasty rumors about him as a man. But the applause continued and grew louder, until it became as loud as thunder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We love you Eve!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the best, girlfriend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignore Gloria, everyone knows that she has herpes!\" came from one taunting voice in particular, which got some laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Holy shit, it's Emily!</i> thought Eugene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was standing among one of the quartets, herself dressed in the school colors, seemingly a cheerleader herself. Eugene grinned back at her, remembering that less than ten minutes ago the two had been fighting profusely in another timeline. </span></div></div>",

It was almost 6:30 P.M. If he was really one of the team captains then he should be able to decide when practice was over, right? He decided to test how far his authority over the other girls actually went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, how about we call it a day?\" he asked them politely. After the way his day had been going since even before he'd found the wish granting rock the former middle-aged janitor expected to be told no. That there was some other horrible humiliating thing he had to do before he was released from his torment, but was pleasantly surprised as he saw the Ingerman girl nod her almost impossibly blonde head in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds good, Eve! We've got this routine memorized anyway!\" Joanna said, beaming. She bounded over, her massive breasts seemingly defying physics as she gave Eugene a massive hug. \"Don't worry about Gloria, I've got your back girlfriend!\" Releasing her co-captain, Joanna turned to the other girls and hiked a thumb towards the brightly lit entry of the girl's locker room. \"Pack it in girls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other cheerleaders nodded and followed Joanna to get changed and go home (as well as get in on the juicy drama that would no doubt happen in the locker room between Gloria and Joanna). Each of them paid 'Eve' a compliment as they passed her by, some even giving her a supportive hug or words of encouragement as they retrieved their duffel bags from the large pile that surrounded 'his' on the bleachers. He didn't know how to feel. He loved the human contact (even if some of it was currently sweaty and a little smelly) and the well wishes, but he wanted it to be for himself, not for this unwanted persona he was stuck in. As soon as the last few girls were out of the gym he was going to get that gemstone from his bag and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY EVE!\" shouted a loud voice from the gymnasium entrance. Eugene turned to follow the voice, his red ponytail bouncing on the back of his head and saw...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: It was that geeky kid from McFly's! He looked really out of breath. Curious, Eugene goes over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: It was some tall, curly haired girl holding what looked like a cheerleading uniform!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"HEY EVE!\" Came a high, shrill voice that echoed off the high ceiling of the Shermer High Gymnasium. Eugene's new head snapped towards the front of the gym, as did several of the other cheerleaders who were still collecting their things from the gym's floor. There, standing at one of two large double doors that exited out into the trophy case decorated lobby, was a tall skinny girl in a red shirt and faded jeans that had splotches of paint on them. Her face was round and slightly boyish, topped by a small pair of glasses and framed by curly dirty blonde hair that hung down to her shoulders. Her free arm was stretched upwards in a frantic wave while in her other arm was what looked like a wrinkled version of the outfit that was currently hugging Eugene's newly acquired curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven while he marveled at the incredibly good eyesight his new form had, his brow furrowed into a frown as he heard the remaining cheerleaders begin to whisper between themselves. Even from a few feet away, Eugene could hear some of the derogatory remarks aimed at the new girl standing on the other side of the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, it's that weird Willow girl! What is she doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard she's a lesbian, she probably just wants to look at our tits\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like OMG, losers like her shouldn't be allowed in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what she wants with Eve?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene frowned at the instant rumor mill, and was reminded of how cruel teenagers could be. At least, it seemed, he wasn't the type of...girl that seemed to do that, everything about his current new life seemed to suggest that this 'Eve' girl the former janitor was stuck as was as nice as could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EVE!\" The tall girl, Willow, yelled again from the gym's entrance, and with a sigh, began the long walk over to her. The way his body moved still felt weird but Eugene could tell he was quickly getting used to the way he, well, bounced now. The way his new breasts moved in the sports bra he was wearing, the cool air around his mid-section, the swish of his hips and the cheerleading skirt, it still felt very different but not as alien as it all had just a few minutes ago. He didn't even register the bouncing of his ponytail as he approached the lanky girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he approached Willow, Eugene began scanning the girl head to toe, almost as if he was sizing her up for some sort of confrontation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Given the day I've had...' He muttered under his breath. Up close Eugene could see the girl was cute, in a girl next door sort of way, with a definite lean towards tomboy, at least fashion wise. Eugene felt a weird twinge of..jealousy? Envy? Whatever it was, it had been set off by this Willow girl's hips and the rounded ass they were connected to. But Eugene pushed those feelings away as gave this strange girl a lopsided smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hi?\" Eugene said in his melodious new voice.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>*Earlier That Day*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill Strasserman stopped to catch his breath as he had run...sprinted the distance from the classic Shermer burger joint McFly's back to the grand halls of Shermer High faster than the lanky, out of shape geek had ever run before. It had only been a short couple of miles, but the teenager was covered in cold sweat by the time he reached his destination, feeling like he had just finished a marathon. Considering that today was a little chillier than the meteorologist had forecast the night before, below average even for a Midwestern state like Illinois thanks to that freak thundershower from this morning, the perspiration that seemed painted over Bill seemed less like a natural coolant system and more like his body was deliberately trying to give him hypothermia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really need to join the gym\" Bill nagged to himself in his exhausted voice, ashamed at his life choices. He wiped the torrent of sweat pouring down his brow, and finally, after a long minute, settled back into to a comfortable breathing routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill's more athletic friend Tom Ackerton had always encouraged Bill to get into shape, but Bill had consistently put it off, lazily rationalizing that he had plenty of exercise running away from Big Jon. Now that he had a girlfriend though, an absolutely gorgeous one(One that had formerly <i>been</i> Big Jon), he had come to the epiphany that he finally had a good reason to take care of his appearance, and he decided that he was going to take Tom up on that offer to bulk him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst though, Bill, absolutely needed to get his life preserver back, the thing that had eliminated all of his problems and significantly improved his life in one fell swoop, the magical green gemstone that he had found on his front porch this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't just selfishness, Bill told himself. Sure, he wanted to use the gemstone to make further improvements to his life, and to the world in general, but more importantly, Bill had convinced himself that he was keeping the stone out of dangerous hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod forbid, if Gloria Vanapoulous got hold of the stone, or Rob Bolstrum, or any of the other bullies, or even his little sister Kimmy, Bill surmised that the world would be far worse off than it already was. He could only imagine what kind of reckless wishing sprees any of those cretins would go on, and how they would inevitably damage society.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, Bill reluctantly told himself, even Tom. Tom was a good guy, but could someone that depressed all the time be trusted to make sound decisions? Bill thought no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr the police for that matter. They couldn't be trusted to not use the stone for their own corrupt reasons, and certainly not the government. If some Feds came knocking on the Strasserman front door tomorrow demanding the gemstone, like hell was he just handing it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. Bill Strasserman, self appointed guardian of the world, decided that he was the only one <b>responsible</b> enough to wield this stone . He wasn't going to waste this opportunity like some lottery winner blowing all of their money on hookers and coke. He wasn't going to use it to settle petty scores, or erase people from existence like Thanos from the recently released Infinity War movie. He going to be <i>smart</i> about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill's fatigued body and cramped legs carried him from the front entrance of the school, which was locked, to a side entrance that Bill knew was used as a quick exit for the students(And occasionally teachers like Ms. Barry) who liked to go out to smoke. Lucky him, a block of wood from Mr. Santini's shop class was lodged in between the door. He casually snuck inside and hoped that nobody would notice him. As quiet as a mouse, he tiptoed past Mr. Irons's office, who currently was busy using the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bill roamed the eerie, empty hallways of post-in session Shermer High, he cursed himself for being dumb enough not to realize that the sharp side of the green stone would tear a hole through his backpack. How could he be so stupid!? The eighteen year old geek guessed that he had been too distracted by the almost divine beauty that was Joanna Ingerman, the amazon like blonde who was now both his loving, affectionate girlfriend and his bodyguard against Rob. Bill laughed at the thought. If Joanna was Wonder Woman, he figured that made him Steve Trevor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he was getting distracted. Bill figured that the stone must have slipped out of his pack at some point in the afternoon, probably as he was commuting from one class to another. and Eve Kazinski of all people found it laying on the floor and picked it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve Kazinski. Bill had mixed thoughts on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redheaded Senior girl was just so <b>perfect</b>. Beautiful. Smart. Graceful. Naturally good at everything. Seemingly pure of heart. Went out of her way to be kind to even the biggest dorks in school like Paige Walters and Matt Harris, and helped out special needs students feel welcome and needed. Bill mentally compared her to a female Captain America. Just like Steve Rogers, she even had perfect teeth. She had even fixed Bill's transmission once!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve's seemingly perfect life just seemed so damn odd to Bill. It's like she came out a storybook. She was a... what's the term...a Mary Sue!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son a bitch\" muttered Bill as he finally made his way to the back of the school where the auditorium. He just had an epiphany. \"Did Eve use the stone on herself?\" he thought as he slipped through the double doors into the dark cavern of the auditorium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was certainly possible. When Bill had wished for Big Jon to turn into Joanna this morning, he had altered the very fabric of reality.  He had created a brand new timeline where Jon had been replaced by Joanna, and only Bill seemed to remember that Jon had even existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho's to say that Eve hadn't done the same, only to herself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt disturbed Bill to realize that his memories could have been tampered with. Then again, he had done the same thing. Maybe there wasn't even such a thing as an \"original\" reality, just the reality the last wisher had created. Who had the original Eve been? For all Bill knew, maybe she had been some obese, pockmarked Freshman nerd that he didn't remember, and that version of Eve had used the gemstone to wish for this dream life as the princess of the school. Like the plot of that one episode of Buffy The Vampire Slayer. What had it been called? Superstar?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill was getting lost in his own paranoia again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just find the stone\" he whispered to himself as he stuck to the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a lot easier than Bill expected to sneak past the drama club. The pack of wannabe thespians were currently taking a break apparently, lost in their own lives and the lives of their characters  A few were chatting amongst themselves on stage, still in their costumes. A few others were going over their scripts for the umpteenth time in the audience. Two kids dressed as greasers were budy laughing over a private joke they were sharing near one of the exits.  It was a completely alien world to Bill, who didn't have a strong interest in the performing arts outside of consuming whatever superhero or sci-fi movie was coming out that month. And comics and video games, if those counted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made his way backstage through a side entrance, and after thirty seconds of searching, he found her. Eve Kazinski herself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!\" he whispered through gritted teeth from behind a curtain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been originally planning on stealing back the stone while play rehearsal was in motion. He had wanted to sneak backstage and rifle through Eve's belongings while the leading lady was busy singing her lungs out with her fellow lead Rod Alvarez, but now he couldn't do that. She was right here! And it looked like something was really wrong with her. Bill watched as she removed her blonde wig and tossed it to the floor in a huff. She turned around, and the eighteen year old saw that her face was red, and there were real tears in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid she fail on stage or something? Impossible. Eve had the voice of an angel, and from Bill had heard a more than capable actress. <br>\r\nHe saw Eve ransack her makeup drawer. And then saw what he had been looking for! Bill had to slam his hand against his mouth to keep from gasping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stone! Eve had pulled out the stone from the makeup drawer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill wondered what he should do. Should he just run up and grab it from her? While he was bigger than Eve, he wasn't particularly strong or athletic, while Eve was in perfect shape from years of all the different sports and cheerleading she had participated in. He wasn't sure he could overpower her, nor did he particularly want to. He wasn't a thug like Ingerman or Bolstrum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw Eve make a wish. A wish to be herself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I knew it!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill waited. He watched the uncharacteristic temper tantrum follow from Eve's lips as she flailed about, frustrated at her failure. He saw her violently sit down on her stool, seemingly defeated by something for the first time in her life. Then, another girl, Eve's best friend Emily McLeod, came backstage to console Eve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill watched with rapt attention as the real life drama unfolded around the two teenage girls. He saw how Eve rejected Emily's affection. Then they began to argue. He had no idea why the two friends were fighting, but apparently rehearsal <i>hadn't</i> gone well after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw the redhead push her best friend to the floor in a bratty temper tantrum. He saw her scream bloody murder at Emily. He saw the betrayed Emily scream back at Eve. He saw Eve reach for the stone, holding it threateningly in her tiny hand.  He heard her make a violently angry wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Bill saw the last thing he had wanted to see. He saw a vibrant green-gold aura erupt from Eve's gemstone filled hand as the world faded away...And then snapped back into existence a moment later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Bill found himself in the lobby of the gym, and something about his body felt very off...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bill blinked in confusion at the sudden change in location. Where before he had been hidden backstage in the school auditorium, now he was standing out in the open, in the brightly lit lobby of the Shermer High gym! And everything seemed...bigger? And brighter? Bill stared at the trophy case next to him, squinting as the overhead lights produced a harsh glare on the metallic surface of the trophies within. He eyed the blurry, distorted reflection of himself in the polished gold of a football trophy from 1996 when he realized that there was something wrong with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head was too large. And something was wrong with his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly very concerned, Bill slowly raised an arm, noticing that where once he'd been wearing a t-shirt, now his arm was covered by a full red sleeve. And his arm itself felt lighter than it had moments ago. The hand crept upwards as he kept his eyes lock on his distorted reflection before violently recoiling as he touched something soft hanging below his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" Bill hissed, and a hand clutched at his throat, which suddenly no longer contained the tell-tale bump of a masculine Adam's Apple. His voice was different! It was...lighter?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no\" Bill whispered, and without looking down he darted for the bathroom doors nearby, not paying attention to which one he entered, only bothering to focus on how small his hands were now, how narrow his fingers looked. How there was an absence between his legs, and how his ass tried to knock him over as his center of gravity was thrown off. And then he was there, standing in front of the bathroom mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill had been, just as he feared, changed by Eve Kazinski's wish. Instead of a short haired eighteen year old male who could have done with a little more exercise, there was just a tall girl with frizzy, curly dirty blonde hair wearing glasses. Small breasts poked through the featureless and red long sleeved shirt he was now wearing, and his hips seemed barely contained by paint-stained jeans. His lips were a little puffier, fuller, small ears hidden beneath his curly mane and decorated by small earrings in the shape of BB-8.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd was he...younger? If he was, it was almost imperceptible to Bill's new eyes, which retained their original color but looked so large behind the pair of glasses that sat on his small feminine nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Eve, what the hell did you do!?\" Bill groaned as he pulled the glases off and watched the world go blurry before slipping them back on. He looked a LOT like his mom, and a little like Kimberly so at least he was pretty sure he hadn't magically been transplanted into another family. And the former boy had retained his mind and memories, even if he had no idea what his name was now. There was still a way to get out of this, he just needed to find Eve and the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a buzz in the pocket of his jeans and cautiously slipped a slender hand into the pouch, sighing in relief as the familiar rectangular shape of a phone met his touch. He grasped the cellular device and pulled it out, unlocking the screen with a simple swipe and thankful that the girl he now was hadn't put in a screenlock code. But that was where the relief had ended. On the home screen was the usual scattering of apps, but they were arranged in front of a picture of some anime that Bill didn't know (he was much more of a Western Animation guy). But it wasn't the picture that made what little body hair he now possessed stand up on edge; no, it was the date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOctober 19th, 2018.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been sent back in time! Instead of being a month away from graduating, the school year had practically started over!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why?\" Bill wondered out loud in his reedy voice. He noticed that there was a text message waiting on the messenger app, and at a loss of what to do now that he was back in the past, Bill simply tapped on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Hey Willow! Good luck! Tell me how it goes okay? xoxo -Paige<br>\r\nMessage Received 6:25pm 10/18/18</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow? Was...was that his name now? Bill could only assume so, and the picture next to the small row of text was clearly the chubby face of Paige Walters, one of Shermer High's social outcasts that seemed to not fit in with any of the cliques no matter how hard she tried. And apparently, Willow was at cheerleading practice? But that didn't seem right, Bill wasn't dressed for cheelrleading and even with the somewhat relaxed expectations of what cheerleaders were supposed to look like anymore, Bill clearly didn't look the type. Did that mean he was part of the 'Losers' now as well?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at least the time rewind made some kind of sense now. In the spring there were no sports that needed cheerleaders, they were strictly for the football and basketball seasons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if the Stone doesn't consider cheerleading competitions a sport\" Bill chuckled darkly to himself before turning back to the phone, looking for more information about who he was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a second to scroll up and was assaulted with dozens of texts, ranging from short emoticon tag to full blown conversation spiels. The most recent one was clearly about Matt Harris, the little sociopath that followed Paige around like a lost puppy...Only now it seemed that Willow/Bill was his new object of lust and it made 'Willow' very uncomfortable. And it also confirmed that Bill was now two years younger than he'd been minutes ago; Paige and Matt were Sophmores, and now he was again as well as the magic of the gemstone had regressed him to sixteen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's just fucking great!\" Bill swore as he pounded a tiny fist against the bathroom counter, glaring at his new reflection, \"I hope I still have my damn driver's license! I wonder what Joanna is-\" Bill paused in the middle of his tirade as a dark thought washed over him. If he was sixteen again, and if he was a girl...There was very little chance that Joanna Ingerman was still his girlfriend. He was alone again after barely having known what it was like to be in a loving relationship for less than a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. No no no! I'm not letting it end like this! That rock belongs to me and Joanna is my girlfriend!\" Bill growled as he slid Willow's phone back into his pocket. He had to find that magical gemstone and he had to fix this, even if he had to steal in back from Eve! Bill charged out of the bathroom, heading for one of double doors that led out into the gym proper when he spied a pile of yellow and white clothes sitting in the middle of the lobby. He stopped and changed direction, swooping up the pile of clothes and un-wadding it to see a VERY dated version of the Shermer High Salamanders logo on it. He spun the torso piece around to find 'Strasserman' stenciled in white across the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This must have been mom's...' Bill thought to himself. His mother, Martha, had been a cheerleader in her high school days. She must have given 'Willow' her uniform to try out in. Well, if nothing else it would maintain his 'cover'. Bill had no intention of making a fool of himself in front of the rest of the cheerleaders, which most definitely included Gloria Vanapolous and Joanna (he knew from Tom, at least in the previous reality, that Gloria wasn't above using failed try-out videos as leverage over other girls).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just gotta get to Eve and fix this mess.\" He muttered silently, wadding the uniform up and holding it under his left arm as he made his way back to the gym doors and walked into the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheerleaders were clearly done with practice, most of them heading into the girl's locker room to change out of their uniforms while Joanna Ingerman stood at the doorway, arms crossed under her incredible boobs as she made sure no girl was left behind. Bill frowned for a moment, his eyes lingering on his sudden ex/neverwas girlfriend before he focused. He hoped Eve was still in the gym, the thought of having to venture into the viper's nest to find the redhead easily topping the list of things he had no desire to do. At least while he looked like this. But then he saw the brilliant red hair, now in a ponytail as opposed to hanging freely as had been before the wish, and it's owner standing next to the bleachers. It was Eve! Now all he needed to do was get her attention. Not willing to get any closer to the cheerleaders than he had to, Bill chose to go loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY EVE!\" The former boy shouted at the top of his new voice. He winced as it echoed throughout the gym. He hadn't meant for it to be that loud, but it seemed to have grabbed the popular girl's attention. Eve whipped around like a cat, and even from across the gym Bill could see that she looked scared, confused. As if this entire situation was as alien to her and is was to him. The few remaining cheerleaders were staring at him before they began talking to each other. Bill couldn't hear what they were saying, but from the looks of disdain he could tell they were probalby making fun of him. Whatever. At least Eve wasn't taking part in the gossip, which meant she still might have been the same kind soul that he remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EVE!\" Bill yelled again, waving his free hand in the air. That seemed to finally spur the redheaded beauty into action, and she made her way across the gym, swishing in her cheerleader outfit until finally she was in front of Bill. She gave Bill a weird look as if she was sizing him up before she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...hi?\" She said in her melodious voice. But Bill could still tell she was confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Here goes...' Bill thought as he gave Eve a small, nervous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad I found you, Eve! You've got to help me, I'm not actually a girl! My name is Bill, and I believe you have something that belongs to me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Bill desperately tries to get Eve Kazinski to work with him in returning to the old reality, not realizing that Eve wasn't all that she appeared to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Eve, or rather Eugene, panics about losing the Stone and her/his only ticket out of this reality and runs from Bill/Willow.</span></div></div>",

Man. I'm an eighteen year old <i>man</i> named Bill Strasserman, and you took something from me by mistake.

How do you know about that?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's my gemstone. Pay attention! When I realized that the gemstone was missing from my backpack, which is a family heirloom by the way, so it's very important that I get it back, I ran all the way from McFly's back to school because I knew you were here, and then I sneaked backstage behind the auditorium.

A couple of other cheerleaders began giggling cruelly at the glib comment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redheaded beauty and the braces wearing geek ignored them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm not a lesbian, and I'm not a Peeping Tom. I'm just a regular guy who wants to set things back the way they were. I sneaked backstage because I knew you had the damn thing, but then you made your wish about not wanting not wanting to be in the play anymore, and now here we are. Look, could we talk about this in the hallway, Eve?\" asked Bill, already tired of his high pitched, reedy voice, and the disapproving gazes of the stuck up popular crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene looked behind him, watching Joanna silently appraise the dorky younger girl claiming to be a boy. The blonde  carried an air of absolute authority about her, as if the gym was a castle, the cheerleaders her subjects, and she their undisputed queen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beleaguered janitor turned around, almost intimidated by her co captain. He didn't know what to make of this Willow character's story. It sounded crazy, like something out a bad episode of The Twilight Zone. But then again, so did his story. Who would honestly believe that the prettiest and most popular girl in school, beloved by all, had been their \"creepy\" middle aged homely janitor less than an hour ago?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Eugene have to lose by listening to Willow's pitch for a little while longer? Who knows, maybe this nerdy chick <i>was</i> telling the truth. More importantly, if she knew a way out of this high school by way of Franz Kafka nightmare, he was going to take it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, sure. Let's take a walk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill and Eugene, trapped in the unwanted guises of Willow and Eve, strolled past the gym's wide double doors and into the hallway, deciding to speak next to the school's trophy case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, so I don't know if you actually remember me or not\" started Bill. \"I was with you at McFly's after school, just before you went off to rehearsal with Emily and Rod. I was the brown haired kid who was Joanna's boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve's green eyes widened once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>do</i> remember you! Oh my God, my wish changed you too!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to! I didn't mean to do <i>any</i> of this!\" cried Eugene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, the former middle aged janitor felt guilty as sin. It was bad enough that he had fucked up his own life, but now he fucked up this kid's life too!? He turned him from a handsome young man with a gorgeous blonde on his arm into this...this frizzy haired nerdette! His stomach began to turn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, you didn't know what the stone was capable of\" replied Bill, comforting Eve with a hug. \"Until this morning, neither did I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how did you know specifically that I had your gemstone?\" Eugene asked, trying to piece everything together. \"I found it jist laying around in the hallway after lunch ended.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was a hole in my backpack. I figure that the stone fell to the bottom, and one of the sharp edges tore right through it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean how do <i>you</i> remember everything like I do? Nobody else does. My...my best friend Emily doesn't remember anything about being at the play, and she was backstage with me! It's like we're in another dimension or something!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's magic\" Bill answered curtly. \"Who the hell knows how magic works? What do I look like, Doctor Strange? I have no clue why only the two of us can remember the old reality. Maybe whoever uses the stone is immune from its effects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene looked down at his curvaceous female body and winced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm definitely not immune from its effects. And if you're really a boy like you say you are, neither are you. But maybe the genie inside the stone or whoever the fuck is in charge does have a rule about that. So what exactly did you make a wish for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" asked Bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said that you made a wish with the stone before. What did you wish for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Crap</i> thought Bill to himself. <i>What do I say? I can't tell Eve that I turned the school bully into my girlfriend! Then she'll think that I'm a bad guy and she'll never give it back to me!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...um...I wished for...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the double doors burst open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve, what does Asserman want? She's not giving you any trouble, is she?\" demanded Joanna, giving Bill a dirty look with a pair of piercing Nordic blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Not at all, Joanna!\" shouted Eugene nervously, chuckling in Eve's beautiful voice. \"Willow is just, uh, wondering if she can audition for the squad!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, again?\" sighed the blonde Amazon, as if she's had this conversation with the redhead a hundred times before. \"I told you, Eve, you need to stop saying yes to every girl who stops by. We're not running a charity here. With all due respect to her, you know and I know that girls like Willow aren't cut out for this sort of thing. You got to be co-captain alongside me based on your popularity and your talent, and I accepted that, but being captain means having to wear your big girl pants sometimes and making tough decisions. Now what's it going to be, Eve?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoanna's forceful speech and lingering eyes bored right into Eugene's soul, intimidating him into compliance. He stared right into Bill's eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I...I have to turn you down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" shouted Bill. \"No, Eve, listen to me, call me later tonight, OK? Here's my phone number...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to pull out his phone to dial Eve's phone, but his slender arm was detained by the vice like grip of Joanna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let it go\" said the blonde coldly and forcefully, staring at her former boyfriend in another reality with undisguised contempt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Bill's heart began to race, and his breathing became rapid and shallow. He realized that he was in the beginning stages of a panic attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I'll let it go!\" he squeaked out in Willow's pathetic voice, lacking even a hint of confidence or authority.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoanna unclenched Willow's arm, leaving a slight skin bruise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now get your skinny little ass out of here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill looked briefly in Eve's direction, who was staring at him silently with a mixture of sympathy and trepidation, but clearly intimidated by Joanna's power as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning, as he realized that he wasn't getting any closer to the gemstone tonight, that he was stuck in this new shitty reality and back to square one for at least one day, Bill grabbed his mother's old uniform and took the long walk back home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The wind blew across his smooth cheeks and through his frizzy mane like a burst of ice water, the skin on his forearms rippling with goosebumps despite being covered by long red sleeves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt less safe now, more vulnerable. Maybe it was because time had rewound itself by six months and it was now pitch dark out, save for the street lights and the glow of the harvest moon above, but it wasn't just that. Bill figured that maybe he was more on edge because he was female now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShermer was a nice small town with next to no crime save for bullies, and the street he lived on was one of the most quiet and unassuming out of all of them, but he had heard enough stories about young girls getting abducted and raped from episodes of the Casefile podcast he was a listener of to know that it was always a possibility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, he made it back home in one piece. He even saw that his old car was in the driveway completely unscathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right!\" squealed Bill, realizing that with no Big Jon in this reality, he wouldn't need to rely on others for transport anymore. He climbed the steps to his front porch, found his house keys in his pocket, and let himself inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm home!\" he shouted in his reedy new voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Willow, did you make it on the cheerleading team!?\" asked Martha Strasserman, his mother, from inside the kitchen. She was clearly cooking something. Smelled like meatloaf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I didn't! They said that the team is full!\" Bill lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh honey, I'm so sorry! Maybe next year!\" shouted Martha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm sorry too, princess!\" yelled Greg Strasserman, her father. \"Dont let those Regina George wannabes get to you.

Who could that be?\" asked Bill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Bill walks into the kitchen and sees the tubby Paige Walters sitting at the dinner table alongside Bill's father and his sister Kimmy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Tom Ackerton is still somehow Bill's best friend in this reality, having always harbored a crush on Willow but never acting on it for popularity's sake. </span></div></div>",

And god, way to date yourself dad' Thought Bill as he wandered into the kitchen, trying not to be weirded out by how different everything looked in his current (and hopefully temporary) body. Everything was a little bit bigger than he remembered it being that morning, 'Willow' being a few inches shorter than Bill's old body had been. Now, what was Tom-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Wills!\" Paige said as Bill entered the kitchen, the overweight, slightly pug-faced girl leaping up from her seat at the table and rushing over to stand in front of Bill, \"I was starting to get worried when you didn't text me back! You're okay, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh\" Bill's mind blanked as he tried to remember who the girl in front of him was before a name clicked into place. The girl in the texts on his phone! This was Paige Walters! He could see why she was considered a Loser in the by the lower classmen of Shermer. She wasn't all that much to look at and her voice sounded like a dying frog. Bill was suddenly grateful that as a Senior he...But the thought died as he realized that he was no longer a Senior. He wasn't graduating in a few weeks, he was a Sophmore all over again and somehow back in October 2018!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige, on the other hand, simply narrowed her eyes at Willow's confused, almost disgusted face. And what was that mark on her arm?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Something's wrong' She said to herself as a million scenarios of how those cheerleading bitches could have hurt her best friend. She shouldn't have let Willow go alone, she was so sensitive and naieve! Paige grabbed Willow's hand and gave it a squeeze out of habit, to show the young at heart teen that it was okay...Only for the other teenager to recoil and jerk her hand out of Paige's almost is if she'd been stung by something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Uh, sorry?\" Bill said as he saw the look of concern and a little bit of hurt on Paige's puffy, swollen face. And while part of it had been a reaction to Paige's sudden touch, he did feel a bit sorry; This girl was just...not pretty at all. Almost ugly, even, and part of Bill had simply reacted. He hoped it wasn't too 'out of character' for the girl he was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a tense silence between the two teenage girls as neither of them knew what to do next in the awkward moment that was, thankfully, broken by Martha Strasserman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You girls can go up to the room if you want, this meatloaf still has about fifteen minutes left before it's ready\" Martha was trying not to eavesdrop, but she also realized something was wrong. This was not the way her Willow acted, so...reserved, especially with Paige. The two girls loved each other like sisters, and Martha was glad that Willow had someone looking out for her in school. But this...This was so out of character for the both of them. Maybe Willow was just nervous? Her daughter had a penchant for over-investing in things and when they didn't pan out, sometimes she could get a little emotional, so maybe she just needed to have a good cry in private. But regardless, her words seemed to break the tension, at least for Paige.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Wills, let's head up. You can show me that new picture you were working on before you left!\" The tubby girl said and grabbed Willow's arm, this time a bit more forcefully, and headed towards the stairs, practically dragging her BFF with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure. The, uh, drawing!\" Was all Bill could say as his skinny form was jerked forward. The two girls plodded up the stairs and down the upper hallway, passing Kimberly's room, in which the pre-teen was dancing around with her eyes shut, a pair of headphones on. And then they were at what was once Bill's door, but now it was clearly someone else's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis morning, the door had simply been plain and featureless, just another door, but now...Now it was covered in cute pictures of cats, several images of 'Willow' and Paige at several different ages, as well as a white board that had \"Do unto others EXACTLY what was just done to you!\" written on it alongside an actually not half bad looking Pidgey from Pokemon. Beneath it was some weird starfish looking thing that was saying \"Praise Helix!\" in different handwriting, clearly not the same as the Pidgey. But as interesting as that was, Bill tried to examine the pictures on the door before Paige opened it and pulled him into what had once been his bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was different. And pink. Just a few hours ago, Bill's bed had been against the far wall, his desk in front of the window, but now those things were reversed, with his bed sitting right next to the window and decked out in pink and white blankets and way, way too many plushies. And his computer was different! Instead of a slightly outdated gaming rig it was now some dinky looking Apple computer with an art tablet next to it! Posters of boy bands and anime shows hung on the walls instead of his much smaller collection of Star Wars and Marvel posters. And what was with the bean bags? Were those...Were those Barbie dolls set up like models?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh my god' Bill thought as he wandered in, not realizing Paige had let go of his arm and was quietly closing the door behind him, beady eyes staring at him as he carefully made his way through the feminized room for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's like she's...She's never been here before. Did she hit her head or something at the gym? Did...Was Matt there? Did he do something to her? What is going on?!' Paige said as Bill finally found a uneasy seat on the edge of the bead, his frizzy face still staring around the room in shock, confusion and...anger? Willow was never angry! She was too kind for that!  There was something off about Willow's eyes...Like there was someone else behind them? Paige knew she was a full fledged geek, maybe even a nerd, but she was firmly planted in reality. Life's cruelty and the need to look out for a Dreamer like Willow made her the cynical realist of their little friend group, but for some reason she couldn't shake the feeling that this was not the Willow she knew, that something had changed inside her best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls locked eyes as Willow finished looking around the room, and Paige couldn't see the same excited sparkle in those green-blue pools, just...clouds. It was too much for the overweight girl to bear as suspicion crumbled into concern, her eyes watering up behind her glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Willow, ar-are you okay? Did something happen at the gym? You're...This isn't you! You're acting like you've never been here before, and like...like you hate me!\" Paige said, her voice struggling not to break. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Shit shit shit!' Bill screamed to himself as he tried not to panic. He couldn't escape, the fat girl was blocking the door, and it was clear that his mom wasn't going to save him...save her or whatever this time. He had to think of something, and fast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Bill decides to fake it to make it, telling Paige a lie and putting on the best act he can to get through the evening with raising more suspicion. Later that night, while trying to find out more information about 'Willow', Bill tries to contact Eve on Facebook about the Stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Bill...Tells the truth? Or at least a version of it. Hedging his bets on being able to get out of the situation, Bill tells Paige everything about the Stone, promising that if she helps him get it back from Eve and back to normal, she can have a wish!</span></div></div>",

Downstairs, the sounds of Martha washing some dishes could be heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Think think think think</i> thought Bill as he realized that Paige had some crazy spidey sense and had somehow caught on to the fact that he wasn\u2019t Willow! Worse, she wasn\u2019t going to let it go until he admitted who he really was! <i>This is bad, this is really, really bad. Thanks so much for this shitty new reality we\u2019re stuck in, Eve.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige strained the muscles in her neck as she gazed into her gangly friend\u2019s endlessly expressive blue-green eyes, the worried girl searching for something,<i> anything</i> to latch onto so she could dismiss her suspicions. But all she saw in Willow\u2019s eyes was fear, and not the dewy-eyed sort of fear that Willow had when she saw a spider krumping around her ceiling. It was kind of fear of someone who was lost in a foreign country at 2:00 A.M.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWillow, you\u2019re scaring me! Why are you acting like you don\u2019t know me?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, Paige. I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes you do! You know and I know that you\u2019re not acting like yourself. Just tell me what happened at school, OK? Tell me what happened with the cheerleaders\u201d Paige begged weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Not acting like yourself...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill grew silent once again, though only for a moment. He found a way out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige watched as Willow\u2019s facial expression gradually started to change quality from bewilderment and disgust into something more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow began to well up. Tears fell below her glasses and trailed down her soft cheeks, a look of childlike sadness developing across her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHOSE BITCHES!\u201d Willow sobbed, grabbing Paige and hugging her tightly. Paige, having no choice, squeezed her tightly in return. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHEY WERE ALL SO MEAN TO ME! THEY...THEY WERE LAUGHING THE SECOND I WENT INSIDE THE GYM! THEY W-WERE MAKING FUN OF ME RIGHT TO MY FACE! THEY C-CALLED ME A LESBIAN NERD, AND I-I-I-I...\u201d Willow began to stutter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Paige felt Willow's body tremble with spasms of histrionic sadness, a part of her felt relaxed once more. This was the friend that she knew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs...is that why you were acting so weird since you got home? You were holding it all in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. I d-didn\u2019t want t-to melt down i-in front my parents. They woul-wouldn\u2019t understand my pain like y-you do!\u201d Willow stuttered through pathetic wheezing gasps, her nose filled with snot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's OK, Willow. You're back home now. You're safe again with your family\u201d consoled Paige, calmly guiding her sheltered friend to her bed and sitting her down upon an ocean of pink. Willow was still shaking, so the heavyset girl grabbed her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're going to be OK. You\u2019re not the problem, Wills. They are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBUT WHY WERE THEY MAKING FUN OF ME?! I NEVER DID ANYTHING TO THEM!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige breathed slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome people are just mean. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re nice to them or not, they\u2019re still going to treat you like shit one way or the other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow buried her face in her palms and cried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I see them laughing and getting along with each other. There must be something wrong with me!\u201d Willow sniffled. \u201cIf they hate me so much, there must have been something I did to deserve it! Some flaw that I can\u2019t see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow began to adjust her glasses, as if she were subconsciously ashamed of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, I never hurt anybody! People aren\u2019t despised for no reason, or at least they shouldn\u2019t be!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige sometimes wished that she didn\u2019t have to walk around Willow\u2019s pollyanna view towards life. She had accepted long ago that she was a nerd and was always going to be at the bottom of the social hierarchy, until high school ended anyway, and she was cool with that. Why couldn\u2019t Willow? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs close the two were, Paige grew frustrated that she could never be completely straight with her childlike friend. She could never speak the honest truth and break Willow\u2019s heart that life wasn\u2019t like a Disney movie.  In real life, Cinderella never meets Prince Charming, she remains unloved and abused forever.  In real life, Snow White is never broken from the witch\u2019s spell, she dies in the forest alone and forgotten. In real life, Simba never gets to overthrow Scar and avenge his father. At best he gets to remain in exile with Timon and Pumbaa, which honestly didn\u2019t sound so bad to Paige. In real life, Elsa gets murdered by Prince Hans before she even gets a chance to rescue Anna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife was hard and cruel, which was why an innocent like Willow needed to be protected from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me, can any of them illustrate half as good as you?\u201d Paige asked, trying to distract Willow\u2019s mind from her pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow, whose tear soaked face slowly lifted away from her hands, gazed with a doe-eyed expression at Paige and shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u201d she squeaked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid any of them learn Korean over the course of a four days just so they could talk to that foreign exchange student?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cno\u201d she said so quietly that Paige had barely even heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre any of them as good at Fortnite as you are?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP-probably not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre any of them as kindhearted as you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEve, maybe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEve's a bitch just like the rest of them, she just hides it better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't think that's really true.

Mousily, she nodded her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess y-you\u2019re right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She hadn\u2019t been eavesdropping on the conversation the two had been having upstairs, but judging by the redness around Willow\u2019s eyes, her guess that Willow had needed to cry in private away from Mom and Dad turned out to be right on the money. Martha wondered casually if she should do something for Willow something to get her mind off of being rejected, maybe treat her to some new earrings or perhaps some bubble tea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a giggle, Willow and Paige pulled up some chairs and sat around the large dinner table, along with Greg and Kimmy who were already present. Greg, having little enough in common with Willow\u2019s pudgy friend to chit chat with her, was instead watching an episode of The Joe Rogan Experience on his iPad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFeeling better, honey?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMuch\u201d said Willow, casually wiping away a stray tear with a red sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s so nice of you to join us tonight, Paige\u201d beamed Martha. \u201cI had a feeling you were going to stop by, so I made extra meatloaf just in case. You know how much we all love having you over for dinner, dear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m honored, Mrs. Strasserman. You know how many times my dad and I have let Willow stay overnight at our place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou never let <i>my</i> friends stay over late!\u201d whined Kimmy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s because your friends are always knocking shit over and giving everyone a headache.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige's eyes widened at the profanity. Willow almost NEVER swore outside of when the two girls were alone in private, and even then Willow often treated it like some grand sin or something and typically only did it when she was extremely upset about something, as she just had been. Paige saw Willow's mom stiffen for a moment as well, almost as if the older woman fought the urge to chastise her daughter for the crude language, but simply went on with bringing the family's dinner over to the table. Paige frowned for a moment before writing it off as just another stress-related fluke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up, Willow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, <i>you</i> shut up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNerd! I would have made the cheerleading team no sweat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey don\u2019t accept little twerps like you on the team either!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreg, tell the girls to stop fighting\u201d asked Martha as she turned around to open the oven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWillow, Kimmy, knock it off\u201d answered Greg, half not paying attention, half smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, if Dad gets to play with his toys at the dinner table, I do too!\u201d whined Kimmy again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the room including Paige gave Kimberly a soft, patronizing chuckle. When she realized that she wasn\u2019t being listened to, Kimmy pouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, Kimmy\u2019s right\u201d announced Martha as she laid her culinary work of art in the middle of the table. \u201cGreg, remember when we promised each other that we\u2019d spend at least an hour a day as a family without any distractions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmaybe? I thought that just meant the kids couldn\u2019t play with their phones at the table.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, it counts for you too, sweetie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I\u2019m the breadwinner of this house!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd <i>I</i> run the house. I\u2019m the Executive Branch and you\u2019re just the Treasurer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg pouted just as Kimberly had and wordlessly turned off the device. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow go put that thing in the living room like a good boy\u201d teased Martha in a half mocking tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Greg sheepishly did as his wife told him to, Paige grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see who wears the pants in this family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe both wear the pants\u201d Martha said as she began to fill everyone\u2019s plate. \u201cHe just knows that life is easier if he lets me get my way. That\u2019s what every husband learns eventually.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere, Willow made a whipping sound, the spontaneity of it causing Kimmy to giggle and Paige to give a witch like cackle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>wuh-PSSSH</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n Paige then made similar sound, making a pantomime of holding a whip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>wuh-PSSSH</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you can\u2019t whip me, I\u2019m the whipmaster! I whip you!\u201d Willow yelled out. <i>wuh-PSSSH</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhip this!\u201d Paige countered. <i>wuh-PSSSH</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuck my whip!\u201d Willow snapped. <i>wuh-PSSSH</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe double entendre briefly threw Paige off since it was out of character for Willow to make dirty jokes, but she was having too much fun and let it go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued to goof off pretending to whip each other until Greg reentered the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>wuh-PSSSH<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwuh-PSSSH<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwuh-PSSSH</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s all this hissing about? Did I just enter a rattlesnake convention?\u201d he asked deadpan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA geek convention\u201d Kimmy moaned. \u201cAnd you just won first prize with your dad joke.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShush, Kimberly. It\u2019s your turn to say grace\u201d gently scolded Martha as she and Greg joined their children at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before Kimmy starts\" interrupted Greg, \"in my ongoing quest to be the whitest man in America, I need to remind you four that the actual sound of a horsewhip is <i>WHOOPAH</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha gave a small knowing smile at her husband's reference. Willow, Paige, and Kimmy stared blankly at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chandler Bing? From Friends? None of you ever saw that episode?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore blank stares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it was before your time, you philistines\" moaned Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not everyone is ancient like you, Mr. Strasserman\" joked Paige.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, that's enough, honey. Kimberly?\" insisted Martha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimmy went through the motions during the incantation, not truly understanding why a prayer was necessary before dinner. Willow similarly was paying lip service, not being very religious or pious herself, but going along with it to please her mother\u2019s sense of tradition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Kimmy was finished, the four Strasserman\u2019s and their guest dug in and enjoyed themselves immensely, all of them living up to the mantra to eat, drink, and be merry. The drama surrounding Willow\u2019s rejection was all but forgotten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\n11:00 P.M <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill laid under a sickeningly girly bedspread, trying to relax after the rather stressful day he'd been through, his new bedroom lit by the warm light of the lamp on his bedside table. Unlike most nights where he often went to sleep in just his boxers, tonight he was fully adorned in Willow's cute pink pajamas with little Pokemon slippers stitched into the pants. A portion of his male pride was mortified at the choice of sleepwear, but he had to admit that the PJs <i>were</i> really comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also wasn't used to the army of stuffed animals strewn across the floor and the bodyguard cabal of Barbie dolls watching over him the shelf, but then again, what was the functional difference between any of them and his collection of Funko Pops down in the basement? Were they still even down there in this reality? Bill hadn't had a chance to explore the rest of the house, after dinner and finishing out the rest of 'family time' (something the Strasserman family hadn't done in the previous version of reality) it had been time for Paige to go home and for the whole family to retire to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise, he was barely even fazed by the physical changes like the pair of modest breasts he now owned, the void between his legs, and the nearsightedness. They were all quite strange and alien compared to his normal body, sure, but for some odd reason he had just rolled with it. Maybe years of consuming video games and comic books had desensitized him to weirdness. Or maybe he was naturally levelheaded. Who knows? Didn\u2019t really matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So this is who I would have been if I had been born a girl</i> Bill thought. <i>It\u2019s not too different. Mom and Dad and Kimmy are pretty much the same. Willow is so innocent though, so much more than I am. Is it because Mom and Dad sheltered her more? Is it because she's two years younger than me? Did getting bullied all the time toughen me up unlike Willow who wasn't? </i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bill shifted his thoughts into more concrete matters. He was feeling pretty proud of himself for managing to fool his family and Paige as well as he had tonight. From what he could tell, nobody aside from Paige suspected that he wasn\u2019t really who they thought he was, and even Paige seemed to buy into that crocodile tears scared little girl act eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeception was a talent that Bill didn't really like to talk about. It was something that he didn't even like to admit to himself, but the truth was that he was good at it. He was good at lying to people, good at spinning webs of bullshit to his advantage, and good at using guile and chicanery to escape seemingly insurmountable situations like this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know where he had gotten it from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it had developed naturally with him having to always keep one step ahead of bullies like Rob and Big Jon. He couldn't fight them with his muscles, so he had to outwit them instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, it came before that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis grandfather Earl liked to call Bill \u201cThe Flim Flam Man\u201d when he was a little kid, after an old George C Scott movie. It was meant as an endearing joke at a time when Bill was obsessed with learning about magic and card tricks, often performing shows in front of his family. He had really taken to it for it a while, believing that it was going to be his passion in life. Then at some point after Kimmy was born, he grew more interested in other things, and dreams of being the next Houdini were dashed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, that was it. Being a magician and being a liar was a fine line. One was just socially acceptable and the other wasn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hey, maybe that's why Gloria and I hate each other so much. She's a bullshitter just like me. We know how the other one thinks.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill wasn't 100% confident in this line of reasoning. Maybe he had a dark side that he wasn\u2019t willing to face, but it would have to do for now, as he just heard his mother switch off the light to the upstairs hallway, meaning that she was about to turn in for the night. The Strasserman home was effectively closed for business. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lights out, girls!\" Bill heard his mom call from the end of the hall. He expected the door to his parent's bedroom to close, but there was simply a long pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring his mother was waiting on him specifically (most sound from Kimmy's bedroom had ceased a few minutes ago, the younger girl most likely having already fallen asleep), Bill rolled over and ignored the feeling of his boobs shifting and squishing together as he clicked the bedside lamp off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight girls, love you!\" His mother called once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Night mom\" Bill replied in his girly voice, and there was only silence from Kimmy, confirming his suspicion that she'd already gone to sleep. He listened as the door to his parent's room creaked closed with a click, and the muffled shuffling as his mother moved about the master bedroom, no doubt preparing herself for bed, the nightly ritual of putting her daughters to bed now complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was another strange change. In his original reality, Bill wasn't expected to adhere to a curfew so long as he was quiet. Kimberly yes, because she was only twelve, but not Bill. Again he had to wonder if it was another factor towards Willow being so exceedingly sheltered in this new life he found himself in. Was being born a girl and a couple of years later than he'd originally been contributed THAT much of a difference? Were his parents simply babying Willow this late into her teens or was this girl he'd been tossed into the life of simply THAT immature?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, now that he was left entirely alone, it was time to get some answers. Quickly and quietly, Bill scurried from bed and unplugged Willow's phone from the corner wall where it was charging and turned it on. Like a lone candle, it lit up the dark room. Bill smiled a braces clad grin as the app for Google Chrome launched, and after he returned to bed, for the next couple of hours, the boy turned girl searched through his current identity\u2019s digital footprint. It never hurt to be informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first link he found in Willow\u2019s search history was to her DeviantArt profile, which contained a motherload of anime inspired artwork dating back nearly four years. Even though Bill wasn\u2019t really into anime very much, he had watched enough of it to recognize that Willow was talented at imitating the art style of different manga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis confirmed some of the conversation threads that he read earlier about Willow blabbing to Paige about how she was aiming at going to art school after she graduated, dead set on being an animator and cartoonist. From this gallery, she could definitely get work. Bill had no clue what he wanted to do after he left high school. He had no overwhelming passions other than steering clear of Big Jon and maybe getting laid, so for all of her quirks, Willow had one thing going for her that he didn\u2019t. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Good for her\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, Willow had a Tumblr account where she also posted her work, and likewise geeked out about her various obsessions. She seemed to have a crush on a new different hunky celebrity practically every week, and interestingly enough, a couple of girl-crushes as well! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill also combed through Willow\u2019s accounts on Fanfiction.net, Amino Apps, Archive Of Our Own, Twitter, Reddit, and various forums, where it was more than obvious, if it wasn\u2019t already, that she was a dyed in the wool nerd and was proud of that fact. Again, not that different from Bill, just more girlish and with slightly different interests. She was even part of Shermer High's 'tutoring' forum, designed for the students that couldn't make it in person. She wasn't a moderator, though not for lack of trying, her private message inbox was full of repeated requests to be made a mod but always shot down because she wasn't school staff or part of the actual tutor program the school ran. And it seemed, as Bill read through more and more messages, the admin (Mr. Laurell, head of the computer lab) was very kindly trying to let Willow know that she simply was too nice to do what needed to be done as a moderator. But it seemed like that part had gone over Willow's head. But as for the forum itself, most of the school students that were registered to the forum seemed like they were taking advantage of his feminine self's kindness and generosity (and most not even bothering to say thanks when Willow practically did the assignment for them).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless though, it was something that Bill never would have done given that he simply didn't like people enough to offer his help. Hell, he had rarely helped Tom! A strange shiver of...something shot through BIll's girly body when he thought of his former friend, who now barely even knew that Willow even existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That was weird' Bill muttered as he went back to scoping out Willow's online life. All in all, Willow was more or less the same person online that she was with everyone else. Too nice, a little naive, and either blocked or deleted comments where she had the power to do so, or ran from any arguments. Bill himself wasn't one to spend hours arguing online, but seeing this alternate version of himself running from confrontations Willow could clearly win with her superior geek knowledge if she was just a little more assertive was certainly disappointing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill rolled his new eyes and continued catching himself up on a life in progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a little after one in the morning when Bill received a private message from Facebook Messenger. There was an icon of Eve Kazinski pop up in the middle of the screen. Curiously, he clicked on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Sent from Eve, 1:05 A.M: Hi Willow! Sorry, it took me like six hours to figure out how this dang thing works. Did I forget to mention to you that I\u2019m really old? Like, old enough to have seen the first episode of SNL live on television old! Anyway, after I logged into Facebook, I searched for you but forgot your last name! I had to like go through fifty other girls named Willow before I finally figured out that you\u2019re the girl with the photo of you kissing that cartoon kid with the fancy watch. Anyway...</b> </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From here Eugene could see that this Willow girl was clearly younger than her despite her height. She must have been a Sophmore, maybe a Junior, it was hard to tell because of how tall she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad I found you, Eve! You've got to help me, I'm ready to try out for the squad, just like you said I could!\" Willow said, giving Eugene a small nervous smile, revealing a set of braces strapped around her teeth. \"I even got a uniform to put on so it'd look like the real thing!\" Willow unfolded the wad of cloth tucked under her left arm to show what was clearly an older version of Shermer High's cheerleading uniform, spreading it as best as she could to show it to Eugene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Um...Wow that's, that's really...nice, Willow?\" Eugene said, hoping it sounded like he knew what the girl was talking about. He cast a look backwards to see a crowd forming at the locker room door as the rest of the cheerleading team, including Gloria, Joanna and Emily had all lined up to see their interaction, looks flickering from confusion, disapproval and clear mean spirited grins as they watched their team captain talking to a girl that was clearly in the wrong place. He looked back to Willow, the curly haired stick staring at him intently with an excited look on her face, expecting him to say something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks! It was my mom's! She pulled it out of storage for me, she was so excited when I told her you'd let me try out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>In reality, Willow had been Bill, finally reaching the high school on his mad dash from McFly's, suspecting Even of somehow getting the magical gemstone that had destroyed his bully Big Jon and turned him into his gorgeous and loving girlfriend Joanna. But the moment he had reached the auditorium, where he knew that Eve would be, Eugene made his wish that had twisted reality once again, this time twisting Bill along with it. Gone was the clever geek boy with the impossibly hot girlfriend, now there was only Willow Strasserman, who spent the days daydreaming of being an artist, drawing, painting and hanging out with her best friend Paige Walters. And constantly fending off Matt Harris, the boy that fancied himself Willow's true love and soul mate with constant creepy flirting and altering his class schedule so that he could be around her all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least there's a boy chasing you, even if he is a creep\" Paige had said one day while they sat in Willow's bedroom dreaming about hot boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but why can't it be a nice boy? Like Tom Ackerton? I'd give anything to be his girlfriend! His girlfriend doesn't even like him with all those terrible rumors she always spreads about him!\" Willow had said as she idly drew another silly anime picture to toss up on her DeviantArt gallery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's so out of your league. You'd have to be a cheerleader or something to be with him\" Paige had said while doodling something of her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when the idea had hit Willow. The next day during the study hall she had shared with Eve, she had gotten up her courage and asked the high school superstar if she could come try out for the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy the Ahn'Ger Stone had changed Bill, it was impossible to say. Perhaps it was part out of malice, ruining its previous owner's happy ending for somehow getting exactly what he wanted with a single wish, perhaps it was defending it's choice of a new owner from the only other being that knew of it's existence. Whatever the reason, Bill had been replaced and now there was only Willow Strasserman, ready to try out for the team.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now she was here, the slightly naieve sixteen year old taking the token friendly gesture from Shermer High's most popular student as a legitimate offer to become a cheerleader. And now Eugene was paying for it, another consequence of his original wish and being transplanted into a life in progress (even if said life was, in whatever counted as reality, barely two hours old).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Well you're kind of, um, late?\" Eugene fumbled, unsure of what to do and cursing having ever found the magical rock, \"We just ended practice, maybe come back tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow's small smile turned into a frown. \"But there's a game tomorrow, you guys are going all the way to Highland Meadows, how am I supposed to tryout then? Do...were you just being mean when you said I could join?\" Willow's eyes began to get watery behind the glasses she wore as the thoughts of being betrayed by the nicest, purest girl in the school turning out to be just like all the other mean girls that picked on Willow, Paige and all the other girls not fortunate enough to be hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene's green eyes went wide as Willow let out a sniffle. \"Oh! No don'-don't cry okay? We're just all tired and were leaving but, uh, just let me go talk to the guys. Girls. Let me go talk to the girls first okay? Wait right here!\" He said as fast as he could, a hand reaching out to softly touch one of Willow's skinny arms as if operating on it's own. The former janitor turned with a swish of his cheerleading skirt and made his way as quick as possible towards the blonde goddess that was Joanna Ingerman, standing in front of the entire whispering throng that was the Shermer High cheer team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does Asserman want, Eve?\" Joanna siad as Eugene approached, giving a small glare towards the nerdy girl that was trying to regain her composure on the other side of the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She..she just wants to try out for the team? I guess I, uh, said she could?\" Eugene said as he grasped at what little information he had in this insane adventure/nightmare he was on. \"I thought that I should, um, check with you first? Since we're...um...co-captains and all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoanna frowned and rubbed the bridge of her nose. \"Eve, we talked about this. You can't keep saying 'sure come try out' to every girl who asks! I know you're just being nice and it's sweet of you, but it just a waste of time when we have to sit here and watch another Sally Know-Nothing hop around embarassing herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I agree with Eve. Let's let Willow try out!\" Gloria said as she pushed her way through the collected girls, her thick black hair like a shark fin sliding through a most blonde and brown sea until she was standing next to Joanna with a cruel smile on her face, \"After all, we can't let our precious Evelyn break a promise now, can we? We let Emily on when she asked, after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up, Gloria!\" Eugene heard Emily's voice say as the girl that was apparently Eugene's best friend. The smaller girl split from the sea of white and yellow uniforms and pulled Eugene towards the empty bleachers while Eugene watched Gloria and Joanna share a look, almost as if the two of them were actually silently agreeing on something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made part of Eugene's mind blare out a wordless alarm that told him nothing other than it meant nothing good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not really going to let her try out, are you?\" Emily said as the two of them reached the bleachers, standing in front of the considerably smaller pile of duffel bags. \"We both know that poor girl is about to make a fool out of herself, and you know Gloria hate her. She'll probably take a video of Willow flailing around and blast it all over social media! And with how sensitive Willow is, who knows what it'll do to her! I know that you just want to be everyone's best friend, Eve, but the best thing for you to do, the right thing for you to do, is tell Willow to go home\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...she's crying! I...I don't know what to do!\" Eugene said as he started to feel entirely overwhelmed again. Didn't he JUST leave a situation like this? Only now he wasn't the one everyone was going to be laughing at. He cast a sideways glance at the pink duffel bag that had 'EVE' on the front. If he could just get to the magical Stone, maybe he could make fix it with a wish?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, like that has worked so far' Came a tiny voice in his brain that Eugene barely heard. He needed to find a way out of this nightmare, where everything he seemed to do only made things worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" Emily said, an evil thought entering her mind. What Gloria had said had been true, Emily was only on the team because of Eve. She wasn't as gorgeous as Eve, Joanna, Gloria, Vanessa or many of the girls and her own cheer skills were just good enough to keep her from the chopping block, but just barely. Maybe...Maybe if Willow did get on she wouldn't be the bottom rung anymore? And maybe get some respect from the other girls while they all took to giving Willow a hard time...And what would a little white lie do? Eve wouldn't even care so long as Emily played it right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you don't want to deal with her crying...Maybe she'll surprise us? I know her little sister Kim or whatever wants to be a cheerleader in a couple years, I'm pretty sure I've seen them at the park practicing a couple of times. Maybe she should try out! But whatever you do, I'll support it, girl!\" Emily said after a few moments of watching Eve look back and forth between Willow and the rest of the group. And it was sort of nice, in a jealous sort of way, to watch her best friend, who Emily loved like a sister, start crumbling under pressure. It was a nice change of pace from the usual perfection Eve brought to, well, everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene looked back to here and the waiting faces of the rest of the Shermer High cheerleading squad, to Joanna's look of disapproval to Gloria's impish grin. He was unfortunately being pushed towards making a decision that was going to end in disaster, and he had to make it soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Eugene does the right thing, going back and telling Willow she can't try out. Willow is understandably devastated and leaves in tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Eugene crumples under pressure and tells Willow she can try out, much to the younger girl's glee. It goes about as well as expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Eugene decides that enough is enough and grabs his duffel bag, searching for the Stone and a way out of this high school drama nightmare.</span></div></div>",

Well, more so than the weight that was already present, thanks to the sizable mounds of flesh hanging off his torso, but a weight nonetheless. Why was it that the magical gemstone had put him into a horrible situation again? Wasn't being humiliated at the play enough? And even if being a cheerleader was a little better, if he had to be stuck as a girl every time he made a wish, why did it have to drop this kind of a dilemma into his lap?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why me? Why am I the one that has to make the decision?\" Eugene whispered to Emily as he stared back and forth at the increasingly agitated group of cheerleaders and a fidgeting Willow. His changed eyes once again locked on the conversation that Joanna and Gloria were having and again the silent alarm went off in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're Eve Kazinski! Even if Joanna wants to be the sole captain of the team, she knows she can't do it without you. It's because you're nice to everyone, Eve, everyone looks up to you, even Amazons like Ingerman! Plus this is, like, sort of your fault. You did tell Willow she could try out. You've got to make a choice, girlfriend. Either tell Willow to leave and hurt her feelings, or we watch her probably make a fool out of herself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I didn't! I don't remember doing any of that!\" Eugene protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you did! I was right there sitting next to you! We were working on our Algebra when she came up and asked!\" Emily said as her patience began to wear thin. She knew that Eve sometimes had the habit of retreating into her own superstar status when pressed with a uncomfortable decision, but this was absolutely ridiculous. \"Listen, if you want to sit there and claim amnesia or whatever, then fine, but this really makes you look bad, Eve. It proves that Gloria is right, that you really think your are 'Little Miss Perfect' and can't handle it when things do go your way. It's gonna make you look bad\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere it was again. Those three words that instantly made Eugene's mind flip from nervous indecision to indignant anger. He wasn't even sure why they made him so angry, but somehow he found himself in the exact same situation he thought he'd escaped from! He curled a tiny fist and felt the carefully cared for nails bite into the soft flesh of his tiny palm. He'd been thinking about revealing everything to Emily, the weird magic gemstone, the fact that they'd been trying out for a play before wishing he was here, even the fact that he'd been a guy old enough to be Emily's father just a couple of hours ago! But those words, those spiteful words made something click in his brain again and made the ball of stress in his stomach melt into a lake of anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, Emily? Maybe I'm not! Maybe I'm not even supposed to be here! Be this! I never wanted it, but I keep getting stuck in some terrible situation or another and YOU keep weaseling your way in and making things WORSE! You're supposed to be a friend to...to this girl that I am but you're not!\" Eugene hissed, pointing a finger into Emily's face, which quickly shifted from annoyed to shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\" The other girl stammered, taking a step back as a flurry of uninteligible murmurs came from the nearby cheerleaders who had been watching the exchange like hawks. \"Eve you're...you're not making any sense!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I SAID YOU'RE NOT MY FRIEND AND NEVER WERE!\" Eugene screamed at the top of his girlish voice, shoving Emily backwards with a snarl, watching the girl flop over backwards onto the gym floor, looking up at him with watery eyes. Eugene heard someone bark a reprimand from the direction of the cheerleaders but he didn't care. He got out of this situation once, he'd get out of it again. Nothing really mattered, not when he had a magical artifact that granted wishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if I always have to be a girl, I'll figure the damn thing out\" Eugene said to no one but himself as he turned and climbed up onto the bleachers, heading for the duffle bag that had 'his' name on it. He heard Emily mutter a half-sobbing \"What?\" from behind him and heard Joanna say his 'name' loudly, but he didn't care anymore. He reached the duffel bag and angrily unzipped it, the contents without bathed in the overhead lights of the Shermer High gymnasium. Eugene dug his hands into the bag, tossing out the previously perfectly folded stack of clothes and grabbing hold of the small purse within as he searched for the Stone. He heard his name shouted again by Joanna, now much closer but once again he didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is it!?\" Eugene hissed as he dug through the bad and purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Eugene finds the Ahn'Ger Stone in 'his' purse. Grabbing it, Eugene makes a wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Eugene can't find the Stone! It's not in the bag, in his purse or the pile of clothes! Eugene was trapped!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a moment of panic when he couldn't find the gemstone in the canvas bag, Eugene ripped open the tiny leather satchel that he was clearly expected to wear as Eve. In it was a collection of make up kits, car keys, a wallet that had thirty dollars of cash and change in it and his driver's license (it looked practically like a professional photo instead of the typical mugshot drivers licenses were doomed to be).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it has to be here!\" Eugene said, not caring about the fact that the entire cheerleading team was converging behind Joanna Ingerman, who was pulling Emily off of the gym floor and glaring at his back. The last thing he needed was to be stuck as Eve is this extremely awkward mess he'd made of everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow, on the other head, had shrunk back to the gym's lobby and was watching fearfully through one of the door windows, terrified that in a moment all of the popular girls were suddenly going to chase after her and blamed her for...whatever was happening on the other side of the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand Emily, poor Emily, was suddenly regretting having allowed herself to make the petty little comment. She knew how Eve felt about being called that, but she'd never expected to be shoved to the floor, and much less have her best friend since Kindergarten destroy their friendship. That was what hurt the most as tears began to pour freely out of Emily's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHA!\" Eugene shouted in victory as he finally, thankfully, found the emerald gemstone buried at the bottom of the purse, almost as if it was purposefully trying to hide. Almost as if it was trying to escape, the sharp point of the gem had sliced open the side of the purse and was buried halfway inside of the lining before Eugene had spotted it and plucked it out with his small fingers. The moment he touched the Ahn'Ger Stone it flared to life with sickly green-gold light as he pulled it out and raised it over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve, what the hell are you doing!?\" Joanna Ingerman shouted at her co-captain. She was concerned by the sudden erratic behavior of the otherwise extremely nice and pleasant Eve Kazinski, but already her mind was turning. Eve had attacked another cheerleader, and that was possibly enough to damage the redhead's reputation, maybe even get her kicked off the team and let Joanna be the full captain once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Eugene cared about any of the unknown plotting the big-breasted blonde was doing. All he could focus on was that he'd found his ticket out of here. He turned and faced the collected cheerleaders, including Emily who was silently crying, the light glimmering off the wet streaks on her round face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.\"Heh, I'm not Eve fucking Kazinski, you bimbo! And it doesn't matter either because I am done with this! I wish that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: \"I didn't have to deal with this high school drama anymore!\" The gemstone flashes to life as it grants the wish, and as the world forms around Eugene once more, he finds to his disappointment that he's still Eve...But where was he now? It still looked like a school of some sort...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: \"I was back to my old self!\" In a flash the gemstone grants the wish. As the world reforms around him, Eugene finds that he's still Eve but now much older!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eugene lifted the magic hunk of green malachite high above his head, the mystical gemstone immediately flaring to life in his clasped hands. Joanna Bolstrum gasped in astonishment at the dramatic sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not Eve fucking Kazinski, you bimbo!\" spat out the former male custodian of Shermer High. \"My name is Eugene, I'm fifty five years old, and I'm not this teenage girl you all think I am! I'm a grown man, and I'm sick and tired of putting up with you awful <b>bitches</b>!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other cheerleaders on the team, who had been busy gossiping amongst themselves, all began to pay attention to their angry captain, who seemed to be undergoing a mental breakdown of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve, what's gotten into you!?\" yelled Joanna. \"Are you fucking insane?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is Eve doing this!?\" asked Emily McLeod through a shaky, quivering voice, still in shocked confusion over her best friend's sudden betrayal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. <b>YOU'RE</b> insane, Ingerman! This whole entire school is insane!\" screeched Eugene, upsetting Emily even further, fresh tears running down her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess the pressure has finally gotten to Little Miss Perfect\" snapped Gloria, which only earned a mean glare from the betrayed friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark haired beauty was secretly very surprised by Eve's erratic behavior. She had viewed Eve as the most calm and composed person ever. Eve was practically a saint, never holding a grudge against anybody and having even managed to talk down Rob Bolstrum of all people from harassing a poor freshman boy earlier in the year. She was as close to being universally beloved as a person could be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Gloria was being honest with herself, she had been more than a little bit jealous at the redhead's seemingly flawless existence. Gloria knew that she could be a huge cunt sometimes. She felt that she had the right to be, as she didn't have the best life at home with her mother. At best, Ariadne Vanapoulous could be described as cold and calculating, raising Gloria almost at arm's length. On the other hand, Gloria had seen Eve and her own parents together at various football games, and they were <i>always</i> affectionate and visibly very proud of their daughter. It just wasn't fair! But if Eve had truly finally lost it, maybe her seemingly immaculate life wasn't so immaculate after all? Gloria would feel a little bit better about herself if that was the case, knowing that she wasn't suffering alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Eugene continued to rant and rave about how much he hated the spoiled brats of this school, how sadistic and cruel they could be, how they were the definition of privileged, that while they moaned and groaned about their petty first world problems, there were people out there who were homeless, or didn't have safe drinking water, or didn't have access to proper health care, or were discriminated against for being different. All of Eugene's anxieties and insecurities about his bad luck in life came pouring out in an explosion of Jacobin resentment and righteous anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoanna stared at her now former co-captain with rolling impatient eyes, hiding the fact that she was secretly enjoying this. There was no way in hell that Eve was surviving this little outburst of hers, especially after assaulting another student. Knowing that she could use this bizarre scene as an excuse to knock her main competition down a few pegs, the buxom blonde could afford to put up with a few sexist comments about her appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the blonde rich girl was still rather puzzled. What exactly was causing Eve to act this way <i>now</i>? Sure, Eve was into that whole social justice scene and tried to use her popularity to help others, so some of her ranting made sense from that point of view, but why was she acting like she wasn't part of the popular crowd herself? Eve had always seemed to enjoy her charmed life, and had always gotten along with her fellow cheerleaders and upperclassmen even if she was also generous enough to speak to losers like Paige Walters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was completely out of character for the crimson haired cutie to make enemies so brazenly like the way she was doing now. And what the hell was that part about being a man named Eugene about? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe Eve is using drugs now?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK honey, this isn't the drama club!\" Joanna shouted patronizingly from the bottom of the bleachers, clapping at Eve as if she were a disobedient dog. \"I'm impressed by your little Che Guevara/Howard Beale act, but it's getting a little old right now! So how about you just come down now, stop acting silly, and apologize to Emily?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, poor Willow Strasserman watched Eve's breakdown unfold behind closed doors, a lump forming in her throat. What the hell was going on? The geeky aspiring artist had no idea, but she worried that it was she who had inspired all this chaos, all this fighting and yelling, which made Willow's anxiety flare up. She could hear her heartbeat raise a tick, her breath starting to become rapid and shallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe the other girls didn't want me to join, and Eve is sticking up for me!?</i> thought Willow to herself, hoping against hope that was the case, and as she repeated that positive affirmation to herself like a mantra, her phone pinged with a text message from Paige. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not apologizing to anybody! I'm sick of all of you! I deserve better than this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow him, the two dozen cheerleaders all looked at the formerly inspirational leader with a mix of confusion and...pity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene's \"coming out\" speech had sounded far less intimidating than he had meant it to be, as the words were coming out of Eve's mouth instead of his own. Instead of a booming, authoritative voice of righteous indignation, like something out of Braveheart, Eve's voice was shrill and hysterical, and, admittedly, rather crazy sounding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought back to earlier today, and that angry, desperate wish he had made. He had wished for a better life than the one he had as Eugene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gemstone that had held high above his head, like King Arthur or Conan the Barbarian lifting some huge sword as they prepared to vanquish an enemy, had indeed given him a better life. But it was better in the way a gilded cage was better. Eugene could never live like this. He simply wasn't a teenage girl, and he found the culture Eve lived in to be absolutely unbearable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw Joanna's austere expression, almost dating her to make a move. Her smug, fake, bitchy little smirk had given Eugene the push to finally make the wish that he needed to make. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I was back to my own self!!!\" he screamed as loudly as he could in Eve's light soprano voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike that, the Ahn'Ger Stone erupted into a green fire, consuming everything in sight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the mysterious green light vanished, Eugene saw that he was now...exactly where he was before. He was still in the Shermer High Gym, staring down Joanna Ingerman and the two dozen other cheerleaders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!\" Eugene screeched. \"Did I fail again?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at his body, and got his answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" he shouted. \"Oh no, oh no, oh no!\" repeated the janitor, in a voice he still recognized as not his own, and still recognizably feminine, albeit huskier.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still a girl. No. He was a woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still clad in Eve's cheerleading uniform, but it was now much too small for him, for his body had grown up. Big time. His top was pressed tightly against his now far larger chest, and his skirt was threatening to burst under the pressure of his now child bearing hips and thicker thighs. His pretty legs now bore the telltale signs of varicose veins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene looked down once more at the gaggle of cheerleaders. Every single one, Joanna included, had her jaw hanging as low to the ground as their mouths would allow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did..did Eve just age forty years?\" asked one girl, Lindsey Moon, not believing her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Eve...is that you?\" asked Emily McLeod, honestly not sure if the middle aged woman standing on top of the bleachers was her once upon a time BFF. She looked almost, but not quite, like Eve's mother Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene could even make out the bugged out eyes of Willow Strasserman as she watched his transformation from behind the double doors of the gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran down the stairs of the bleachers as quickly as this new body could carry him, past the throng of teenage girls, out the double doors, and into the first bathroom he could find, which coincidentally, was the ladies room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Eugene was still trapped as Eve Kazinski, now a fifty five year old woman. Everyone still remembers the teenage Eve<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: In a panic to escape, Eugene/Eve dropped the Ahn'Ger Stone on his way out of the gym! And someone picks it up!</span></div></div>",

Are you okay!?\" Came Emily's voice, but Eugene didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead the former janitor turned popular girl turned...old staggered across the tile and into view of the mirror, where he could see his new form entirely. The first thing he noticed is that he was fat, a layer of soft flesh having encased his formerly skinny girl body. His cheeks were puffy, his lips slightly bulging and covered in lipstick that was a shade too bright, his eyes piggish as they stared, in horror, at the new predicament he was in. His hair was long but messy and graying, no longer styled in a ponytail and clearly suffering from the effects of being on the back end of middle age. His breasts we're massive but flabby, he could tell that if the now comically too small cheerleading uniform wasn't keeping them bound they'd be sagging downwards towards the paunch that was hanging beneath the yellow top. And his hips were flared outwards, connecting his swollen abdomen with the trunk like pillars of flab that were his new legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GODDAMMIT!\" Eugene croaked out in a voice that sounded nothing like he had just a minute ago, \"Why can't you just work the way I want!?\" Eugene felt the need to hurl the Stone against the nearby wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve! Please come out or let me in! You're scaring me!\" Emily's muffled voice cried out again from behind the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former janitor opened his flabby fist and stared at the gemstone laying on the layer of wrinkled fat. It was twinkling and green-gold light danced from within. It almost looked as if it was... laughing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door bucked against the trashcan can as something heavy rammed against it. And then again, and the trashcan slid sideways as the bathroom filled with cheerleaders. Eugene clenched his fist, the light becoming more intense as his entire body tensed in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve! Please, what is going on!? Why are you old now!? Why are you acting so weird!?\" Emily said, her face soaked in tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many times do I have to say it!? I'M NOT EVE!\" Eugene croaked, turning his gaze and glaring in anger at his fist, opening it and pointing a chubby finger at the glowing gemstone. \"I wish you'd help me for once!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: The Stone flashes and Eugene suddenly finds himself, still a woman, back in his old janitor uniform. The cheerleaders are now... treating him like a janitor? They don't remember young Eve at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: The Stone makes all the other girls old like him as well! As Eugene tries to get his bearings, the newly middle-aged cheerleaders begin to freak out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"How many times do I have to say it!? I'M NOT EVE!\" croaked out Eugene in his husky new voice. It was far less pleasing to the ear than the lilting, angelic voice Young Eve had possessed five minutes ago, but it was still distinctly feminine in tone, as if Eve had spent the last forty years with a smoking and drinking habit. Eugene shook his head in frustration, genuinely feeling sorrow for the poor crying girl in front of him who had no idea what the hell was going on, probably terrified at the sight of her best friend having nearly aged half a decade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaring in anger at the glowing artifact which had ruined his already paltry life, he jabbed his chubby index finger at it and demanded:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish you'd help me for once!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ahn'Ger Stone obeyed Eugene's command as it flared to life, bathing the women's bathroom in its emerald light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Eugene had stared directly into the gemstone when it activated, he had been momentarily blinded by its ethereal beauty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Kazinski?\" he heard Emily ask him as he blinked his eyes in rapid succession, gradually gaining his sight back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily, is that you? Oh no, I'm still an ugly old hag aren't I?\" he asked, disappointed to hear that he still possessed his husky feminine voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard a few titters from a few feet away. One of the cheerleaders made a rude comment, causing Emily to speak up once more, telling the mysterious voice to shut up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene grabbed a hold of the sink's counter as he as was feeling dizzy, the weight of his chubby new breasts straining against the fabric of his top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Kazinski, are you OK?\" asked Emily once again. The former janitor could hear that her tone sounded different than it had five minutes ago. Caring, but less intimate. Friendly, but somewhat distant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily, she's probably drunk\" laughed the voice of Gloria Vanapoulous. \"I've seen her carry around a flask of whisky in her little mop cart before. Just use the boy's bathroom.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" asked Emily with a lack of confidence in her voice. \"She looks like she's really upset about something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she woke up this morning, all excited to eat her three layer chocolate mousse cake all by herself, opened the refrigerator, and suddenly realized that she had eaten it the night before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, stop that! Why do you have to be such a bitch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you have to throw off my choreography during practice?\" countered Gloria spitefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two girls bickered, Eugene continued blinking, finally getting the last of the floaters out of his line of sight. He could finally see in the mirror that...that he was still female. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Damn it!</b> he mentally screamed, struggling to not have another public freak out by slamming his fist on the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still trapped as this old hag! He stared into the mirror at this woman, with her embarrassing looking jowls, her lipstick which looked just a shade too bright for her skin tone, her piggish looking green eyes, her fleshy untoned arms, her beach ball sized behind, and her large, unappealing body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few differences this time. His fading red hair was now tied back into a loose ponytail, as it had been during cheerleading practice. And he was clothed in his old work uniform!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene slowly turned away from the bathroom mirror, briefly at the accursed artifact in his hand, and then towards the entrance, where Emily McLeod and Gloria Vanapoulous were both standing. His eyes trailed down to both of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Kazinski, are you OK?\" asked Emily with concern in her voice. \"We heard you crying and screaming in here a few minutes ago. When we came to check in on you, you were staring all dead eyed at yourself. Is there something wrong?\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you keep calling me...\" Eugene began, but then stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe now realized what the gemstone had done. It had come to him all of a sudden, like an epiphany.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily didn't remember her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't remember her best friend Eve Kazinski, because this fucking stone had altered reality yet again! When he had made his last wish, he felt guilty for upsetting this girl who had no idea that Eve was an artificial construct, someone who didn't even exist a couple of hours ago. He had felt remorse for yelling at her, for pushing her, even if he felt she deserved it at the time, because she <i>just didn't know</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's why his wish changed him. Because he wanted her to forget. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene didn't know where he had gotten that from, he just knew. It was an incredibly eerie feeling.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow... apparently he was still Eve, but all grown up? Just great. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, Emily. I just had a really bad today\" answered the former Eugene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily cooed in empathy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" asked the girl, who seemed genuinely curious.  \"It must have been a really bad day for you to get all riled up like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...it's personal. Nothing to do with any of you. I'm just beat. I want to go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily smiled politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, um, in that case, would you mind leaving so I can use the bathroom? I've been holding in my pee for two hours!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... sure\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily ran inside the girl's bathroom and straight into a stall, locking it behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria stood by the doorway, a cruel smirk on her face. With a deep sigh, Eugene walked right past her into the hallway, wheeling out the mop bucket which had materialized along with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the other cheerleaders had already changed out of their uniforms and into their casual clothes. Most of them were chatting idly amongst themselves as they carried their gym bags, preparing to exit the building and into the school's parking lot for the car ride home. From the tidbits Eugene had heard, apparently the squad was going along with Shermer High's football team to Highland Meadows tomorrow for a big game. In the back of his mind, Eugene was at least grateful that he dodged that inevitable shit show. He had enough embarrassment today to last a lifetime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the windows, it looked much darker outside than it should have been. In fact, it shouldn't have been dark out at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else did that damn Twilight Zone magic rock do?\" he bitterly whispered in his softer voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever it did, Eugene didn't have time for it. His watch, which had magically reappeared on his wrist, said that it was almost 7:00 P.M. He had a bus to catch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took the elevator down to his utility closet on the ground floor. Finding a pair of keys in his now more snuggly fitting custodian uniform, he opened the closet, shoved the yellow cart back inside, grabbed his coat and the novel he was reading, as well as a worn blue purse that had materialized out of thin air. He locked the door to the closet, and ran as fast as his new girth could carry him to the bus stop in front of Shermer High.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he ran outside, he immediately felt assaulted by the rush of chilly autumn air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god, it's freezing out here!\" he complained as he jaunted the remaining fifty yards to the bus stop, his fading red pony tail flapping behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Eugene finally reached the stop, he took a deep breath, as this new body was winded, and he waited an uncomfortably long six and a half minutes for his bus to arrive under the ominous glow of an orange street lamp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce his bus finally arrived, Eugene blew a sigh of relief, just glad to finally be able to go home after the single weirdest day of his life. He hated being stuck as a woman, but he figured that he'd be able to think better and regroup after a long night's sleep. He stepped on the bus and swiped his pass, glad to hear the telltale beep from the swiper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evening, Evelyn. How was your day?\" asked Reggie the bus driver, who Eugene was friendly with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty...good. Can't complain. By the way, do you know what date it is?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's October 18th, ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene's eyes went wide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Son of a bitch</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thanks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene went to sit down. He usually sat in the front of the bus, and that's where he decided to sit tonight as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus ride home was mostly uneventful. Eugene hated the alien feeling of his new body, how soft and fleshy and...wide it was, but he tried his best to just ignore it the best he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also tried as best he could to ignore the creepy older guy who kept leering at him, licking his lips lasciviously. Eugene didn't recognize this guy, and didn't exactly feel safe around him. Thankfully, he got off five stops before Eugene's joke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene pulled the cord at his stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a good night, Evelyn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too, Reggie. Say hi to your wife for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will. Stay safe, ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene bristled at the ma'am comment, but let it go. He was home. He was finally home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though it was October instead of May, even though he was a woman instead of a man, at least his apartment building was exactly the same as he had left it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked up the short flight of stone steps, entered the building, and climbed all the way up to his inner sanctum, the place where he could finally be alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe unlocked his front door...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: \"Honey, you're home!\" exclaimed a familiar voice, that of Evelyn's long time husband Ralph, the building's superintendant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: \"Mom, you're home!\" exclaimed a pair of unfamiliar voices, Evelyn's children, as she is a single mother in this new reality. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lily Kazinski arrived home at 4:37 P.M, the tires of her bicycle screeching wildly against the cement sidewalk, the colorful array of autumn foliage adding a delightful rustling after-noise. After taking in a gulp of chill late afternoon air, Lily turned off the podcast she was listening to on her ancient hand me down iPod, pulled out her earbuds, and slipped both of them into her pants pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Lily wondered why she went through the trouble of riding her bike all the way from Camden College, which was more than an hour away from home, when she could have just waited for the bus like a sensible person would.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were two reasons. One happy, one not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe happy reason Lily took the scenic route was that it was October in Illinois, and Autumn happened to be her favorite time of the year. Falling leaves, nature hikes, apple picking, pumpkin spice lattes, carving jack o'lanterns, wearing awful sweaters...all that corny jazz spoke to her. She didn't know why it did, and as a biracial girl it made her and her friends laugh at how stereotypically white she acted sometimes, but she was a dork at heart, and had come to accept that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily didn't want to admit the truth to herself, but the second reason, the <i>real</i> reason was that she hated living at the Sunset Arms and wanted to stay away from it as often as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe venerable Shermer apartment building, which had existed since at least the 1940s, wasn't inherently terrible. Everything more or less worked inside. It was clean. It was warm. It was small, but not unbearably so. Some of the tenants were loud, or creepy, or drug addicted(Often all of the above), but they mostly left you alone if you left them alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily guiltily realized that she could be doing much worse right now. At least she had a loving family who cared about her. At least she wasn't living in Syria or South Side Chicago or the Shermer Fields trailer park, and it's not like her mother could afford anything else than this. Not on a janitor's salary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the seventeen year old couldn't deny what her gut told her, the Sunset Arms simply didn't <i>feel</i> like home. Secretly, Lily yearned for when she was five years old, when she and her brother and both of her parents were still together as a unit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had once lived in a big red house in the nice part of Shermer, with two stories, a white picket fence, a dog, and a big back yard. Back when dad wasn't a petty vindictive jerk. Back when Mom wasn't yet a depressed obese mess. It was suburban bliss. Lily still rode past it on her bike when she had the opportunity, remembering the last time she had built a snowman on the front lawn with Russell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the time before her father had finally confronted her mother's infidelity and the fallout that ensued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShivering equally from the cold and from painful memories, Lily climbed the set of stone steps that led into the Sunset Arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The new owner really needs to install a wheelchair ramp</i> the teen thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked through the tiny lobby to collect her family's mail, the yellowing tile floor as familiar to her as the back of her hand, she felt goosebumps erupt underneath her sweatshirt as the telltale voice of the superintendent barked from behind the oppressive pane of glass separating him from his tenants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey kid!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily tensed up and slowly turned around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mr. Spilotro\" she answered neutrally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph Spilotro was a balding, short tempered man in his late fifties who managed the building. Lily didn't like dealing with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell your mother when she gets home that she's a payment behind on the rent. I'd like to speak with her about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, boss\" Lily said, mail in hand, turning toward the flight of stairs. She began to wheel her bicycle up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, we have a perfectly good bike rack in the back of the building\" Ralph added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know!\" Lily yelled back as she rounded the corner and up the first flight of stairs, pretending not to hear Ralph's muttering.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Stupid kid, no respect</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo way was Lily going to trust one of her only possessions with Ralph, who easily could be running a chop shop for all she knew, and if not him, probably someone else. As a journalism major, she was aware that Shermer had a severely underreported crime problem and suspected that Ralph was involved in something, but she wasn't going to tell him that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Ralph was right. Lugging a bike upstairs everyday was prohibitively difficult and not to mention awkward, especially for a not particularly athletic girl like herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, my life, my problems\" Lily assured herself, as if hearing this very exposition play out in her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily eventually made her way up to the fourth floor, only slightly wheezing. She rolled her bicycle to 4E, the Kazinski's little nook of the world where they kept their stuff, unlocked the door, and walked inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was the first one home, as usual, so the apartment was utterly silent. If they weren't so poor, it would actually look kind of cute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leaving the mail on her mom's dresser,  putting her own stuff away in her room and undressing into her comfy clothes, Lily poured some water into a large cooking pot she found in the cupboard and turned on the stove. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily wasn't much of a cook, but she could make a mean mac &amp; cheese. As she waited for the sound of the boil, she watched TV on the faded red couch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell Kazinski came home from work at 6:00 P.M. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Police, there's a stranger in my apartment! She's eating all my food! Listening to my television! And what's this? She's rubbing her smelly toe jam feet all over my bed?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scumbag, you're the smelliest one here. Go take a shower\" Lily said without looking away from the screen, hiding a small smile on her face. She was eating a bowl of the finished mac &amp; cheese while watching a DVD of <i>The Disaster Artist</i> she had gotten from the library. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I smell, roads and bridges don't repair themselves. At least I'm the one with a job.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I graduate, I'm going to be making a lot more than you, you ginger shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No guarantees, and that's in four years at the soonest, freeloader.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tense silence existed between the two half siblings before both of them broke out into giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you too\" said Russ. \"Hey, a shower actually sounds like a swell idea, so that's what I'm going to do. See you in thirty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, see you then!\" shouted Lily as she laughed at James Franco as Tommy Wiseau make a fool of himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had likewise changed into more comfortable clothing, and he smelled significantly better without the grime and sweat he came home with clogging his pores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got good news\" the red haired young man said nonchalantly as he sat next to Lily on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n L\"I'm finally getting my own place.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily paused the movie and turned to face Russell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You and Mom won't have me to kick around any more. I can tell that you're excited. Now you can watch TV in here late at night without listening to the disgusting snoring noises I make.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily's eyes widened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I'm still going to see you two every day.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I meant...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I still going to help cover the rent and groceries? Of course, Lill. What do you take me for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily sighed sadly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I don't want you to go. Really. I like you. <i>Love</i> you. Even if you are an annoying Archie Andrews looking motherfucker.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I love you even though this you're an annoying know it all twerp. I don't want to either, really, but it's too small here. I need to spread my wings. And to be honest, I'm too embarrassed to tell my girlfriend where we live. I'm just worried what Mom is going to think.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you what she's going to think. Mom's going to freak.You know that she's been hanging on by a thread for years now. We're the only ones who care about her. If you leave, she might have a heart attack or something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the Kazinski kids looked on at a framed photo of their mother back in 1989, held tightly against the father they once knew when the two had started dating.  Wordlessly, Russell and Lily lamented a time before either one had been born, because the twenty six year old Evelyn Kazinski they saw looked so much happier, so much more vibrant than the broken down woman who they knew now, the one who often cried herself to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n** <br>\r\n<br>\r\n8:05 P.M. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind the green door, Eugene paused door and wondered what he was going to do with the rest of the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was too exhausted, and frankly, too scared to use the gemstone again. It was bad enough that he had been magically shifted through three different realities today. He certainly didn't need another drastic change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. What he was going to do was take a nice long hot shower. Then he was going to soak his feet in front of the TV for an hour or two. He didn't know what was on tonight, but it didn't matter. His mind was like molasses right now, and if he had to veg out watching <i>Young Sheldon</i> or <i>America's Got Talent</i>, well, he was just going to have to settle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, he was going to eat a salami sandwich, if he even had salami anymore, though considering his new corpulent body, he probably did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he was going to go to bed, collapsing on his mattress without even bothering to get undressed. He might even say a prayer to God, his first one in decades. Eugene had secretly been an atheist since he was sixteen, but today's magical madness made him reconsider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith great reluctance, the former man unlocked his front door... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell and Lily turned around as they heard their mother walk through the front door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, you're home!\" they shouted in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope you're hungry!\" added Lily, raising a bowl of the dinner she had made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene took one look at the two strangers sitting on his couch and immediately fainted. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eugene stepped off the bus down onto the cold sidewalk, the final step almost causing him to trip as he, in his new form misjudged the now larger drop. He let out a womanly grunt as he landed harder than he should have on his two feet and was suddenly glad that this female version of himself wasn't wearing heels. The last thing he needed right now was to accidentally break his ankles. But still, the harder landing sent a flare of pain shooting through his body and he grimaced in the dark as the bus doors closed behind him as Reggie the bus driver continued his journey through the chilly autumn night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though it was October instead of May, even though he was a woman instead of a man, at least his apartment building was exactly the same as he had left it. It loomed above him in the dark, an older brick building that was older than Eugene, and was constantly shifting owners despite a steady stream of occupants like himself. The building was four stories tall and fairly narrow, but still dominated the skyline of the old main street of Shermer. It dated back to around 1940-ish and had been renovated several times over it's life span by multiple owners but somehow managing to keep the 'old timey' charm of the 40s. But the fact that 'old main street' Shermer was largely nothing more than a handful of old businesses that were too stubborn to let go meant that rent was cheap, which also meant the building continuously changed hands every five or so years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut so long as the revolving door of new owners didn't evict him, Eugene really couldn't have cared less about the fact that the last time the building had seen any extensive renovation had been 1989, and then in the early 2000s to bring it up to fire and asbestos code. It didn't leak, everything more or less worked and it kept him out of the bitter northern Midwest winters, one of which was getting ready to once again arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe once-again janitor inhaled the crisp, cold night air and walked up the short flight of steps into the four-story apartment building's lobby, which was furnished with yellowing tile, bank of small wall-mounted mailboxes and the main office where Ralph, the current superintendent, sat under a pair of florescent lights watching something on the small TV while, despite a 'no smoking ordinance' he smoked a large cigar with his legs popped up on a filing cabinet. The harsh light shined painfully off the overweight man's bald head as he noticed Eugene, spinning around in his squeaky chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, heh, Eve-nin' Ms. Kazinski! How are you tonight?\" Ralph said cheerfully as he leaned heavily on his side of the counter, pressing his face close to the glass pane that divided him from the tenants. The man was just a couple of years older than Eugene and had run the building since sometime before Eugene had found himself in Shermer. While he didn't own the property and was technically only the building super, he also collected the rent money from Eugene and the other tenants. Eugene watched as Ralph sucked in his gut as he swiveled around to face him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, I guess I can't complain?\" Actually Eugene could, given his situation, but he was pretty sure his landlord wouldn't like having a tenant that thought she was supposed to be a man or in possession of a magical, reality altering gemstone and had spent the last few hours being A: Transported back in time from April of 2019, B: Having been regressed to being eighteen years old again, and C: Was the star of the school play before being unceremoniously tossed into the role of head cheerleader for the high school's cheer team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good! Hey, listen, I hate to do this but the new owner is really coming down on me about rent, and he's not too happy about you being a payment behind. I was thinking though, maybe if you and I went out to dinner tomorrow night, maybe I could...smooth things over?\" Ralph's voice was full of false sincerity and Eugene caught the man's eyes flickering down at his flabby breasts before wandering back up to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene tried not to puke as it dawned on him why his super, who usually only communicated in grunts or short, gruff, profanity laced sentences was being so nice and communicative. He wanted a freaking date! Eugene felt himself gripping the Ahn'Ger Stone tightly as the urge to escape another uncomfortable situation. Was there just no END to the terrible situations that he was going to find himself in today!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wis-\" Eugene started under his breath, but caught himself before he made the situation worse. The last thing he needed was to end up married to the fat man in front of him or something! At least right now he was as close to breaking even as he'd gotten all day, and Eugene just wanted to get upstairs and be alone, even if it meant being in this flabby female body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Ralph said, leaning closer to the gap in the office window, his flabby face scrunched in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I, uh, I said I would, uh, love to but I thought I would, uh, use the kids being at a game tomorrow to, um, clean the gym floor!\" The janitor fumbled up the best excuse he could find, which was, ironically, something he actually did do when the gym would otherwise not be in use. Whether or not he actually had done it the first time he'd lived through October 2018 was another story all together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Ralph's face fell as he looked downward at the counter, relaxing in disappointment as his stomach ballooned out to it's original size. Silence and the muted sound of some old TV show filled the otherwise quiet lobby,and just for a moment Eugene didn't see the abrasive and crude landlord. Instead he saw a sad, tired and lonely old man that had just gotten his heartbroken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Shit' Eugene thought to himself as a wave of guilt washed over him. As weird as being a woman was, Eugene WAS behind on his rent, and if he couldn't figure out how to make the stupid gemstone in his hand work the way he wanted it to, at least going out to dinner wasn't the worst way he could solve the problem. Plus there didn't seem to be any way out of this particular situation without just walking away and potentially risking his apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, maybe some other time?\" Eugene croaked meekly, suddenly leaning forward on his side of the glass, giving Ralph an up close look at his flabby cleavage, \"I don't think I'm doing anything this weekend? Maybe then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph's eyes lit up in delight and Eugene hated the fact that he had been a woman for all of about four hours and was already forced to use 'feminine wiles' to get his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a plan my dear!\" Ralph beamed as he leaned back in his chair, which creaked dangerously under the man's weight. \"I think I can tell the powers that be they don't have to worry about any late payments\" The super gave Eugene a wink and the tortured janitor tried not to shudder (he was pretty sure that even the slightest shiver would make his fat new body start jiggling). Instead Eugene just gave Ralph the best smile he could, wished him goodnight, and retreated up the stairs as fast as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich proved to be a mistake. Eugene's apartment was on the top floor, as far away from everyone else as he could manage. In his old body he was still regretting the decision as he got older and his body got weaker, but as this new, almost obese woman he found himself as, the climb was torture. He was out of breath by the time he got halfway up the second flight of stairs and had to pause to catch his breath, gasping as quietly as he could unless Ralph suddenly appear and take it as an excuse to 'flirt'. So Eugene had carried his Eve bulk upwards each flight of steps, trying his best to ignore his throbbing feet and the layer of sweat that was unpleasantly catching in the folds of his skin (and beneath his breasts). By the time he had reached his floor he was so exhausted and frustrated that the gemstone had begun to glow once more and the risk seemed dangerously worth it to the suffering man-turned-woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Eugene had shoved the cursed little gem into his purse and waddled down the hall, the floor creaking under him until he finally, finally reached Apartment 4E. Home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPraying that everything inside was more or less how he left it, now that it seemed the only thing different about his life was that he was fat and female, Eugene fished a keyring out of his purse, slid the appropriate key into the lock, and held his breath as he opened the door to find...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Exactly what he wanted, what he NEEDED to see. His furniture, faded and old, right where he left it. His TV, the same. The wallpaper still in need of replacement, and his kitchen, while still in need of a deep clean, was still acceptably clean. It was, in fact, even more full than Eugene usually kept it, which he had to attribute to 'Eve's' currently, well, size. As Eugene completed his inspection of his apartment, the only things that seemed 'off' was largely just his curtains, bedsheets, the feminine products in his bathroom, and of course, his wardrobe. The handful of pictures he on display had not changed outside of him appearing as a her, and the one, perhaps the most important one that Eugene had owned that was kept next to his bed, showed much younger, thinner and happier looking Eve (one that looked like a 26 year old version of the body he previously had) held tightly against the body of a strange dark headed man he didn't recognize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene picked the picture up off of the nightstand with two flabby hands and stared at it. He remembered this, only he had been the guy and the girl...The girl's name had been Karen, but she definitely hadn't looked as good as Young Eve did. It was the only keepsake he had from the only positive relationship he'd ever had, but it had been impossible, now that he was a she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than any of the other crazy things that had happened to him today, strangely hurt. Eugene put the picture back on the nightstand and collapsed, exhausted into bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a fucking day\" He muttered.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Poor Emily McLeod was completely in the dark at everything Eve was saying to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn Kazinski was her very best friend, for intents and purposes her sister from another mother, and now not only had had her closest pal in the word turned on a dime into a raving lunatic the second she decided to indulge that weird Willow Strasserman girl, now she...now Eve was this fat old hag standing in front of her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched with horror as the now middle aged Eve, actually looking far older than that, having accrued some city miles on her, pointed her fat finger into the middle of her palm, which was holding a pretty little green teardrop shaped gemstone between the excessive skin folds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish you'd help me for once!\" the former popularity queen croaked out in her husky voice, which sounded addled from years of alcohol and tobacco abuse. Then her hand seemed to begin radiating an unearthly green glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily's eyes widened in shock<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and then realization. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait a minute, is that gemstone magic or something? Like out of Supernatural? That would explain why Eve is old now!</i> the eighteen year old thought silently to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of Emily's guilty pleasures, which she didn't like admitting in front of people, was that she was a huge fangirl of horror movies, and her favorite TV show was Supernatural. Her mind was already primed to accept the existence of paranormal relics like the Ahn'Ger Stone since she had seen so many variations of the scenario before, like in Wishmaster.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe if I can break that thing, I can reverse the curse, and bring Eve back to normal!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched as the otherworldly green glow slowly began to create wisps of green smoke that slowly filled the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!!\" screamed the pretty brunette cheerleader, her body leaping on top of Eve to try and wrestle the accursed thing away from her friend, knocking them both to the floor. She began to pry open Eve's thick, sausage like fingers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LET GO!\" bellowed Eugene in his new voice, sounding surprisingly mean and bitter, as if the new Eve had gone through an even harder life than her formerly male self had. She slapped Emily in the face with her free hand, assaulting her for the third time that day. Given that Eve now weighed at least as twice as much as the rather slender Emily, this slap hurt, knocking the beautiful girl a significant distance across the bathroom from Eve, underneath the sinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily cried to herself about how insane and impossible this all was, her seemingly picture book existence, with almost everything going for her, having been torn away in an instant by a magic stone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked on with fearful eyes as the stone's glow intensified in Eve's hand, and then let off a blinding flash of light...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing Emily and Eugene both heard was the shrill cry of two dozen middle aged voices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH! MY! GOD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLY SHIT! SHIT! SHIT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they heard a stampede of feet rush towards the ladies room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap, what now?\" Emily asked herself in a voice that sounded slightly off from the one she had a moment ago, slowly pushing herself out of the cavity underneath the sink and up on her feet again. She turned around and looked at herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLY SHI...\" muttered the Scottish-American girl, unable to finish her blasphemy as the stampede of feet rushed inside the medium sized lavatory. She was immediately pushed aside by a now very matronly Vanessa Chandler gazing with terror at her thickened body and her short, butch looking haircut, appearing ridiculous in her now much too small cheerleader uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so old looking!\" loudly moaned Lindsey Moon in the mirror next to Vanessa as she appraised the wrinkles on her now weather beaten face, the crows feet dominating everything. She picked at strands of her fading dark hair as she saw streaks of grey running through it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've turned into my mother!' stuttered Gloria Vanapoulous quietly from behind Lindsey, in clear shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, not <i>exactly</i> her mother, but close enough for the resemblance to be uncanny. The usually arrogant beauty began breathing rapid and shallow, worried that she was about to have a panic attack over this unexpected transformation, not appreciating that while she was indeed older, she was actually still rather attractive in a MILF sort of way, and she was one of the girls who had been affected the least by Eugene's wish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCertainly not as bad as Alicia Adams, who had the great misfortune of developing arthritis and degenerative scoliosis in her old age  She took one look at her mature, fiftyish looking face, her brown hair half gray now, and hobbled out of the bathroom, looking for a place to sit down so she wasn't in agonizing pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, yet another cheerleader, Kaitlyn Irby, was crying as she poked at the imperfections on her now withered chocolate covered skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a date tonight!\" she cried in her throaty, mature sounding voice. \"Brad will never want to go out with me now!\" as her friend April Huang gave her a supportive hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor what seemed like an eternity, the squad all primped and sobbed and worried what the hell was going on, if anyone would even recognize them anymore, if anyone would even <i>love</i> them anymore now that they were old and fat and disgusting, and how to return to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one stopped to look at Eve, or had put two and two together that her outburst may be connected to this very strange turn of events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGradually, the girls of Shermer High's cheerleading team left the bathroom and filled out into the hallway, all of them quite a sight in their ill fitting outfits, all looking like middle aged women on the way to a Bon Jovi concert. Several of them grabbed their phones out of their purses and called their parents. Each call was unique, but all sounded something in the ballpark of;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy, you are NOT going to believe this!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last girl, Victoria Mattingly, left the room in tears, Emily McLeod took an opportunity to finally get a look at <i>her</i> new self. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, Eve, what did you do?\" as she saw her friend hiding in one of the stalls out of the corner of her eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily gulped at her new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the middle aged woman staring at Emily through the mirror was now visibly overweight, though not as bad as Eve, Vanessa, or a couple of the other cheerleaders were. Her face was much rounder than it had been twenty minutes ago, with a thick double chin and jowls. Her body had become wider, with her tummy and her upper arms jiggling with excess fat. Her posterior was now soft, lush, and did the rumba when she walked. Overall, she looked like she had been well fed, the only positive being her now much larger breasts. But that wasn't all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer formerly well kept long brunette hair was now a short bob cut, and was dyed blonde. Her roots were just beginning to show, which made Emily a tad self conscious, though she didn't know why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe now seemed to possess poorer eyesight. She was wearing a pair of admittedly cute black cat eye glasses on her face, but when she took them off, everything near and far seemed to blur, so Emily put them back on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could still make out traces of her original self. Her blue grey eyes continued to twinkle mischievously, and the cheerleader could recognize her telltale smile from anywhere, but overall, she was virtually unrecognizable. She could pass for any random stay at home mom on her block.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Eve?\" she asked with a distinct dread in her voice, turning around to face her sulking friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friend, sitting on a closed toilet, very slowly raised her face to look at Emily with her deep set, piggish looking eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve, where did you get that piece of jewelry from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Willow Strasserman, who had been unaffected by the wish, had quietly snuck away from the scene through a side exit, both upset and deeply, deeply confused by what happened tonight. The geeky blonde could barely believe her own eyes. Had all of the girls <i>really</i> aged forty years right in front of her? She couldn't wait to tell Paige the news. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding silently, her arms crossed underneath her cleavage, was a now middle aged Joanna Ingerman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll things considered, Joanna had gotten off the easiest. She was clearly a middle aged woman, just like the rest of her team, but she was still incredibly beautiful and fit for her age, and more importantly, she had seen Eve run off with that weird looking gemstone. She <i>knew</i> that bitch had something to do with this, and she was going to make her pay for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Parents of some of the cheerleaders begin arriving at school after receiving distress calls from their daughters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Joanna, along with the other cheerleaders, confront Eugene about the Stone.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Where is it!?\" Eugene hissed as he dug through the bag and purse before unending their contents over the bleachers. Out tumbled a phone that cracked and broke as it hit the floor. Out came a load of cosmetics. Out came the rest of the clothing  and the loose change that Eve had been keeping in her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was no gemstone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...NO! It was supposed to be right here!\" Eugene spun around, tumbling backwards as he over-estimated his control over his new centers of gravity and was saved only by grabbing onto one of the nearby handrails. His green eyes were wide and his chest heaved as panic overtook the anger he had been feeling, and suddenly he realized that every single pair of eyes in the gym was locked on him, and plenty of phones were pointed in his direction, including Gloria's. And Joanna simply stood there, towering over all the other girls with a cold look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh no. Oh no oh no oh no' Was all Eugene could think as he realized what had happened. The Stone was gone, it clearly hadn't come with him from the previous reality, if it still existed at all. It had abandoned him here as a cheerleader and now he'd ruined it with his tantrum. He inhaled sharply as Joanna took a step forward and pointed a finger towards the row of doors at the far end of the gym, Eugene following it and catching a blur of something curly ducking under one of the windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve, I think you need to go. Clean up this mess and leave or I'll have someone go get Mr. Irons and he can walk you out\" Joanna said in a very stern and icy cold voice that sent a chill running through Eugene's body. Suddenly the girl who had hugged him, had felt so soft and warm just minutes ago looked like a unyielding mountain of stone and steel as he blue eyes drilled into Eugene's soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-I...I just, I didn't mean to\" He stammered, trying to find the words, some way to make it right, but it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to hear it, Evelyn. You attacked a student, and now you have to leave. Pick up your shit and get the hell out of our gym. You're no longer welcome here\" Joanna said, a murmur of approval running through the collected crowd of cheerleaders. \"I'll be speaking to Mrs. Beck and Mr. Lonnigan about this. Don't plan on going to the game tomorrow\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene could do nothing but stare in shock before Joanna snapped her fingers, the snap echoing across the otherwise silent gym, and Eugene quickly scrambled to life as he stuffed the mess of items back into the duffel bag and ran towards the door.<br>\r\n__________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike all the days had been in the month following the incident in the gym, Eugene had had a rough day. He'd scrambled out of the gym into a blast of cold air, which had taken his breath away before he discovered that it was no longer April 2018. Instead the gemstone had changed more than just his gender and made him a cheerleader, it had shifted time itself! Instead of it being spring it had become mid-October 2018, and Eugene had nearly froze in the chilly night air as he wandered the parking lot, trying to find out which car belonged to Eve. Finding the cute little pink and white convertible Eugene had piled in and taken off, ending up at the home of Eve Kazinski through some weird form of autopilot. He'd pulled up in the driveway of a extremely expensive looking house in the white collar neighborhood of Shermer on the opposite side of town from the apartment he rented when he he had been a man and bolted inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve's parents, two strangers that Eugene didn't know, wanted to know why their daughter was home so early, why it looked like she had been crying, but Eugene had simply bolted up the stairs and into what he now knew as his bedroom, slamming the door and falling onto the large, soft pink bed and passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day had been hell. He hadn't wanted to go to school, but Eve's parents, Karen and Howard, had forced him to. His lack of knowledge of makeup, how to do his hair and his eyes locked shut experience in the bathroom had left the apparently pristine looking Eve looking like a mess. And when he'd gotten to school, well, things just got worse. Everyone was pointing and whispering at him, crowds parting as he wandered down the main hallway before the school's PA system summoned him to the office. There Eugene was the unfortunate star of the first tongue-lashing that Eve had ever received, video evidence being presented to his horrified new mother, mumbling excuses through a mane of limp red hair before Eugene had been escorted out of the building by Mr. Irons, the school security officer. Eugene, or rather Eve as he resigned himself to be now, had received a week suspension for bullying, physical violence against another student, and erratic behavior. And he'd...she'd been removed from the cheerleading team, the academic decathalon team, the BETA Club and pretty much every extra-curricular that Eve had ever been involved in. At home she was stripped of all her privileges. Her keys were taken away, her computer, no TV. Her new parents were clearly so hurt and angry that they would barely look or even speak to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Eve's reputation among the student populace? All the goodwill, the praise and admiration, it had all vanished like dust in the wind. What had taken the girl that Eugene now was a lifetime to build, he'd destroyed it literally overnight. And Eugene, Eve, found herself the target of the same bullying she had tried to save Willow from. Her locker, smack dab in the middle of the of the 'popular' hallway was vandalized, and she was ostracized by all the girls she shared classes with, including Emily, who wouldn't even look at Eve. Eventually Eve was re-assigned a locker away from everyone that she was 'causing conflicts' with, and eventually had her entire schedule re-arranged so that she would stop 'causing disruptions' in the classes with the cheerleaders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they stripped her name from her, in a way. Instead of being called Eve, everyone now, if they spoke to her without insulting her, simply called her Evelyn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was friendless, adrift, a shell of a person. Ironically it was almost second nature, given Eugene's former life and the social pariah he had been because of the same cruel rumors, caused by almost the exact same people. It was why Eve had rolled with it better than anyone had expected, and the target on her back had faded as it looked like the 'fallen angel' of Shermer High wasn't going to give anyone the satisfaction of being provoked into another tantrum. She was just a sad, quiet little loser now, and it was no fun for Gloria and her newly enlarged pack of sycophants if she wasn't going to play ball. Eventually Gloria had gone back to torturing her boyfriend and the constant abuse finally stopped. All that was seemingly left to play with was just a shell of a person, and that was boring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was when a ray of light finally appeared in the most unlikely place. Three weeks after the shockwave had passed and Eve, Evelyn now found herself at the lowest rung of the Shermer High social ladder, two girls appeared at lunch, at the empty table near the back of the high school cafeteria where she'd found herself exiled to. She had quickly and quietly finished her meal and tried to focus on catching up on her homework, which was near impossible for her, given her previous life as a man who had originally barely graduated decades ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is this shit even math!?\" She muttered to herself as she stared at the incomprehensible calculus in front of her. But then a shadow fell across her book and she closed her eyes, preparing for the assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...Eve?\" Came a slightly nasally female voice. Eve's head shot up, sending her limp, faded red hair flying. There, standing in front of her table with lunch trays in hand, were Willow Strasserman, Paige Walters and some greasy haired boy that was staring a little too intently towards Eve's cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can, um, can we sit with you?\" Willow asked shly, and Eve could see more than a few eyes glancing their way from the other tables. More gossip for the rumor mill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve chuckled to hereself. \"I don't know. Might damage your reps sitting with me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we don't have any 'reps' so I think we'll be okay\" The tubby Paige Walters said, \"With how crazy everything has been, now that we share a locker block and classes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to thank you!\" Willow blurted out, slamming her tray down on the table as emotion overtook her, \"I know the story, you stood up for me! You kept me from making a fool out of myself! I..I can't believe would do something like that for me! I knew you were a good person! I just knew it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve just closed her eyes and shook her head. 'You have got to be kidding me' She thought to herself as the three other losers of Shermer High settled down at the table around her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Another month passed by in the lonesome life of Evelyn Kazinski, the damp gloominess of November giving way to the biting cold of December. Snow fell in droves from an omnipresent wall of endless gray clouds dominating the Shermer skyline,  transforming the town below into a living Norman Rockwell painting, a winter wonderland which the kids loved and the adults lamented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Eve knew it, the ten day Christmas break had finally arrived, marking the end of 2018. Despite everything, being turned into a teenage girl and gaining this entirely new, unwanted life, the weirdest thing to the transformed ex-janitor had always been the inexplicable six month jump in time. What was that all about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she had no time to ponder the mysteries of the gemstone that had brought her here. Right now, she had more matters to pay attention to. Like her grades. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve had once been a straight A student with a sterling GPA. She had aced all of the honors classes Shermer High had, and until recently, had been on the road to attending her pick of whatever Ivy League school she wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, thanks to Eugene, all of that had been unceremoniously taken away from her. After it was made clear during a particularly embarrassing Biology lab that she no longer understood the material, the former top student had been bumped back to taking remedial classes earlier in the morning. At home, Eve had even heard her new parents whispering to one another about her seeing a private tutor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren and Howard Kazinski didn't know what to make of their daughter's changes in well... everything. Prior to <i>that</i> one night last October, which Karen refused to even acknowledge, Eve had been their perfect little angel. Now she was starting fights, she perpetually looked like a mess, and she had become a social pariah, consistently coming home straight after school and locking herself in her bedroom. It was like she had become a different person!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of Eve's usually chipper, bubbly personality, she was now consistently sullen and depressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of her witty banter and garrulous way of speaking, she now only gave monotone one or two word responses, saying only as much as she needed to before abruptly ending the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of the warm, caring extrovert that Eve was known for being, she now turned inward, seemingly wanting to be closed off from the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had even put on a couple of pounds, although this only had a negligible effect on Eve's fitness, merely taking her from being \"absolutely perfect\" to \"perfectly healthy for a girl her age\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe married couple of twenty years asked themselves in hushed, guilty tones if they had ever truly known their daughter at all. It's not like they had seen Eve very often in the last few years between all of her extracurriculars and her vibrant social life. Karen and Howard were both busy professionals themselves, and the only times the three of them were ever together as a family anymore was at best...maybe having dinner together three times a week? The odd weekend where Howard wasn't out golfing or Karen wasn't busy with her work friends? As they gazed around their immaculate household, both adults realized to their sadness how un-lived in it looked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir fears gave way to a paranoid brainstorming session. Was Eve doing drugs? Had she fallen in with a bad crowd? Did she join a cult? Did her boyfriend dump her? Did she even <i>have</i> a boyfriend? Was she eating Tide Pods? Had...had Eve been sexually assaulted or even raped?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever it was that was bothering her, Eve refused to tell them, even after a particularly unnerving integration from her father. She had also declined Karen's persistent pleas for her to see a therapist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red haired girl, whose knotty unkempt mane was increasingly being referred to as a rat's nest behind her back, had made it clear that whatever was causing her changes, it was something that she didn't want to talk about. Reluctantly, Karen and Howard had decided to let their worries go. For now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy contrast, Willow Strasserman and Paige Walters had increasingly inserted themselves into Eve's life, becoming the adoring groupies and unwanted companions of their new hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile their initial luncheon with Eve had gone poorly, as Eve was rather dismissive and distant towards the two teenage best friends, Willow and Paige didn't seem to take the hint, as they sat with her in the back of the lunch hall the following day. And the day after that. And the day after that. And the day after that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made you this friendship bracelet!\" beamed Willow one day, tying a multicolored band of woven thread across Eve's wrist.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee... thanks\" said Eve unenthusiastically, not wanting to hurt Willow's feelings by rejecting her gift, but not really desiring her attention either. She had started to tolerate how they followed her around like lost puppies during school hours, but that didn't mean that she would start having pow wows with them either.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome!\" answered Willow, grinning through a row of braced teeth, holding up her own wrist to show that she had made herself the same bracelet. \"Sorry, I know it's kind of corny and all, but I just wanted to make you something. I'm just really glad how you stuck up for me when nobody else would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it\" said Eve as she struggling to finish her homework. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your favorite Grass Starter, Eve?\" asked Paige innocently, somehow expecting the former most popular girl in school to know what that was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My favorite what now?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige was interrupted from going on a Pokemon related geek out when a fourth person joined the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Matt\" said Willow quietly, her body language noticeably tensing up around the greasy haired boy. He sat between her and Eve, dropping his lunch tray right next to Eve's textbook. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are my three girlfriends up to today? Something obscene, I hope!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross, Matt\" moaned Paige. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, did any of you hear how Gloria Vanapoulous and Tom Ackerton broke up again?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt!\" yelled Willow, pointing towards Eve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't mention Gloria's name around Eve. It upsets her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" asked Matt. He turned towards Eve, who had been ignoring the conversation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve, does it bother you if I bring up Gloria Vanapoulous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really\" she answered blankly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See!\" exclaimed Matt. Willow's face became flushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just being considerate is all\" answered the tall, dorky art lover defensively. \"After all the abuse that...that...\" Willow stuttered for a moment as her face took on a slight red tinge as anger welled up inside of her. She was silent for a moment as her eyes darted back and forth and her mouth seemed to fuse itself shut for a moment before she inhaled sharply. \"That bitch! After what she put Eve through, I just assumed Eve would be upset, alright? I know that I would be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt and Paige shared a look of surprise while Eve continued to just stare blankly at the trio that had attached themselves to her, watching Willow's face turn red with embarassment from her outburst of uncharacteristic profanity and stared down at the assorted Pokemon cards and her half-eaten sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Paige who broke the moment of awkward silence with a forced giggle, \"Oh please! We all know that this is really about Tom. You've had a crush on him since Freshman year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to Eve, Matt's gangly body tensed and his face scrunched up in disapproval as he opened his mouth to say something that he probably shouldn't, only to be cut off by Willow perking back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't help it Paige! He's so dreamy. I can't stand the way that he puts up with Gloria. I'd be <i>so</i> much better for him!\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh\" moaned Eve as she buried herself in her work.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The day before Christmas break, Secret Santa gifts were exchanged among the student populace. In the original Eve's life, she had requested for her gift to be a donation to the local food bank or to a charity designed for Syrian refugees, which meant that the former Eugene was the only student at Shermer High to go home empty handed. He didn't really mind this, however, as he had never had very much to begin with, and had grown past the desire to acquire more and more stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, <i>he</i> was still someone's Secret Santa, and he felt an obligation to have a present ready for his charge. Just his luck, it ended up being Willow Strasserman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Eugene had never had anyone in his life to buy presents for, he was crap at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I get for a lonely, nerdy sixteen year old girl?\" he asked himself the Sunday before vacation started as he wandered throughout the local mall. He wondered if Willow would enjoy receiving a new book, or maybe some clothes, or one of those Funko Pop things, or possibly even a new sled?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eve pondered what to do, she inadvertently found her answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked inside the local Game Stop, and tapped on his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom Ackerton turned around from the shelf of games he was browsing through and saw Evelyn Kazinski wrapped up in her signature ruffled winter coat and pink hat. He had been one of the few popular kids at Shermer High to <i>not</i> shin her, knowing intimately well how humiliating it was to be shunned and suspecting that there was more to the story than Gloria or Joanna Ingerman had let on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Eve. How are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, thanks for asking. Listen, um...I know this is going to sound really weird, but  I'm Willow Strasserman's Secret Santa, and I have a BIG favor to ask you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom's baby blue eyes widened, slightly surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm listening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring lunchtime, Eve and the three biggest losers of the school once again spent the hour together in the back of the cafeteria, Paige and Willow playing Magic: The Gathering together while gossiping about the latest season of Daredevil, which Willow had just gotten done catching up with. Matt sat on the opposite side of Eve, doing little more than staring at the noticable lumps that pushed up through her sweater, periodically shifting his creepy gaze towards Willow in between bites of his lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Willow and Paige chatted amongst themselves, someone entered from the rarely used double doors near the back of the cafeteria and began to approach their table. A shadow loomed over the quartet of losers, whose heads snapped towards the source of the occlusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Willow, isn't it?\" asked the shadow in a cheerful voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stick thin, curly haired geek girl's face lit up as she saw her crush Tom staring down at her, her heart beginning to pound in excitement. She let loose a quiet squeak of surprise and felt her face start to turn red as she tried her best not to have a total high speed come apart in front of the high school sports star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this seat taken?\".asked the golden haired athlete with a boyish grin on his face as he sat down next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...sure\" Willow stuttered as her eyes bored into the hunky teenager, not knowing what to say. On the other side of the table, Matt's look of surprise turned into a angry glare as Tom pulled a empty chair from a nearby empty table and plopped it in the space between Willow and Paige, taking care not to disrupt the small mess of Magic cards splayed out between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve here tells me that you wanted to get to know me a little bit better, so here I am! She was your Secret Santa, and I'm your present. I'm going to spend the whole day hanging out with you, doing whatever it is you want to do! That is, if you're comfortable with this.\" Tom said, giving Willow a huge grin of perfect white teeth that backed up eyes that looked convincingly sincere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow stared slackjawed at Tom, then at Paige, whose face was scrunched in confused surprise, then at Matt who was glaring daggers at Tom, and then at Eve, who was smiling for the first time in months.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I...I'd really, really like that!\" Willow tried not to scream out in excitement. She was, internally, about to explode from being this close to Tom Ackerton, the star athlete of Shermer High. And he was talking to her! And smiling! OMG!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Eve was smiling as well! Willow almost couldn't remember the last time she'd seen the grumpy-gus that Eve had become smile, and it had most certainly been before she'd taken the fall and kept Willow from making a fool out of herself back in October. It was is all the celestial forces in the unvierse were converging on the two of them and to be honest, Willow was finding it a little hard to breathe from all the excitement. But the skinny sophmore forced herself to take a deep breath and focus on the amazing thing happening in front of her as Eve spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merry Christmas, Willow\" Eve's voice was different to Willow, like it had sounded the school day before the fateful cheer practice. It was full of energy and genuine happiness, the sheer wonderous magic cracking the shell around her heart open and making her feel again. Or at least, that's how Willow chose to take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reality, or what amounted to it when an artifact that could bend existence to it's will was floating around out there somewhere, Eugene, Eve, WAS happy. Maybe not on the scale that Willow believed she was, but the janitor turned cheerleader turned loser definitely felt better in this moment than she had for months. In fact, she instantly compared it to when Gabriella had first texted him, how sweet it had all sounded...But then that turned out to be fake. It had been wiped from existence along with his old life, but the pain still felt real to Eugene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile on her face drooped a bit, her unpainted lips sliding closed to hide her perfect teeth once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you want to do first? Als, you gonna eat that, bro?\" Tom said good naturedly, pointing to the red apple sitting on Matt's tray. The greasy haired boy just continued to glare at Tom, his face growing more and more red as his hands began to ball up into fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'THIS ISN'T FAIR' Matt's mind howled and screamed in jealously and hate, 'WILLOW IS MINE! I SAW HER FIRST! YOU'RE JUST SOME SECOND FUCKING STRINGER FROM NOWHERE!' The fire in Matt's mind was making him so angry he couldn't think. If he'd only had that...that THING that he dreamed about, the thing that made him the star and made Willow realize she was made for him, destined to be with him, he could make this fucking jock pay...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt began to rise from his seat but an unexpected hand tugged at his pant leg. His head snapped towards the source and saw a flabby arm gripping one of his cargo pockets. He followed the had to an equally chubby arm, which was connected to the equally chubby body of Paige, whose face had turned from confusion to concern as she stared right at Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Woah. She's never done that before...Man, her eyes are pretty even if she looks like a pig' Matt's brain was distracted enough for the mental fire suppressants to kick on, and Matt found imself lowering himself back to the seat of the chair before he grabbed the apple and tossed it towards Tom with as much attitude as he could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...'bro'. Take it. I'm not very hungry anymore anyway\" Matt did nothing to hide the hate in his voice as Tom effortless caught the fruit with his fast reflexes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks dude!\" Was all Tom said in reply as he turned his attention back towards Willow. \"So, you wanna finish lunch? You want seconds? I'll buy!\" Tom's voice was eager, almost...urgent. Paige didn't like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made no sense to the girl that often served as the 'Anchor of Reason' in her circle of friends. Or, well, with Willow. Matt was just sort of there, the flotsam of the school body clinging to the two of them simply because he had nowhere else to drift off to. She was relieved, at least, that Matt took her quiet suggestion to not have one of his freakouts, though. Even if Tom selling himself as a man-whore for the rest of the day seemed earnest enough...Why would he stick his neck out for a loser like Willow? Sure, the rumors that his on again off again girlfriend Gloria Vanapolous were awful but so many of them were just not true...Or were they? Paige had long since given up on trying to glean some kernal of truth from Gloria's bullshit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But still...' Was all her mind said as she watched the two interact, 'This doesn't feel right'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, well, We've all got study hall next period. You can, um, help me study?\" Willow said, blushing at the other kind of studying she wanted to do with Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, my dear, sounds like a plan!\" Tom smiled again before glancing at his phone, \"Hey, lunch is about over, you want to beat the rush and get what you need from your locker first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow's knees can within millimeters from knocking together. This was it! They go to her locker and open it and they'd hide behind it while they shared their first kiss! It was just all so perfect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!\" Was all Willow could say as she shot out of her chair like a lightning bolt, grabbing Tom's hand before pulling him away towards the double doors the group had been using. But Willow felt a tug on her hand and she wheeled around directly into Tom's muscled chest. She gave Tom a puzzled look that melted away under the toothy smile he was giving her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go out this way! It's quicker. If we go the other way we have to walk all the way around the cafeteria to get to your lockers!\" Was all Tom needed to say. Willow smiled, giglled, and nodded, allowing the hunky popular boy to lead her towards her wildest dreams. He even stopped near the double doors, released her tiny hand and gave a little bow as he said \"Ladies first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'OMG, HE'SO PERFECT!!!!' Willow's mind simply screamed as she gave him a braced filled smile and walked through the slightly askew door...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..Which was was when Paige realized that Gloria and the other popular kids were no where to be seen in the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WILLOW! STOP!\" Paige screamed bolting up from the table, but it was too late as Willow pushed open the door and was suddenly doused, head to toe, in stinking garbage as the bucket that had been set on the lip of the door tumbled over as the door was opened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFilthy water, trash, leftovers and other refuse poured down in a torrent upon the skinny girl that was almost too innocent and naieve for high school. All she heard was Paige saying something and then the WOOSH of water as it cascaded down upon her, soaking her from head to toe as she screamed in surprise and alarm. And then, as the water spread out around her and dripped furiously off of her previously frizzy hair, Willow heard it: The cruel laughter of several dozen voices from the hallway she had been coerced into using. Willow wiped wiped her eyes clean as the stench of the garbage began to overwhelm her as she saw the group of horrible, horrible kids led by Gloria Vanapolous pointing at her and laughing as they recorded the entire thing on their cellphones. And even to the right of her, she heard laughing. Confused she turned to look and saw the final straw that broke her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Tom, pointing and laughing at her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY EVE! THIS WAS GREAT! MAYBE YOU'RE STILL COOL AFTER ALL!\" Gloria's shrill cry rang past Willow as the skinny girl burst into tears. She cast a large, wet look at the stunned face of Eve Kazinski before she took off running, slipping and falling twice as the stinking wetness from the prank made it impossible for her lanky form to gain traction on the floor tile as she tried to escape the horrible situation. The young Strasserman was full on bawling by the time she disappeared around the corner, heading deeper into the school to find refuge somewhere, anywhere, away from everyone. She wiped her face, but only caused more stinking garbage water to drip out of the friendship bracelet she had made for herself and Eve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe betrayal hit her just as much as the prank ever did. She had been so wrong! Eve wasn't her friend!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow tore the bracelet from her damp wrist and let it fall to the floor as she ran for the only place she could think of: The janitor's closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the cafeteria, the popular kids had eventually tired of their prank and had dispersed as the bell had begun ringing. Tom had vanished as well, but not before clapping a hand on Eve's shoulder and wiping the mirthful tears from his eyes. Paige and Matt simply stared at Eve in shock and horror (though Matt was also just relieved that it wasn't him for once).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...That was the most horrible thing I've ever seen anyone do, Eve\" Was all Paige said before she stood from the table and rushed out the door to find her best friend. Matt simply faded away, getting up and heading towards his next class with a backwards glance at Eve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Eve simply sat there, staring at the horrible, horrible cruelness she had indirectly visited upon the only person that hadn't made her feel like shit for the past two months. Eventually the cafeteria staff had called Principal Stevens once the troubled redhead had failed to leave for class, and he and Mr. Irons, the school security officer, had arrived to collect her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Eve found herself in the office of the man that had, once, paid her to clean the building, receiving another lashing for 'bullying' and 'harassment'. Her new parents had been called and there was hell to pay, especially because they couldn't find poor Willow anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Eve? Eve felt the last part of her that seemed to care about the world around her shrivel and die. The world fell into a distant, muted, slow motion state as her mind just...shut down. It was all her fault. She should have never have picked up that goddamn Stone. She just should have stayed away instead of trying to be a 'good friend'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve hated herself entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Eve is suspended indefinitely pending the result of a full investigation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Willow, crying alone in the janitor's closet, finds a peculiar looking gemstone...</span></div></div>",

She was a literal Mary Sue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily genuinely didn't know what Eve was going through right now. If she was having some kind of nervous breakdown, Eve had never told her about it previously or even <b>hinted</b> at it in their many times alone with each other doing homework or watching bad horror movies. It was incredibly disconcerting and yet, in a horrible way, refreshing, knowing that there was a chink in her armor that Emily hadn't known about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette sidekick didn't approach Eve to hug her, as her instincts told her to do. Instead she stood guard, waiting for Eve to come to on her own terms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eugene continued to sob, fresh tears falling freely to the ground, Eve's makeup a complete mess, her stage outfit soaked, Ms. Barry finally found her way backstage, storming onto the heart-rending scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE!?\" demanded the diminutive drama teacher. Emily looked up and frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing's going on, Ms. Barry. We're just having a little personal issue here. We'll be ready to leave in just a few minutes\" answered the eighteen year old, knowing that it was a crappy little lie that would never work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, whatever is going on between you two, the entire damn theater heard it!\" snapped the adult teacher. \"Shit, the entire school probably would have heard it if it were still in session!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeannette turned to Eve sitting quietly in her stool, the red haired girl's crying spell down to a case of the sniffles, and she gave her a dirty look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve, what's wrong?\" she demanded with a hard voice. \"What's going on with you? Why were you such a mess out there today?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene didn't answer her. Even if he had wanted to, his throat was sore and raw from all of the screaming with Emily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Answer me! What the hell was that <b>thing</b> you called acting back there!? Just yesterday, you were pitch perfect, you were a star, and today, you're acting like some drunken off key klutz who got rejected during the American Idol auditions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Barry, stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily, don't interject. You're in hot water too!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene looked up at the furious teacher and glared. He knew Jeanette. This was her third year teaching English and Drama at Shermer High. She didn't have tenure yet, and the possibility of getting fired was always hanging over her like the Sword of Damocles. As a man, Eugene mostly avoided Ms. Barry, because he knew how self absorbed and high strung she could be. Most struggling actors were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Barry, please, I think Eve is just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IS IT THIS? IS THIS WHAT YOU TWO ARE FIGHTING OVER?!\" Ms. Barry asked as she snatched the green gemstone right out of Eve's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeanette briefly became transfixed by the Ahn'Ger Stone as she watched the energies inside of it swirl around in beautiful patterns, like snowflakes on a winter's day. A deep part of her brain was reminded of the primordial soup which had given birth to life on this planet, and in some weirder, metaphysical way, she felt as if the stone itself represented change, evolution, ambition, and unceasing progress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's beautiful\" she whispered to herself, before turning back to Eve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Is this what you were fighting over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...No\" answered Eugene, as quiet as a church mouse. Her voice indeed, sounded rather hoarse at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why were you telling at Emily? Why were you so bad during rehearsal today?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily huffed behind both of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me explain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to hear it from Eve. You're not her lawyer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve is...I don't know! I think she's having a nervous breakdown or something. She wasn't like this earlier today!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, Emily, you're not her lawyer. Speak up, Eve! If you're in a bad mental place, you're going to have to tell me now, because the play goes live in two days, and your understudy needs to be informed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve remained silent. Inside, Eugene was totally spent. He was being held hostage in this auditorium by these two people, one of whom he only barely knew from his day job, and one he didn't knew at all. If he had the stone, he would have made another wish, but Ms. Barry was holding it at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Answer me, Eve!\" screeched Ms. Barry. \"Why are you acting so weird? Why didn't you perform well today?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve looked at the woman with pleading eyes to just leave her be, but the teacher either didn't take the hint, or didn't want to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The silent treatment? Seriously?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe emerald gemstone began to glow once more in Jeanette's hand. She had completely lost her patience with the little drama queen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a raised voice, she made a wish...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: \"I WISH YOU'D GIVE ME AN HONEST ANSWER!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gemstone grants Jeanette's wish. Eugene is now forced to tell the truth and to never lie. He admits to who he really is, a lonely middle aged janitor who was changed against his will into a teenage girl, causing Ms. Barry and Emily to believe that Eve has lost her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: \"I JUST WISH YOU'D BECOME A BETTER SINGER AND DANCER SO I DON'T GET FIRED!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gemstone grants Jeanette's wish. Eugene now knows all of the choreography and sings like an angel. Unfortunately, he can't <i>stop</i> singing and dancing. In his day to day life, Eve now behaves like she's in a musical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Ms. Barry wishes for something else.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The twenty-eight year old wife and stepmother felt her flawless skin crawl beneath her white designer dress and blazer as she dug her nails into the far too expensive designer purse as the school's administrative staff spoke. And the fact that she had to cancel her day trip into Chicago and make time to come here to this dingy school and listen to people nearly twice her age lecture her on how to be a parent? It was completely unacceptable!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's come to our attention that your son may be involved in a bully situation, Mrs. Ingerman\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We believe he might be threatening students Mrs. Ingerman\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you know anything about this Mrs. Ingerman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pile of questions and false accusations were piled onto Tara faster than she could keep up, and all the while she could just feel the judgement from the school staff, all of which were clearly just jealous of her looks, her wealth, and that her stepson, Alexander, was so physically gifted that he was allowed a free pass so long as he stayed on the basketball team, which he hated. They wouldn't let him play football though, because of the Incident. But she had heard the rumors before and until now, had chosen to ignore them. Of course, that had been in the original reality. Now that Jonathan was an attractive girl and had been altered both inside and out to being one of the nicest, most popular girls in school and Bill Strasserman's girlfriend, things had shifted just enough. Instead of Jonathan, now the school board was concerned about the complaints coming in about Tara's OTHER stepchild, the younger child of Ragnar Ingerman from his previous marriage, Alexander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr as the student body of Shermer High knew him as, 'Alex the Terrible'. He was only a sophmore, and, until around nine hours ago, hadn't existed, but in the twisting of reality the Ahn'Ger Stone had willed the boy to life, now little more than a product of a loveless marriage and a powerful businessman wanting a proper male heir. The boy, Alex, wasn't so much an organized bully as he was simply a entitled, spoiled terror who, from time to time, paid Rob Bolstrum and his pack of thugs to terrorize some unfortunate student or faculty member until he got his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps he was created as a contingency plan by the Ahn'Ger Stone, or perhaps it was always just the vague concept of 'fate' that would lead to the creation of a hate-filled bully with the last name of 'Ingerman', but whatever the reason, he existed now, and unlike his previous incarnation as Jonathan, Alexander exhibited far less caution, which is what resulted in Shermer High finally being forced to take action against the boy and his connections to Bolstrum and his bullies. Which was why Tara was currently spending her afternoon listening to the accusations leveled against her stepson (even if she secretly despised the boy for the same attitude, she had worked too hard to get to where she was and she wasn't about to let some underpaid school marms tarnish her achievement). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was because of this insecurity, the thought that if she didn't defend her new family's name, that she might end up back where she began. Proving the rumors about her right. The rumors that the disapproving school board in front of her clearly thought were true. Tara knew what they were thinking. It was what everyone that was jealous of her thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Look at the dumb bimbo trophy wife'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She'd be sliding on a pole if her sugar daddy wasn't so rich'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She probably sleeps with her stepson, they're basically the same age'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I bet she slept her way to her high school graduation, she's never been to college'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No wonder the boy is disturbed if he has to put up with THAT every day'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I really feel sorry for the sister. Such a pretty girl and so nice!'<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nEven as the gathered school staff in front of her droned on about the number of offenses that Alexander had supposedly committed while on school property, Tara felt the rage boiling up inside her, over the accusations, over everything, and especially because she was here, in the dingy school her husband had graduated from decades ago, instead of living it up in downtown Chicago, personal car full of merchandise and just sitting down to eat a expensive meal at one of the city's best restaurants. The place where she deserved to be! Enough was enough!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU'RE LUCKY MY HUSBAND ISN'T HERE OR HE'D SUE YOU ALL FOR LIBEL AND SLANDER!\" Tara screamed at the top of her voice, rising from her chair and pointing a long, manicured finger at the assembled members of Shermer High's school board and several teachers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Ingerman, please-\" The balding, bespectacled and slightly overweight figure of school superintendent Andrew Chandler began, but was silenced by a hateful glare from the much younger woman's icy blue eyes and a feminine snarl as she shouldered her ludicrously expensive purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll MAKE SURE HE HEARS ABOUT THIS! YOU'LL ALL BE FIRED AND THIS SHITTY SCHOOL WILL BE CLOSED DOWN!\" Tara snarled as she turned and marched towards the door, her styled mane of long, blonde hair bouncing with every step as her designer heels clicked against the hard tile of the conference room as she made her way towards the door, gripping the cold handle in a fist of slightly too long red fingernails as she pulled it open and stomped with as much fury as her body could muster out into the school's interior. She had only made it a short distance away when she heard the door open behind her, and the voice of Superintendent Chandler call out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Ingerman, PLEASE! We don't want to offend one of our largest donors but there's a record AND a substantial number of students who have come forward about your son's actions! That's why we called you here so we could discuss it privately! If it gets out to the media, we'll be forced to take action! Please, just calm down and I'm sure we can-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a spineless old turd!\" Tara sneered down the hallway at him as several other members of the staff poked their heads out the door behind the superintendent, \"YOU ALL ARE! YOU'RE JUST AFTER OUR MONEY! I BET-\" Tara paused in the middle of her tirade as the overhead lights caused a dull glare from something on the floor to catch her eye. It looked like glass, maybe part of a broken bottle. Tara grinned sinisterly (or as best as she could, with her flawless face) and bent over to pick up the item, giving the staff in front of her more than a clear view of her expansive cleavage as she picked the object up within her red taloned fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, look at this!\" Tara said, not really looking at the object herself, knowing only it was cold and hard against her flesh as she glared back at the gathered faculty, \"A piece of  broken glass? Why, that seems like a serious safety hazard to me! What if a child had gotten a hold of this? Or fell on it? Maybe I should do my part as a concerned parent and report the absolutely FILTHY conditions this school is in to the news! Maybe then you'd see that there are much larger concerns than a bunch of jealous little snowflakes wanting to get my stepson in trouble!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her hand, the Stone began to glow as Tara lowered it with a evil smirk, watching the blood drain out of the face of Superintendent Chandler and several other members of the staff that actually understood the threat, while the others stared at her with open contempt. No one out of the small crowd noticed the glow of the Stone, and with a harsh, cruel laugh, Tara Ingerman unknowingly unleashed the artifact's power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish...\"</span></div></div>",

Superintendent Chandler and the collected Shermer High school board went rigid for a moment as their eyes became greenish gold and cloudy. Tara, herself, was unaffected as the bright explosion of light from her left hand caused her to look towards it before the brightness of the flash forced her eyes shut on instinct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe they all had a stroke at the same time?' Tara thought for a moment, but as soon as she finished, the clouds left the eyes of the administrative staff and they returned to a more relaxed, natural looking pose. Whereas before most of them had been staring at her with reproachful looks, judgemental stares, or outright disgust, now each staff member seemed more more open and friendly looking. Superintendent Chandler straightened his tie and took a step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Ingerman, you're absolutely right\" The balding man said, the small double chin waggling a bit as he spoke, \"These accusations against your stepson are completely out of line, and I can see now that we were taking the wrong approach to dealing with this. Alexander is a fine young man with plenty that the other students would be jealous of, and we, as a whole, will be dealing with punishing the students that brought these complaints to our attention. Rest assured we won't rest until we've made sure that each student receives a punishment equal to the complaint against your son\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara was shocked by the sudden amicability of the Superintendent, but she wasn't about to look a gift horse in the mouth. She took a breath and lowered herself out of her aggressive heeled stance, lowering her arms. She cast a glance at her left hand, opening the fist she had made to look at what she had originally assumed had been a shard of glass, but was actually a gorgeous emerald teardrop, with a smaller golden teardrop in it's center. It was gorgeous! Tara couldn't believe she had mistaken it for a shard of glass before! Tara brough the Stone closer to her face for a more through inspection but a sudden polite cough turned her attention once more to the Superintendent and the gathered school board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it that punishing the other students will be sufficient enough, Mrs. Ingerman?\" Andrew Chandler said, still polite but a somewhat impatient tone giving edge to his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yes? Yes. Absolutely! Um, have a good night!\" Tara said, and with that she turned and hurried right out the nearest set of school doors, letting them slam close behind without so much as a backwards glance as she bee-lined for her car in the staff parking lot. The moment she reached the luxury porsche she ripped open the door and crawled into the driver's seat, slamming the door behind her and locking it as to not be rudely interrupted if...whatever had just happened to the school board wore off and they came looking for her. Satisfied with her security precautions, Tara opened her hand once more and began to examine the mysterious rock that had apparently just changed the minds of EVERY member of Shermer High's staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt truly was gorgeous, and Tara was a girl that knew her gemstones, given she had tons of them at home, gifted to her by her dear husband Ragnar 'Reggie' Ingerman. This particular gemstone was the most brilliant green Tara had ever seen, and however they had managed to get the inner golden stone in, well, the jeweler must have been an absolute master at his craft as the trophy wife couldn't feel any seams in the material whatsoever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some poor girl is going to be very sad when she realizes she just left this for a random stranger to find\" Tara said with a cruel laugh, \"If this really mad those old fuckers listen to me, then imagine what I can do now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClutching the Ahn'Ger Stone tightly, Tara closed her eyes and said \"I wish I was queen of the world!\" and braced for the light...But nothing came. Confused, Tara looked at the stone once again and made another wish. \"I wish I had bigger boobs!\" She shouted, though she was actually quite happy with her breasts it was the only thing she could think of. Again, nothing. No flash or anything. The frustration boiled within Tara's abdomen and for a brief moment she could have sworn the golden stone within the emerald had glowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you and how do you work?\" Tara muttered, studying the Stone further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Tara eventually puts the Stone aside and goes home, the Ingerman Estate outside of Shermer. There, she goes back to studying the Ahn'Ger Stone and seeing what it could do, eventually making an angry wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Tara eventually figures out the Stone's secret by mistake there in the parking lot and makes a poorly thought out wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Tara puts the Stone into her purse, finally writing off the turn of events as just her imagination playing tricks on her.

The economy in Shermer was good, especially for a Rust Belt state like Illinois. Some poverty existed, but it wasn't anywhere near as bad as the big city. Violence for the most part wasn't an issue. Andy didn't have to worry about any drive bys here as he sat in his office or getting mugged on the way to the parking lot. Kids here had problems, but not the life and death kind, which made his job easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, things weren't all Norman Rockwell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTake this Alexander Ingerman kid, and he used the term \"kid\" very literally, as Alexander was somewhat on the small size for his age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexander was a sadistic bully and a thug through and through.  In Andy's opinion, it wasn't long before \"Alex the Terrible\" saw the inside of a jail cell. Ever since Alexander's father had moved back to his childhood home from Chicago seven years ago, reports of bullying had gone up dramatically. So had reports of sexual harassment and misconduct, and what do you know? They were all tied to Ingerman. There were also rumors that all the bullies and delinquents in the Shermer School District were now acting almost like an organized crime racket, systematically robbing their fellow students of their money and belongings, all of them acting under the auspices of a blonde haired kingpin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexander's father Ragnar had used his considerable money and influence to sweep these little transgressions underneath the rug, but now as Jonathan was getting older, these incidents were increasing in frequency and becoming impossible to ignore. Andrew had half a mind to expel Big Jon, but there was never enough support from the district or the school itself. He suspected that Karl Stahl, the school principal, was himself scared of the influence Alexander had over the bullies and his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, as Alexander's insufferable stepmother was crying about an errant piece of glass, he heard her make a foolish wish, something along the lines of \"I wish YOU had to deal with this!\", and then everything went green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew felt a bizarre, stomach churning sense of whiplash as he quickly realized that his perspective had suddenly shifted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment ago, before that flash of mysterious green light, he had been facing the furious scowl of Tara Ingerman as she stormed out towards the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he was facing towards the principal's office at a handsome looking blonde man in a suit, a look of desperation on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs Ingerman\" said the blonde man with some concern, \"I wish that you would reconsider your current course of action. Your son may be about to face some serious legal consequences if we don't deal with this now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew was confused. Who was this man? Where did he come from? Why was he speaking with Tara Ingerman?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to ask the man \"Who are you?\", but he could only get the words \"Who\" and \"Are\" out of his mouth before he realized something was extremely wrong. That wasn't his voice. A look of panic crossed his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MRS INGERMAN, PLEASE!\" pleaded the blonde haired man. \"PLEASE COME BACK TO THE OFFICE AND LETS DISCUSS THIS LIKE ADULTS.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew instinctively took a couple of steps forward when he heard the telltale click clacking of heels. He glared down...and his eyes went wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was...he was wearing black high heels. And a white dress. The very same expensive designer dress Tara Ingerman had been wearing just a second ago. His head snapped back up, causing a curtain of shiny brown hair to follow in its wake. And his hands! They were soft, small, and dainty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat voice again. His voice. Soft, bubbly, almost ditzy sounding. He was starting to get dizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Tara's wish caused the Ahn'Ger Stone to alter reality yet again, this time swapping Tara's and Andrew's lives around. Andrew is now Mrs. Andrea Ingerman, the trophy wife of Ragnar and beleaguered stepmother to Alexander and Joanna. Tara is now Terrence Sheppard, the superintendent of the Shermer School District trying to convince Andrea to consider moving Jonathan to another district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Andrew wakes up in one of the school offices and sees...Tara Ingerman sitting next to him!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Something Else<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The pain in his head as he opened his eyes was the first thing Andrew felt, slamming his eyelids shut once more to blot out the glare of the overhead flourescents lights. But then after a few moments he felt the cold leather of the couch that was in the school's staff administration office. And then he felt several something elses. Like the pressure on his chest, the slight tug on the back of his head, the way the couch felt different around his rear. And then as he groaned, felt something waxy on his mouth as he realized the groan was light and definitely feminine. Andrew pulled himself upwards and felt what seemed to be like the entire world shifting as the pressure on his chest shifted forward and a mane of long brown hiar covered his  vision as he looked downward into a canyon of cleavage that was held in place by a white dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" The former superintendent said as panic crept back into his brain. But any further thoughts were whisked away as he heard someone move next to him, and he snapped towards the sound causing his newly acquired hair to flash in front of his vision as something metallic tapped softly against both sides of his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG sis! I thought you were never going to wake up! Like I can't believe you fainted!\" Said Tara Ingerman, or at least a woman that looked mostly like her. She was still blonde, but her breasts were at least twice the size Andrew remembered them being before  he was given his own pair, and her clothing was definitely less expensive looking and clearly designed for a more sexualized look.. Tara's hair was much lighter that it had been and much, much longer and her skin was almost bronze as numerous golden bangles hung off her wrist and forearms. \"It's a good thing I was waiting in the car!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh\" Was all Andrew could say as he struggled to process what had happened. What HAD happened? One minute he was trying to handle the deranged woman in front of him, and the next minute he WAS the deranged woman! Or at least, he thought he had become her until he had passed out. He looked around the small office and was glad the strange blonde man that had apparently taken his job wasn't there, or any of the other school staff. He wasn't sure if he was ready for them to see him as he was now. He looked back to the strangely different Tara who began straightening his hair with a few swipes of her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should totally sue this dumb school for every penny. That would make them regret stressing you out so much! I'll call Reggie and let him know what happened!\" Tara continued on, pulling out her phone and tapping on the screen with hot pink nails that were so long that they seemed painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew cast a look at his own nails on his now very female hands and were thankful they seemed much less extravagant, even though they still looked like glossy light pink claws to him. And then he saw the diamond encrusted wedding band on his ring finger and his stomach dropped out from under him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-reggie?\" He asked, the sound of his own voice still so alien to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara fixed Andrew with a strange look. \"Uh, you know, your husband? Reggie? As in Mr and Mrs. Ragnar Ingerman? OMG Andrea did you hit your head so hard that it gave you amnesia!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MY HUSBAND!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you know, you met him when the two of us went to that REALLY nice bar with the rest of the sorority after we graduated? You and him hooked up and then like a month later you were getting married? Dad and mom were pissed and didn't come to the wedding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wedding?\" Andrew whimpered. The only wedding the previously bald, middle-age school administrator recalled being part of was his own, to his beloved Charlotte. 'Oh god, how am I gonna explain this to Charlotte?' Andrew said to himself as he stared numbly at the ring on his finger that seemed like it was more diamond than gold. Baside him, Tara's face was clearly twisted in concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, don't you remember? Like, Reggie paid for everything! You got married in that huge cathedral, you had a dress that was just to die for, you guys disappeared for like a month on your honeymoon? You sent me all kinds of pictures from Europe!\" Tara tapped frantically at her phone and shoved it in Andrew's face. He squinted automatically, not feeling or seeing his glasses on his nose, but suddenly realized the pictures were as clear as day. Not that he was pleased to see them. Tara scrolled through hundreds of images, picking out ones that showed Andrew with the tall, Nordic Adonis that was Ragnar Ingerman. And all the pictures were selfies of his current body (which Andrew had to admit, was stunning and had more than a passing resemblance to Tara, at least in her previous form. Was he now her twin?) nestled against Ragnar in some romantic pose or another in front of famous European landmarks. Andrew noticed that quite a few of them seemed to be in the famous Red Square in Moscow, his body hanging off Ragnar's business suit like it was little more than an overdressed accessory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god\" Was all Andrew could say. Was that what he was now? Just a pretty little piece of arm candy to a much older man?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara exhaled dramatically, her clearly no longer fully natural chest heaving in relief against the tight confines of the dress. \"Oh thank god you remember!\" She said, mistaking Andrew's words. \"You know I'm still super jealous, I would have gone after him first if you hadn't called dibs. But I wouldn't have met Harry then!\" Tara began swiping excitedly through her phone, away from pictures of Andrew and Ragnar and onto pictures of herself and a slightly portly man that Andrew could have sworn owned several car dealerships in the upper Illinois region, if he was remembering the commercials right. Was she married to him now? Or dating? Either way, right now it wasn't that pressing of a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Whatever changed me clearly changed her as well. If I'm...married...to Ragnar Ingerman, that must make me Andrea Ingerman!' Andrew said to himself, leaning back against the familiar leather couch that he had used many times, but now felt as strange and alien as his new body did. BECAUSE of his new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...now that you seem better, what do you want to do, sis?\" Tara asked, grabbing her purse and tossing her phone into it. From the darkness inside the massive storage container, the Ahn'Ger Stone softly glowed beneath a pile of makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Andrew, or rather Andrea, insists on asking more questions about his new life, much to Tara's worry. After losing the sibling argument, Andrea finds herself being carted off to the hospital for a head injury when Ragnar, Alexander and Joanna arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Andrew, or rather Andrea, plays along for now and eventually goes to his new home, the sprawling Ingerman estate outside of town. There, Andrew discovers that this isn't just a small change, but something that has changed the whole of reality itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: The newly changed Tara re-discovers the Ahn'Ger Stone, wondering what it is, why it was in her purse, and why it looks a little familiar. Seeing it as the possible cause of all this mess, Andrew snatches it away from Tara and tries to make a wish.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Continuity and additional edits made by Mr. Domino)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter asking several questions about his new life, Andrew is taken to the hospital. Tara believed her sister got a head injury when she fainted, causing partial amnesia. While there, Andrew meets his new husband, Ragnar, or Reggie, as he and his new sister Tara apparently called him, along with his new stepdaughter, Joanna and stepson, Alexander. While he'd never met Joanna and Alexander's biological mother, it was clear that, given the vast age difference between his new body and Ragnar, along with how attractive (and busty) this body was, he was just a trophy wife now, a stepmother to Ragnar's children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew's thoughts briefly turned towards wondering what had happened to his daughter, Vanessa, and if she even still existed since it seemed as though Andrew Chandler no longer even existed. Did that mean, since he never met or married his wife Charlotte, did Vanessa no longer exist? But before he could fall down that particular hole, he was pulled away by his new 'family' bursting into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoanna, being the kind soul she is, seemed very worried about her stepmother. Just as worried as her aunt was. Ragnar, was concerned, but his anger at the school board for supposedly causing this overshadowed that concern. And Alexander didn\u2019t really seem to care. Andrew also got to meet two new people who didn\u2019t exist a few hours ago as Tara's new family rushed to the hospital after a panicked phone call. Apparently, thanks to her wish indirectly giving her a new husband, Tara now has new children, a two year old son and three year old daughter, named Blake and Jasmine respectively. They didn\u2019t exist before the wish because Harry never got married. Of course, Andrew had no way of knowing this. He still didn\u2019t even know how all of this happened. He didn\u2019t know about the stone, or its ability to grant wishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t stand for this! That school will pay! It was bad enough giving my wife so much stress she fainted! But she even got amnesia! It\u2019s an outrage!\u201d Ragnar shouted, pulling out his phone and dialing his lawyer\u2019s number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-honey. There\u2019s no need for that.\u201d Andrew said, trying to stop him. He didn\u2019t want the school to suffer because of this ignorant, yet powerful family. \u201cI was just stressed. My memories will come back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they will, but I can\u2019t let them get away with this!\u201d He stepped out of the room as his lawyer answered the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAndrea, is Dad really going to have the school shut down?\u201d Joanna asked. Andrew looked at her, and he realized she was just as concerned about the school as he was. He knew she was a good girl. He even heard that she stood up to a bully for her boyfriend earlier today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoanna...s-sweetheart. I\u2019ll talk to your father about it.\u201d Andrew placed his hand on hers, trying to comfort her. It was strange to be so young again and addressing a girl that was only a few years younger than he currently was as 'sweetheart' in such a motherly way. On the surface, at least, it seemed like Joanna was a decent stepdaughter while Alexander just threw himself into one of the few chairs in the room and pulled out his phone without even saying hello.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Andrea.\u201d Joanna smiled at her. \u201cI\u2019m gonna step out for a moment and call Bill. We had a date planned tonight, but I\u2019m gonna cancel it so we can spend the night together. Be right back!.\u201d Joanna patted her stepmother on the hand and walked outside. It was only then Andrew realized how motherly he acted, placing his hand on Joanna\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018God, how the hell did this happen?\u2019 Andrew wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Tara gets angry about something, making another wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Tara gives the stone to Andrea as a get well soon gift.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tara felt dizzy as the world swirled around her in a green-gold blur. She felt like she was moving, almost falling, and she thrust out a arm to steady herself only to smack something soft and fleshy as the world snapped back into focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, like ow?\" Came an annoyed voice, and as Tara blinked the afterimages of the school hallway out of hervision, she could see that she was no longer even AT Shermer High. Instead all she could see was the annoyed looking face of her BFF Andrea Chapman as her hand was pressed against the other woman's not insignificant breasts that seemed held in place (however impossibly) by a small bright blue dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Uh, sorry...'Drea?\" Tara said in confusion. The trophy wife removed her hand from Andrea's boob and looked at it, before turning her gaze towards what else had changed. Instead of the school she was at...a winery? And around her were almost a dozen other women that all looked to be somewhat well off, all seated around a massive table that overlooked the nearby lake. Most of the other women were engaged in their own conversations, some looked angry, some joyful, some sufficiently intoxicated, given that Tara and every single other woman at the table had wine glasses in varying amount of fullness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething seemed off about this to Tara. She could have sworn she had just been in the dingy high school that her husband supported, listening to a bunch of blithering school staff chew her out about her stepson's supposed bad behavior...But hadn't she always been right here, with Andrea, Teresa, Lisa, Hannah, Veronica, the whole squad of girls that she'd either been friends with in the sorority or had met at parties with her husband, Ragnar and formed a bond with. Most of them were young like her, but a couple were older, but at the moment she couldn't really remember their names, for some reason. She felt like this wasn't right. She knew EVERYONE in their social group, and this was their weekly Girl's Night, where they rented the entire winery out for their own private party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, Tara?\" Andrea said as her annoyance turned to concern at the confused, almost scared look on her BFF's face as Tara scanned the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...Um, maybe? 'Drea...how long have we been here?\" Tara asked as she finally turned back to her dark haired sister in arms. She KNEW Andrea, they had grown up together, attended the same college together and had almost competed in men together, though Andrea had gone after a more younger man than Ragnar, in the end. She could feel her voice trembling as conflicting memories of some...other girl than she couldn't picture or name floated around in the part of her brain that was convinced she had just been at the high school. But any hope of answers was brushed off as Andrea's look of concern twisted into a chuckle and an eyeroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like geez Tara, you have had WAY too much to drink! We've been here for like two hours and you're already shitfaced? What, you on some sort of new pills or something that turn you into a lightweight?\" Andrea chuckled, \"C'mon, let's call your driver and get you home before you have to go hurl like last time. We're all done bitching about the high school anyway, Monica's already left.\" Andrea rose up from her chair and gave a little stumble as it was clear she was more than a little drunk herself, to which she just giggled. She held out a hand to Tara, who cautiously took it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'New...pills? What new pills?' Tara thought to herself as she was pulled upwards by her best friend. She stood for a moment and felt wobbly on her feet as suddenly the world took on a blurry edge. Was she really just drunk? She hadn't felt drunk a couple of seconds ago...Tara blinked it off and reached for her purse, sliding it onto her right shoulder as she allowed Andrea to guide her away from the table with a polite wave that barely any of the other women noticed. She was so lost in her own thoughts that she never heard Andrea call someone on her phone, or realize that the car waiting for her when they reached the entrance of the winery was her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here you go, Tara. Text me when you get home? I know Emile will get you there but I'll feel better knowing my BFF isn't hurling on the side of the road somewhere\" Andrea said as she loaded Tara into the backseat of a car that the trophy wife could have sworn she hadn't been driving before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara looked up at her best friend with bleery blue eyes, \"You're not coming with me? But...\" Tara said, suddenly scared to see what else had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl I have BARELY had anything to drink! Lisa and I were gonna meet up with Monica and Tiffany later anyway, and we're too old for sleepovers!\" Andrea said with a grin, \"Text me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Andrea slammed the door and minced off, her feminine rear rocking the blue dress as she went to rejoin the collected group of women that Tara was uncertain hadn't been there moments before. The sound of a small electric motor made Tara jump however, as the small privacy mirror that separated the back of the car from the front began to roll down, revealing a slightly portly, bearded man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, shall I take you home now?\" Tara's driver, Emile McLeod said, staring at his employer's wife through the rearview mirror with deep green eyes that seemed like they knew more than they should. Tara didn't like it, and turned away from his gaze, her eyes landing on her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara suddenly felt an overwhelming urge to dig through it. Maybe if she just got on her phone, the answers would be there...She clicked the white designer leather open and reached in with perfectly manicured nails, digging through the assorted cosmetic items, loose change, and other items in search of her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am? Shall we return to the house?\" Emile asked again, and something about the way the driver had said it finally tripped Tara's patience from confusion to annoyance, and she snapped her eyes up out of her search right as her fingers brushed against a certain green gemstone which caused it to glow softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: \"Yes Emile, take me home!\" Tara commands, and finally pulls out her phone, the Ahn'Ger Stone flopping out of the purse unnoticed and falling to the floor of the car. Later, at the Ingerman estate, the Stone is discovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Tara tells Emile to just drive around town while she pulls out her phone. Scrolling through her photos and social media, she finds out more about this reality that she's not quite sure is right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3:\"I wish you'd just shut up and drive, Emile!\" Tara says, her frustration and confusion being enough for the Ahn'Ger Stone. In a flash, the entire car is different, sleeker and more futuristic, along with the landscape outside.</span></div></div>",

For what it was worth, Jules had gotten off pretty easy all things considered. With Big Jon erased, replaced by the knockout Joanna, there was no one left in in the high school that could beat Rob in a fight for dominance, and Jules had, for a moment, feared he was getting one of Rob's sledgehammer-like fists ploughed into his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the giant of Shermer High had simply shoved him against the lockers, hard enough that his back was still hurting hours later, and simply grunted that Jules would be 'working overtime tonight'.

Pocket change he wouldn't even get to keep, assuming he even managed to score any!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance, near the library where the nerd clubs typically held their after school little queer clubs, Jules heard the indistinct murmur of conversation and the slam of a locker, With a sigh that was more of a grunt, he made a left near one of the locked lunchroom doors and stalked down towards the library. He was already in loser country, he knew that greasy little shit Matt Harris's locker was down this way and that blob with tits that he followed around because no one else would talk to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules rounded the corner and nearly plowed into the green-suited body of Mr. Krazinski, the school's disgraced janitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHIT\" The bully yelled as he took a awkward, off-balance step over Krazinski's mop bucket, causing him to stumble across the hall and crash painfully into the row of lockers. The pain in his back flared again as Jules regained his footing and turned on the older man, who was holding something green and shiny in his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! You all right, kid?\" The janitor said, looking concerned for a moment before realizing who it was. Earlier in the day the older man had been victim to one of Rob's longer pranks, a catfish game where Rob pretended to be the hot Spanish teacher and lured the poor man into confessing his love for her before Rob had pulled the plug. Jules had been there when it had happened, laughing along with the rest of the bullies, and any ounce of sympathy Krazinski might have had vanished in an instant as hate filled his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither the older man nor the malcontent teen saw the brief flash of light from the object in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you watch where' you're fucking standing old man!\" Jules hissed, pulling himself back together and leaping into the older man's face, \"Last thing you need is for me to go report your pedo ass, how would it feel if some trailer court shithead like me got you fired? Then you wouldn't be able to skeeve at all of us little kids anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now listen here-\" Krazinski started, but felt a flare of pain in his body as the bulky teen shoved him against the lockers, causing the green stone he had just found to tumble out of his hand moments before he curled it into a fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! you're such a fucking failure, you should go kill yourself, you're a fucking janitor! What kind of a fuck up do you have to be to end up like that?\" Jules shoved the older man again as the school janitor had tried to bend over, reaching towards whatever it was he'd dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW! Kid, stop!\" The old man croaked as his back flared in pain as he felt his spine collide with the latch of one of the lockers. He wanted to hit the little punk in front of him, dunk his head in the dirty mop water and teach the boy a lesson in respect, but that would surely get him fired. He'd already had to speak with the Superintendent, Andrew Chandler, about the rumors floating around school, he was already on thin ice. Just let the kid go, get that strange gemstone back, and then get back to work...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Mr. Krazinski had no chance, as Jules's head snapped downward as the bully spotted the gemstone as it glimmered oddly in the artificial light from the overhead florescent bulbs, like there was something inside that was twisting the light and flashing it into his eye. Whatever it was, Jules swooped a hand down and grabbed the teardrop shaped object in his hand, despite the graon of protest from the janitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but this is your 'in the fucking way' tax! You want it back, you can give me fifty bucks\" Jules sneered. He didn't actually know if the object in his hand was worth anything, but the janitor had seemed interested in it. If he didn't get anything out of the bag of bones in front of him, he could just go pawn it, or just toss it in the trash if it was some fake plastic shit. Whatever it was, he wasn't giving it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe janitor simply stared at Jules for a moment, then Jules's closed fist before muttering something under his breath, turning back to his mop bucket and pretending like the bully wasn't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's what I thought. Good fucking night\" Jules said, turning and stomping down the hallway, the confrontation having given him a much needed boost of energy and confidence and he strolled towards the library. He opened his palm to look at the thing he'd stolen; a shiny green teardrop that sat over another teardrop that looked like...gold? Whatever it was, Jules immediately knew that it was some kind of jewelry. Maybe the janitor was some kind of crossdressing faggot, or maybe one of the rich girls had dropped it earlier in the day, either way Jules had pawned enough jewelry that he knew it was worth something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just need to keep it under wraps. Rob'll kick my ass and take all of it if he finds out' A thought fluttered darkly in his mind, and Jules clenched his fist tight again. And it was something Bolstrum would do, as far as the much larger bully was concerned, Jules was here under orders, which meant most of the spoils belonged to the red haired behemoth that was his 'friend'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking Bolstrum\" Jules muttered as he came to a stop near the library bathrooms. He could hear the muted voices of nerds and other losers filtering out from the double doors and from at least one other classroom. He'd hide out in the men's and jump the little pricks as they wandered in. Jules would have done to the same to the girls bathroom but Rob had, for some dumb reason, a strict 'no touching girls' plicy that he made sure every single one of the his 'friends' followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And maybe that's your whole fucking problem Robbie' The bully muttered as he sauntered into the final stall and took a seat to wait for his first victim, 'Maybe if you were such a gyno you could have knocked Ingercunt on her ass a long time ago. We'd all be sitting pretty then. But no no, you just let her walk all over you, now I'm sitting here on a fucking toilet!'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules never saw the flicker of light between his fingers as he leaned back and closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe really, really wanted a smoke, but the smell would tip the geeks off and then he'd have nothing to show for it. So instead he simply sat there in silence, listening to the dull murmur of conversation from the nearby clubs and thinking about his situation and how unfair it was. He, oddly enough, started to feel a little lonely on his cold throne. The geeks, even if they were all losers, at least stuck together and seemed like they were having fun, yet Jules was all alone, his 'friends' (if he could even call them that) were elsewhere, probably making fun of him instead of actually missing his presence. He had had friends once when he was a kid. But that was a long time ago, before he and his dad had moved to Shermer after his mom died. They'd ended up in the trailer court where he'd met Rob, the sad, lonely kid falling under Rob's influence (largely due to not wanting to be on the receiving end of the larger boy's threats). Before long Jules was the first of Rob's growing gang of thugs, and his dad was too sad and drunk to even notice the boy wandering down the wrong life-path.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules shook his head to get rid of the existential thoughts and instead wondered if, given her little boytoy was a geek, if Joanna Ingerman was in one of those rooms, and how great it would be to get the benefits of being one of the rich girl's friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bully felt a strange tightness in his chest. It felt like he was angry, maybe even jealous of the nearby students? Either way, Jules didn't like the feeling, and was honestly a little confused as to where it was coming from. He gave the bathroom stall a pound with his fist, unaware of the small, steady glow within it now to get the weirdness out of his system as he grunted;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: \"Rob would just be nicer to me!\" With a flash of light, Jules finds himself no longer on the toilet, but back with Rob! But something was definitely wrong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: \"That I was one of Joanna Ingerman's friends!\" With a flash of light, Jules found himself out of the bathroom, sitting at a table next to Joanna Ingerman, who was talking to him! But wait, something seemed...off.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Had Jules been aware that the emerald gemstone he had stolen from the janitor was actually a magical artifact, one that had been slowly charging itself up for a wish while the bully had been silently fuming about his life, he might have chosen his next words differently. He might not have said anything at all, instead dropping the stone on the tile floor of the bathroom and letting the pent up angry energy dissipate before picking it up and inspecting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the bully had been completely unaware, too caught up in his anger at his so called 'friend' Rob Bolstrum and desiring the kind of friendship the kids in the library seemed to share with one another. And so Jules, staring up at the plain ceiling of the school bathroom and completely unaware of the green-gold light streaming out of the cracks in hist closed fist that held the stone, changed his life forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish Rob would just be nicer to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magical power that had been charging within the gemstone was released in a flash of light that, had it not re-written reality in an instant, would have caught the attention of the students in the school library. Instead, they simply continued on with their after-school activities as Jules Harper vanished from the halls of Shermer High, having now never been there at all. And as for Jules, the last thing he remembered before his reality was blasted away, was the feeling of falling, and darkness taking over the brilliant emerald light that was blinding him. And then there was the feeling of soft warmth covering him before consciousness left him entirely as his new reality settled in place around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BZZ BZZ BZZ BZZ*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe electronic racket caused Jules's eyes to snap open, darkness giving way to a softly lit room that, at the moment, more closely resembled a blurry oil painting. The only thing that stood out were the glowing read numbers that read <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><b>7:00am</b></span>, their brightness like knives stabbing at Jules's eyes. He squinted his eyes shut and shot out a hand, his fingers colliding painfully with hard molded plastic as his brain registered the familiar shape of his alarm clock sitting on the cheap bedside table he'd bought from a garage sale a few years ago, right next to his wallet, pocket knife and the ash tray he'd stolen from said garage sale. He grunted as pain suddenly shot through his skull, a dull pounding that coincided with a queasy feeling in his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Fuck, did I pass out?' Jules wondered, slowly registering that he was,in fact, in bed. How did he get there? Wasn't he just in the bathroom by the school library? Jules scrunched his eyes as the world swam more into focus, the bathroom seeming more like a fading dream now, but the alarm didn't wait for the bully to get his bearings as it continued it's synthesized shriek. He guided his hands across the surface and pushed the Snooze button, the alarm clock's wailing ending with a low beep as Jules let his hand go slack in relief as relative silence filled the bedroom. Outside were the familiar sounds of the Shermer Fields trailer court coming to life for the day, but everything else was quiet, normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe I just came home and got shitfaced. Probably explains the headache' The teenager said, pulling his arm back in under the warmth of the covers, willing himself to go back to sleep as the limb settled against two mounds of flesh that tingled as he brushed against the shirt that hung over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules's eyes snapped open once more, his head launching from his pillow as his arm rose upwards sending the small comforter flying off his body and exposing it to the world. Cold air rushed across small bare feet and two slender legs and sent a involuntary shiver through Jules's body as he stared in horror at himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, dressed in nothing more than a pair of plain panties and an oversized t-shirt, was a very feminine body that Jules was apparently attached to. He sucked in air as his eyes widened even more, his generous chest heaving upwards towards him as he simply stared in shock at the smooth, tan skin that covered his legs, the small hand that moved in front of his face, the strange tickle as brown hair fell in front of his vision and was now gently pulling at the back of his head. The weight of his large breasts and somewhat tubby stomach that was revealed as the t-shirt settled upon it's bulging form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Oh god. OH GOD\" The boy turned woman screamed, his new higher voice causing him to flail even more as a hand clasped his now slender throat. Another hand shot up to his face, Jules winced inpain as he poked himself in the eye with a nail that was certainly longer than he remembered it being, his tiny palm tracing around a much smaller nose and a set of lips that had no business being that puffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLY SHIT! HOLY SHIT!\" Jules screamed once more as he launched himself out bed and falling immediately on his face as his personal center of gravity failed to assert itself. But the flare of pain did nothing to stop him as Jules flailed about on the floor, a hand shooting inside the panties that hugged his feminine hips that simply confirmed what he already knew: His penis had been replaced by a womanly slit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\" Jules rolled across the floor as bile built up in his stomach, and he clambered to his new, tiny feet as stumbled his way out his bedroom door, hitting the hallway wall and guiding himself to the equally small bathroom on his end of the house, flicking on the light and collapsing in front of the toilet, breasts swinging wildly from the erratic movements as he gripped both sides of the porcelain throne and heaved, salty, burning tears filling his eyes as stomach acid made it's way out of his transformed body and into the water below. His new brown hair hung shook violently around him as his body arched and shuddered until it was finally spent, Jules collapsing in an exhausted heap against the bathtub rim and wiping a thick ribbon of spittle away, his face coated in sweat has he gasped for air, which only further reminded him of the massive orbs on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that was when he was given another surprise; the sound of feet padding down the hallway towards his bathroom, which he was starting to notice was filled with feminine products instead of it's usual spartan appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh shit, dad!' Jules thought in alarm, staring at the doorway in dread as he struggled to come up with some kind, any kind of reason to explain to his dad why Isaac Harper's only child, his son, was now a woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead of the haggard, bloated form of Jules's father, instead the hulking mass of someone else slid into view. Someone with a mess of short red hair and a face that looked as if the entire ugly tree had just decided to fall on it. Someone that was wearing nothing more than a pair of underwear that did little to hide the bulge of a cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Rob?\" Jules squeaked in surprise as his 'friend' or more accurately, his 'boss' in the previous reality leaned against the door frame and and rubbed his eyes with a hammer-like fist. \"What...What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it that bad this morning?\" Rob said with a yawn as he blinked away the last of the sleep in his eyes. The giant's nose wrinkled in disgust before he reached over and flushed the toilet, sending the contents of Jules's stomach into the sewer system. \"Bleh, must have been. Good thing your hair didn't get in it\". Rob rubbed his face with a massive palm before stretching it down towards Jules, or rather, Julie's bewildered form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, get off that floor and I'll take you back to bed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jules's mind was racing a million miles a minute. How was he a girl!? Why was Rob here!? Where was his dad!? What was Rob talking about!? WHY WAS HE A GIRL!? But despite all of this, the teenage boy turned girl felt himself reach out and take Rob's hand, bracing for the vice grip the larger bully often used but finding it to be surprisingly gentle, if a little firm. With barely any effort Jules felt himself being pulled upwards, his center of gravity wheeling once more as he fell against Rob's muscled, hairy chest. He looked up at Rob and realized that his new body was short. Not crazy short, but definitely shorter than he had been before, his head didn't even clear Rob's pecs! But the former bully saw something flash in his periphreal vision, and turned his head towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard Rob's voice rumble something, but Jules never heard what. he was enraptured by the face staring back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit\" Jules whispered as he stared at his reflection. Was this what he would have looked like if he was a girl? Large, bright blue eyes started out at him, a narrow, cute nose with nostrils that flared with every breath he took, agape, kissable lips that looked as if they already had an application of lipstick, and small, white teeth hiding behind them. There was a little bit of puffiness to his new face, seemingly because he was a little tubby now, but overall he wasn't too far from being a total knockout. Almost as if someone had mushed his face up with that Jane chick from Breaking Bad!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules watched one of Rob's large hands slid into the reflection and cupped his tiny chin, turning his head away from the mirror to look upwards at Rob's face, locking onto his brown eyes that, for the first time that Jules could remember, weren't glaring or filled with hate and rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, earth to Julie! you in there? Babe\" Rob said, his voice full of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules simply stared upwards for a moment before he realized he needed to respond. \"Oh, uh, yes? I mean yeah? It, uh, yeah I must have had too many beers last night!\" Jules thought it was a perfect enough answer, but Rob's face scrunched in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Julie, you haven't had a beer since you got pregnant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PREGNANT!?\" Jules screamed in alarm. He looked down in horrified realization at his bulging stomach, and then went limp in Rob's arms as he promptly passed out from the morning's final shock.</span></div></div>",

The rest of the bullies were assholes, other dead-enders in life whose futures were most likely dotted with long stretches of jail and prison time, much like any future Jules hoped to have if he continued down the path of being Rob Bolstrum's errand boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to think, if his mother had still been alive, if his dad wasn't a depressed drunkard that seemed to have forgotten he even had a son, maybe his life would have turned out different. Jules listened to the indistinct sounds of the clubs in the library and the abjoining vacant classrooms, wondering what they were doing. It sounded fun, at least.

The rest of the bullies were assholes, other dead-enders in life whose futures were most likely dotted with long stretches of jail and prison time, much like any future Jules hoped to have if he continued down the path of being Rob Bolstrum's errand boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giggle of laughter from two indistinct female voices floated into the restroom and Jules felt a throb of pain as the hard, cold toilet seat grew even more uncomforatble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob. Everything that had gone wrong with his life so far seemed to have stemmed from Jules association with the cruel neanderthal. And it wasn't as though he could say anything to Rob without either getting further 'punished' like he was being now or worse...getting the absolute crap knocked out of him by Rob's fists. Was Jules just meant to suffer? To forever serve at the whims of the larger, more powerful boy until one of them ended up moving away, in prison or worse, dead? A dark thought entered his mind, about how much Rob had been drinking since they'd been doing jobs for Alexander Ingerman, Joanna Ingerman's little brother. Maybe if Jules got Rob shitfaced and the gorilla tried to drive back to the trailer park...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, what the hell am I even thinking?\" Jules hissed to himself. He may have been angry at Rob but that wasn't any excuse to want him dead! But then then the conversation from the giggling girls swam into focus as they grew closer to the restrooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl you HAVE to show him who's boss! You're the one in charge! Tell him that he's got a choice; he can either buy you whatever you want, of YOU can get another boyfriend!\" Came a voice that Jules immediately recognized; Gloria Vanapolous, the 'bitch' of the high school's cheerleading team. She was hot, sort of rich, and everyone knew she was crazy. About the only person that seemed to stand her was her boyfriend, and even that seemed like a stretch at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you knew it was bad when the bullies occasionally felt sympathy for her long suffering boyfriend Tom Ackerton, even if the sports star liked to stick his face into other people's business. Like Rob's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just because YOU like drama doesn't mean I like it, Gloria! He doesn't have to pay for everything I just thought it'd be a nice gesture!\" Another feminine voice said, clearly annoyed. Jules only vaguely recognized it, but it had the tell-tale accent of another cheerleader. The sounds of clicking footsteps stopped for a moment and Jules heard the -clunk- of the water fountain's pressure bar being activated, followed by the gurgle of water as one of the girls was clearly getting a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why you never get good boyfriends Courtney! Meanwhile I can get Tom to do whatever I want!\" Gloria said, her voice haughty and very 'bolier than thou'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that why he said he wished he had a better girlfriend this morning after Joanna beat up Rob Bolstrum?\" Courtney said, her voice filled with smugness as the sound of clicking heels resumed down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bitch! How fucking dare you! I'll-\" Gloria's harpy shriek of a voice faded into echoed indistinctness as the two girls passed the bathrooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules couldn't help but smile despite the weird tightness in his chest. Gloria Vanapolous was such a bitch and everyone knew it and it was good that at least he wasn't the only one getting dunked on by his so-called 'friends'. But if there was ever someone that embodied #Firstworldproblems it was Gloria. The raven-haired former queen of the school liked to flaunt her family's upper middle class wealth, and before the shift in reality that had changed Jonathan Ingerman into Joanna Ingerman, had been the richest chick in Shermer and liked EVERYONE at school to know it. But even after the change she still liked to let others know that she was better than them, but this time, without having to play second fiddle to the infinitely more wealthy and the infinitely more kind Joanna, Gloria clearly couldn't get away with as much as she did before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Jules definitely thought she could stand to be knocked down a few more pegs. It was nice to see, or at least hear, someone who deserved it getting dunked on by their so-called friends. If only Jules could do that to Rob...But again the idle thought passed as the bitter tightness in his chest squeezed tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this, fuckin' anxiety?\" Jules hissed and gave the bathroom stall a pound with his fist, unaware of the small, steady glow in his tightly closed fist. He didn't want to be here, he wanted to be out having fun or home relaxing, but no no, here he was because Rob was more than capable of bossing him around, force him to continue being at school after hours and having to hear Gloria Vanapolous's stuck up bratty thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grunted in pain as his fist struck the metal latch of the stall door and he recoiled, frowning at the peeled skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuckin' great\" he hissed. And that was when he muttered the words...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: \"I wish I could boss Rob around for a change!\" In a flash, Jules vanishes from the bathroom, reappearing in his bedroom. Disoriented, he suddenly realizes there's someone else in the room with him! Was that Rob!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: \"I wish Gloria could see what it's like to be on the bottom for once!\" There is a flash of green light that surprises Jules, but nothing else appears to happen. Jules eventually goes home to the trailer park and discovers Gloria is now his neighbor!</span></div></div>",

And the Stone, released from it's fleshy cage as Jules hands scrambled for purchase, sailed free and bounced off the wall, landing on the un-made blue sheets that covered it's owner's (for the moment) bed. The boy lay there for a moment, stunned at what had just happened as he recovered his bearings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...what the hell!\" Jules whispered as he saw and smelled the familiar scents of his room, the faded Metallica poster on his closet door, the dated wood paneling that covered the rest of his room, the tiny TV and PS2 on the coffee table at the end of his single occupant bed that was hooked up to it but rarely used, the remnants of a past life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules could do little more than blink in stunned silence at what had just transpired. How did he get from the school back to home? Had..had he mixed up his cigarettes again and grabbed the one with the weed? Was the weed bad? Maybe he hallucinated or blacked out or something and wandered home...Jules fished the pack out of his pocket and stared at it in suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was when he became aware of the figure standing in the door way to the little-more-than-a-closet bedroom. The fading rays of sunlight as the ball of fire slipped behind the trees at the edge of the trailer court and caught their hair, making it shine a fiery, and familiar, red that caught his eyes, and Jules's head snapped to the intruder, his eyes going even wider as he realized who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas that Rob? Wait...no way!</span></div></div>",

His eyes locked on the red hair first, and his gut reaction was simply to blurt out \"ROB!?\". But then his brain caught up with his eyes, and he could see that the person at his bedroom door was most certainly NOT the hulking goliath that treated him like a slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feet were small, covered in a pair of sandals. Her legs seemingly went on for MILES until they reached a pair of jean shorts that looked like they barely fit on her wide hips, and something in her exposed belly button sparkled in the coming twilight. A pair of breasts large enough to rival Joanna Ingerman's pressed against the strained fabric of a white tank top that did very little to hide anything from the imagination, and two slender arms topped by red nails, one hand resting on her incredible hips while another one was pressed against the door frame. From her amble torso rose a shapely, slender neck that was topped by a stunning face that carried a pair of plump, kissable lips, a cute nose, a pair of glittering green eyes, high cheekbones and of course, a mane of fiery red hair that fell across her shoulders and down her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving gotten his attention, the girl gave Jules a smile and took a few steps into the tiny room, her breasts bouncing and jiggling with each minx-like step and pendulum sway of her hips until she was standing in front of Jules, her incredibly glory of sexy femininity on display for the down on his luck bully to view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules felt his jaw go slack as he took her in, and felt his cock begin to stiffen and rise painfully against the threaded confines of his underwear and black jeans. This girl...no, this WOMAN was easily the redheaded version of Joanna Ingerman. And maybe a little more trashy, as she carried herself with a more casual ease than the refined poise that the blonde haired Amazon did. But there was something about her something...off, that sent a warning bell off in his head. Where had she come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, oh no fucking way!' Jules thought as he suddenly remembered that weird stone, but any further thought was blasted from his mind as the woman in front of him leaned over, giving Jules a look into the grand canyon of cleavage, and with a single finger reached out under his slack mouth and pressed it shut, her silky smooth skin shooting through him like an electric shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: \"C'mere loverboy...\" The woman purred in a voice that was almost sex incarnate, and fell into Jules's arms as she kissed him. Passionately. Afterwards, Jules discovers that this beauty is his loving, extremely obedient girlfriend, Roberta Bolstrum!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: \"I don't know why the FUCK I'm a chick or why I'm in your house, but you're gonna help me fix this, J!\" The woman growled, staring down at herself in horror and fury. Rob is still still Rob, even though everyone else now knows him as Roberta Bolstrum, Jules's extremely obedient girlfriend!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jules was practically drooling over the sexy redheaded woman that was bent over in front of him, her massive cleavage almost beckoning him to bury his face in it's soft embrace. And then she touched him, pressing his slack jaw closed with her fingers and her smooth flesh sent an electric shock through his body as both rows of teeth softly clicked against each other. And then she smiled again, her large lips splitting to reveal perfect teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules felt his member poking painfully against the restricting fabric of his boxers and jeans, and he swallowed with an audible gulp. He began to reach out towards her, to pull her in tight... But then the smile on her face vanished and she suddenly pulled away, clumsily stumbling over herself until she collided with the cheap sliding doors that hid Jules's closet from view. She looked at Jules as if seeing him for the first time, her sculpted brow furrowing in confusion before she looked down at herself, her tiny hands shooting up to cradle the massive breasts that now hung off her form. It didn't take more than a second for her face to turn from confusion to fear and rage as she screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE FUCK WHAT THE FUCK\" She screeched, her hands releasing her breasts and pulling at the skimpy clothes that barely covered her new form. She backed further into the closet door, pressing her full weight against it and the cheap plastic and metal snapped, causing her to let out another screech of fear as she tumbled backwards into the closet. A red-tipped hand grabbed the single rod that held up Jules's rather meager wardrobe, but instead of saving her it simply snapped from the wall and collapsed upon her, burying her in an assortment of t-shirts and jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence as both Jules and the woman were too stunned to speak, but then the redhead was clawing her ways out of the pile of clothes, fighting against her own sensual bulk and the forest of hangers and fabric. Jules cautiously held out a hand and without hesitation the woman took it and pulled herself upwards with a feminine grunt and a surprisingly strong tug, pulling herself to her feet and Jules directly into her, his face finally colliding with her massive tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another moment of silence as Jules's mind definitely came to the conclusion that this was the best feeling ever, and then the feeling was replaced with pain as the woman pushed him away and socked him straight in the gut with a tiny but furious fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get the FUCK off me, J!\" She growled. It was clearly meant to be intimidating but her husky voice made it sound almost sexual, not that the dark haired boy cared too much, the punch to the stomach knocking the air out of his lungs and causing him to collapse backwards onto his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the FUCK am I a chick!? Why the FUCK am I in your house!? Where the hell are the other guys!? Are they chicks too!? WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED!?\" She barked as Jules gasped for air, writhing on the bedspread and curling his sheets into a ball, the forgotten Ahn'Ger Stone finding itself becoming entombed in the cheap fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guh!\" Was all Jules could manage, but that didn't satisfy the redhead as she grabbed him by the cuff of his shirt and hauled him upright as he wheezed, air re-entering his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better have a answer for me, shitnugget, or I'll kick your fucking ass like I should have done this morning!\" She hissed, spinning him around in the small space and glaring up at him with a pair of emerald green eyes as her gorgeous face, twisted in anger and rage though it may have been, filled Jules's vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This morning? Wait, OH SHIT, ROB!?\" Jules swore as realization hit him like another fist to the gut. He tried to step backwards but there was simply no room, no way to escape from the angry beauty that was glaring at him in a VERY familiar way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the hell else would it be, shithead?\" Rob said, palming Jules in the face and smushing his features, making his still semi-hard cock tingle at the touch of how good Rob's new skin felt. The changed bully himself scooted, as best that he could without bumping his enormous rack against the other teen, towards the bedroom door where there was a little more room. Finally free of the tight confines, Rob looked down at himself again, staring into the cleavage he now possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit\" He whispered, pushing the long strands of silky red hair that fell in front of his vision and pooled on the soft tissue that stuck out from his body like a pair of mountains. He stared at how tiny his hand was, how slender his tattooed arms were, the lack of bulging muscle, the lack of scars or forests of hair. The red nail nails that tipped fingers that looked as skinny as toothpicks. Rob used those small hands to cup his breasts, feeling the heavy weight of their fatty mass lessen for a moment as they filled and spilled over hands that could once palm basketballs with little effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a tingle in his new nipples that shot through his body and ended in the void between his legs, a sudden feeling of excitement, a brief feeling of warmth that exploded, and he let go of his new breasts immediately, watching as their personal physics jiggled with the return of gravity.  This was real. This was actually happening. And the worst part was that despite the fact he was in a body that was the exact opposite of his own and should have felt completely alien...But it felt completely normal. Or rather, it didn't feel as different as it should have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta see this\" He whispered, turning on a corked heel and rushing out the bedroom door at the door, pausing for just a moment to look at Jules over his shoulder and past the waterfall of red hair, his eyes widening as he quickly raced through the door and turned left, taking a handful of minced steps until he was in the trailer's single bathroom. He fumbled for the light-switch, banging his nails painfully against the wall and hard plastic before they found purchase on the switch, flipping it up and the tiny room, not much larger than Jules's own, was lit in a faded yellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohmygod\" Rob gasped as he saw his reflection in the mirror. It was no wonder Jules had been looking at him like that when he'd finally come too after...whatever had happened. He was in the body of a walking wet dream. His mane of hair was silky smooth, and a deep lush red, redder than his original hair had ever been, and it was EVERYWHERE. It hung down to his round, small shoulders and down his back, it was on his massive boobs. The former man had only ever had buzzcuts, and he routinely beat up what he saw as 'faggy little punks' that wore their hair long, or in those fucking awful manbuns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd his boobs. They were even more enormous than they looked from his first person perspective, pressing against the white tank top he now wore as it the fabric was just painted on. His stomach was taught and toned, just the hint of muscle and a fucking naval piercing? He touched it gently and immediately recoiled at the foreign object that was attached to his new body. His arms were decked out in full sleeve tattoos, roses and thorns and bleeding hearts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'At least it's nothing too girly' He thought to himself, mourning the loss of his muscles. This new body wasn't completely just boobs and the new massive ass and hips that strained the tiny shorts he now wore, but it was little more than superficial. If it wasn't for how...punky, he looked, Rob could have easily mistaken his new body to belong to a cheerleader. He threw a look to Jules, who was now standing in the hallway staring at him, and not completely with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sent a shiver through Rob's body and caused the various attractive fat to jiggle once more as he turned away, looking closer into the mirror at his new face. It lacked the scars, the stubble, his cheekbones were high, his nose looked smaller, and his wide eyes glittered green at he stared at himself. He reached up and felt his new face, running a ringer along the plump red lips that had replaced his near permanent snarled ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you sorta look like that chick from the giant shark movie\" Jules said with some hesitation. Rob turned to look at his lackey again, confusion on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Asian chick? Think you need to have your eyes checked, fucko\" He snorted, though it came out as more of a huff as he turned back to his reflection, cautiously running his hands over his curves as he turned slowly in front of the tiny mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not her, the white chick that had the short hair! I think she plays Batwoman? Shit what was her name?\" Jules said, stumped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't she supposed to be a dyke?\" Fuck, that's the last fucking thing I need right now\" Rob groaned, and immediately regretted how sexy it sounded in his new voice. Fuck, why did everything he do turn out sexy!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules was about to respond when he heard the front door to the trailer slam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Im home. Picked up a shandwich\" A gruff, slurred voice called out. Jules's eyes went wide. \"Oh shit, dad's home! Uh, just, uh maybe hide or something?\" He hissed to Rob as he started down the hallway, not noticing Rob's new body suddenly go stiff and those angry green eyes cloud over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, dad!\" Jules called out to his dad, who was stumbling into the small kitchen area, setting a McFly's takeout bag on the counter as he pulled open the fridge door and pulled out a six pack of Brier's, the local cheap beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mr. Harper!\" Came a voice from behind him, and Jules turned to see Rob standing there, grinning like a moron with his new teeth, a tiny hand raised timidly behind Jules's shoulder. Wait, why did his eyes look so weird?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeeey Bobbi! You should have told me sche was gonna be here, boy. Would have got her a burger too\" Frank Harper said as he looked towards his son and his girlfriend, feeling a pang of envy that somehow, his son had managed to hook up with one of the most attractive girls in town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules just blinked in confusion. Why was Rob acting like that? What was going on!?</span></div></div>",

One delicate hand was raised above Jules\u2019s shoulder in a cute wave, and the other was gradually curling its way across his waist like an affectionate, vine-clad python.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperately, he tried to put the smooth softness out of his head and think of an excuse. \u201cY-yeah, Dad, we were just gonna\u2014!\u201d Rob tightened his grip, an <i>extremely</i> contented hum escaping his lips. \u201cG-get out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, but <i>Juulee</i>,\u201d whined the currently-bodacious figure. \u201cI thought we could stay <b>in</b> tonight...\u201d A red-tipped finger traced a circle on his back and Jule\u2019s breath caught in his throat. What the fuck was Rob doing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis dad looked from his son to the girl practically hanging off of him, and back to his son again. Paternal instincts long-unused started to stir and, after heaving a heavy sigh that stunk of booze, he started to lope to their little nook of a TV room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink I\u2019ll watch the afterschhow now,\u201d he called over his shoulder, throwing in a bloodshot wink for good measure. \u201cEarsh ain\u2019t workin\u2019 sho good, so gonna have to turn the knob <i>real</i> high.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob giggled \u2014 giggled! \u2014 as the plywood door slammed shut behind his dad. As promised, the muffled static pop of the CRT turning on slunk out through the doorjamb, the sports-network noises that followed loud enough to shake the trailer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s get some food in you before the happy ending!\u201d chirped Rob, sauntering over to the small table after snagging the McFly\u2019s bag. Jules stared at the swaying denim bulges, mind racing. This\u2026 wasn\u2019t Rob. Fuck, this wasn\u2019t <i>anyone</i> he knew, this was a wet dream on two long legs! What did dad call her? Bobbi?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, siddown!\u201d The redhead tapped the fraying upholstery of the dinner table\u2019s bench, half a greasy cheeseburger in her other hand. \u201cWe can share!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules complied, awkwardly sidling into the squeaky seat and next to the jubilant bombshell. Yup. This felt real. Bobbi looked real. Best not to question it. Getting chewed out in his bedroom was just some kinda psychotic break. Mhm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he questioned his reality, Bobbi stretched her arms and let out a cute squeak of a yawn, stretching her long legs out and over his lap, trapping him and his now-raging erection. Jules swallowed as she scooted closer and closer, until she was near enough to feel the voluminous flesh underneath her jean shorts. \u201cSay aah~\u201d cooed Bobbi, waggling half of the greasy sandwich in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuckit. He\u2019d rough up some geek for Xanax tomorrow. Jules opened his mouth and closed his eyes, not noticing his potential\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s eyes gain a familiar, glittering sheen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobbi let out a strangled squeak, and still, no meat entered Jules\u2019s mouth. \u201cWhassamatter?\u201d he mumbled, opening his eyes just to see the fast-food flying toward his face at supersonic speeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcFly\u2019s secret sauce splattered over the bully\u2019s face as the girl scrambled out of the confines of the dinner table, accidentally slamming a heel against \u2018Lil\u2019 Jules\u2019 in the escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJESUS FUCK WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK,\u201d babbled what was now becoming increasingly obvious was Rob, though Jules was too preoccupied with the intense, burning pain to respond<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob held his hands out in front of him, flexing each delicate digit individually. That\u2026 wasn\u2019t him. He didn\u2019t feed his flunkies fucking hamburgers, and he sure as hell didn\u2019t practically sit in their goddamn laps, making moon eyes at their stupid retard faces!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, bereft of anyone to really blame besides himself, Rob shifted his rage towards his usual target, who was currently recovering from his dick-kick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b><i><u>You.</u></i></b>\u201d hissed Rob, trying his very best (and failing) to not sound remotely sensual. Jules, both hands on the table in an attempt to recover, looked up at the babe charging towards him like a CoverGirl rhinoceros.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, his face was ensconced in the small hand, red nails digging painfully into his cheeks. \u201cTell me what you fucking did, J,\u201d growled Rob, hot minty breath gusting against Jules\u2019s face. \u201cWhat kinda faggy MKUltra bullshit did you fucking pull?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha\u2026?\u201d managed Jules, his eyes momentarily dipping down to the valley of flesh right in front of him. In response, Rob let out a quite unmanly screech and released his face, scooting backward with an arm across his prodigious chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>That</i>. Right fucking there! Turn me into some Ingerbitch knockoff and fucking incept me into some fucking bimbo, you piece of shit? I <i>never</i> shoulda let you in the gang!\u201d Jules watched the redhead rage with a familiar dread mounting in his stomach, memories of disciplinary beatings disconcertingly close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a tiny fist raised in the air and a contralto yawp, Rob jiggled towards the flinching Jules, who\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Jules, with his hands held up to his head, yells \u201cStop!\u201d at the raging Rob who\u2026 listens, for some weird reason?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Because he\u2019s able to fend off the much-weaker Rob\u2019s attacks, Jules explains to the furious flame-haired female what happened \u2014 with a bit of editorialization \u2014 in the bathroom stalls.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rob let out a feral scream that sounded more like a sexual moan as he lunged at Jules, tiny fist raised and what little muscles he had tensed. He'd kick the little bastard's ass and then he'd figure out just HOW this nightmare happened, and get out of this walking wet dream body! He darted across the cheap, peeling linoleum floor on the strange heeled sandals that were freezing his feet off and with a grunt swung his fist directly at so-called friend's face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Only to miss as Jules sidestepped Rob's wobbly attack, and the newly buxom redhead collided with the cabinets behind the table with a high pitched 'oof!' followed by a girlish squeal as Rob felt his right arm twist behind his back and then suddenly pain flared across his newly enlarged chest as he was pressed against the messy table and his free arm was pinned. His mane of red hair was across everything, it had knocked the take out bag off the table, it had draped itself across the un-spoiled half of the burger that...other him had divided up, there were stray toppings from the destroyed one curling into his locks as Rob unintentionally frenched the table as he struggled to free himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go!\" The bully whined as he struggled weakly against Jules' grip. He couldn't stand how weak he was now, and he definitely didn't like the pressure of his lackey's crotch pressing against his rather bodacious butt. It felt horribly wrong...Yet some part of his mind could help but feel a little turned on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if you'd fucking calm down!\" Jules hissed from behind. He was trying very hard not to get turned on, his member still throbbing from the dick-kick moments ago, but there was just not much hope as his sore johnson began to grow hard again as Rob wiggled against him in vain. Jules couldn't believe how easy it was to overpower Rob now. He would have NEVER been able to do this before! And he'd watched Rob do it enough time to wannabe tough guys and other members of the gang that happened to smart off to the giant, and even Jules himself had been a victim of it twice. He'd eventually picked up on how to do it himself. It was almost fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Whatever you did, fix it right now you little shitbag!\" Rob squealed again and struggled to lift himself up, only for Jules to double down on the pressure. He flailed some more and felt a strand of his new hair catch on something sticky...with promptly, with his squirming, flipped it right in his pretty face as the smell of mayonnaise filled his nostrils. He managed to crane his head back just enough to glare at Jules but farther behind his 'friend' he saw the leering face of that old drunk fuck Frank as the older man peered out through the cheap plywood door of the master bedroom, a crooked, sloppy grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thatta boy!\" Frank chuckled to himself. He didn't mean to catch his son and Bobbi in the act but the loud noises and shaking from the kitchen had roused him from his near stupor. He'd opened his bedroom door to see his son mounting the beauty on the kitchen table, and he couldn't help but grin as he stared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen that...something happened again. The moment Rob made eye contact with Frank it was like a switch had flipped in his brain. His eyes took on a different shade of green as SHE opened for business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, harder baby!\" Bobbi moaned as she pressed herself against Jules's rock steady body. And cock. It felt SOOOO good against her, she just needed to have it! She bit her lower lip in anticipation as she began to grind against the throbbing rod in her lover's pants as her slit exploded with heat and wetness. She needed Jules, and she needed him now! Her fingers clenched in and out, her toes curled in her sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it to me daddy! Right now!\" She moaned as her body built towards ecstasy, the furnace between her legs radiating heat as she reared upwards to Jules's surprise, her back arched, her breasts swinging heavily to and fro as her body was wracked with desire...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank had seen enough. Drunk as he was, he knew that as a father he shouldn't perv on his son and his girlfriend. He chuckled to himself and shut the custom built door, shambling back to his bed, his six pack of beer, and sports.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules was at a loss of what the do, having been facing the wrong way and had not seen or heard his father making his presence known once more. Suddenly Rob had just switched over again, becoming the gorgeous girl that was clearly either just really horny, or madly in love with him. He had lessened his grip just enough for her to move, no longer trying to fight the raging member straining against his pants, a missile seeking the heat source that was grinding against it, instead the teenager was now trying to fight the mental urge to simply let go of Rob...Bobbi and rip his and hers pants off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just...hold...on...' The rational part in his mind struggled as it was slowly overtaken by his now raging sex drive, 'He could...turn back...any second!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Doit. Do it do it do it doit doitdoitDOITDOITDOIT!' the larger portion of his brain screamed, and the right as he was about to give in, to rip off the thin barriers of fabric separating him from Bobbi, he felt her rocking form grow stiff and still once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy FUUUUUUUUCK!\" Rob screamed as HE took over once more. What was...What was happening!? What was this feeling!? It felt so...so good! Rob let out a heavy moan as his entire body shuddered violently in Jules's grip, and then he felt exhausted. He went limp, all his energy spent for the moment. His hair and breasts hung limply in the air and he panted heavily, a sharp, high pitched wheeze as he felt something wet in his new panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh...oh my GOD!\" Rob gasped, \"J...Just...Just let me go, I can't-fuckin' can't breath\" Was all Rob could get out as he slumped lower towards the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules hesitated, once again caught in the lurch as he struggled to understand what was happening. Why was Rob flipping back and forth between being his typical asshole self and what was clearly a girl that wanted nothing more than to fuck him!? How was any of this even real!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please J! I'm not...not gonna fight anymore. Please?\" Rob said more quietly, his voice taking on a begging quality to it that Jules had never heard before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Jules' brain told him a variety of different things to do in the moment, but he ultimately went with letting go of Rob's arms and backing away slowly, his hands raised and muscles tensed just in case the buxom bully tried anything. Instead he just slumped against the table for a moment, wheezing like a very attractive fish before slowly pulling himself up and turning to face the dark haired boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, for the love of fucking god, tell me what you did to me J\" The redheaded woman pleaded again, her face twisted in confusion and what lookedl ike the edge of tears. She looked down at herself in disgust and reached a sweaty hand down to her jeans and pulled them away from her body, face twisting in revulsion at whatever she saw within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Should...Should I tell him? What if he just switches again in the middle of it? God I can't tell if this is the best or worst thing that's ever happened to me!' Jules thought, and for a moment he considered simply running to his room, blocking the door and trying to find that magic Stone. But what if something else happened and Rob suddenly got strong again? The last thing Jules needed was to end up in a similar fate if Rob got his hands on that clearly magical artifact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, J!\" Rob begged again, and Jules made his decision. With a long sigh, the bully rubbed his face and looked at Rob's own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I know, Rob, is that you had me on fleece patrol. I was waiting in the toilets by the club rooms at school and...\" Jules paused for a moment, taking another breath, \"...And then I said 'I wish I was home on my bed!' and poof, here I was! And then there YOU were , looking like that! I can't fucking tell you what happened because I. DON'T. KNOW! Ok!?\"Jules backed up a few steps, staring into Rob's harsh green eyes as they scrunched together. Good, he still 'looked like' Rob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Huh, I guess eyes really ARE the windows into the soul!' Part of him quipped, but he shoved it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tha doesn't make any fucking sense! Magic...Magic isn't fucking real! It's just something those faggots talk about when they play those faggy games!\" Rob hissed as he shifted his hips. The wet spot in his panties was growing cold and it felt, well, awful against his skin. God, this was the worst night of his life! Even worse than when his dad left! Jules HAD to be lying, the little shithead KNEW what happened! He hesitated!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob summoned his strength and stood a little taller and took a single step towards Jules, trying his best to look intimidating in a body that was built to be anything BUT. \"Tell me what really happened! Tell me or I'll...I'll...I'll say you raped me!\" Rob threw out the only threat he could think of that might actually make Jules stumble a bit. There was no reason to threaten violence anymore, Rob just wouldn't be able to win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What? Hey fuck you Little Mermaid! That's what happened! I sat there waiting for the clubs to end and then I said 'I wish I was home' because I didn't WANT to be there! I lean back and poof, I'm here and this insanity started! Maybe one of those little bastards got a hold of a real magic spell or something that changed you into this! Or maybe...Maybe Gloria Vanapolous had something to do with it! She was bitching to some other girl about her boyfriend, maybe she's a witch or some shit! All I know is I teleported home and you're standing in front of me looking like you're about to kiss me or something!\" Jules spalyed his arms wide and gave Rob the largest shrug that he could. It was the best excuse, but Jules wasn't going to reveal that magical rock. Not yet, at least. He'd figure out if he still had it, if it still worked...And maybe he'd have a little fun with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, what was the rush?</span></div></div>",

Jules\u2019 face \u2014 without any twitch of a frightened lip or any eye widened by terror \u2014 might have well been a brick wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bully huffed, flipped a lock of mayonnaise-encrusted hair over his shoulder, and crossed his arms underneath his heavy chest, all the while trying not to think about how damn <i>girly</i> that all must look. It may well be true that Jules was a lying piece of shit, but if so\u2026 what could he do about it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tiny seed of impotence-laden fear settled into the pit of his stomach, but he compartmentalized it as quickly as it came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules, meanwhile, was trying to keep his poker face. The list of people he\u2019d trust with a wishing stone was, unsurprisingly, quite short. It started and ended with him \u2014 and maybe his dad, on the rare occasion that he wasn\u2019t piss-ass-drunk. Rob Bolstrum wasn\u2019t anywhere <b>near</b> that list, and if he was, Jules would probably go check himself into some kinda institution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh god, it <i>had</i> to be in his bedroom, right? It couldn\u2019t still be in the bathroom?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried his best to look innocent-yet-relaxed and not at all like he was freaking out about how his one chance at being someone might be resting on piss-stained linoleum. Rob shot him some serious side-eye and he tried his best to twist his face into the light annoyance of the unjustl accused<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s what innocent people looked like, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his relief, Rob heaved another sigh and, after grimacing at how his tits jostled, finally faced Jules. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, J. So, I believe you, or whatever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules felt muscles that he didn\u2019t know that he <i>had</i> relax. \u201cYeah, I <i>told</i> you \u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what\u2019re we gonna do about this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules blinked owlishly. \u201cWha\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob took a step closer to Jules, who couldn\u2019t help but retreat. \u201cYou heard me. What\u2019re we gonna <i>do</i>? You\u2019re not \u2014\u201d A quick, manic giggle spilled out of Rob\u2019s lips, his eyes darting from every object in the trailer except Jules. \u201cYou\u2019re not gonna let me <i>stay</i> like this, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules took another step back, but Rob matched his pace. \u201cUh, I\u2014\u201d Shit, were those <i>tears</i> in Rob\u2019s eyes?<br>\r\n\u201cLike, uh, <b>-hic-</b> you know I\u2019m not <i>gay</i>, right, J?\u201d Rob continued, words spilling faster and faster with every second, small hiccupy sobs interspersed throughout. \u201cThat <b>hic</b> girl earlier, she\u2019s the one who <b>-hic-</b> said all that bullshit and <i>it wasn\u2019t me you believe me right</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules blinked again. Rob was <i>really</i> close and <i>really</i> weepy, putting a lot of guilt into his half-chub. This was just like, hormones or something, right? And <i>oh shit was Rob not wearing a bra</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules closed his eyes and took a deep breath, trying to muster up the feeble dregs of good that hadn\u2019t been stomped out of him. Slowly, he put his hands on Rob\u2019s shoulders and moved the redhead to a safe, non-boner-encouraging distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Rob, I believe you,\u201d Jules said, opening to his eyes to a relieved grin he could <i>almost</i> describe as cute if his former boss wasn\u2019t behind it. \u201cBut, uh, what <i>do</i> you want to do about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob\u2019s smile vanished, but Jules kept plugging on. \u201cI mean, we could go see a priest or something, but after we egged St. Laurence\u2019s, I don\u2019t think any of \u2018em would see us.\u201d He refrained from adding an <i>if</i> in there to refrain from freaking out the fiery redhead. Well, uh freak him out <i>more</i> \u201cThere\u2019s also, uh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped talking when he took in Rob\u2019s newly-affixed expression; all screwed up into an angry pout, tears starting to leak out of his emerald eyes. \u201cFine then, <b>-hic-</b> <i>asshole</i>! You\u2019ve always <b>-hic-</b> been a piece of <i>ungrateful</i> shit, and, and\u2026\u201d He swiped a thin wrist underneath his nose, leaving a thin trail of slime underneath it. \u201dI hope you <i>DIE</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob turned on a dime and slammed open the trailer\u2019s cheap plastic door, wiggling out the opening as fast as his long legs could carry him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules scratched the back of his head. That\u2026 wasn\u2019t really what he was expecting. Nor was it\u2026 the ideal outcome. Sure, he got Rob out of the house, but he didn\u2019t really feel <i>great</i> about it: he had done a <i>lotta</i> shit in Rob\u2019s little bully-clique, but never anything to <i>chicks</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgggghhhh,\u201d Jules groaned, massaging the bridge of his nose. Fuck, was this what those scrawny nerds felt like all the time? All guilty n\u2019 stuff about shit? And, fuck, was he feeling <i>bad</i> for <i><b>Rob</b></i>?! Would Rob even spare him a second thought if he were the babe? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA phlegmy cough sounded from the other side of the trailer. Jules leveled his gaze at his dad\u2019s bloodshot one, who was peeking out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really get what you two were shcaying,\u201d he began, before pausing to take a swig out of a brown-glass bottle. \u201cBut, uh, Jules.\u201d His head poked out of the door like a balding thumb. \u201cYa schouldn\u2019t let a girl that loves ya that musch go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rickety door slapped shut before Jules could get a word in edgewise. Fuck, was his life some fuckin\u2019 romcom chick flick now? Was the entire fuckin\u2019 universe conspirin\u2019 to have him meet Rob at some location, where they\u2019d run into each other\u2019s arms and <i>wait what if he found the stone at the school</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so only half-motivated by his withered conscience, Jules sprinted out the door, searching desperately for a glint of red hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob, in the meantime, was learning the frustrating minutiae of running in the body of a teenage wet dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was that his fuckin\u2019 hair was more of a nightmare than he ever could\u2019a imagined. If he didn\u2019t have it tucked firmly underneath a soft bicep, it flew behind him like a sprinter\u2019s parachute, stymieing any attempt at speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second was that boobs fucking <i>hurt</i>. Two masses of flesh slamming into his ribs with the kinetic force of a beanbag-shotgun, occupying his other arm with what felt like twenty-fuckin\u2019 pounds of tit-flesh. Also, he wasn\u2019t even wearing a goddamn bra! Er, well, he\u2019d never wear one: he wasn\u2019t some swishy faggot, but the girl renting out his headspace apparently thought it was a good idea to wear pink heart stickers \u2014 what were they called, pastries? \u2014 instead of, like, an undershirt or something. Go fucking figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third was that tears in your eyes made it <i>incredibly</i> hard to navigate a trailer park at dusk; he nearly broke his fuckin\u2019 ankle in these heeled sandals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slammed a fist into the mud. It was this <i>fuckin\u2019</i> <b>body</b>! He was Rob goddamn Bolstrum, and he didn\u2019t cry just \u2018cuz the only person who might have an idea of what he was going through didn\u2019t want to\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother hiccupy sob wracked Rob\u2019s body, but he shook it off. Just, well, without shaking, because any more jiggling might make him cr\u2026 HICCUP again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, he needed to actually learn how to get outta here. Fuckin\u2019 Jules and his fuckin\u2019 trailer. Rob trotted up to a small building \u2014 the only one without wheels in a square mile \u2014 and peeked in the lit window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rather rotund lady who looked like she was pushing her fifties sat at a desk, occasionally scribbling something into a sudoku puzzle. Rob clenched his hand into a fist, long fingernails leaving crescent-moons in the soft flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust go in, go out, and don't let that fuckin\u2019 bimbo take control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob swung the screen door open, and....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jules's trailer was near the front of the trailer court, so the building had only been about a hundred or so feet away. Still hadn't stopped him from almost face planting in the mud, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't actually just a random building, but a slightly crumbling brick house that had been there long before the rest of the trailer court had. It was the 'front office' of Shermer Fields, the first (and sometimes last) thing most people that lived in the sizable collection of dilapidated mobile homes would see. But the owner of the trailer court didn't live there, instead it was the Superintendent's house. Whoever actually owned the park was something Rob didn't actually know, but he'd been to the one story house plenty of times before. Typically it was about yet another endless problem that plagued the run-down Bolstrum family trailer, or to deliver a (typically late) check on behalf of his lazy bitch of a mom. Rob and the Super, Lou Reed, didn't get along very well, but his wife Peggy was always nice to him, and one of the few adults in Rob's life that he didn't feel some form of hatred towards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob had a plan of sorts. Jules's dad seemed to recognize the...girl side of him, but who knew how any of this was actually supposed to work? Maybe it was just Jules's house that made the new switch in his brain flip over and make Rob become 'Bobbi'? Or now that he 'was' Bobbi...Maybe he lived somewhere else?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were just so many questions that Rob had and that little lying shitfuck hadn't given him any answers. He'd just have to find some himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grimaced as his new additions bounced with each small step he took up onto the house's front porch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You got this, Bolstrum' He said to himself as he carefully walked across the positively ancient wood planks that made up the porch, the fading twilight casting long shadows that the single pale yellow bulb did little to get rid of. 'You just walk in, ask the Super's wife where this...bimbo lives, and then you walk out. J ain't here so you're not NOT gonna turn into that brain dead cunt, you're NOT gonna start crying! Just walk in, get directions and walk out. You got this!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former man took a deep breath and tried his best to ignore the rising twin peaks that currently hung off his torso. Their weight was so alien and uneven, how they shifted and bounced inside of the strained fabric of his new t-shirt. He reached out with a hand that felt comically small and gripped the screen door's handle and with a final burst of adrenaline and false confidence, he pulled the screen door open and marched into the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the moment the door had swung open, and the moment Peggy's eyes had spotted Rob as he crossed the threshold, all that confidence vanished as Bobbi returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who...Oh, Bobbi honey, you scared the me!\" Peggy said, giving the girl a soft smile. But the smile was short lived as the young woman froze mid-stride, her eyes wide in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Oh Mrs. Reed, I'm...I'm so sorry I just wasn't paying attention and...and\" Bobbi stuttered as her large green eyes filled with tears. She sniffled and turned away, a hand reaching for the door handle as she swiped a rogue tear away with a mud-stained finger. She felt another one run down her opposite cheek, and a final sniffle was all it took as the waterworks began. Bobbi let loose a sob and her body shuddered as the emotional toll of what had just happened overtook her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, what's wrong?\" Peggy said, rising up from the desk where she had spent...And rather significant amount of her life behind. She rounded the counter and moved towards Bobbi, who she'd seen grow up from a little bean pole into one of the prettiest girls she'd ever seen around Shermer. Now that the counter wasn't blocking her view, the shorter woman could see that...something had happened to the poor girl; her shapely legs were splattered with mud, her hair was matted in places and she was crying!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh Mrs. R-reed!\" Bobbi sobbed, turning and burying her head into the shoulder of the older woman, \"I-I just can't seem t-to make my b-boyfriend happy! I l-love him so much but h-he won't let me get close to h-him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh honey...\" Peggy cooed sympathetically, pulling the girl into a tight hug. At least she hadn't been assaulted or raped, Peggy had always been afraid that one of those would happen to Bobbi, especially given where they lived and ESPECIALLY given where the girl worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's c-cause I'm u-gly isn't it!?\" Bobbi bawled again, and Peggy just let the girl cry as she held her tight, stroking her pudgy, wrinkled hand through her hair and along her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bobbi, you're not ugly baby, you're one of the prettiest girls I've ever seen! You've always been good looking, why when you were younger you were so cute I always thought it was criminal you had to live here!\" Peggy said a few minutes later, after Bobbi's unbridled sobbing had slowed. She pulled the girl off her shoulder and grabbed a handful of tissues from the box on the office counter and went to work dabbing up the Picasso painting that was now smeared across Bobbi's face from the waterfall of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but why won't he love m-me?\" Bobbi said with a slight hiccup as she let Peggy clean her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bobbi if there's one thing I've figured out from all my years on God's earth is that men don't have a lick of sense when it comes to women\" Peggy said as she finished up, the tissues practically dripping with wasted makeup, \"I've known men who'd rather sit alone with a video tape and a sock than touch a woman out of fear of makin' a fool outta themselves. That Julian boy doesn't know how lucky he is that you even look at him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...\" Bobbi said with another sniffle as the last of her tears, for now, dried up. \"Thanks, Mrs. Reed, you always know how to make me feel better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeggy smiled up at the girl and gave her a soft pat on the cheek, \"Oh honey, it's the least I could do. Now c'mon, lets...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: \"Get you home, I'll walk you there\" Mrs. Reed takes Bobbi home, back to the Bolstrum mobile home near the back of the trailer court. Peggy is reluctant to leave Bobbi alone, but the young woman assures her that her mom will be home 'soon'. The moment Bobbi closes the door, Rob returns...But is he alone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: \"Get you out of those muddy clothes! No adoptive daughter of mine is going to be filthy if I can help it!\" Bobbi is whisked away by her foster mother, having been adopted by the Reeds three years ago after Bobbi's mother had skipped town. Peggy helps Bobbi out of her clothes and shoves her into a hot shower, where Rob finally returns.</span></div></div>",

No adoptive daughter of mine is going to be filthy if I can help it!\u201d harumphed Peggy, driving Bobbi further into the house by her thin waist. A frown clouded her face as she bustled her kinda-daughter through the kitchen, and she gave the taut tummy of her ward an approximative squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to get some more food in you too, darlin\u2019.\u201d she tutted. \u201cI swear, you could eat five buckets \u2018a wings and not gain \u2018n ounce!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou <i>know</i> that\u2019s not true, Mrs. Reed!\u201d whined Bobbi. \u201cI get all hippy and my jeans barely fit!\u201d She put a demonstrative wiggle in her step, answering the loud snort this elicited from Peggy with a cheeky grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou kids these days,\u201d sighed the interim-super with mock disapproval. \u201cYou grow like weeds, but yer minds don\u2019t catch up fer years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFoster mother and daughter shared a giggle as they pushed their way past the small, but well-stocked kitchen and into Bobbi\u2019s room. It was surprisingly austere in its decorations, a peeling punk-band poster salvaged from her old trailer the only notable piece of furnishing, and maybe the pink-sheeted bed would catch someone\u2019s eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything else though, looked like it got hit by a category 5 pubescent hurricane. The dresser was strewn with magazines for your garden variety teen, every Valentine\u2019s Special Edition cover creased from heavy use. The vanity had a plethora of products on it; lipsticks from purples to reds to blacks; fifteen eyeliner pencil-nubs; and enough moisturizers and lotions to keep Nosferatu\u2019s skin soft and supple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slightly ajar white door led to a compact attached bathroom with so many jars of perfume that it smelled like a candle store, and makeup wipes used and unused litter the sink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobbi practically skipped into her room, parking herself firmly in front of the magazine-replete dresser. The third drawer down \u2014 underneath a compacted layer of boyfriend-shirts and hoodies stolen from Jules \u2014 contained a variety of sheer fabrics and lace that, heretofore and probably for a good bit longer (Valentine\u2019s and Jules\u2019 birthday were a ways off) were unused, but the mere sight of it might give Ms. Reed a heart attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she could lovingly but firmly dismiss her foster mom from the room, the rotund woman started setting about Bobbi\u2019s clothes with maternal vigor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgh, <i>stoooopit</i>!\u201d squealed the redhead, bapping at the liver-spotted hands pawing at her clothes with both of her hands. \u201cI can get undressed mys<i>mrgh</i>\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether it was due to the fact that she didn\u2019t want to hurt one of the few positive female role models in her life, or that the fact that Bobbi\u2019s exercises were primarily for aesthetic \u2014 and Jules\u2019 \u2014 benefit, it didn\u2019t matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat mattered that Peggy Reed was able to divest Roberta Bolstrum of her tank top and then proceeded to stare with disapproval at the unveiled and unsupported peaks revealed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBobbi...\u201d she hemmed, with the disapproving lilt that all mother-figures had mastered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eponymous girl put her hands on her hips, twisting her face into a sullen pout. \u201cWhat?!\u201d she huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Reed arched an eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-it\u2019s to celebrate our six-months-and-twenty-day anniversary!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other eyebrow went up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobbi sighed and tucked a strand of silky red hair behind an ear, looking away. \u201cIt\u2019s not like anything <i>happened</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Reed sighed and folded the tanktop into a little white-stained-brown square, wistfully smiling. \u201cI just want ya to be happy, darlin\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impudent expression melted from Bobbi\u2019s face, and her lip started to wobble. Overwhelmed by familial sentiment, the teen once again collapsed into Ms. Reed\u2019s arms, who, once again lightly stroked the girl\u2019s hair as she gently guided her to the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeggy helped the girl out of the pair of particularly tight \u2014 and wet from mud, she hoped \u2014 jean shorts while trying to avoid the drip of mucus. She refrained from commenting at the scanty pair of panties, choosing instead to thank the Lord that at least the girl had worn <i>something</i> down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cranked the hot-and-cold knobs of the shower as Bobbi sat on the toilet seat, blubbering happy and sad tears in equal measure. Peggy could remember comforting the Bolstrum girl in a similar state when she was younger; whether it was the pet grasshopper that she had accidentally squashed or the sad Disney movie she had watched a few minutes ago, a couple\u2019a gentle coos and maternal affection fixed her right up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr she could cry herself out, an option that her deadbeat biological mom had tended towards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ms. Reed had expected Bobbi to, well, change as she got older. Instead, the girl stayed at a fairly high level of emotional volatility as she grew up and, um, <i>out</i>. Sure, the Verner youngun could\u2019ve probably handled the situation better \u2014 and if she heard word that he didn\u2019t treat her lil\u2019 Bobbi right, the boy\u2019s ass was <i>grass</i> \u2014 but the constant games of emotional Minesweeper with the Bolstrum girl didn\u2019t always pan out for <i>her</i>, so it was a bit of a tossup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shoved the girl into the shower as delicately as she could, nodding at the indecipherable words sniveled into her ear. A brief frown was leveled at the trail of snot left on her blouse, but she shrugged it off. It\u2019d go in the laundry with everything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou good with biscuits n\u2019 gravy, darlin\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnomatopoeic sobbing echoed from the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBobbi dear, I can\u2019t quite understand you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shaky red-capped thumbs up extended above the shower curtain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeggy smiled again. \u201cIt\u2019ll be done when you\u2019re out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the shower, Bobbi let a wobbly sad smile stretch across her face. She was so truly <i>blessed</i>, having someone like Miss Reed take care of her. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was so blessed, having someone like Miss Reed take care of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grimace, the girl started to work a fingernail underneath the pink sticker over one of her nipples, managing to grab the edge of the adhesive after a bit of work. Slowly, carefully, she began the risky process of peeling it off\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Rob\u2019s glittering green eyes shone once more, completing the task Bobbi had started with his usual method of accomplishment: brute, artless force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFUCCCCCK,\u201d hissed the sodden bully, his right chesticle smarting from the sudden removal. He made sure to keep his voice low, lest the super\u2019s wife decide to check in and send the fuckin\u2019 Bobbi broad into another fit of hysterics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(He didn\u2019t know that Peggy Reed\u2019s traditional means of cooking involved the frying of a frankly impressive amount of animal and vegetable fats. The only noise that could possibly penetrate her spitter-spattering heaven would have bomb-level at <i>least</i>.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob peeled off the other sticker far more gingerly, as warm water pounded against his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a fuckin\u2019 wash. So much for a quick-in-an-out, instead, Jules\u2019 <i>whore</i> had to get all gooey, and sobby, and\u2026 adopted. Rob stopped his pity-party for a second to actually think about what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe super\u2019s wife was, like, his mom or something now. That was\u2026 weird. Rob started the arduous process of washing his massive mane of hair \u2014 which came to him oddly naturally, not that he realized this \u2014 while pondering this issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, all that sobby bullshit kinda felt good when that Bobbi bitch took the wheel, and <i>sure</i>, Ms. Reed <i>kinda</i> was a better mom than his\u2026 uh, for that fucking bimbo! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever. He was still in proximity to Jules, no matter how much sentimental mushy bullshit and delicious food Ms. Reed could pile on, this place was still kind of a no-fly zone. Absentmindedly, he scrubbed the areas around his chest, a lewd thought not even threatening to intrude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob hummed a metal song as he conditioned his hair. Sure, this Bobbi chick was, like, everything he fuckin\u2019 <i>hated</i> about girls, but she had good taste in band posters. In short order, he concluded his wash, shutting the water off with a quick twirl of the valve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hair <i>plapped</i> against his back. Rob frowned at a 30\u00b0 angle, his head pulled down by the sodden keratin. <i>This</i> was why he avoided those faggy prettyboy haircuts, well, besides their inherent fagginess.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuckin\u2019 whatever. Not leaving the safe and warm confines of the shower, he snagged a towel and attacked his hair with it, tying an impromptu turban around it. For good measure, he grabbed the other towel there and wrapped it around himself lengthwise, tucking it firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob grimaced as he left the shower. Whether he was going to escape this enforced-bimbodom, or go Bobbi for some actual food, he had to get dressed, which meant \u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movement in the mirror caught his eye. Rob turned to face his current form. Pale skin flushed from the heat, full lips gently parted in surprise, a good amount of cleavage showing from the too-little towel, and a slit running up the side that showed the ample curve of his wide hip; he was, like, <i>objectively</i> hot. Like, porno where just-showered-girl-fucks-the pizza-guy-instead-of-paying hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that\u2019s all it was to Rob. Objective. He could tell that all the parts fit together right, but there was no rising member or heat in his core. Just a removed appreciation, like looking at a well-crafted painting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Desperately, he screwed his eyes shut and imagined a naked Ingerbitch as best he could. Nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngerbitch running her hands over him, driving her tongue into his mouth: Nada. A quiver of disgust, if anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuckit. He went to his old standby; that nice jock-and-cheerleader \u2018film\u2019 he had on his favorites bar. Even the foreplay-makeout was enough to make him hard. The guy was just like him, tall, musclebound, and redheaded, and the girl was one\u2019a those blonde bimbos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of his cognitive energy was focused on visualizing their embrace. To Rob\u2019s delight, heat prickled in his core, and a smile spread across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, something could be different. Maybe make the guy a lil\u2019 shorter\u2026 less muscles. Make it more  realistic n\u2019 shit. The heat rose to his stomach, and Rob\u2019s hand unconsciously made its way to his breast, a small keening moan escaping his lips. He didn\u2019t really know what girl-horny-buildup was like, <i>specifically</i>, but he was pretty sure that this was it. And he felt pretty fuckin\u2019 close to, uh, what happened before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if the guy had, like, black hair? And, <i>unf</i>, the cheerleader bitch should have some tattoo sleeves, all done up in some badass roses. Give her some red hair, and Rob could practically <i>feel</i> the guy\u2019s hands roaming\u2026 wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>GOD</b> no.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn aghast Rob released his boob the moment he realized specifically <i>what</i> he had imagined someone doing to him, and his seemingly unconscious preferences for what the person looked like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshamed and helplessly furious at the <i>second</i> time that J had made him horny that night, Rob stormed into his, Bobbi\u2019s, whom-the-fuck-<i>EVER</i>\u2019s room and tried to distract himself with clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption One: In the midst of changing and figuring out how girls' clothes work, a rat-a-tat-tat and face appearing on his window scares the everloving <i>shit</i> out of Rob. It\u2019s Jules, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption Two: Desperate to escape the <i>fucked</i> state of mind that he\u2019s in, Rob goes out to the kitchen and surrenders to the expected brain-tsunami of Bobbi. But is something different?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was wearing a tiny, black t-shirt with the words \"Girlz Rool\" in a pink lettering, a pair of capri pants, and her favorite black and pink shoes. She wore glittery eyeshadow and had too much mascara and lipstick on, in a vain attempt to look older than she really was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom sent me out here to give you this,\" she said, handing Bill his homework assignments which were due today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap! How could he have forgotten that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, dork,\" Bill told his sister, taking the offending papers from her hand. Suddenly Kimberly noticed the strange emerald Ahn'Ger Stone in Bill's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that thing?\" she said, bending her head down a little to look at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's mine,\" snapped Bill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, loser!\" replied Kimberly, sticking her tongue out angrily at him. \"You don't deserve anything pretty. Jewels and gems should go to girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly suddenly kicked Bill in the shins, causing the older brother to wince and drop the gemstone. Kimberly gingerly picked it up, admiring the eerie beauty of the ancient gemstone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it back!\" yelled Bill. \"Or I'll take it back from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly replied by sticking out her tongue again, this time blowing Bill a raspberry as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does it,\" shouted Bill, tackling his younger sister to the floor. She still held tight to the Ahn'Ger Stone though. As the two wrestled on the porch, a furious Kimberly shouted: \"Let go, Bill! You always think everything is yours.

She was now dressed in a Budweiser t-shirt, a pair of ratty cut-offs, and flip-flops. She was taller than Bill and looked considerably more muscular as well.

He collapsed to the pavement, sweaty and exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA triumphant Kimberly stood up, and towered over him sneering. But Kimberly now looked considerably more muscular.

Her voice was still the same, but there was now a strange, muscular confidence in her voice--the edge and arrogance of a cocky teenage boy, though physically she was still a thirteen year old girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill sighed and looked down at himself. Everywhere Kimberly had gained muscle mass, he seemed to have lost it. While he was still his normal male self, he now had the stick-thin arms and legs of a middle-school girl.

She started to walk away from him. Bill had to scramble to catch up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-B-But...\" Bill stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away,\" said Kimberly. \"You're such a geeky, little spaz.

Kimberly remained the tall, muscular girl with the strength of an older boy. And Bill looked down at himself and saw he was still a boy... but he was now wearing a long white blouse, a pair of bright pink leggings, and white ballet flats. His fingernails were longer and painted a light shade of lavender. He could feel his hair was now longer and curlier as it brushed against his neck and shoulders. And he felt several studs suddenly appear in each of his earlobes. He now wore glittery pink lip gloss and a light dusting of blush on his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhmigod!\u201d he shrieked in a lisping, sissy voice. \u201cI'm all girly now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly looked down in disgust at her older brother, now much shorter and more feminine than she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's your point, Billie?\u201d she growled in a low, husky voice. \u201cYou've always been pretty fruity.

Not only was the backpack gone, but Bill was now dressed in Kimberly's clothes! He was wearing a tight black t-shirt with pink lettering that said: \"Girlz Rool!\" He had Kimberly's capri pants, her pink ankle socks, and her black-and-pink shoes... all strangely sized to fit Bill's older, masculine body.

You mother picks the stone up to look at before turning back to you two. \"Thanks to your insistence on changing, you've taken too long, and you two are going to be late! And since I am not going to have my children be late for school because you couldn't decide what to wear Bill, I'm going to have to take you!\" she complained. \"Now hurry up and get in the car you two!\" she demands and rushes the two of them out the door as is.</span></div></div>",

She realized that the stone was still on the porch, and wanted to jump out of the car and get the stone, but they were already accelerating to a speed that was too fast for a girl her age to safely jump out, and Martha clearly wasn\u2019t going to stop the car since they were running late. So, Becky decided she would \u2018visit\u2019 Kimberly after school and get the stone, hoping it would still be on the porch when they get there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard Jake was going to ask you to the dance that\u2019s coming up.\u201d Kimberly giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJake?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet you\u2019re super excited. You\u2019ve been crushing on him since forever.\u201d Kimberly teased. This worried Becky. She didn\u2019t want to get involved in the drama of middle school. However, as she thought about the name Jake, a face suddenly popped into her head. The face of a twelve year old boy. Becky didn\u2019t realize it, but she started blushing as she thought about holding hands with her crush. She even smiled shyly when she pictured dancing with him, wearing a cute dress while he wore a suit. \u201cI see that blush. Thinking about dancing with Jake huh?\u201d Kimberly lightly pushed Becky\u2019s should in a teasing manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No!\u201d Becky suddenly realized what she was thinking, now even more worried. It seemed the stone also alter her memories a bit, just as it did to Kimberly, although not as much apparently, since she still remembered being Bill. What worried her even more than having new memories of a boy she never met before was how the stone apparently also altered how she thinks, giving her a crush on the boy. \u201cAnyway, forget about that. You\u2019re hoping Dan asks you to the dance aren\u2019t you?\u201d Becky asked the question before she even realized what she was asking. She had no idea who \u2018Dan\u2019 was, but the moment she said that name, a new face appeared in her head, but thankfully didn\u2019t elicit the same reaction as the last one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I am, but I\u2019m pretty confident he will. I just hope your family doesn\u2019t scare off Jake.\u201d Kimberly teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy family?\u201d Even as she said it, Becky realized who Kimberly was talking about. According to her new memories, her new family was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Bill is now Becky Chandler, the youngest daughter of school superintendent Andrew Chandler, and younger sister of Vanessa Chandler, one of Shermer High's top 'Mean Girls' and friend to Gloria Vanapolous. Becky now lives in the 'rich' part of Shermer and her big sister and mother are known to be rather snobbish and rude to people they find socailly beneath them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Bill is now Becky Harper, the little sister of Jules Harper, one of Shermer High's bullies and a direct minion of Rob Bolstrum! Becky now lives in the Shermer Fields trailer park and has to deal with her new big brother constantly being in trouble and a dad struggling to keep his alcoholism in check (and a steady job) following the death of Becky's mom.. </span></div></div>",

He felt completely paralyzed as the whole world in front of him suddenly melted--just dissolved away into nothing... no wait. Now it was coming back, fading away from nothing into... into his own face?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill gasped, as he found himself looking at... well... himself. Only the gasp that emanated from his lips wasn't his voice. It was too high-pitched and girlish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" Bill said, recognizing he now had Kimberly's voice. \"What's happened? I... I'm you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill looked down at himself and recognized Kimberly's black and pink t-shirt... only now it was on his body. He shuddered with disgust as he saw his sister's tiny breasts pushing out from beneath the shirt. He was wearing Kimberly's capri pants, her little pink ankle socks, and her favorite pink and black tennis shoes. He even had purple, glittery nail polish on his fingers now. And he knew he must be wearing her baby pink lipstick and stupid, glittery eyeliner too. Fortunately, because he was now Kimberly he was also the one now holding the Ahn'Ger Stone in his dainty, little hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're me!\" laughed Kimberly, with Bill's voice. \"How did this happen? Oh, this is hysterical. You're little Kimmy now. How's it feel to be a thirteen year old girl? Oh, I love this! I'm the older brother, now. I'm the big strong one and you're the weak little girly girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's what happened,\" sighed Bill, disgusted with his whiny, high-pitched girl's voice. \"This weird emerald you tried to take from me... it's magic. It grants wishes, but somehow only if you're really angry or something. I don't know much about it, but obviously it works since you got all pissed-off and wished us into swapping bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now wait a minute,\" said Kimberly with an evil smile on Bill's old face. \"If I'm Bill... then that's MY whateverstone. It's only fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" said Bill. \"You don't even know what it's called. And we're NOT staying like this. We are changing back this instant!

Anyhow, this isn't so bad being a guy. I kinda like it actually. I don't hafta worry about being all prissy and how I look and stuff. Hell, I can't believe I used to care so much about clothes and make-up and hair. Say, why don't we just stay this way for a couple days?

Kimmy, there's no way I'm gonna spend the rest of my life as you!\" Bill squeaked in his sister's voice, staring up at his old body, who glared back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, don't call me that! I'm Bill now! Not Kimberly! That's your name, you stupid girl!\" Kimberly snarled back before wandering off to the other side of the porch marveling at herself. Bill glared daggers at his former body and clenched his hand tighter, feeling the Stone dig into the flesh of his newly tiny palms as the anger pooled up within his tiny frame. Gold light began to shine in the gaps between Bill's fingers as he opened his mouth to make another wish...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish that-\" Bill began, only to be surprised as his mother charged out the front door of the Strasserman household, Kimberly's backpack in one hand as she grabbed Bill's stick-like arm and began dragging him off the porch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LET'S GO, KIMMY!\" Martha Strasserman groaned, \"You can't be late for school AGAIN and I certainly don't need to be late for work! I can't believe how inconsiderate you are to others sometimes! Maybe I should start making you ride the bus so you can appreciate how much effort it is to get you ready for school!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill allowed himself to be pulled off the porch, not expecting his mother to be that strong. His tiny body almost bounced along the sidewalk before his brain finally kicked into gear and he dug his tiny sneakers into the concrete path that led to the garage and the two females jerked to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KIMBERLY STRASSERMAN, YOU GET IN THAT CAR SO I CAN TAKE YOU TO SCHOOL THIS INSTANT!\" Martha screamed, wheeling about on Bill, her face contorted in anger and frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Kimmy, go to school you little airhead!\" The real Kimberly said with a chuckle from the porch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BILL! START WALKING!\" Martha roared as she turned away from Bill, pointing a manicured topped finger in the direction of Bill's stolen body. After a moment of shocked silence, Martha turned back towards the garage and with a painful tug, jerked Bill forward again, and this time he could do little to stop it, still shocked by his mother's outburst. Before he knew it, Bill's body was practically shoved into the passenger seat of his mom's sedan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. Now I'm sorry Kimmy but you have got to go to school!\" Bill's mother fussed as she leaned over him and clicked the seatbelt into place. Like he was some tiny child. He WAS a tiny child. Bill looked up to see his own body standing there with a huge grin on it's face as the true Kimberly, however much of her actually remained beneath the 'dudedification' of Bill's last wish, was highly amused at the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom, can I get a ride to school? I'll never make it there in time now!\" Kimberly said, making Bill's voice just whiny enough. Martha sighed and pointed at the car with a shake of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but you both better hope I'm not late for work!\" The Starsserman matriarch said with a glare towards Bill as Kimberly slid into the backseat of the sedan, the huge shit-eating grin still on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Martha stomped her way around to the driver side of the car, Bill decided to err on the side of caution and quickly slid the Ahn'Ger Stone into the pocket of the Bedazzled jeans Kimberly had been wearing, placing a small hand over the bump it made to both keep it secure and to hide it's existence from her mother, who would surely think the worse. Bill cast a backwards glance at his old body who was still staring at him with a huge shit eating grin before settling down into the seat as far as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of Bill, and he wasn't sure if it was actually him or just some weird residual...Kimberlyness influencing his mind, but he wanted to stick out his lower lip and pout, much like his little sister was known to do when she didn't get her way. She'd sniffle and get big watery eyes and try to charm her way out of being in trouble, and it sometimes worked. But Bill knew his mother was on the warpath and that any attempt to pull one over on the Strasserman family matriarch would only make the current situation worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And Kimmy might squeal about the Stone and I'll be up shit creek without a paddle' Bill thought to himself as his mother slid into the seat beside him, took a deep breath and began the process of starting the car and pulling out of the driveway. 'Maybe if I just act like I'm accepting this, Kimmy will just leave me alone and I can find someplace at school to try to fix things'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill sat in silence as his old body and his mom made small talk on their way to school, Bill catching sight of a dejected Tom Ackerton rounding the corner as they pulled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damn it Tom, of all the days to be late!' Bill swore in his head as he watched his depressed best friend stare pathetically at the car as the Strasserman trio continued down the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive only took a few minutes to get to the school campus, though Bill was momentarily confused when his mother's sedan pulled to a stop in front of the Elementary School, near the Sixth Grade wing where Kimberly's classroom was. He stared at the horde of Tweens before realizing that he WAS a Tween now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter Kimmy? Cold feet? Afraid of the big bad sixth grade?\" Bill heard his voice say mockingly from behind, and he shot Kimberly a glare before unbuckling himself and reaching for the obnoxiously colorful backpack that was, for now, his. Bill opened the door and slid out, not even bothering to return his mom's 'I love you' as he slammed the door behind him and made his way into the crowd of pre-adolescent students. Once he reached what he thought might have been a safe enough distance in case Kimberly tried anything, he turned and gave a half-hearted wave and tried not to shudder as he felt the bracelets on his forearm bounce and jangle and his sister's hair tickle his ears, watching as the car pulled away in the direction of Shermer High.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That little shithead has no idea what's about to happen\" Bill said to himself with a giggle, not realizing how girly it sounded as he stared at the retreating tail lights. There was another reason why he and Tom always walked together, strength in numbers. The moment Kimberly was alone, Big Jon Ingerman, Rob Bolstrum and the rest of Shermer High's bully brigade would descend upon her. \"But not my problem!\" Bill said as he turned and followed the last of the sixth grade students into the school building, \"Anything that happens, I can just un-wish\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill gave the Stone in his pocket a pat just to make sure it was still there, and with his concern momentarily addressed, made his way to Kimberly's classroom. He'd have to play along for now, there was simply no time to experiment before her class started. The former high school senior found his way into Mrs. Beckham's classroom and, thankfully, the desks were still labeled so it was easy enough to get to Kimberly's desk right as the final bell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this should be fairly painless\" Bill said to himself as the middle aged Mrs. Beckham rose from her desk, cleared her throat, and greeted the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He still had all of his knowledge after all. This worried him a little since that meant Kimberly probably still had her own knowledge as well, so she could end up screwing up his grades today. However, what Bill didn\u2019t realize was that both he and Kimberly, while retaining their own knowledge, also gained all the 'surface' knowledge they needed to convincingly act like each other, so Kimberly was able to do just as well in class as he would. Unfortunately, knowledge wasn\u2019t the only thing they gained. As Bill tuned out the teacher, his gaze drifted across the classroom, taking in his surroundings. As his gaze landed on a boy on the other side of the room, he started to stare at the boy. He didn\u2019t realize it, but he started to get excited, thinking about holding hands with the boy. As he pictured it, he even thought about saying \u2018Danny, I love you.\u2019 to the boy. Suddenly, he came back to his senses and realized he was just daydreaming about being lovey-dovey with a twelve year old boy. He got really embarrassed and shook his head, even lightly slapping himself on both cheeks to snap himself out of it. This strengthened his resolve to return to his own body, not wanting to deal with his sister\u2019s first crush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is crazy! I didn't even know that boy existed before today! When did he and Kimmy even meet!?' Bill thought angrily as he tried to hide the embarrassed blush on his new cheeks. In reality, Dan had moved to Shermer two years ago, joining Kimberly's fourth grade class and despite his sister's obnoxious behavior, the boy had become one of the younger Strasserman's best friends over the past couple of years. Now that they were in sixth grade and their bodies were entering puberty though, Kimberly had been dealing with some really...strange emotions. Emotions that were now messing with Bill's mind, and that he was totally unprepared to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the bell finally range at the end of the day, Bill grabbed Kimberly's obnoxiously pink backpack out of the tiny locker and rushed out the door before he could get sucked into any sort of crazy situation or be forced to talk to one of Kimberly's equally annoying and giggly friends, waiting on his mom to pick him up. He pulled out the stone for the first time since the switch had happened that morning, holding it tightly and thinking about things that make him angry, such as how Kimberly stole his body, and how his mind was being affected by the switch. Just as the stone started glowing, ready to grant a wish...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: He managed to make a wish, saying \u201cI wish Kimberly would forget about the stone and it\u2019s powers\u201d, hoping to keep its powers to himself and switch back when they got home, and tricking her into thinking something else caused their switch, but since he\u2019s Kimberly now, the stone made him forget about the stone\u2019s powers, and he ended up losing the stone, not realizing it\u2019s importance to his desire to switch back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Bill felt a tap on his shoulder, and turned around only to be surprised by Dan, making his heart melt due to having Kimberly\u2019s feelings for him. He then finds out that Kimberly and Dan had plans to spend the afternoon hanging out, with both their moms chaperoning the pre-teens.</span></div></div>",

He let loose a very girlish groan of annoyance and spun in his sister's pink and white sneakers, ready to tell one of Kimberly's stupid girl friends to get lost, only to have butterflies explode in his stomach as he saw who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kimbo! Man I didn't think today was ever going to end! Mrs. Beckham was SOOOO boring! I'm freaking starving! Are you starving? You look kinda pale...\" Dan's voice was high pitched and still childish, puberty had yet to hit full force and make his voice start cracking, but it was enough to make Bill's new knees quiver as Kimberly's emotions once again got the better of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah I'm starving for you!' Bill thought before he realized what had just gone through his brain. 'NO NO NO NO NO GROSS NO NO EW NO!' Bill said and tried his best to purge the disgusting thoughts from his mind. Kimberly was only TWELVE! Why was she already acting like this!? But Bill's inner conflict seemed to show as Dan's boyish, smiling face scrunched up in worried confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay Kimmy?\" The boy said, laying a hand on Bill's tiny shoulder, \"Should I get a teacher?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill\u2019s heart melted at this. He felt more butterflies come to life in his stomach as he stared at Dan, and ended up smiling before bringing Dan in for a hug. He was so...warm! And caring! Bill didn\u2019t know what he was doing. He couldn\u2019t help but act this way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm just really hungry too!\" Bill said, trying very hard not to gush or burst into a giggling fit. He suddenly felt as though he was in control again and pushed away from Dan and turned away, hiding his blushing face in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, cool I guess!\" Was all Dan said before he started rambling on about some kiddy show called 'Raspberry Squad Go!' that Bill's implanted 'Kimories' told him was one of the things that Dan and Kimberly had first connected over. Bill had seen a poster or two for the show in Kimberly's room the few times he'd walked past with the door open, Despite his lack of Kimberly's deeper knowledge on the subject, he knew enough to at least engage in a excited conversation about it. It was some dumb anime show about fighting robot monsters with what amounted to digital Pokemon cards, but the longer the two pre-teens talked about it, the more Bill found himself getting into it, apparently there was even a brand new movie about it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s here.\u201d Dan said, interrupting Bill as he was talking about what little he could glean from the surface memories he had of the show, turnind to see Dan\u2019s mom pull up in what Bill had to assume was the family car. It was maroon and the same model as his mom's, if maybe a year or two newer as it slowed to a stop in front of the two twelve year olds. The older woman was a little younger than Bill's own mother, Martha, but only by a few years, and had shiny and smooth brown hair that was hung down past her shoulders and dangerously low neckline. Dan gave his mother a wave and began walking around the front of the car, but Bill hesitated. The surface memories swimming around in his Kimberly'd mind seemed to suggest that she...HE was supposed to wait for his mom, Martha. He didn't know this woman, and the surface memories only knew her as 'Mrs. Davidson' or 'Dan's mom'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Figures Kimmy doesn't pay enough attention to know this woman's name' Bill groaned inwardly as he stared at the car and then cast a look down the afternoon street, seeing if his mother's car was close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up on Bill's hesitation, Dan's mom rolled down the driver side window and looked directly at Bill, who could see his sister's, or rather his, reflection in the enormous pair of sunglasses the older woman was wearing as she began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys! So are we all set? Kimmy, your mom had to run home for something so I offered to pick you up! She said she'd meet us at...\"</span></div></div>",

Maybe I should start making you ride the bus so you can appreciate how much effort it is to get you ready for school!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill allowed himself to be pulled off the porch, not expecting his mother to be that strong. His tiny body almost bounced along the sidewalk before his brain finally kicked into gear and he dug his tiny sneakers into the concrete path that led to the garage and the two females jerked to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KIMBERLY STRASSERMAN, YOU GET IN THAT CAR SO I CAN TAKE YOU TO SCHOOL THIS INSTANT!\" Martha screamed, wheeling about on Bill, her face contorted in anger and frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Kimmy, go to school you little airhead!\" The real Kimberly said with a chuckle from the porch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BILL! START WALKING!\" Martha roared as she turned away from Bill, pointing a manicured topped finger in the direction of Bill's stolen body. After a moment of shocked silence, Martha turned back towards the garage and with a painful tug, jerked Bill forward again, and this time he could do little to stop it, still shocked by his mother's outburst. Before he knew it, Bill's body was practically shoved into the passenger seat of his mom's sedan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. Now I'm sorry Kimmy but you have got to go to school!\" Bill's mother fussed as she leaned over him and clicked the seatbelt into place. Like he was some tiny child. He WAS a tiny child. Bill looked up to see his own body standing there with a huge grin on it's face as the true Kimberly, however much of her actually remained beneath the 'dudedification' of Bill's last wish, was highly amused at the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom, can I get a ride to school? I'll never make it there in time now!\" Kimberly said, making Bill's voice just whiny enough. Martha sighed and pointed at the car with a shake of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but you both better hope I'm not late for work!\" The Starsserman matriarch said with a glare towards Bill as Kimberly slid into the backseat of the sedan, the huge shit-eating grin still on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill looked down and opened his tiny hand, showing the Ahn'Ger Stone sitting there, the greens and golds looking more vibrant and alive but yet not glowing as it had been. Bill's timing was unfortunate as the exact moment he chose to look at the Stone was the moment his mother turned to glare at him, revealing the Stone's existence to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KIMMY!\" His mother's voiced peaked once more, \"I can't believe you! Stealing from my jewelry box! I thought I raised you better than that! We're going to have a talk later today little missy! Maybe a month's grounding will get make you start listening!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill's eyes went wide as he saw his mother's hand dart towards the Ahn'Ger Stone, the only means for him to get back to normal. He closed his hand protectively around the Stone, pulled it close to his chest and dug deep into the anger of the situation as he felt his mother's hands wrap around his own and begin prying his fingers apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me it Kimmy so we can go to school! BILL HELP ME!\" Martha hissed, and Bill felt much larger arms and hands begin pulling at him from the backseat  He hugged his tiny hands closer to his chest and turned away as his mothers larger fingers wormed through his tiny ones. As Bill made his wish he heard his mother say something beneath her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish we didn't have to go to school!\"</span></div></div>",

The second thing that Bill noticed was his swollen stomach from which a horrible flaring pain seemed to be coming from. And instead of being decked out in Kimberly's typical tweenager girl clothes, he was now wearing little more than a oversized night gown that hung limply off his form. Long brown hair filled his vision as he stared down into the canyon of cleavage before he screamed as a wave of sharp, stabbing pain radiated forth from his abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH GOD!\" He screamed as the ringing in his ears faded away. Then he heard another voice in his ear and the teenager jerked his feminine head up as his surroundings fell into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on honey we're almost at the hospital!\" Said a gruff voice, and Bill turned his head towards the source to see a heavily bearded man who he most certainly did not recognize behind the steering wheel of his mother's car, which now looked considerably older than it had moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie just do the breathing okay? Mom's right here, we got you!\" Martha's voice came from the back seat as Bill turned to look. His mom was definitely older, her hair was going gray and there were more than a few wrinkles on her face. Next to her sat a much older version of himself, currently pinned beneath a small mountain of bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god!\" Was all Bill could say as another wave of pain rolled across his body. His wish had been granted, he and Kimberly didn't have to go to school, but the Stone had, for some reason, made them all older! And for some reason, made him clearly pregnant! It didn't make sense! Bill tried to take some deep breaths as he turned back to face the front, now realizing they were cruising down the streets of a city much larger than Shermer Illinois. He chanced a look down at the Ahn'Ger Stone in his hands. He could now see the golden band that wrapped around his ring finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh god' Was all he could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh honey, I wish you could have left your good luck rock at home!\" Martha said from the back seat as she rubbed Bill's left arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, SIS, you should have left it at home so I don't have to keep track of it like everything else!\" Came Bill's old voice from the back seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here!\" The gruff voiced stranger next to Bill said and he looked up as the large structure of 'St. Harrison General' loomed above them, a pair of nurses rushing out the door with a wheelchair already in hand. \"Good thing we called ahead, right babe?\" The stranger said with a panicked smile as he slowed the car to a stop and put it in park before jumping out and rushing around to Bill's door and flinging it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"C'mon, let's get you inside!\" The stranger said and Bill felt very powerful arms almost effortlessly lift him up out of the sedan and place him into the waiting wheelchair, and then suddenly he was being whisked away as the two nurses, his mother and his apparent husband were all chattering between themselves about what were clearly pregnancy terms. Bill turned in the wheelchair and looked back, seeing his old body standing outside of the car, giving him a wave that seemed half sincere, half sarcastic as Kimberly made her way to the driver's seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kimmy\" Bill heard someone say, and after a moment he realized someone was talking to him. He watched as the car pulled away and turned back towards the group of people around him, including a woman who was very clearly a doctor. Her tiny, overcoated body was topped by a serious face and fiery, if short, red hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes?\" He said, and for the first time noticed how mature his voice sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Dr. Melanie Jackson. I'm the OB-GYN on call today, Mr. Goins has a bad stomach virus and can't come in so I'll be delivering your child for you. Given how quickly you're progressing, we should head straight into the delivery, but first you have to surrender the item you're carrying, for your safety and that of my staff's\" The woman, Dr. Jackson, said, her voice as cold and serious as her dark green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\" Bill whimpered, and through the pain clenched the Stone, his only way out of this nightmare, closer to his newly enlarged chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to give Dr. Jackson your good luck rock, sweetie\" His mother said softly, and Bill watched as a slightly wrinkled hand reached towards his own. He felt anger beneath the intense pain that was his current existence, the feeling of how unfair all of this was, his hate towards Kimberly, the coldness of this doctor, the insanity of the entire situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but I...\" Bill stammered as he clutched the Ahn'Ger Stone tighter as the smallest hint of a glow began as...</span></div></div>",

Especially if Kimberly gets her hands on it. She\u2019ll make sure he remains stuck as her, with a newborn child. He quickly thought about how suddenly becoming Kimberly, then suddenly becoming a pregnant, adult Kimberly, and how angry it made him. However, the pain from going into labor kept him from thinking of what he wanted to wish for. He simply couldn\u2019t concentrate due to all the pain, so he said the one thing he wanted more than anything right now. \u201cI wish I could keep the stone!\u201d This was his greatest desire at the moment because of the earlier fear that he may lose it and be stuck as he is, so it was the first thing he thought of when trying to think of a wish. Unfortunately, wishing to return to normal hadn\u2019t crossed his mind because of the pregnancy hormones running through him, along with the pain from going into labor. It was all just so overwhelming, especially since it\u2019s all so new to him and bombarded him very suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s get her in the delivery room.\u201d The doctor said as hey wheeled him away from his mother. The man who is apparently Bill\u2019s new husband was allowed to follow them. After a few minutes, he was brought into the delivery room and placed on a bed. His new husband stood by his side, holding Bill\u2019s free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, after squeezing the life out of his husband\u2019s hand and the stone, while pushing the muscles in his groin as hard as he could, it finally ended. Throughout it all, he hadn\u2019t even considered trying another wish, too distracted by the pain. When it ended, he was so relieved, he had forgotten where he even was or what he was doing. After a few moments, he remembered where he was, and what he just did. His anger at the stone slowly started to rise, along with his embarrassment at doing something no man should ever be able to do, but before he can open his mouth to make a wish, he\u2019s interrupted by the doctor saying...</span></div></div>",

She made a beckoning motion with her left hand, as she was a southpaw, that indicated that she really needed to talk to him. \u201cGreat\u201d, Bill thought bitterly to himself \u201cJust what I need\u201d. He grabbed his backpack , slung it over his shoulder, and practically schlepped his body down the front steps towards the next bit of drama in his life. He just hoped that whatever it is she wanted, she left before Tom showed up, otherwise he'd have to listen to their bickering for the next hour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Bill asked with a neutral voice, hiding his dislike for Gloria, although the look of raw annoyance in his eyes gave it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen\u201d said Gloria somewhat insistently, as if she had big news to tell Bill. \u201cI can't be seen talking to you, you understand that, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u201d sighed Bill impatiently. \u201cI'm not popular, you don't need to rub it in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know I like you, Bill. You're a sweet guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, whatever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill's mind briefly imagined Gloria's little clique. Despite being an only child with a really strict mom, Gloria was pretty enough and cunning enough(Bill used to refer to her as Littlefinger behind her back in middle school) to have earned a spot among the popular crowd of jocks and cheerleaders. It was almost a clich\u00e9, the popular kids all being beautiful and athletic and largely well off, but that was the truth. The popular kids ran the school, and everyone else were their footstools. The only caveat that allowed kids like Bill some degree of room to breathe is that despite all of their privileges, the cool kids seemed like they were a surprisingly miserable bunch. Gloria's friends maintained a very regimented caste system with very little wiggle room for social mobility or the ability to resist peer pressure. There were weird and capricious rules which dictated acceptable social behavior, and there was constant paranoia among them that if you did something out of turn or were the victim of malicious gossip, you could be ostracized at any moment like Tom had been. Despite being by some definitions a loser, Bill felt that he had more personal freedom than Gloria did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou've ignored all of my texts and private messages, I even tried to call you, so you had to know that this was coming. I really need to tell you something, and I could only tell you. I...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria stopped for a moment before composing herself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...I think that I'm ready to forgive him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill briefly closed his eyes to prevent his eyes for bulging out of their sockets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're...ready to forgive Tom?\u201d said Bill, enunciating his words slowly, every last one dripping with sarcasm and disdain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u201d announced Gloria proudly. \u201cWe've had our differences in the past, and we've always bounced back from them. No matter what was said, who threatened who, who called who what, I think that Tom and I can make it work again. The problem is, I can't tell Tom directly that I'm ready to start fresh. I want to ease him into it. You know how he gets. How he flies off the handle when he thinks he's being lied to. How oversensitive he gets. I swear he's bipolar.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn't be surprised\u201d said Bill quietly, ready to fly off the handle himself. While she prattled on, giving herself a pat on the back for having the compassion to forgive Tom's previous transgressions, Bill was thinking angrily to himself \u201cHow DARE Gloria try and paint herself as the victim here?\u201d. You see,  Tom and Gloria had possessed a toxic relationship for the entire length of time that Bill had known the both of them, ever since Kindergarten, and Gloria gave as good as she took. She was just as much of a drama queen as Tom was, just as capable as creating absolutely vicious insults that would embarrass the rudest sailor, and Bill was getting really sick of being caught in the middle of their inane soap opera. If Bill wasn't so distracted, he'd give Gloria a piece of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what's that?\u201d pointed Gloria towards Bill's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's what?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere's something glowing in your hand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill opened his hand, revealing the mysterious Ahn'Ger Stone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis? I don't know, just something I found laying on my porch. I forgot I had it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is it glowing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't know. Maybe it's kryptonite?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill laughed. Gloria didn't. She was transfixed, almost in a trance, somehow preternaturally aware that it was something special. Something forbidden and all powerful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I see it?\u201d she asked with a touch of awe in her voice. \u201cIt's beautiful\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, just give it back. I found it first, and I'm planning to find somebody to appraise it. It looks expensive\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria turned over the Ahn'Ger stone in her hand three times over, examining its teardrop shape and the  smaller gold gemstone embedded inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This looks priceless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hoping so. Then I can move out of here and do something exciting with my life\" said Bill wistfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u201d she said, changing the subject back to Tom, gradually losing interest in the artifact \u201ccan you let Tom know that I'm open to seeing him again? If he behaves, that is?\u201d. </span></div></div>",

I'm sorry.\" Tom replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You apologize to him? You apologize to HIM but not to ME?\" Gloria shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gloria, listen. We've been through this song and dance too many times. We've had this argument too many times. We're over. We're done. Please. Let's just end this quietly.\" Tom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tell her, Tom.\" Bill said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Bill. You're not helping this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I'll shut up.\" Bill said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least Bill has a little bit of sense here to SHUT UP. Tom, we can fix this! I have forgiven you, if you can forgive me, we can work this out!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forgive me? You forgive ME? Gloria, this is the problem exactly. We can't go on like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill could see the anger building in Gloria's face. But more than that, he could see a green glow erupting from her hand. From the stone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell...\" Bill said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Bill could point anything out, Gloria erupted with a statement that would have grave consequences</span></div></div>",

He\u2019d expected it to be a broken off piece of jewelry, or some undiscovered mineral that would make him famous. The last thing he expected was for it to start glowing in Gloria\u2019s hand. Gloria herself didn\u2019t seem to notice; instead, her attention was stuck on Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a self-absorbed asshole! I came here to forgive you, no apology necessary, and you try and turn it around on me! You\u2019ve even got Bill on your side! Honestly, I thought he was smarter than that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about!?\u201d Tom shouted loud enough for the whole block to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill shut his eyes and hoped he\u2019d go deaf as the two teenagers competed in their shouting match. Their words jumbled together in his ears until they just became noise, noise that made Bill cringe and wince and shake his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey,\u201d he said softly, knowing he wouldn\u2019t pierce their screams. Neither Tom nor Gloria turned away from the other. \u201cHey!\u201d he repeated, louder this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former couple their heads to look at Bill. \u201cWhat!?\u201d they shouted in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you please, maybe, possibly stop shouting just a little bit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment he stopped talking, Bill knew he\u2019d made a mistake. Tom looked as though he\u2019d insulted his mother, killed his cat, and punched him in the face all at once. Gloria, on the other hand, was wearing a manic grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you taking her side?\u201d Tom asked in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No, Tom, of course not! Where\u2019d you even get that-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria stepped in front of Bill before he could finish his sentence. \u201cOf course he\u2019s taking my side! I\u2019m right!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout missing a beat, Gloria spun around, grabbed Bill\u2019s shoulder, and planted a spiteful kiss on his lips. She pulled her head away, but continued to hold him; it wouldn\u2019t be that easy to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a good kisser, Bill,\u201d Gloria lied. She looked behind her, directly into Tom\u2019s moist eyes. \u201cReally, I wish I\u2019d dated you from the start!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the stone in Gloria\u2019s hand grew bright enough to blind the trio, and green light enveloped the world.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bill only had a few precious seconds to process what Gloria- No, what he and Gloria had done. It had been a joint effort. Had he controlled his outburst and not offended Tom, the explosion of light never would have happened. Bill was afraid to see what the consequences would be. He could feel in his gut that it would be nothing good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, the green light naturally faded, but Bill still had to blink a few times to drive away the spots in his vision. Once they were gone, Bill took in his surroundings. He was back on his porch, where he\u2019d been before Gloria and Tom and the argument. His hand curled at the memory, only to ease up at a sharp pinprick. The stone was still in his palm, which had been pierced by a jagged edge. Bill grumbled to himself as he slid the stone over to his other hand. Suddenly, a familiar voice cried out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY BILL!\u201d Gloria shouted from the sidewalk, where she\u2019d been the first time this had happened. Only this wasn\u2019t Gloria Vanapolous. Gloria had always had her silky hair draped over her shoulders, framing a carefully made up face. Designer tops and torn up skinny jeans always covered her curvy figure, except for the few times she wrapped herself in thousand dollar dresses. The young woman running excitedly up the sidewalk had none of these features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, this Gloria had an impossibly frizzy ponytail that bounced with every clumsy step she took. It flopped over a too-big sweatshirt that covered any figure she might have. Instead of her body, a logo for a video game tournament was on display. Paint-stained pants and muddy converse made up her lower half. This Gloria even had a small pair of reading glasses jutting out of her back pocket, next to her phone and a spare paintbrush. Bill had always suspected that Gloria wore contacts, but he wasn\u2019t sure that an alternate dimension confirmed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill stood up and, not knowing what else to do, spread his arms open wide for Gloria to fall into. She laughed, not some small, cutesy thing but a hearty, deep-throated guffaw, and pressed her head deep into Bill\u2019s chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI forgot how cozy you are,\u201d Gloria mumbled. Bill did what he supposed was the gentlemanly thing to do, and hugged Gloria back. He had to admit, she was right. This was cozy. \u201cSorry I didn\u2019t call you. I was stuck with my mom all week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tom and Gloria were dating, Bill had had a couple run-ins with her mother, Ariadne. To say that they were miserable would be an insult to misery. She was strict, overbearing, clingy, and even louder than her daughter. Bill had never thought that he would feel bad for Gloria, but these few encounters had softened him to the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds awful,\u201d Bill said as Gloria reluctantly pulled herself away from him. She was careful to keep her hands in his. \u201cWhat were you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfusion crossed Gloria\u2019s now-pale face? \u201cYou don\u2019t remember? I was at that gaming competition, the one in California? I got this rocking sweatshirt out of it!\u201d All signs of disappointment left Gloria as she admired her hoodie, but they suddenly returned when Bill coughed to grabbed her attention. \u201cIt was really important to me. How\u2019d you forget?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill had never played poker, or gambled all that much, mostly because of his truly terrible poker face. Right now, Gloria was staring at a mess of sweat, nervous smiling, and bulging eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s, uh, it\u2019s really early. Babe,\u201d Bill added with no tact or romance. \u201cIt just... slipped my mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh, sure it did.\u201d Gloria rolled her eyes. It seemed that even with the changes to her appearance, she\u2019d kept her perception and ruthless sarcasm. \u201cLook, if you forgot, you can just tell me. I\u2019d be upset, but I won\u2019t break up with you over your memory.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad Bill known this version of Gloria for any decent amount of time, he would know that she was telling the truth. Unfortunately, he was used to the popular, mean girl Gloria, who had used and abused his friend for nearly his entire life. So when every bone in Bill\u2019s body told him that this level of care and understanding was a trap, he believed it over the love he was receiving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, uh, look,\u201d Bill sputtered, desperately looking for a way to escape his apparent girlfriend. \u201cI don\u2019t know if, uh, if I...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Bill could do any serious damage to his relationship, his eyes caught sight of a car driving towards his house. It was close enough that he could vaguely make out the person driving. \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d he asked, completely oblivious to his changing the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria pouted, but turned around anyways. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, Bill. Can you just- Wait. I recognize that car!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gloria shook her head. Bill and Tom were so ridiculous sometimes. It's like they were joined at the hip!   Tom never ONCE stood up for her the way he always went to bat for Bill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod, you two should get a room! It's like you love Bill other more than you love me, Tom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, at least Bill was there for me when you turned everyone against me, Gloria!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI only told them the truth, you idiot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're full of shit. I never did half the things you accused me of!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Gloria, don't call Tom an idiot. He's going through a hard time right now\u201d said Bill with his hands out in front of him. He was trying to signal to Gloria to calm down a little. Somehow, he instinctively knew that the gemstone Gloria was holding was about to do something bad if she got anymore angry. Gemstones aren't mood rings, at least ordinary ones. They don't erupt into colors the second somebody gets angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought I told you to shut up!\u201d spat Gloria, not even looking over at Bill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBill can say whatever he feels like saying, Gloria! He's not one of your sycophantic cheerleader friends!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria's face was turning red. She was losing control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou fucking idiot, Tom! You're so out of touch. You don't have a clue what's going on! You don't want to get back together, fine! Get out of my life! I wish that you and Bill would just become the old married couple you guys act like!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Gloria said that, the gemstone burst open an onslaught of emerald magic. Turning deathly cold, Gloria dropped the gemstone as it covered the street corner in its gelid glow. It fired on for a moment, and just as quickly vanished into nonexistence, as if nothing had happened at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere Bill had just been standing now stood a middle-aged man, himself at fifty years old. He was a few inches taller now, and unlike a moment before, he was actually in pretty good athletic shape despite possessing a small paunch. He had a well defined musculature, and he was more handsome than he had been as a teenager, somewhere along the way having developed rugged good looks.  But the world did seem somewhat different, sharper, and Bill was suddenly aware of a pair of glasses resting on his nose. He felt a tickle beneath his nose and a quick check later revealed a bushy moustache spanning across his upper lip. He felt a coolness on top of his head that hadn't been there before and another cursory check revealed a receding line of short course hair. His clothing seemed like he was about to go to work. He was wearing a short-sleeved polo shirt with a collar and a pair of nice looking pair of khakis and a pair of brown tennis shoes. Definitely business casual, almost as if he was preparing to go to work!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere Tom had stood now stood a middle-aged woman of about the same age as Bill. She was blonde haired like Tom was, although she wore it in a long bob that framed her pretty, well made up face. Despite years as a sedentary housewife, her figure had somehow only barely diminished, and she was overweight, with a large rear that bulged from her 'mom jeans'. Most of the weight was concentrated in her posterior and hips, her stomach not swollen but certainly not fit as a small muffin top poked against her white undershirt and sky-blue cardigan. Her breasts were still firm and full and a pair of small framed glasses sat on her nose. All in all, especially for a woman who was nearly two feet shorter than Tom had been, she looked good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really good\" Bill thought as he stared over his own changed hands at the woman, who was examining her own petite hands with a smile on her face. Bill felt something stir in his dockers before a flash of dark hair drew his attention as Gloria quickly picked up the Ahn'Ger stone from where she had dropped it on the ground, and she looked up at the two strange adults with a mixture of fear, curiosity, and laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: It is still the present day. Bill and Tom have transformed into Bill and Tammy Strasserman, a married couple who live across the street from Gloria's house. Bill is now Gloria's mother's boss at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: It is now forty years in the future. Bill and Tom(Tammy) are still old and married to each other, but Gloria has aged as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Bill, Tom(Tammy) and Gloria are in the past! But when?</span></div></div>",

He was still Bill Strasserman, but now he was the brother to his former father, as opposed to being their son. He was now born in 1968 instead of 2000, graduating high school in 1986 and college in 1990. He had met Tammy Ackerton in college, during a meeting at the school's television station, his sophomore year, 1988. Their first date was seeing Who Framed Roger Rabbit at the local movie theater, and they were madly in love ever since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the years, Bill had made his way up through business school, and now was chief officer of sales in the northern midwest region for Veracity Banking, at which Gloria's Mother worked. He was now the boss of Gloria's Mother. How crazy was that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more memories flooded in, things got even crazier for Bill. Tammy's dreams of being a news anchor were put on hold after she got pregnant shortly after college, and their only child, a daughter named Willow, was born in 1993. Willow, now 25, was persuing her dream of a career in animation over in Los Angeles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill was a father now. He couldn't fathom what had just happened. His thoughts were interrupted by a laugh. Gloria's laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it! You two are a married couple now! You got what you deserved!\" Gloria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Bill realizes Tammy doesn't remember her life as Tom as she scolds Gloria for laughing. Bill plays along with a \"Respect your elders, young lady\" speech in hopes of getting the stone back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Bill realizes that the stone did this and argues with Gloria about it. However, Tammy snatches up the stone, and reveals that she sort of likes being Tammy as opposes to Tom.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bill was feeling overwhelmed. Suddenly having an entire lifetime's worth of memories poured into his brain was making him dizzy, and he struggled to not pass out from the sheer abundance of it. Memories of growing up in the 70s and 80s with his own father Greg as his brother. Memories of Generation X touchstones that he hadn't even been alive to witness flashed before his eyes: Watching the end of the Vietnam War on an old fashioned CRT TV with his parents, seeing the Challenger explosion happen on live TV in the high school auditorium, witnessing the fall of the Berlin Wall one night at the college bar, his anger at the OJ trial verdict, his sadness at Princess Diana's death, preparing for Y2K and Tammy making fun of him for it, watching 9/11 happen at work and suddenly having the impetus to take Willow out of school that day. All of it would be too much to take all on its own, but in addition, Bill also had his original memories of him still being just seventeen. He still remembered walking off his family's porch ten minutes ago fuming about not having a girlfriend and having to deal with Tom and Gloria's relationship drama. He still remembered that his calculus homework was due today. These competing memories clashed and negated each other, and yet, Bill felt that somehow they were both still true. Bill was reminded of when he read 1984. The concept of doublethink in Orwell's novel meant to hold two contradictory pieces of information in your mind and accept both as equally true. That's what these new memories felt like. He had to ignore the madness of realzing the contradictions of that paradox for now and shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Gloria was still cackling, gloating in her having gotten one over on her knucklehead sadsack of a boyfriend.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two look so adorable together!\u201d she squealed. \u201cCan I see the wedding photos? Where'd you go on your honeymoon?\u201d she asked sarcastically. It was at that point when Gloria stopped and realized that the gemstone that Bill had...she still had it, and she could use it to do anything she wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria made several attempts wishing for things- money, eternal youth, fame, glory- all of the greatest hits, but she grew increasingly frustrated that none of her wishes seemed to be working. The gemstone she was holding in her hand lacked even the briefest flicker of the glorious light that it had produced a moment ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe fuck? Does this thing only work once!?\u201d screamed Gloria, shaking the gemstone in a futile gesture, perhaps trying to wake up the genie that she thought might be inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill started to argue with Gloria, demanding Gloria to give the stone back because he found it first and he needed it to return reality back to normal. His deeper voice and overall demeanor made Bill very authoritative now, but the defiant Gloria wasn't having it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNuh uh\u201d she said childishly, shaking her head. \u201cIf you think I'm ever giving this to ANYONE ever again, you've got another thing coming, Bill! This rock is magic. Like, actual magic. I just changed existence itself with it. I'm never giving this up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGloria, this isn't funny\u201d said Bill intently. He couldn't believe how much his voice sounded like his own father's. \u201cDo you have any idea how insane this is? I can't allow you to just waltz away with that stone and rob me of forty years of my life. Give it to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr else what?\u201d said Gloria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr else I'll overpower you and take it from you. I'm a lot stronger now in case you haven't recognized. I'm freaking Wolverine now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly Bill, you look just like somebodies dad. If some pedestrian drives by and sees a grown ass man like you trying to wrestle something away from a little girl like me, who are they going to sympathize with?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh...I'm your mother's boss now! I can get her fired and have the both of you put on the street!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria smirked. \u201cYou haven't met my mom. If you ever tried to fire her, it'd be weeks until they found your body.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah right, Gloria. Just because you...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, while Bill and Gloria continued to bicker over the gemstone, Tom was growing confused at how happy, how blissful these new memories as Tammy Strasserman were making him feel. Call him crazy, but he could actually get used to being an older woman. Was he actually transgender this entire time? Tom  had never felt uncomfortable being a man before. No, it wasn't his new gender. It was something else. In this new reality, he felt loved. Tammy's memories were filled with almost nothing but wedded bliss. Memories of Bill and Tammy on their many vacations all over the world. Memories of romantic candlelit dinners. Memories of seeing Bill's ripped abs riding on top of her as they made love. Memories of Bill chasing down a man six blocks who had stolen her purse. Memories of their daughter Willow, and how they had both had nurtured her into the wonderful young woman that she was now. Sure, Bill and Tammy had arguments like every couple did, but the fights never lasted very long, and they almost always gave way to the joys of kissing and making up. Not like his toxic relationship with Gloria, who made everything about herself and never accepted that she was wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the original reality, Tom was miserable. Gloria and her gang had turned him into a social pariah. He was constantly made to feel like shit for things he never did. Tom had never told anyone this, not even Bill, but he had considered suicide at one point. Maybe that's why this new reality seemed so attractive to him. Here, as Tammy, she was respected. She had a loving husband and a loving daughter, and she and Bill lived in a wonderful house without a care in the world. It was so saccharine that most people would puke, but Tom was clinging to any kind of acceptance he could. He loved recalling new life. He wanted to be Tammy Strasserman forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Tom/Tammy somehow convinces Gloria to give up the stone, and she begs Bill to play at being a married couple for a week. If he doesn't like it, she promises that they can turn back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Tammy decides to fix things then and now by making a wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Gloria, angry at Bill's threats, makes another wish.</span></div></div>",

Tammy watched as the stone glowed. Her eyes widened in a bit of fear. Obviously the stone is what caused all this in the first place, and it's glow most likely meant that it was about to do its magic at the next wish. Tammy didn't want to lose this opportunity as quickly as she had gained it. She didn't want to be Tom again, at least not until she gave this a try. She had to speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bill. Gloria. Give me that stone. Now!\" Tammy said, her voice taking on a very motherly tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill and Gloria looked at the former Tom in a bit of shock. Both Gloria and Bill realized that this large woman had been quiet for most of the previous precedings. And now that she spoke, it completely drew her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, obviously that stone is very powerful, and however it works, we need to make sure we don't send ourselves hurdling into another reality. And if you two can't handle it, let a third party try and take control for a second.\" Tammy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was, Tammy was lying through her teeth. In fact, she was already thinking of ways to possibly use this stone to make her new life permanent. But for the moment, she had to get the stone away from the emotions of Bill and Gloria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I'm right.\" Tammy said, looking to Gloria and Bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria, who was currently holding the stone, looked to Bill, and considered for a moment that something like that could happen to her if she wasn't careful. She really wanted the rich and famous life she was trying to get... but she couldn't bring herself to argue with her former boyfriend's logic. Reluctantly, she handed the stone to Tammy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now, Bill... I have a proposition for you.\" Tammy said. Bill looked on in curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom...\" Bill said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bill, please, call me Tammy.\" Tammy said. Bill looked a bit concerned, but nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen... what if we played in this reality for a week? What if we lived the life of a married couple? We have the memories, we have the connection, let's just give it a try?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tammy, you really... want to be my wife for a week?\" Bill said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can spend some time reasearching this stone, seeing if there are any legends or anything... plus we'll get a chance to be something new. Look, if this doesn't work out in a week, and if we don't find anything, I promise I'll try to wish us back. Please, honey? Can we be husband and wife?\" Tammy exclaimed, that last \"honey\" accidently slipping from his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill looked on in a bit of shock, but it was that honey that Tammy slipped out that really did the trick. He now had many memories how how much he loved his wife, and he couldn't say no to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Tammy, fine. But only if we actually get to do some research on this thing.\" Bill said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you Bill! Thank you honey!\" Tammy said, giving Bill a big kiss on the lips. Bill couldn't help to think this was weird... but also... he was sort of into it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Gloria changes her mind, angry about how happy Tom is as Tammy, and demands the stone back. Angry at Gloria's selfishness, Tammy wishes Gloria was the Stasserman family dog. Bill is both horrified and aroused by this development.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Gloria leaves to explore her Tom and Bill-less life, leaving Tammy and Bill to be a loving couple.</span></div></div>",

He was still recovering from that knockout of a kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot you, Bill. Tom. I can't believe it! I was joking when I said that you two should be a married couple, but apparently he really DOES love you more than he loves me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy looked at Gloria with a look of annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe adults are kissing, Gloria. Go away now. There's some cheers that need leading. Go hang out with Jon Ingerman or something. Let him be your boyfriend for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEww!\u201d exclaimed Gloria. \u201cNo, I'm not going out with that nine month mistake. I want you! That's why I came over here to begin with!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGloria, please\u201d said Tammy in a firm but gentle voice, letting go of Bill. \u201cI've made my decision.

Well it's obvious that you're happy being a kept woman, so you don't even need it anymore!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u201d insisted Tammy. \u201cThis stone is staying with us until we figure out what to do with it. You're proven that you're not responsible with it. You've got to earn your trust back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFUCK YOU!\u201d screamed Gloria as she ran at Tammy, trying to grab the Ahn'Ger stone. Bill himself was so shocked that he hadn't had time to try and stop her, although Tammy was. Although she was now a middle aged woman with a sedentary lifestyle, four years of being a basketball player as Tom had honed her reflexes, and she easily evaded Gloria's telegraphed attempts to wrestle the magic artifact from her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it, give it back!\u201d said Gloria as she wrestled on the ground with Tammy. If she had seen the stone's emerald glow, she may have rethought her decision and backed off. Then again, maybe she wouldn't have. The Vanapoulos family were known for their stubbornness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBad girl!\u201d laughed Tammy playfully, still evading Gloria's every attempt at reneging on her promise. That was, until Gloria slapped her in the face, stinging her skin a little. That part actually shocked Tammy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to be a brat? Fine. I wish you were our dog!\u201d she yelled angrily, knowing what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria's body was suddenly covered in the gemstone's green flare. Her body shimmered and shrunk, retracting into a smaller, more compressed shape. Just a few brief moments later, in the dark haired girl's place now stood a friendly looking Labrador Retriever! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa!\u201d laughed Tammy. \u201cThat's what you get, Gloria!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoof!\u201d barked Gloria, trying and failing to enunciate human speech. \u201cWoof! Woof!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Gloria realized that she couldn't speak English anymore, her new body now took on a cowering, more frightened picture. Gloria realized that she couldn't even see in color anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Gloria acquiesces to being Bill and Gloria's dog in the hopes that eventually they will turn her back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Gloria still desperately tries to knock the gemstone out of Tammy's hand in the hopes that she can wish herself back to normal. </span></div></div>",

In that moment, Gloria considered her options. She could either go on the attack, try to get the stone, wish herself back. But truly, was it worth the risk? She couldn't even speak English! Would she be able to even wish herself back with just barks and growls? And if she did fail... well... was it possible that Tammy could come up with something worse to change her into?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other option... Gloria didn't really like... but she really had no choice. She was gonna be the best dog possible, in hopes that Tammy and Bill eventually would be nice enough to change her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria rushed up on all fours to Tammy, bounded up to place her new paws on Tammy's shoulders, and began to lick Tammy's face like there was no tomorrow. She had to convince Tammy that she was... well, a good dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down, girl! Down!\" Tammy laughed, and Gloria found herself obeying, going back to all fours and panting. She was loyal, and a good girl for her master... wait, did she think that? Was playing into the dog role giving her a dog's emotions?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see how smart you are, girl. Sit!\" Tammy said. And indeed, Gloria obeyed, sitting on her haunches, tail wagging behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl! Speak!\" Tammy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woof!\" Gloria barked. She liked being called a good girl. It felt.. right! It felt... natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl! Such a good girl!\" Tammy said, as she leaned down to scratch Gloria's floppy ears. Gloria's tail wagged even faster, her tongue panting more and more. Tammy was right! She was a good girl! And this ear scratching felt so good. There was a part of Gloria that tried to hold onto her human past, remembering her mission to become human again... but a larger part of her was satisfied with the ear scratching. A larger part of her hoped her male master would take her for a walk later. A larger part of her just wanted to be a good girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gloria descended further into a doggy lifestyle, Tammy couldn't help but to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that worked out rather well... and now... back to us...\" Tammy said, returning to Bill's gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Bill is horrified that Tammy just took away Gloria's human will like that. He secretly plots to get the stone away from Tammy before she goes mad with power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Bill is surprisingly turned on by Tammy's actions. The two become the Bonnie and Clyde of magical stones, and plan ways to use the stone to imrpove their lives as they grow more and more aroused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Gloria manages to hold onto her humanity, and plots to return to normal.</span></div></div>",

No way Tom would be taking her for walks or making her a statue or something. She was gonna get back to being human. No matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn intinct, Gloria jumped at Tammy, biting her arm in the process. Tammy was so stunned by the turn of events that the Stone dropped out of her hand and to the ground. As if in slow motion, both Tammy and Gloria watched as the stone hit the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria wasted no time, and lunged towards the stone, placing her paw on top of it. She growled and barked, hoping that would be enough to activate the stone and fix this nonsense once and for all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: It works! The stone can just read pure emotion. However, Gloria has still not learned her lesson. She wishes to be human, but creates a reality where humans are pets and dogs are the dominant species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: It doesn't work!

He didn't even look at Gloria when he had said that, as he was too focused on being in the throws of loves with Tammy...his wife of almost thirty years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAm I going to get the stone back, at least? Do I at least get a parting gift? A simple thank you? I'm the one that made you a married couple in the first place!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn a week, Gloria\u201d answered Tammy, not really paying attention to her either as she stared lovingly into Bill's soulful blue eyes and sensually traced her fingers down her husband's rock hard chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh...get a room. Nobody wants to see you two old folks making out in public.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill and Tammy both suddenly recalled how much they enjoyed making public displays of love when they were younger, and they weren't going to stop now. Bill had even already forgotten about this blonde woman formerly being his male best friend less than an hour ago.  They continued to ignore Gloria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you guys\u201d whispered Gloria as she stomped away. \u201cFirst Tom won't accept me forgiving him, and then Bill steals him away!\u201d she quietly muttered to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the frustrating walk to school, Gloria noticed her mother's 2009 Saturn Aura passing by her. Ariadne waved in a friendly manner out the window at her daughter. Gloria waved back, almost out of duty. Ariadne would have asked if Gloria wanted a ride, but she already knew the answer. Gloria wanted to spend as much time away from her mother as possible, so the car passed by her on Ariadne's way to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she trudged along, lost in thought over what a mistake it had been to come over to Bill's house today, that she should have listened to her gut feeling and just continue keeping Tom removed from her life, Gloria noticed with trepidation a cool breeze in the air and a sudden drop in brightness. The sunny, cheerful morning was now rapidly giving way to cloud cover. Dark clouds. Within a minute of walking, she heard thunder in the distance, and before Gloria knew it, it began to rain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh great\u201d said the younger Vanapoulos, not having possessed the foresight to carry an umbrella. She took off her backpack and carried it over her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Bill and Tammy were still holding each other, exploring the other's body for the first time in a way only a loving married couple can. They both kept it above the waist, but the intent was clear. They may as well have been making love. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it began to pour rain, Tammy started to laugh and hugged Bill tightly across the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is just like The Notebook!\u201d she said, which Bill's new memories recalled was Tammy's favorite romantic movie, a movie that she forced her husband to watch too many times for his liking. Despite that, Bill laughed at the reference and just the sheer weirdness of this morning. They kissed one more time, reminding each other of Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC'mon, lets go inside before we catch our death of cold\u201d said Bill with a smile, grabbing Tammy's hand. Understanding the intent, and without any desire to return to her life as Tom, Tammy smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Giggling like the kids they were, in mind if not in body, Bill and Tammy ran inside the house, quickly locked their front door, and they began voraciously discarding each other's wet clothes all over the spacious home as well as the stairwell as they made a carnal journey to the master bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gloria reached school, the rain had intensified, and afraid that the constant downpour would wreck her school work, Gloria removed it as head cover and carried the pack around her chest the rest of the way, simply bearing the rain. To make matters worse, the onslaught of water wasn't the warm, breezy summer rain that she enjoyed playing in as a little kid. It was the cold, oppressive rain that felt like bullets as they landed on your skin hundreds at a time, just making you miserable. Gloria felt every drop of that cold hell. She ran up the front stairs as fast as she could and opened the door to enter. Shivering, Gloria decided to take a quick trip to the restroom to readjust herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI look like a drowned rat\u201d she muttered with horror. Her hair was soaking wet, as were her clothes. Looking downward, she realized that her feet and sandals were now covered in mud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh!\u201d was the sound she uttered. Gloria took them off and washed her feet in the sink, feeling like she was a total pig. She then wiped downher sandals of telltale mud stains using paper towels. Finally, Gloria took a couple of deep breaths and stared at herself in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're Gloria Vanapoulos. You've handled worse than this. You're brave. You're fierce. You're not a failure\u201d she said in a soft yet firm tone to her reflection like it was therapy and marched out of the lavatory to her first class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, Gloria Vanapoulos was terrified. Her former boyfriend and his spaz of a best friend had stumbled upon a magic gemstone that could change reality. They were essentially gods with it, and she gave it away like a total idiot! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked to class, she wondered why she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow!? How the hell did Tom mind trick me?\u201d she muttered under her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was Tom's new motherly demeanor, and Gloria didn't need to be reminded that she had issues with mother figures. In retrospect, Tammy actually came across like she was probably as sweet as she seemed and was a far cry from the emotionally abusive domineering witch that Ariadne was, but nonetheless, the trauma and the button triggered it were both still there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria would have to analyze her anxiety and self loathing at a later date, as she had to go to Calculus. She walked through Mr. Thompson's door discreetly and looked for her usual seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMs. Vanapoulos, you're late\u201d said the stern teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it\u201d muttered Gloria, hoping that he would have noticed her, as the lights were dimmed to show Mr. Thompson's lecture on the overhead projector. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry, Gloria. I don't want to do this, but since this is your second tardy this week, I'm going to have to count that as a strike on your record, Gloria\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Mr. Thompson. It won't happen again. Family emergency\u201d she lied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Thompson nodded his head stoically, and then went back to discussing L'Hopital's rule for derivatives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree strikes meant that you were suspended from school for a week, which is something that Ariadne would never let her hear the end of, so gulping, Gloria pulled out her notebook and began putting pen to paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: In this new reality, Gloria has a new boyfriend, one who treats her like dirt and is controlling over her life the same way her mom is. To make matters worse: With a more sullen, depressed personality, Gloria no longer has the sway over her girl clique that she once did, and now even has several rivals. Gloria suffers through a day of school waiting to get back to Bill and Tammy so she can wish this horrible reality away. Too bad blissful Tammy has designs on making this reality permanent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Meanwhile, at Bill and Tammy's house...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Something else.</span></div></div>",

He looked at himself at the mirror himself. 'Not too shabby' he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's a cursed piece of shit is what it is\u201d fumed Gloria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, why couldn't you have turned into a puppy, or some ducks?\u201d Bill joked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy's eyes darted around the house. The first thing she saw were a pair of photos: One when she and Bill had first gotten married. Tammy was wearing a gorgeous wedding gown based on a design from the 1800s, and Bill's thousand watt smile could melt anyone's heart. The date at the bottom said 5/8/2025. The second photo was of the two them, now older, perhaps in their late thirties or early forties, standing next to a teenage girl at Disneyland, all three in front of the famous copper statue of Walt and Mickey Mouse holding hands. It took only a moment for Tammy to realize that the teenage girl was their daughter. Tammy recalled her name: Willow. Willow had both of her parents physical characteristics, and she seemed particularly happy being at Disneyland. Tammy further recalled that Willow was interested in animation beyond just entertainment and fandom. She wanted to pursue it as a career, and Tammy remembers both she and Bill being very supportive of it. Early memories of Willow's artistic abilities flashed through her mind. Either way, all three of them in the picture were wearing Mickey Mouse hats and seemed like they were living the American dream. They seemed so happy...so blissful. Tom had always wanted to visit Disneyland, but he never had the chance to. This reality, despite the forty years of aging, seemed so much nicer than the one Tom had ten minutes ago. He...she could get used to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill and Gloria continued to bicker for a little bit, with Bill needling Gloria for how old she looked(She didn't actually look THAT bad, but Gloria couldn't stand it, both out of vanity as well as the psychic pain of not wanting to look like her mother). Gloria on the other hand reminded Bill who still had the stone, and how she was going to turn Bill into a ferret if he didn't shut up.  Their fighting and Tammy's reverie  were interrupted however by a loud honking noise coming from outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cold robotic voice that sounded like the Siri app then erupted throughout the house like Reveille. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIncoming call from: Willow\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's our daughter, Bill!\u201d yelled Tammy with excitement from the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur daughter?\u201d asked Bill, confused. He was too busy quarreling with Gloria to recall his new memories, but neither he, nor Gloria, nor Tammy could ignore the knock on the door. He pulled his vibrating cell phone out his pocket, and saw an image of a pretty young woman who looked like maybe an older version of his sister Kimberly staring right at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy then unlocked and opened the front door, revealing said young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Mom!\u201d squealed Willow, giving Tammy a large bear hug, who reciprocated said hug and squeal in turn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho's that?\u201d asked Gloria, still primping in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeats me\u201d said Bill, not wanting to admit the possibility running through his head. They both walked into the living room, where Bill was ambushed by another big bear hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Dad! I'm home! Hey Mrs. Vanapoulos, that's a cute jacket you're wearing\u201d added Willow after she gave her father a loving peck on the cheek, looking over her father's shoulder at her childhood neighbor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks?\u201d added Gloria, who didn't really like the jacket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow let go of Bill and composed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, Dad...I've got great news, and I just HAD to tell both of you in person!\u201d  she said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill's mind melted. The very first attractive woman to ever kiss him was his own daughter. He felt simultaneously disgusted, confused, and embarrassed. He wasn't anywhere near emotionally ready to be a parent, and yet, here she was, bursting with energy and gusto. He heard her speak, saw her mouth moving a mile a second, but the entire time Bill was lost in thought at this strange new reality. Suddenly he saw Willow childishly snapping her fingers in his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad! Didn't you hear a word I said!?\u201d giggled Willow. \u201cI...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: After two years of working on other people's shows, Willow is finally getting to create her own animated TV series. The plot of the cartoon, about a magic rock that warps reality and grants wishes, but only when the user is angry, is disturbingly close to the events of this morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Mutants with superhuman powers exist in the future of 2058. Willow has just discovered that she is a mutant. A quite powerful one.  </span></div></div>",

The trips to Disney World. Watching Little Mermaid and Zootopia and Sleeping Beauty and Ducktales over and over again. Buying tours of Cartoon Network and the Disney Studio for Willow. Sending Willow off to LA for school. Her being very excited to get her first gig. And now, this moment, this moment where this girl claiming to be his daughter now had found true success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sweetheart! We're so proud of you! We're so happy all your dreams are coming true!\" Tammy exclaimed, trying to save face for Bill's lack of engagement. Bill took the message. It was almost as if he knew his wife better than anyone, even though his wife was supposed to be his best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Willow... that's amazing. I'm just trying to... take in this amazing news! What's the show about?\" Bill asked, trying his damndest to be a good dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you'd never ask! Well, it's about these three friends. Brad, Tim, and Gina, and they find a magical rock that grants them wishes, but only when they are angry enough! Now, that gets them into all sorts of hijinks every week. Like, one week, Brad's accidently turned into Gina's poodle. And then the next week Gina finds herself in 1920s New York... and there's a whole mythology...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Willow went on and on about all her plans for the show, Bill, Tammy, and Gloria all looked at each other. This was sounding familiar. Much too familiar...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there's a whole bunch of other stones we can introduce in season 2, and beyond! It'll be like that old show Gravity Falls! We can have an endgame!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... amazing sweetheart.\" Bill said, a little shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Bill and Tammy try to get Willow to share more about the backstory of the stone, and even get her to talk about the other \"stones\" she has planned for season 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: As Gloria goes to put away her things, Gloria tries to convince Bill and Tammy to just show Willow the real stone and tell her what actually happened.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once Willow calmed down a little bit from her big news, Tammy invited her into the living room to sit on the comfy couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tammy looked at some of Willow's concept artwork for the show that she brought with her, trying to play the role of supportive mother, Bill glanced over at Gloria, who was wearing an over the top expression of stunned disbelief. Gloria's jaw was dropped, her eyes were practically escaping from her sockets, and then she whispered: \u201cShould we tell her?\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill shook his head and whispered back softly: \u201cNot yet\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both walked into the living room, where Bill saw some of Willow's drawings sitting on the coffee table as she was explaining them to Tammy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd this is Brad. He's more or less the main character.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill glanced at the sketch and noticed that \u201cBrad\u201d looked very much like he himself normally looked. Not 100% identical, but close enough to be disturbing to Bill. The drawing Willow was showing had Brad first discovering what Willow called the \u201cGrellstone\u201d, picking up the mysterious artifact that somehow appeared on his front porch. Below Brad was some black text- the narration that was going to be added to the show once it started being produced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHY COULDN'T LIFE JUST BE EASIER? WHY DO I HAVE TO SUFFER BECAUSE OF SOME IDIOT NEANDERTHAL, OR WAIT AROUND LIKE A DOOFUS FOR MY SADSACK FAILURE OF A FRIEND? OR TAKE CRAP FROM MY FAMILY?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill realized that his internal thoughts- the monologue that goes on his head- more or less said the exact same thing earlier this morning. He was starting to wonder what else Willow knew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney?\u201d asked Bill as he sat down next to Willow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Dad?\u201d she asked with a bright smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's the plot of your first episode?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that depends on how the Disney Channel decides to schedule everything. They don't always put the episodes in chronological order, but the first episode we're planning on has Brad, Tim, and Gina getting into a fight, and the Grellstone turns them all into adults in their mid-fifties. Towards the beginning, Tim and Gina are boyfriend and girlfriend, but they hate each other, and Gina gets a hold of the stone and wishes that Brad and Tim were an old married couple. Tim transforms into Brad's wife Tabitha. Tabitha wants to stay as an adult woman because she thinks her life is better that way because Gina turned everyone against him in the real world, but Gina hates it because she hates being old, which is understandable. However, her appearance also reminds her too much of her mother Artemis, who Gina sees as a real mean, controlling bitch, but really just wants what's best for her. Meanwhile, Brad wants the stone back for himself because he found it first, and he thinks that it's therefore rightfully his. So for the rest of the episode, they're all scheming to get it back from each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Willow was enthusiastically explaining the plot, the grin on her face bespeaking her own pride at inventing such a far out and clever plot, Tammy began to become more concerned. The pleasant look on her maternal face began to turn into one of rapt attention at what her daughter was going to say next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the end of the episode, Gina finally gets a hold of the stone, and...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd?\u201d added Gloria, who realized that Willow was talking about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd she makes another angry wish that screws everything up even further, but we haven't decided what that'll be yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow shrugged her shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry! We're still really early in development for this. You three are literally the first people to know who aren't directly involved. Disney would probably sue the pants off of me if they found out I was telling you guys\u201d she said, laughing a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that...\u201d Tammy hesitated. \u201cThat sounds really creative, honey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria looked a little mad, not liking the implication that she screwed things up for everyone in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u201d said Bill. \u201cI'd watch the hell out of that, Willow. You know how much I love animation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's why I wanted to tell you first, Dad! You're the one that turned me on to all this!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what about those other gemstone you mentioned earlier? The ones you were thinking about putting in Season 2?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that! I...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Willow explains that she's planning on there being other gemstones that are powered by different emotions, sort of like Green Lantern, but they are hidden all across the universe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Something else<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'd love to learn so much more. I promise to post no spoilers once the show gets on the air, I promise!\" Bill said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sweetie. We love hearing all this stuff you are so passionate about. The more you have to tell us, the better!\" Tammy said, getting into what Bill was trying to do. The more information they had on the stones, the more they could understand what was happening... and the more likely Tammy would find a way to remain Tammy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you don't mind, Mrs. V?\" Willow asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not at all.\" Gloria said. To be honest, she had been tuning out much of this, other than the fact that this stone she had was seemingly powered by anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, OK! If you insist! Well, there's obviously the <b>Grellstone</b>, which grants wishes through anger, as we've established. There's also the <b>Brellstone</b>, which creates a blissful reality for whoever holds it, but of course, there's always a sort of catch to that thing. Then, there's the <b>Frellstone</b>, based on fear. It essentially reads a person's fear and creates a change or object to protect them from that fear. There's the <b>Drellstone</b>, powered by sadness, and a little similar to the Frellstone, works to make the sadness disappear. And Finally there is the Vrellstone, which is the most powerful of the stones, and is powered by love. But why it's so powerful... well, that's for another time.\" Willow smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill took this all in. These were basically infinity stones, now existing in his reality! All powerful things, objects, with the ability to change and alter the course of space and time. And he was in possession of one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Willow goes into one last part of the Grellstone lore, the Two Gods in control of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Willow leaves to put her stuff away. Tammy wants to get the Brellstone to create a perfect Tammy life, Gloria wants the Frellstone to take advantage of her fears, and Bill thinks the Anger Stone is enough, even though he is curious about the power of the Vrellstone.</span></div></div>",

Maybe they cause some trouble that's too big to ignore, and they the Feds find out about the Grellstone. Maybe it gets confiscated by some other super secret XYZ agency in the process, and maybe they all end up in some scary black site where people disappear and are never found again.

But hey...gemstones...there's probably genies inside it, right? Like the genie in Aladdin? Me and some of the other animators are really keen on adding godlike characters into the story so we can go all meta with it when we feel like it. Every stone could be powered by a different god. Maybe more than one!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria, looked down at the gemstone she was holding in the palm of her hand.

Still holding onto the gemstone, she began to walk hurriedly towards the door to her own home, if she even lived there now, when suddenly a very solid, gut feeling was telling her that she didn't in fact live there anymore. A strange vision, a newfound memory from her recent past was telling Gloria that she lived with Bill and Tammy...Bill and Tom...Bill and Tammy now. This memory was telling her that she was temporarily living in their guest bedroom because she had just gotten divorced from her husband...a Senator! He had cheated on her multiple times, dumped her, and screwed her over in the divorce proceedings. He had done a good job at covering this up, and even though Gloria had raised hell about it in the media, not enough people believed her to make it a political issue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gloria stood there, paralyzed by this new information, indecisive on what to do now, Willow spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I'm so sorry to hear about the divorce, Mrs. V\u201d said Willow, sounding genuinely hurt for Gloria. \u201cIs your mom still OK?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe's...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria's new memories started filling in.

He got up from Willow's little demonstration of her new characters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I need to help Gloria calm down. Could you just give me a couple of minutes, Willow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow looked concerned, but she shook her head. \u201cSure\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill and Gloria began to walk upstairs to the guest room, when Tammy told her daughter that she wanted to make sure that everything was OK and ran upstairs herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Gloria's room, Gloria was explaining to Bill the memory she just had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHAT SON OF A BITCH!\u201d screamed Gloria. \u201cHOW DARE HE CHEAT ON ME!?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGloria, you literally just found out who this guy was. You have no actual attachment to him. This reality isn't our reality\u201d observed Bill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's the principle of the thing! Nobody cheats on me and gets away with it! It's a rule!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh brother\u201d said Bill quietly as he rolled his eyes at Gloria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy then entered the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you screaming about now, Gloria?\u201d she asked with a touch of hostility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApparently I have a husband now. An ex-husband. It's so weird. I remember being married to him and everything, and the asshole cheated on me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ahn'Ger Stone began glowing in her hand a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can't\u201d said Gloria, starting to hyperventilate. \u201cI can't live in this reality. As funny as it is seeing what you've both turned into, I just can't. It's too painful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill and Tammy stared at one another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about Willow?\u201d asked Bill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about her!?\u201d asked Gloria, as if that were a stupid question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys, didn't you see how happy she looked?\u201d Bill continued. \u201cI mean...I know that she's not real-real, but she looked so happy telling us about her show.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm not happy!\u201d loudly whispered Gloria. \u201cI just got robbed of forty years of my life! And to add insult to injury, I've been humiliated by some ratfaced asshole!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't want to break Willow's heart. This is like her dream\u201d said Bill, recalling new memories. \u201cEver since she was a little girl, she's had apparently been obsessed with this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEarth to Bill: She's not really your daughter!\u201d said Gloria, looking at Bill like he was crazy. \u201cThis isn't reality. We're still just teenagers!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut maybe this reality IS real, just an alternate version of our reality\u201d ruminated Bill, now lost in his own concerns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! That! Listen to Bill\u201d said Tammy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh stop it, Tom! Stop acting like you're so happy being here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're actually happy being a middle aged woman?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! I've got a family. Bill and Willow love me and I love them back. I never realized it, but that's all I've ever really wanted, a family to call my own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria rolled her eyes and moved her fingers around in a derogatory motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the world's smallest violin playing for you\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up Gloria!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, YOU shut up Tom! I wish...\u201d said Gloria absentmindedly, in a state of anger and panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Gloria wishes that they were all teenagers again. The wish is granted, and the gemstone transports them all back to 2018...including Willow, who is now also eighteen again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Before Gloria can make a wish, Willow knocks on the door and wants to know if everything is OK. Bill, Gloria, and Tammy stumble over each other trying to come up with a convincing lie. </span></div></div>",

Bill stood for what seemed for an eternity before the light faded away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Bill's eyesight returned, he instantly recognized the place where he stood: His house! As in his house from 2018, not his weird but still really cool future house. Looking down at himself, he found that he was back in the same teenage body he started this day with, Same teenage clothes, same teenage build. Looking up again, he saw Gloria, same as she ever was, except a few moments ago when she was older. But as Bill looked around, he started to see that not everything was back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst of all, there was Tammy, who had not returned to his Tom form, but was now simply a teenage version of Tammy. She was slightly chubby, not as heavily built as the older version. Her blonde hair flowed downward, and she was wearing a Black Widow Shirt and Jeans. Bill couldn't help but to find himself incredibly attracted to Tammy. He wasn't sure if this was a residual effect of the magic or if Tammy truly just was his ideal woman. But he couldn't stop thinking about how much he wanted to kiss Tammy again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Bill's eyes turned to the other elephant in the room: Willow! She was still rather stylish, wearing nice red dress, and black heels. Bill couldn't help but to wonder what was going through Willow's mind right now. Bill, Gloria, and Tammy obviously knew about this weird stone. But Willow had been a construct of an alternate reality. Does she remember her past? Or has the stone adjusted reality once again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Willow freaks out about her parents being teenagers and being stuck in 2018. Bill and Tammy try to explain, but Willow grabs the stone in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Willow believes she is Bill's sister, at which point Bill realizes that the stone has made more strange changes to reality that he didn't suspect.</span></div></div>",

Bill, Gloria, and Tom/Tammy had already suffered the experience of shifting through realities once today, and the second time wasn't any less abnormal or extraordinary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys, I think we're back home\u201d announced Bill, relieved to hear his normal voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my g...I did it!? I actually fixed things!?\u201d shouted Gloria with a hint of ebullient surprise in her voice as she observed Bill, Gloria still holding the stone in her right hand. She immediately examined her body, her hair, and touched her face. She seemed to be back to normal, and breathed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. \u201cIt looks like were in my folk's guest room still, judging by the cobwebs in the corner since nobody ever actually visits us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot everything is back to normal, not that I'm complaining\u201d announced Tammy as she examined her own self, a younger facsimile of the woman she had been just a moment ago. She noticed that she was still slightly overweight, with a bit of a soft patch of flesh over her stomach and an overall thicker body, but it was nothing major. Her wavy blonde hair felt oddly comforting as it rested against her shoulders. When she noticed teenage Bill, she immediately felt butterflies. They traded knowing smiles to one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock of this mystical adventure had momentarily set aside all of the drama that Bill, Gloria, and Tammy were going through this morning. Simultaneously, all three walked up to hug each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLets never tell anyone about this\u201d said Bill, his voice almost a whisper. \u201cThis stone is dangerous\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still want to try and experiment with it. There's got to be a way to use it safely\u201d said Gloria, had hand still gripping the artifact tightly. \u201cCome on, if we crack this, we can have anything we want!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe. We've got to get to school first though or my parents will kill me. We can play around with it later\u201d said Tammy. She wondered what her reputation was like now that she was no longer Tom. It couldn't be any worse than what Gloria and her crew had done to slander it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the three fire forged friends were trying to wonder what to do next with their lives after discovering an omnipotent rock, none of them had paid much attention to Willow. Gloria had half-expected her to just vanish or evaporate, as she couldn't actually be \u201creal\u201d, could she? Willow was just a construct from the old reality, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria was wrong. Despite being from the future(Or perhaps another reality altogether), Willow was just as real as any of our three heroes were. After staring down at herself in the mirror, at the bedroom she now found herself in...after seeing her mom and dad and Mrs. Vanapoulos as teenagers...after having her entire sense of reality torn asunder, Willow began to panic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom! Dad! Where are we!? What happened!?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three suddenly turned around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god\u201d whispered Gloria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWillow\u201d said Bill carefully. \u201cWe've got a lot to tell you. Believe me, we're still figuring things out ourselves. You see, we've got this magic rock we found...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d shouted Willow. \u201cWhat magic rock? Where are we!? One minute I see all of you run upstairs like you're hiding something, and then I hear you all fighting, and then I run upstairs and saw a huge green light coming from underneath the door...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGloria? Please?\u201d asked Bill, pointing towards the stone. Reluctantly, Gloria handed it over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis gemstone, Willow. You see...I hate telling you this, but I'm not really your dad. Scratch that. I mean that I am your dad, but just not yet. I found this just sitting on my doorstep this morning. When I was 18, in the year 2018. Me and Gloria and To...and your mother got into a little argument, and somebody made a very stupid wish...and somehow we ended up in 2058 as grown adults.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow's jaw dropped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo none of my memories are real? Growing up with you and mom, wearing pajamas, drinking milkshakes, birthdays and holidays, going to college...none of that ever happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe. Maybe not. I don't know\u201d answered Bill impotently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll of that could have happened. Maybe it just hasn't yet\u201d added Tammy. \u201cIf we were all as old as we were just a few minutes ago, I'm probably not going to give birth to you for a few more years, at least.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow looked sad at her mother's logic. It all made sense. All that fighting she heard was probably Mom and Dad and Gloria fighting over the stone for a second time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I'm stuck in the past? In 2018? Isn't Donald Trump president now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnfortunately. I didn't vote for him\u201d laughed Bill uncomfortably through gritted teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria's eyes were darting around. She was becoming worried that something bad was about to happen. She wanted to run the hell out of here, but something inside her told her that she shouldn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god\u201d said Willow, looking sick. \u201cThis is like being stuck in the stone ages! No self driving cars. No synthetic meat. First contact with the Martians hasn't even happened yet. I've got to get out of here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprising even Bill, Willow casually walked up to Bill and suddenly snatched the stone out of her future father's hand, shocking the boy into silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, please give that back. You don't know how to use it\u201d said Tammy in her teenage voice, trying her best to sound like a mom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll I have to do is make a wish, right?\u201d asked Willow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow was thinking now about The Wizard of Oz. About Dorothy Gale being whisked away into a magical land of enchantment. That's exactly how she was feeling right now, except for the fact that realizing your life was a lie didn't feel so enchanting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish I were back home!\u201d she shouted to the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Bill and Tammy's disappointment, and Gloria's sudden terror about not listening to her gut and leaving, the stone began to glow once more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: The stone misinterprets Willow's thoughts of Oz by actually sending the four of them to the wonderful land created by L Frank Baum, and they'll only be able to return home by playing out the story of the classic movie. Willow finds herself in the role of Dorothy, Tammy finds herself as Glinda the Good Witch, Gloria as the Wicked Witch of the West, and Bill as the titular wizard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: For the first time, the stone does nothing. The world of 2018 is her home now. One where she has no identity, no paper trail, and no one but Bill, Gloria, and Tammy knows who she is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Willow, no!\" screamed Bill and Tammy in unison, both future parents leaping to save their time displaced daughter from making a horrible, reality altering mistake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite having returned to their original timeline of 2018, the couple still possessed the memories of their future selves on top of their current memories(And on top of a third, <i>original</i> set of memories where Tammy was Tom and they were merely a pair of best buddies instead of lovers). Because of this, both of them felt oddly protective of the girl who hadn't existed an hour ago. Even though Willow was now a couple of years older than both of them, in their eyes she was still their little girl. More importantly, they both knew how sensitive she could be, how easily she let her imagination run away from her into the darkest recesses of horror and despair. Both being caring guardians, Bill and Tammy had wanted to ease her gently into this weird new world she was stuck in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, they were too late. Willow's existential dread was enough to activate the power of the Ahn'Ger Stone. It flared to life in Willow's trembling hand, and an eerie green haze rapidly filled the Strasserman's guest room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief period, Willow was lost between worlds in an empty void where nothing existed. In this eerie, phantom realm where shadow and substance were indistinguishable from one another, she gripped hard onto the magical emerald which had arguably given birth to her, retreating deep into her mental safe space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somewhere over the rainbow..\" she slowly sang to herself to maintain her sanity. The Wizard of Oz was her mother's favorite movie, and whenever Willow got stressed out, one coping strategy that seemed to work for her was focusing on a particular memory of her and her mother watching the film one rainy Thanksgiving evening together as they snuggled up together on the couch. It was a happy memory, one where she had felt perhaps the most content and safe than she had ever been, the combination of childhood nostalgia and maternal affection creating a powerful elixir. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...where trouble melts like lemon drops. High above the chimney tops. That's were you'll find me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank God, it seemed to be working. Her trembling was finally easing up. She kept her eyes closed tightly, ignoring questions of what she was standing on or how she was even breathing if she was really in some dark corner betwixt realities. She half wondered if she was dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no Willow. Stop it. That way lay madness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe curly haired young woman tried extremely hard not to crumble into a hyperventilating little ball(As her instincts told her to do) after her parents had implied that the reality she had grown up in all of her life was artificial. She caught her breath just in time and took in slow, measured gulps of air, feeling her chest rise and fall through her top. Gradually, the tightness she had felt melted away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she couldn't get her mind off of the multitude of thorny questions her vivid imagination was generating. Her parents and Mrs. Vanapoulous just told her that they had made a wish with this magic emerald when they were teenagers and then wished themselves back to normal. This implied that their adult lives weren't their normal, natural selves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would help explain why they were acting so weird and secretive earlier, why something had felt off in Willow's brain the moment she had arrived at her family home, but did that mean she wasn't real?! Was she just the byproduct of this crazy emerald shuttling mom and dad through time and making them older!? Was she just a fill in the blank answer to Bill and Tammy's future dream life together? That possibility made her extremely upset, to know that all of her memories were false and that she was essentially a non playable character in someone else's life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even if she <i>were</i> real and her imagination was just running away from her, if the timeline could be messed around with so casually, does that mean that she could just as casually be erased?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst implication was the one that she had just realized. What if <i>nothing</i> was real? What if she was a fictional character in someone else's strange story? After all, she was a creator herself, and she took joy in playing with the lives and emotions of her fictional characters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just <i>way</i> too eerie of a coincidence that the new animated show Willow had gotten the green light for was about a magic gemstone powered by anger. She had thought that she was so clever, so creative and audacious for coming up with an idea like that. She had impressed all the right people, and her team had already finished up six episodes for the fall season. But now she was wondering if maybe the idea she had in her head wasn't really hers. Maybe it had been implanted in her brain by some higher force, and the implications of that terrified her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it!\" she mentally admonished herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like a small eternity. Willow finally felt herself land on solid ground. The clacking sound of her shoes slamming against what sounded like bricks was the biggest relief in the world to her. She felt like someone lost at sea crawling back onto land at long last. A pleasant warm breeze brushed against her face, tickling her skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she opened her eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.. and gasped much louder than she had intended to.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoosebumps instantly rippled all over Willow's skin as she realized where she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't be\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was unmistakable. In every direction, she saw Munchkin Country. Radiant skies colored an unearthly shade of azure. Enormous fields of grain, wheat, and vegetables that went on for miles, surrounded by neat blue fences. The eccentric looking, squat buildings that dotted the landscape. The freaking yellow brick road she was standing on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention the chitter of laughing little people, many of whom were kneeling behind enormous pumpkins and other large obstacles, trying and failing to hide from Willow. A smile crossed her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would would recognize this place anywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut somehow, it was more than that. She just <b>knew</b> this place was Oz. She felt it in her gut. This world felt brighter, more alive, more vibrant than the real world ever had in her two and a half decades of life. Willow's hypersensitivity to stimuli was overwhelming her with the feeling that wonder, <b>real</b> wonder was possible here. Here, there was no more worrying about bosses and deadlines. Or smog or taxes. Or paying the rent or dealing with assholes. All of the riff raff of the modern world didn't exist here. Here, there was nothing but pure, unadulterated fairy tale fantasy, and nothing in her life experience came close to describing the sense of  bewitching ecstasy coursing through her soul right now. The only thing that had come close was the first time her parents had taken her to Disney World as a kid, and even that was a distant second to this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHell, even the day that an ancient race of aliens were discovered on Mars somehow felt less monumental than the fact that Oz was real. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noted the irony of having lived in Los Angeles for the better part of her adulthood, and how it was it was sometimes referred to as la la land. No, fuck that. This was the true la la land. This. Was. Amazing. Intoxicating, even. It was like Heaven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was when Willow looked down at herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wearing Dorothy's outfit. Her casual clothing had seemingly evaporated. Now, she was wearing the signature blue and white pinafore dress that Judy Garland had worn in that iconic film so many years ago. Her curly, dirty blonde hair was even tied into two long pigtails, capped by two blue bows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Could that mean...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow lifted up her feet and to her disappointment, found that she wasn't wearing the telltale ruby red shoes that could transport her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh, I'm being silly!\" laughed Willow. \"I don't need magic shoes when I have this magic emerald right here in my hand.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, the Ahn'Ger Stone was still in her possession. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow giggled as she watched the population of Munchkins trying in vain to hide from her. She was about to call for them to come out when the last voice she had ever expected to hear erupted behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Willow, is that you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: It was her mother, Tammy! And she was dressed up as Glinda, the Good Witch of the South!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: It was Mrs. Vanapoulous! And she was dressed up as The Wicked Witch Of The West, her skin even having turned an olive green!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Someone else </span></div></div>",

Who was to say she wasn't some artificial being create to fill a role in a reality that had never existed? And what as time itself?

Somehow the look of recognition of what was about to happen to Willow on her mother's much younger face did little to calm her.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Willow made her wish to return home to a timeline that, due to the existence of the Ahn'Ger Stone, no longer existed, something else was happening in the Strasserman household.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow them, in the basement, was Rob Bolstrum. Formerly the head bully of Shermer High until he had lost a fight of dominance against Jonathan Ingerman, Rob was reduced to being Big Jon's lackey, following the rich boy's orders under threat of further humiliation and most certainly pain. Rob had slid in through the basement's single poorly secured window, and was there under orders to 'burn Shitterman's house down' after the Strasserman family and Bill's little geek fucktoy Tammy Ackerton had left for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Rob had complied, at least to Big Jon's face. Knowing that it was just a trap to get rid of Rob permanently as well as get revenge on Bill Strasserman for managing to out-think him, Rob had a plan of his own. Instead of burning Bill's house down, Rob was going to recruit the clever teen to help him come up with a way to get rid of Big Jon once and for all. And so he had waited in the Strasserman family basement, lounging on a couch that sat in front of a older big screen television that appeared to be from the mid-2000s, before decently sized flatscreens had become relatively affordable. The geekery he had been surrounded by almost made him sick to his stomach. Marvel memorabilia was everywhere and the full collection of every single movie sat on a huge shell next to the TV. And a collection of numerous weird not-bobbleheads superheroes that Rob accidentally destroyed trying to make, well, bob in his boredom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then the commotion happened. There was some kind of argument between Strasserman, Ackerton and the Vanapolous chick, then silence before the argument started once more only with a new girl's voice, one that he didn't recognize, in the mix. Curious and annoyed that his own plan was clearly going awry, Rob had crept up the basement stairs and slid out of the door into the kitchen and had been peeking around the corner of the door frame as he watched everything unfold. The two lovebirds were making eyes at each other, Titsapolous looked to be in shock, and a hot chick in a red dress with curly dirty blonde hair was in the process of having a freak out. Rob had to admit though, this new chick that the nerds were calling 'Willow' was rather hot. She looked about three years older than Rob and her body was curved in all the right places. Nice tits, nice ass, the frizzy, curly hair was a bit much and Rob had no idea why she was in a dress that looked like she was going to some kind of award show or a conference or something, but he appreciated how she filled it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What the fuck are these nerds talking about?' Rob wondered as he listened to Bill and Tammy explain to the new chick, who was clearly freaking out about in 'the past'. Rob watched as Gloria handed Bill some kind of green gemstone and explain to the Willow chick who was supposedly his 'daughter' that it was magic. Rob's eyes narrowed in suspicion as he listened to how the trio had somehow traveled to the future, become old, and then traveled back to 2018 with their accidental hitchhiker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'These guys are clearly all having a bad trip. Fucking nerds, can't even handle some pot' Rob chuckled as quietly as he could. But then the Willow chick, whom Rob assumed was the one hooking the teens up with marijuana, grabbed the gemstone and it began glowing! 'No way! Holy shit, are they telling the truth!?' Rob's mind shot off in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it was, he didn't need Strasserman's help to get rid of Big Jon. All he needed to do was walk over and take the Stone from the group. He was so big and strong that they'd never pose any sort of a threat to him. Rob began to creep out from the kitchen when Willow made her wish, and his viision was filled with a blinding green light. When it finally receded, Rob blinked the remaining floaters out of his eyes and stared, in awe much like everyone else, at what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Willow has become Rob's twin sister! But the question is, does Willow retain her old memories or is she Willow Bolstrum, body and soul?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Willow became...Rob's daughter!?</span></div></div>",

Willow's panicked attempt to get back to her own timeline that no longer existed causing the Ahn'Ger Stone's magic to react in a way that no one could have expected. Instead of placing Willow into Bill Strasserman's, Tammy Ackerton's or Gloria Vanapolous's families it instead reached out and placed Willow into the family of someone that none of the teens even knew was in the Strasserman's house. Rob Bolstrum, the humiliated former leader of the Shermer High bullies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead of making Willow into Rob Bolstrum's twin sister, it instead once again acted in a way that no one could have expected. Willow was someone's daughter and whatever the source of the magic within the Stone was, it knew that she had to remain a daughter. And as she had the 'youngest' DNA out of all the gathered individuals, the source of the magic acted accordingly. The magic reached out through the green-shaded world in the instant the flash had occurred and selected the individual that had the 'oldest' genetics within the Strassmerman household. And that individual was the previously unseen Rob Bolstrum, who was two years older than Bill, Tammy and Gloria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magic, or whoever was behind it, seemed satisfied with this choice and in a literal instant, made Willow into Rob Bolstrum's daughter. But as the two were nearly the same age, the magic had to enact further changes to them in order for the new reality to function.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the light faded, everyone saw that Willow now greatly resembled the red-headed bully, only...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Willow was now the same age as Bill, Tammy and Gloria, and Rob was now much older!

She had had enough of them over the years to have a certain amount of self awareness of how she tends to react during these episodes, and given that she was now in a nice quiet room, literally her childhood bedroom, all alone, it helped the recovery process run a lot more smoothly than it otherwise could have. The woman out of time took a long, deep breath, and sighed. She felt her heart palpitations slowly fade away, and her heartbeat lower to her normal resting rate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>All better</i> she whispered to herself quietly as the heat running across her cheeks evaporated.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she had her head on straight again, the first thing that Willow wondered about was how painless teleportation had felt. She didn't know what she had been expecting when she had made that errant wish, but the experience of being spirited away had been completely mundane and uneventful. No feeling of being squished down through a narrow tube like the floo network in Harry Potter, or broken down to her constituent atoms and then reassembled like in Star Trek. One minute, she had been arguing with the teenage versions of her parents, and one wish later, here she was. It was like magic. It <i>was</i> magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like that gemstone took my wish to go home a bit literally\" snarked the artsy blonde as she amazed herself at the familiarity of it all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere she was, sitting on the very same bed that she had slept in every night from when she was a toddler until she left for college, with even the same <i>Gravity Falls</i> themed blanket she had owned since she was six tucked into the mattress. Here she was, staring at the pink colored walls that had once upon a time been covered by posters of classic Disney and Studio Ghibli movies, and later on, darker &amp; moodier stuff during her rebellious teenager phase. She smirked a bit, recalling the fight she had with her mother when Tammy saw the poster of the ultra offensive <i>A Serbian Film</i> laying above Willow's dresser one day, and how Tammy demanded in her *serious* voice to take it down, not happy with her normally sweet daughter watching such filth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were so many memories so had of this room. She remembered tea parties with her daddy and her stuffed animal collection. She remembered how she would jump out of the closet at random intervals to scare both of her parents who worried that she had been kidnapped. She remembered her first girlfriend Kylie, and their subsequent breakup. Willow had lost her virginity on this very bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas any of that even real? She wasn't sure anymore. Slowly, she took a mental step back and went over the events of this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Willow had arrived home, her parents and Mrs. Vanapoulous were acting so weird! Like they weren't themselves. The three of them seemed completely shocked to see her there despite the fact that she had given them a week's notice that she was coming home for the weekend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father hadn't been his normally confident, strapping alpha male self. He wasn't jovial or boisterous, and his posture seemed all wrong. The adult Bill Strasserman wasn't a macho man necessarily, but he had been very successful in life, and he had developed a bit of an ego over it. Willow recalled how a few of her childhood friends and even her third grade teacher had crushes on her ruggedly handsome father as he came to pick her up from school every day in his fancy sports car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier this morning though, her father seemed nervous. Timid. Geeky. His normally strong bear hug seemed weak and shaky and slightly effete. He stuttered just a little bit as he spoke, as if he had suddenly transformed  from Superman to Clark Kent overnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what about Mrs. Vanapoulous? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe middle aged friend of the family, who Willow had always thought was very beautiful, and had always been kind to Willow growing up, and was practically an honorary aunt, was not her usual fierce self either. This morning, she had seemed distant and cold, even slightly petulant. Willow had heard that she was going through a messy divorce, but that excuse seemed too easy, too simple for Willow's endlessly creative brain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, her mother. Willow <i>knew</i> that there was something wrong with her mom the second she entered the house. Nothing had been specifically wrong with Tammy on the surface, the curly topped young woman could just tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow and Tammy were extremely close with one another, as close as a mother and daughter could be, almost as if they had never completely cut the umbilical cord. She called her mom on the holophone every single day, and Willow felt comfortable telling her mother everything going on in her life, even the times where she was depressed or upset or wanting to tear her boss's head off for being an asshole. Tammy had done the same, sharing her own fears and regrets and the little delights happening to her throughout the day, or even just idle gossip from the neighborhood. The two women often sensed each other's thoughts and feelings, and Tammy joked that the two were psychically linked to each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis morning, Willow hadn't felt that. At all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tammy Strasserman she had met had been an imposter. She was warm, and kind, but there was something in her eyes that suggested a lack of genuine maternal knowledge of Willow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on, Willow had brought out the cool stuff, her concept art for the show she was creating, her big break into the industry she was so passionate about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, her parents would have gone gaga over it. Her father had never completely lost his geeky side. He was just as much into animation and comics as Willow was. The \"real\" Bill Strasserman and Willow could have gabbed about her show for hours. Her mother had a fangirl side to her too, and she was always interested in anything her daughter did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, neither had seemed all that excited by it. The parents she had witnessed in the living room were almost scared to see Willow's artwork for <b>The Grellstone: Angry Transformations</b>. They muttered among themselves like little squeaking mice, made some crappy little obvious lie to excuse themselves, and then quickly ran upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Willow had been confused. Then she became hurt, believing that her parents didn't like her show idea, or maybe they were angry at her for some other reason, so she bolted upstairs to go check on them. She heard screaming coming from the guest bedroom. Then she saw an eerie green light coming through the cracks behind the door. She had covered her eyes with the crook of her elbow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, when she lowered her elbow  she had seen something much worse than the off chance Dad had snuck uranium into the house: the teenage versions of her mother and father and Gloria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were all so young! Her father was skinny as a rail, and he had acne scars running across his face! Her mother looked so much like she had at eighteen, except she was much shorter. Mrs Vanapoulous was positively stunning. Like, she was a Willow Strasserman perfect ten, someone that she'd want to go out with if the age difference didn't make it creepy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow put two and two together once Dad explained what had happened with the stone(Which just by itself was incredibly creepy and meta, considering that it was the premise for her cartoon), and that's when she had her little existential crisis about whether or not she was real. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow took another big sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it doesn't really matter anymore. With this stone, reality is whatever I say it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young artist chuckled as held the pretty green gemstone in her hand, and turned it around a couple times, wondering what she should do with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it behaved anything like the Grellstone from her cartoon, it was only possible to make a wish under extreme emotional duress. Anger. Hate. Fear. That sort of thing. It wasn't worth risking, especially by someone as sensitive as she was. Willow thought the best thing to do was find out where she was first and work from there. In all likelihood, if her bedroom was here, whatever parallel reality was currently stuck in couldn't be <i>too</i> different from the one she remembered coming from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr <i>when</i> she was, rather. Maybe she was actually in the correct timeline, but the stone had ferried her ten years too early to 2048! Then she'd open the door and bump into her dorky fifteen year old self getting ready for school! Willow chuckled at the idea of meeting her past self. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, who am I kidding myself? I'm <i>still</i> a dork. We'd probably get along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow stood up and fatefully opened her bedroom door, her creative wheels turning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This might actually be a fun <i>adventure</i>!\" Willow rationalized as she strolled casually down the familiar stairs and went inside the kitchen. Grabbing a can of Pepsi and a banana from the fridge, the girl had already noticed several subtle differences with the decoration of the home. First, the kitchen was wallpapered. The dinner table was also decorated differently, and the drapes blowing from the two open windows were yellow when she remembered them being off white. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCracking open the soda can, Willow took a big, gluttonous gulp of the tasty carbonated beverage and then noticed a strange woman out of the corner of her eye standing in the foyer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um..hi?\" said Willow, giving an awkward little smile with her banana filled hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is this woman? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Stephanie Donaldson, a witch who has been after the Ahn'Ger Stone for a long time, and has been keeping track of the mysterious gemstone's telltale \"timequakes\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Abby Reilly, a neighbor of the Strasserman's from the 2018 timeline, and noted religious fanatic. She believes Willow is her sinful lesbian daughter who's engaging in witchcraft!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You don\u2019t know what that thing can do\u201d Tammy pleaded feebly, her throat tightening from the stress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell let\u2019s find out, Mom! I wish I were home!\u201d Willow screeched. The Ahn'Ger stone flared to life in her hand, creating a localized aurora right within the confines of the guest room. Across the street, a nosy neighbor momentarily thought they saw a blinding flash of unearthly green illumination coming from the second floor of the Strasserman residence, but dismissed it as being the effect of having done too much molly the night before and went on with their day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the uncanny luminescence finally subsided, the young trio saw the curious emerald drop to the floor with a clang. Willow was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhmigod!\u201d shouted Bill and Tammy in unison.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBILL, WHERE IS SHE?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTAMMY, WHERE IS SHE?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill dashed for the gemstone laying on the floor. Snatching it up with his wide-cut hands, he made a wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI WISH I KNEW WHERE WILLOW WAS!\u201d he yelled, throttling the gemstone as if it were an uncooperative murder suspect in an interrogation room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, the green-gold glare of the Ahn'Ger Stone was not all consuming, neither blinding nor dazzling Bill with its magical effigy, simply obeying his direct and uncomplicated demand. A beam of green shine launched itself directly into the teenager\u2019s brain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy and Gloria watched in awe as Bill absorbed the answer to his question, his somewhat flushed face returning to its normal hue at first, and then all of a sudden heading in the opposite direction, turning white as a ghost. Tammy then watched curiously as her best friend turned husband turned boyfriend begin to quiver with fright, droplets of sweat erupting from his forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBill, where <i>is</i> she?\u201d demanded the petite blonde. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe's here\u201d Bill said fearfully, gulping strongly. \u201cWillow's the house. The stone transformed Willow into the house.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? What do you mean she turned into the house?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe stone\u201d he said, lifting it up to show Tammy. \u201cIt can talk. It\u2019s sentient, and it told me that when Willow wished that she was home, it took her wish literally. The house we're all standing in is alive. Willow is literally the house. She\u2019s no longer a person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</b> yelled Tammy. \u201cThis isn\u2019t some sick joke, is it? Where\u2019s my baby?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re standing on her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy opened her mouth as if to say something like <i>\u201cThat can\u2019t be!\u201d</i>, but then shut it when she saw the grave look etched on her beloved\u2019s face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook honey, I can\u2019t believe it either, but I swear that I\u2019m telling the truth. The good news is, I think she can still communicate with us, if we try hard enough. Willow, can you hear me?!\u201d yelled Bill to seemingly nobody in particular. \u201cSugarplum, don\u2019t be scared! It\u2019s your dad!\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief moment of doubt, Tammy joined Bill\u2019s one man chorus and shouted as loudly as her 5\u20190 body could muster, giving in to the madness of the situation. She gently hugged the walls with her hands as if to console her child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWillow! Mommy\u2019s here! Please let us know you\u2019re OK!\u201d she pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about two minutes of the young couple\u2019s fruitless search for their vanished daughter, a sound of cackling could be heard, causing Bill and Tammy to whip around like cats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you fucking serious?\u201d Gloria asked incredulously, struggling to hold back her overflowing stream of mean-spirited laughter. \u201cYou two mental patients really believe that Willow's the house?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u201d said Bill sharply, turning around to face Gloria. Tammy\u2019s pleasant looking face began to boil over with rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis house, right here? The one we\u2019re all standing in, it\u2019s alive? Like, <i>alive</i> alive?\u201d Gloria asked aggressively like some investigative journalist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, <i>alive</i> alive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is she even breathing without lungs?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if Willow even needs to breath right now. This thing is magic, it\u2019s definitely doesn\u2019t obey any natural laws\u201d answered Bill, looking down slightly disturbed by the emerald he held tightly in his grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh great, magic. The answer to everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are <i>you</i> being skeptical of all people?!\u201d admonished Tammy. \u201cYou were just with us in the future ten minutes ago!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s called critical thinking, duh!\u201d replied Gloria. \u201cTraveling through time and transforming into inanimate objects are like two <i>completely</i> different categories. Just because you\u2019re head over heels with Bill doesn\u2019t mean that I have to be too, Tom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Tammy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever, shorty\u201d Gloria answered dismissively, turning back to Bill. \u201cSo can Willow like, see? You know, without eyes? Ohmigod, please don\u2019t tell me the house has a pair of eyes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, I don\u2019t know. The gemstone didn\u2019t tell me that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what <i>did</i> it tell you? I want specifics!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill made a frustrated noise that sounded like a kazoo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe geeky side of him was thinking back to the old Mystery Science Theater 3000 theme song: \u201cIf you're wondering how he eats and breaths, and other science facts, then repeat to yourself 'It\u2019s just a show, I should really just relax!'\u201d. He wanted to repeat it to Gloria, but he knew that she wouldn\u2019t get it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt...it told me that that Willow was really upset about us not telling her about the gemstone. She, um, she felt a little bit betrayed.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the corner of his eye, Bill saw Tammy\u2019s look of hurt. He knew how much being a good mother meant to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god! Your daughter decided to yeet herself out of this decade rather than hang around with the likes of you two, and now she\u2019s turned into brick and mortar! You guys are the worst parents ever.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria covered her mouth, having failed to hold back her fit of giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAll of this is your fault!\u201d growled Bill. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t shown up here uninvited and made that stupid wish of yours, we wouldn\u2019t even have a daughter to be worried about, and now you have you have the gall the laugh at us? I always knew that you were a bitch, but...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBitch?! Fuck you, nerd. Nobody gets to use the b-word on me, and especially not you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGLORIA, THIS ISN'T THE TIME!\u201d shrieked Tammy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up, Tom, nobody asked you anything! God, you're so self centered. Hey, maybe you really are better suited to be a chick, because you sure do whine as much as one! And Bill, you should be grateful that I gave you a girlfriend. It\u2019s not like you were ever going to find one yourself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSHUT UP!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnless you count Big Jon or Rob, both of whom I\u2019m sure would love to buttfuck you like you\u2019re the new guy in prison. I mean, they have to be gay to be so obsessed with tormenting you all the livelong day, right? But then again, that would make you their girlfriend since you\u2019d be the bitch in that situation. The point is, you\u2019re a loser, Bill, and you would have never found someone to even have a daughter with in the first place if it weren\u2019t for me. Be grateful is all I\u2019m saying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSHUT. UP.\u201d demanded Bill through gritted teeth. The gemstone in his hands flared to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You two should be hoisting me on your shoulders!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGET OUT!\u201d screamed Bill as loudly as he had ever screamed before. In the back of his mind, he was so glad that his parents weren\u2019t home to hear all of this fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria paused at the furious couple, in genuine shock at how angry they were with her, unused to anyone challenging her authority. A moment of tense silence went by as she thought about what to say next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook Bill, I\u2019m sorry, OK? It\u2019s been a hell of a morning, and when I get stressed out, I tend to have a serpent\u2019s tongue. Just ask Tom. I was only screwing with you guys when I was laughing about Willow turning into a house. I..I guess I wasn\u2019t 100% sure if you were serious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hardy expression of Bill\u2019s face softened just a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI <i>am</i> serious. As serious as you can get. But to be fair to you as much as I hate doing that, I know how crazy this all sounds. If you really are sorry, I guess can meet you halfway. As you can see, tensions are really high between Tammy and I right now, so you just get out of here, I\u2019ll be willing to let bygones be bygones.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a deal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Now if you\u2019d be kind enough to not step too hard on the staircase when you\u2019d leave, I\u2019d really appreciate it. Because I think that\u2019s Willow\u2019s spine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria gave a polite laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re so funny, I wasn\u2019t expecting that! You know Bill, I wasn\u2019t lying earlier when I said that I liked you. You\u2019re a sweet guy, and Tom...Tammy is lucky to have you\u201d Gloria said, rolling her eyes a little at Tom\u2019s magical sex change. \u201cFriends?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill\u2019s eye trailed down towards Tammy, as if to ask her if this was a trick or not. The petite girl\u2019s expression had remained hateful and intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp us find Willow, and I\u2019ll <i>think</i> about forgiving you\u201d Tammy replied icily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, babe, I think Gloria just wants to go to school. Let\u2019s let her mosey on out of here, so we can\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! You said it yourself, Bill. Gloria started this, so she can finish it. If she\u2019s really sorry, she can start by making up for the lifetime of bullshit she\u2019s put us through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d said Gloria, rising to her full height, crossing her arms under her breasts. She noticed for the first time how much she now towered over her former boyfriend. For what it was worth, Tammy didn\u2019t flinch at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI won\u2019t even get in to all of the awful things you\u2019ve done to me over the years, or to how many other poor souls that ever had the misfortune of meeting you. Let\u2019s just focus on this morning, mmmkay? First you show up at Bill\u2019s house uninvited when you knew that he\u2019d be alone so it\u2019d easier to rope him into one of your little schemes. Then the moment I show up to escort him to school so he doesn\u2019t get harassed by Big Jon, you start a pointless argument with the both of us because you\u2019re not being paid attention to. <i>Then</i>, you childishly steal what rightfully belonged to him, and made some thoughtless wish with it, which is what led to all of this happening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m saying that a leopard can\u2019t change its spots, and a true bitch like you can\u2019t help but show her bitchy true colors. I\u2019ve been down this road before, Bill, don\u2019t <i>ever</i> believe a word that this snake in the grass says. She\u2019s not sorry about anything. And for the record, Gloria, I am never going back with you. Fuck you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what? Fuck you both, and fuck future girl!\u201d whined Gloria as she began stamping hard on the floor of the Strasserman guest bedroom like a child, her face turning rabid. \u201cCan Willow feel me pounding on the fucking floor, Tom?! Huh? Huh?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>OWW!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, the Strasserman home began to very visibly sway side to side, knocking the three teens to the floor. Gloria made an \u201coof\u201d sound as she fell onto her butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Downstairs, Bill heard his mother\u2019s china falling out of the cabinets and something that he was pretty sure was the expensive 4k television collapse upon the living room floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit\u201d he whispered as he wiped some sweat from his brow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gazed down at Tammy, who he smiled at for finally standing up to her ex. Tammy smiled back. They held hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhmigod, are we having an earthquake?!\u201d shouted Gloria as the house continued to tremble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you you listen to a word I said, you bimbo?!\u201d yelled Bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I said no b-words!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, I\u2019ll call you a retard! Or a fucking idiot! You\u2019d have to be deaf to not hear what I said! Our daughter has turned into the house, and you just made her very mad!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>MOM? DAD?</b></i> boomed a disembodied voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney?!\u201d exclaimed Bill and Tammy in unison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Holy shit, he was telling the truth</i> whispered Gloria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>MOM AND DAD, PLEASE STOP YELLING AT MS. GLORIA! I DON\u2019T KNOW WHY SHE\u2019S ACTING THIS WAY, BUT SHE\u2019S A GREAT PERSON! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...OR AT LEAST SHE BECOMES GREAT WHEN SHE\u2019S OLDER! SHE\u2019S MY FRIEND AND I WON\u2019T STAND EITHER OF YOU BEING SO MEAN TO HER! SO KNOCK IT OFF!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust to prove that she meant business, the Strasserman home began swaying side to side again, forcing the teenage trio inside to remain planted to the floor. Down the street, a rather perceptive dog starting barking loudly at what it perceived as an unnatural occurrence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK!\u201d Bill yelled in a firm but clear voice, as if he were a hostage negotiator. \u201cWe got it! We promise not to yell at Gloria anymore! But Willow, please, we need to know what you\u2019re going through right now! I asked the magic emerald what happened to you, and it told me that it transmuted you into the house! Is that true?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>YES! I\u2019M REALLY SCARED, DAD! I...I CAN\u2019T EVEN DESCRIBE WHAT I AM ANYMORE OR WHERE I AM! THIS IS FREAKIER THAN WHEN I DID ACID IN COLLEGE!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did what?!\u201d squealed Tammy angrily. \u201cYoung lady, I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill shushed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you see us right now?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>NO, I CAN\u2019T SEE ANYTHING! I CAN\u2019T SEE, SMELL, HEAR, TASTE, OR TOUCH.

Gloria's wish worked! Well, sure, it wasn't 100% effective since Tom was still a girl and Willow was still around, but hey, close enough right?. They can figure the hard stuff later. Tammy was secretly the most excited out of all of them, as she was now free of the horrible burden of being Tom, and she wanted to see what her life held in front of her now that she had a fresh start. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Willow\u201d asked Bill turning to the fourth person in the room, trying to break the ice. He hesitated, not knowing what to say to his future daughter. He didn't know how accepting she would be at such a bizarre situation. Was she in shock? It was hard to say. Bill was afraid that she wouldn't take it well, so he decided not to push the question directly. \u201cAre you OK, sweetie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow gave Bill a funny look, furrowing her eyebrows like he had just farted in her direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I'm fine, little bro! I just asked you if you wanted a ride to school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe color in Bill's skin suddenly evaporated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-sure.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell alright then! I'll drop you all off on the way. Come on, guys!\u201d said Willow. She was practically skipping out of the room, seemingly expecting the trio of friends to follow her lead. Slowly, they all started walking. Gloria, Tammy, and Bill started whispering to each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's going on here?\u201d asked Gloria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bill passed by a framed photo of the Strasserman family that was affixed onto the wall next to the stairwell, something odd caught his eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on a minute\u201d he said, walking past Tammy and Gloria. He walked back upstairs two stairs at a time and looked  back at the photo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit. Guys! Come here, quick!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d whined Gloria, still holding to the stone as she turned around and ascended the staircase. Tammy did the same. She was mostly quiet, but wasn't liking where this was going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Tammy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook\u201d pointed Bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family photo showed Bill, Willow, and two adults who looked almost like his parents. Almost, but not quite. The differences were subtle, but just detectable enough to unsettle Bill into realizing that something was off. The uncanny valley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god\u201d said Tammy, immediately understanding Bill's meaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? What's wrong?\u201d asked Gloria.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cBill! Gloria! Tammy! You coming?\u201d Willow's voice called out from the front door. Bill ignored his future daughter-turned older sister's voice as he attempted to console Gloria, but the longer he stood staring at the picture of his changed family, the angrier he became. He was just about to explode when he felt two soft hands on his shoulder and arm. Bill's head snapped to the left and the anger he felt faded away as he saw Tammy's concerned face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...We can figure it out at school, okay?\" Tammy's voice was soft and calm as she stroked Bill's broad shoulders and gave his arm a supportive squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill felt the anger fading away as the touch of his best friend-turned wife-turned...something brought back Bill's level-headedness. They did have all day to figure out how to control the gemstone and get everything back to normal. Right now they just needed to get to school before anything else happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Yeah, we can.\" Bill said with a nod, and the three teenagers soon piled into Willow's economy car and were off to school. As Bill stared out the passenger side window, listening to Willow talk to the girls in the backseat about...something pointless, he considered it at least something of a small miracle that reality had ended up this way. Two blocks later, a small thunderstorm had interrupted the pleasant morning weather, heavy raindrops pouring down on anyone caught on the street, including Jon Ingerman and Rob Bolstrum. The bullies of the high school, both with a grudge against BIll that apparently persisted in this new reality, the two ogre-like teens had clearly been waiting for Bill on his usual path to school before being dislodged by the surprise rain. Despite the similar downpour of thoughts running through his mind at the moment, Bill couldn't help but grin at the sight of the two bullies getting soaked as they dashed for cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Bill blinked as Willow pulled to a stop at the intersection. Instead of the two bullies there was now just Big Jon and a...girl? The two of them were hunkered under the short awning of an apartment building, BIg Jon's  letterman jacket covered arms craned almost protectively over a red haired girl dressed to the nines in full punk clothing, leather jacket, bare mid-riff, torn apart jeans and boots, a cigarette clinging to life in her fingers. She looked almost like a...female version of Rob? What was going on? The two shared a quick kiss as Bill blinked in confusion and worry before Willow's car accelerated forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the backseat, Tammy was going through a similar cascade of thoughts and emotions. She loved this body, she felt happy, happier than she could ever remember being as Tom. But that happiness was tempered by worry over the stone, which was still in Gloria's possession, worry that Bill, her darling Bill, didn't want her to remain Tammy, and remorse over the fact that Willow, her baby, was no longer her baby. At this point there was very little Tom left within Tammy's mind. She could still remember being him, but she also remembered two entire lifetimes of being Tammy. The greater sum of memories being her older self; a wife and mother and an entire life lived, while now she also had full memories of this life. Of being Tammy the teenager, being Bill's best friend and sharing a deep, almost soul-mate like bond with despite the two of them never acting on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of these realities were preferable to what Tammy had been and if nothing else, she had to figure out a way to get the stone so she could make everyone forget she was ever Tom. She could live with this reality, but no matter what, she had to erase Tom Ackerton from whatever level of existence he still remained on. No matter what. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd for Gloria, well, Gloria was the target of a intensive, gossipy interrogation by Willow, whom she was still incredibly weirded out by. From the few minutes of small talk that kept her thoughts from drifting towards more paranormal matters. Apparently Willow looked up to Gloria's mother, which gave the younger Vanapolous chills. Willow was still persuing an artistic career in this reality and Ariadne, Gloria's mother, had apparently been something of an short-lived splash in the art world before motherhood had sent her down another path. Willow was a big fan of Ariadne's art and was clearly smoozing for a meet and greet, while Gloria had no real idea what the newly created woman was talking about. To her knowledge, her mother had never shown any inclination towards creativity, instead just that constant sneer of cold command and logic, the need for more power and control. But as strange as it might have been, it could have also possibly been true; Gloria knew very little about her mother's past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd during the final silence as the high school loomed in the distance, Willow decided to drop a bombshell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Gloria, are you still seeing Matt Harris?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria blinked in confusion, \"Matt Harris?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, pride of the school, captain of like all the ball teams? Oh no, are you two fighting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh....\" Gloria's thought process scattered into static as it struggled to process the information. The only Matt Harris that she knew had been that loser Sophmore, a greasy little pervert with anger issues that she would occasionally pick on, whenever she hadn't been blasting Tom or some poor girl that earned her wrath. And he definitely wasn't captain of any of the ball teams! She'd NEVER date such a little turd! Out of instinct she cast a sidelong look at Tom...But only saw Tammy, who was staring at her blankly, seemingly unconcerned about Gloria's dating life. Any mention of 'another man' in Tom's presence had been enough to drive him into a rage but this...girl that she had turned him into appeared to give zero fucks. And she looked so comfortable in her geeky, slightly chubby but still cute form. Like she'd always been that way. Was Tom in there at all? Gloria could feel the edges of the gemstone cutting into her palm as real fear set in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't sure if she had loved Tom, but something about how naturally at ease that Tammy looked made part of her heart break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gloria?\" Willow asked from the driver seat, but her timing was poor. They had just pulled into the drop-off lane of the high school, and the three teens were quick to leap out and race through the rain to the school doors. Willow just stared at her younger brother and shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, what is up with them today?\" She said to herself as she slowly accelerated away from the high school and off towards the local community college.</span></div></div>",

But even as he told Gloria that the changes were not her fault, he could feel something hot and primal forming in his gut as he stared at the picture of his changed family. It was true the differences were subtle but there was no mistaking that Bill's mom and dad were different people. His 'dad' with different colored hair, glasses, eyes the wrong color. His 'mom' who was taller than she should have been, heavier, a more modern sense of fashion, higher cheekbones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was Kimberley's absence. Bill wandered down the hallway, his eyes roaming across the various pictures that were hanging there showing various scenes of his new parents, of Willow, of himself, of strangers that were now his grandparents. But not a single picture of Kimberly. Bill raced to the door that had led to Kimberley's bedroom, tossing it open to reveal the room of a young adult woman, tidy, modern, not at all like the almost unbearably girly room that had belonged to Kimberley. His little sister had been wiped from existence entirely. He felt numb as he stood in the doorway, staring at what was clearly Willow's room, not hearing Tammy and Gloria approaching from behind or the repeated calls from his new older sister. There was just the sound of his heart pounding in his ears until Gloria's voice sliced through the shock like a piece of glass on a chalkboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is all your fault, Tom! If you had just apologized for being an ass like you were supposed to then none of this would have happened!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fury that had been building in his stomach surged upwards, and Bill roared in anger, spinning around on his heel as his face contorted with rage. Gloria screamed as Tammy jumped backwards, her eyes wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THIS. IS. ALL. YOUR. FAULT. YOU. STUPID. BITCH!\" Bill roared into Gloria's face as he loomed over her. The formerly dominant girl seemed to shrink as she stumbled backwards into the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, this, this is Tom's fau-AAHHH!\" She attempted to say but was silenced once more as Bill's hand lashed out and backhanded Gloria across her pretty face. The teenage diva screamed in pain and brought both of her hands up to protect her face from any other blows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in her pained fear, Gloria opened her hands and the gemstone that had caused everything to go wrong in the span of just a few short minutes went flying through the air, clacking against the hallway windows and tumbling to the hard wooden floor. And Bill, in his rage, shoved Gloria up against the wall once more as his eyes locked on the stone, pushing his best friend's ex against the wall as he raced towards it, picking in up in one aggressive swipe. Green-gold light immediately began shining through the cracks in Bill's fingers as he spun around and shook his now enclosed, glowing fist at the two girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish...\" </span></div></div>",

He on the verge of sobbing, lost and unable to think straight due to a toxic combination of ire, anxiety, and grief over the perceived loss of his family. If he could see himself, he would be aghast at the mess he now was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo add to this maelstrom, twinges of guilt already began to manifest. Bill was normally not a violent person, and despite feeling that she deserved it, he saw the look of fear in Gloria's eyes as he loomed over her.  He was about to apologize to Gloria for hitting her before he noticed that it wasn't exactly his beet red face she was staring at with rapt concern. Instead, she was staring at his glowing fist.  His eyes trailed downward...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill opened his palm, revealing the damaged Ahn'Ger Stone and the effect that it was generating. Despite the crack running through it, the stone was currently shining brighter than it had the first two times it had been used. To Bill, it was as if he was holding a miniature star in the palm of his hand. He stared at the stone in genuine awe, astonished at its power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seemed to be slowing down to the teenage boy, as if every second were an hour and every minute a day, but despite this feeling, or perhaps because of it, the magic of the stone struck again. He watched as time and space warped around him like he was on the world's worst acid trip. The domicile that Bill, Tammy, and Gloria were standing in began to melt into a riot of colors and configurations. Before reality  finally reset itself once more, the last thing that Bill heard was his name being called out by Tammy's haunted voice. She feared losing him, and Bill feared losing her, but the latter could not dwell on lost on.  Bill instead wondered what insane life he was heading to next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBill! Bill!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ringing of Bill's name suddenly caught his attention. He looked around, and found himself back in his bedroom. After breathing a deep sigh of relief, now somewhat used to the nature of shifting locations, the teenage boy quickly inspected for anything that was out of place, and by anything, Bill meant anything. To his relief, Bill found that nothing in his room seemed to be altered or bizarrely out of place. His baseball cards, his comics and video games were still all organized to his specification, and the clothing in his dresser were still all the same. His telescope was still present. Even the white walls were the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly looked down at himself. He was still dressed in the same clothing and shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe patted himself down. Nope, no tail. No forked tongue. No breasts or any signs that his body had been altered in any way. Not even the color of his shirt was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoohoo, I'm normal!\u201d he muttered to himself in an attempt to keep his sanity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost importantly, the Ahn'Ger Stone remained in his hand, back to its dormant state, though unfortunately still damaged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBill! Champ, we need you! Please come downstairs!\u201d shouted the same voice again. Bill didn't recognize it, which deflated his already shaky confidence that reality had indeed returned to normal in its entirety. Cautiously, Bill didn't answer back, not knowing who this person was. Slowly, he walked out into the hallway, back to the family photo that had set him off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe location of the family photo wasn't there. Not even the one with his fake parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued to take stock of the house. Other than the missing portrait, everything else looked normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnxiety concerning his family's whereabouts began to resurface in Bill's mind once more. He was about to inspect Kimberly's room to see if it had returned to its relentless assault of pink, but he was interrupted in this pursuit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBill! What are you staring at? C'mon honey, or we'll be late!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teenager was shaken out of his state by yet another voice at the bottom of the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC'mon, pumpkin. We're all packed and ready to go! We're just waiting for you, and we can't leave until our darling Bill is ready. .\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his head and discovered perhaps the last person that he had expected to see again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Tammy! Not the Tammy he just left...it was the grown up Tammy. The middle aged one that he's married to in 2058! She was dressed casually in  cut off jean shorts and a white top, a pair of dark sunglasses tucked into her collar. If Bill could guess, she looked like she was ready to go on vacation or a trip to the beach. But it was still April...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking down the stairs in a daze, he approached the older blonde woman once known as Tom Ackerton with confused emotion and disappointment that nope, things were not entirely back to normal after all. Once he reached the last step, Tammy immediately rubbed Bill's hair, though the gesture felt more playful than romantic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod, I'm going to miss you when you leave for college\u201d she said, hugging him with a tight, affectionate squeeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTammy?\u201d he asked with confusion as she held him tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGetting too old to call me Mom?\u201d as she let him go to look deeply into his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom?\u201d asked Bill in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bill looked into the eyes of his best friend slash future wife slash girlfriend, he definitely noticed that hopelessly devoted look was gone. Instead, it was replaced by something else. Still affectionate, still loving, but different. He wanted to say that it was the look his real mom gave him, but he didn't want to go down that road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTammy!? Where is that kid? I'm not waiting another second!\u201d once again shouted the mysterious voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dark haired man entered the foyer, dressed in a black t-shirt and tan pants. He looked rather handsome, reminding Bill a bit of John Stamos, but the teenager had never seen this man before in his life. The man began to speak with an annoyed countenance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBill, what are you doing? You want to go on vacation or do you want to spend all summer stuck in your room?\u201d he asked with an exasperated tone to the teenager who was slowly realizing what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold your horses, Gene, for Pete's Sake!\u201d said Tammy with a hint of annoyance before grabbing her son's hand. The man exited through the front door dramatically before Bill looked into Tammy's face again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC'mon Bill, summer awaits!\u201d smiled Tammy,  pulling him forward towards the front door as they followed the man named Gene. They piled onto the front porch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tammy locked the front door, Bill saw the family station wagon packed with luggage, and a couple of of passengers waiting in the back. The weather was stiflingly hot, the front lawn was vibrantly green, as were the row of trees lining the opposite street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Bill followed the smiling woman down the front porch.  As she locked it, Bill checked his watch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJuly 25th, 2018. 8:45 A.M.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had just jumped forward three months in time. Tammy was apparently his mother now, and a complete stranger was his father...unless...no. No! That black haired man couldn't possibly be Gloria, could it? It was the only semi-reasonable answer the teenager could grab onto. The stone clearly wasn't afraid to alter people's gender. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, he entered the backseat, still holding tightly onto the broken artifact that he thrust his life in three bizarre new directions over the course of one morning. He turned to look at his fellow passengers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: It was Kimberly and Willow! The Ahn'Ger Stone brought back his little sister into the mix without sacrificing his former daughter Willow, still his older sister. However, both siblings look subtly yet noticeably different due to different parentage, confirming Bill's suspicions that Gloria is his new father. When Bill sees his own altered appearance in the window reflection, he makes another angry wish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: It was his real parents! Well...his real parents as they were as teenagers, anyway. With his older sister  Willow off on her own summer sojourn with her college friends, Bill's new parents asked if he wanted his two best friends Greg Strasserman and Martha Hanson to tag along with him on a Vanapoulos family vacation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

They piled onto the front porch. As he felt this version of Tammy's soft but firm grip, Bill still couldn't believe it, the Stone had, for some reason, twisted his entire wish and had transformed his Tammy into his new mother! And if his quickly forming hunch was correct, that meant that Gene had to be Gloria and was now his father!.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wall of oppressive summer heat hit him like a ton of bricks and immediately a thin layer of sweat began forming on his brow. Summers in the American Midwest were always hot, but it seemed especially so in the weird time jump that had occurred with the wish. Not to mention the oppressive brightness of the morning sun as it lit the world beyond the protective covering of the porch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christ, we should have gotten going earlier like I wanted. Its gonna be some hard driving with the sun in my eyes all day\" Gene said, and Bill saw the dark haired man that was apparently now his father cast an annoyed look at both him and Tammy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gene, I was not going to make everyone get up at the crack of dawn just because you do. We're on vacation! We can afford to relax a little!\" Tammy's voice had an edge to it as she rolled her eyes at her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's about the only thing we'll be able to afford after this. Taking a big vacation when we've got a kid in college and another one a month away? Bleeding me dry over here, honey\" Gene pulled one of his pants pockets inside out in dramatic fashion, to which Tammy just crossed her slightly flabby arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh just get in the car, Gene!\" The former man turned Bill's wife turned geeky teenage girlfriend turned Bill's mom said with a dismissive wave. Gene turned and took a few steps towards the small set of stairs leading down off the porch before he stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget to lock the door like you did last time!\" Gene warned, \"I swear if mom calls and says the door is hanging wide open again, we're coming straight home and never taking another vacation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I'm doing right. Now. Honey.\" Tammy hissed as she dug into her purse, pulling out a loaded key chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well good. I locked the other ones while we were waiting on Bill, so get it locked so we can get our asses in gear!\" Gene turned and stomped his way down the steps and across the small pathway that curved towards the rumbling station wagon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's new' Bill thought to himself, having been frozen in the awkwardly tense exchange between his best friend turned mom and his best friend's ex-turned dad. Before, in the old reality there was just the concrete path that led to the sidewalk, but in this new reality one of his new 'parents' must have decided that walking three feet across grass was unacceptable and had made a secondary path to the driveway. In the gap between the new path and the house there was now a small garden of roses and other flowers that, in the baking heat of summer, looked like they could use a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his gaze followed Gene to the car, Bill could see two other bodies in the back seat of the station wagon, though with the glare from the morning light he couldn't tell who they were, but he figured he'd find out soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I love that man, but sometimes I just want to strangle him!\" Tammy muttered to herself as she turned towards the front door, pulling out a particular key and sliding it into the two locks.  The short blonde dropped the keys back into her purse with a sigh and turned to face Bill, given him a strained smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that, sweetheart. You know how your dad gets when he's under pressure. C'mon, let's get this show on the road! Two weeks of fun in the sun!\" Bill's new mom chuckled at her own little rhyme as a more genuine smile grew on her face. as she hooked grabbed Bill's arm and practically dragged him to the station wagon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they approached the waiting automobile Bill shot a look at the luggage area, seeing a pile of suitcases, recognizing his but the rest were unknown to him, one of them a bright pink that sat on top of a dull, old looking Chicago Cubs themed suitcase that triggered something within Bill's memory, but he couldn't figure out what. But before he could ask a question, Tammy was opening the backseat passenger door for him and a wave of cool air washed over him. Reluctantly, he entered the backseat, still holding tightly onto the broken artifact that he thrust his life in three bizarre new directions over the course of one morning. He turned to look at his fellow passengers, and his heart suddenly jumped into his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, sitting practically on top of him, were the teenage versions of his original mom and dad! Martha was sitting in the middle, her brown hair in long and slightly curly as it was draped over her bare shoulders. Her face was youthful and full of life, and every bit as pretty as Bill remembered it being even without the 90s style make-up from old family pictures. Her lips were parted in a warm smile as they said something, but Bill couldn't tell what as the sound of his pulse thundered away in his ears. He found his eyes drifting downward in disbelief, following the straps of his former mother's tank top and bra down to two modest breasts, to the barely visible mid-rift and the cut-off jean shorts she was wearing, all the way down to the sandals that sat between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Bill's shocked gaze turned to the other occupant in the back seat, sitting on the other side of the car. It was his dad, Greg! It took Bill a few seconds to connect the dots on who the other young man had been, his father's signature 'Henry Cavill 'stache'' no longer resting proudly on his upper lip. Instead the younger version of his former dad was wearing a Chicago Cubs ball cap and clean shaven, an almost baby-faced look with eyes that clearly didn't need glasses. Yet. And even though he knew the old version of his dad wore the Cubs hat on vacation because of the bald spot, the tufts of hair in slight need of a rm stuck out from under the rim of the hat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mom-Tammy opened the passenger side door and slid into her seat, the world leap back to normal speed and the pounding in his ears fade away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bill, are you okay?\" His previous mother's youthful, melodious voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Oh, um, yeah. Yeah I'm good. Just, uh, still a little sleepy, that's all!\" Bill faked a yawn and did his best to push out a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He shouldn't be, he slept in the entire damn morning\" Gene said from the seat in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough, Gene. Now, we have the tickets? Everyone got everything they need?\" Tammy said, spinning in her seat after giving her husband a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tickets? Where are we going?\" Bill asked, suddenly confused. He could have sworn that they were going on a road-trip! He was suddenly amused by the fact that everything that had happened in the span of thirty minutes had drastically altered his life and the lives of those around him, this was the thing that caught him entirely off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you're totally out of it!\" Greg chuckled from the other side of the car, \"We're flying to California, remember? Otherwise I wouldn't be here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a good thing your parents paid for your part of the trip, because then you really wouldn't be here\" Gene muttered as he backed the car out onto the street a little too fast causing the tires to squeal. And then they were off, accelerating aggressively down the street as his new 'dad' clearly vented his frustration with the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thank you Mrs. and Mr. Vanapolous! We're super happy you're letting us come along! I've never been to California before, I can't wait to see the resort condo and swim in the ocean!\" Martha said, and it was clear to Bill that his old mom still possessed the ability to diffuse things with her words as the look of anger on Tammy's face faded and turned back to excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Martha, honey, you two kids are practically family to us, it's gonna be such a blast having you along!\" Tammy turned forward for a moment before popping back around, a cellphone held up in front of her face. \"Let's get you guys in a group picture!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill felt Martha lean into him, her breasts bobbing to the side just enough to brush against Bill's chest as the teenage version of his mother slid an arm across his shoulder. On the other side of Martha, Greg slid into the frame as she slid her other arm across his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you kids look so cute! Okay, on three I want you guys to say...um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bankruptcy?\" Gene muttered as he hunched over the steering wheel, but Tammy seemed to ignore him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, how about you guys say 'summer!', all right?\" Tammy raised her finger in preparation to take the photo, \"One...Two...Three!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SUMMER!\" Martha and Greg said in unison as a flash of white light momentarily blinded Bill as his new mom took the picture. With a squeal of delight, Tammy spun the phone around to show the three teens, and Bill finally got a look at himself. HE looked entirely different!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of his normal WASPy looks, now he looked very much like Gene, close cropped dark hair, large nose, almost naturally tanned skin. But his eyes were a dark, twinkling blue and he could pick out traces of what had once been Tammy's male features, when she had, once upon a time, been Tom Ackerton. Bill squeezed the gemstone in his hand, suddenly reminded of it's presence once more as the edges bit into his flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Holy shit. I look like a completely different person! I look like...like Gloria! I'm Bill Vanapolous!\" Bill's mind did a somersault and he felt a twinge of anger at the injustice. In his fist, the broken Stone let out a soft glow. Bill then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Bill learns more about this new world, the vacation and his relationship with his teenage parents as they drive to Chicago to catch their flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Bill blurts out an angry wish, forgetting about the damage to the Stone, which only makes his situation even stranger.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bill stared at himself on the screen of Tammy's phone, utterly shocked at his new face. He looked so different! Everyone looked different! This was insane! He subconsciously clenched the fist that held the Ahn'Ger Stone tighter as his 'mother' pulled the phone away and slid it back into her purse, trading it for a small paperback book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been wanting to catch up on my reading for a while!\" She said, seeing Bill staring at her from the corner of her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you don't plan on reading the whole time. If you wanted to read we could have saved on a condo\" Gene said with a derisive snort as he flicked on the radio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe if I finish I can...tell you all about it\" Tammy said, a playful tone in her voice that caused Gene's eyebrows to rise. With a soft chuckle, the former teenage girl flipped on the radio as he rest a hairy arm on the center console next to Tammy's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take me hooooome, Country rooooads\" Bob Denver's voice crooned from the station wagon's speakers, and Bill's mind clouded with sadness as he thought about how the morning had started. It was true what another song said, he didn't know what he had until it was gone, even if they (save for one annoying twelve year old) were all sitting nearby in the same vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the loaded station wagon rolled out of Shermer and onto the Interstate that led towards the city of Chicago, Bill silently fumed to himself as he sat in a car full of familiar strangers. He was supposed to know each of these individuals but to him, and because of the mysterious magical gemstone in his hand, they were now all twisted. Bad enough his best friend had become his wife and then his girlfriend, but at least those wishes had come with memories!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gene competently weaved through the morning traffic that would only get heavily, the classic folk song faded away as the chords of another one flared to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There must be some kind of way out of here said the soldier to the thief\" Jimi Hendrix's signature voice called out, and suddenly the aggressive music made Bill's thoughts turn away from sadness as anger at the situation he was once again stuck in filled his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now this is a great song!\" Bill's 'dad' said from the front seat, glancing back at Bill through the rear view mirror, \"Your mom and I used to listen to it all the time back in college\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did, dear. I was just along for the ride\" Tammy said as she turned her attention to her book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow his best friend turned wife turned girlfriend had become Bill's mother, his best friend's bitter ex had become his father, and the two teenagers that were making small talk and surfing their phones had been his original mother and father! And this time the gemstone hadn't provided any memories on top of the huge time shift, it had simply tossed him into this reality. And Bill himself didn't even look the same! He now looked more like his new 'dad', Gloria's strong genetics making him look like a stranger himself. Anger welled up within Bill's stomach and despite the bright morning sunlight streaming into the backseat of the car and the Stone being hidden within his fist, Bill could see a shimmer of the strange light that seemed to show that the magical artifact was ready to grant a wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I need to just change everything back to normal!' The Strasserman turned Vanapolous thought to himself, 'But what if it just makes it worse? No I...I need to figure it out first! Maybe then I can change everything back the right way!' Bill forced the anger in his stomach away, accepting, at least for the moment, that he was Bill Vanapolous, son of Gene and Tammy Vanapolous, and he watched as the other-worldly glow between his fingers faded away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Huh. So is it powered by anger? that...That actually makes a lot of sense' Bill pondered as he cautiously uncurled his fingers and exposed the now inert gemstone to the rest of the world. It glittered in the heavy morning sunlight and cast a green glow over his face as it reflected the light, and he saw Martha look over from her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow! That's really pretty Bill! Where did you get that?\" She gasped, putting her phone down and sliding over in the long back seat of the station wagon, scooting almost uncomfortably close as she leaned in to stare at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did he get what?\" Greg said as he too pulled his eyes away from his own phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bill's got some kind of really pretty gemstone!\" Martha said as she leaned closer onto Bill, her breasts pushing up against him as she leaned in even closer, \"Wow, look at the middle! Is that real gold?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gold? Bill, what the hell do you have?\" Gene's voice barked in front of him and Bill saw the dark, brooding eyes that once belonged to a teenage girl staring at him suspiciously. Even Tammy turned in her seat to look at her son. In just the brief moment he'd exposed the Ahn'Ger Stone to the world it had drawn unwanted attention!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing, mo-Martha! Just, uh, something I found in my desk last, uh, night! I thought I'd bring it along for good luck?\" Bill shoved the gemstone into his pocket as quick as he could, illiciting a disappointed sigh from Martha how pulled away from Bill and went back to her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's really pretty. It'd make a beautiful necklace! And don't call me Martha, you know I like to be called Rose\" The former mom said as she popped her earbuds in and pulled up a video on her phone. Bill looked over at Greg, who just stared back, his face a slight frown before his eyes darted towards Martha for a second before they too drifted back to the tiny screen in his hands. It almost looked as if his former father was...jealous?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Martha is a very pretty name\" Tammy said from the front seat as she turned back to her book, \"It's got such a classic feel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Mrs. Vanapolous, I just prefer Rose\" Martha, or rather, Rose said politely before she quickly fished a pair of earbuds out of her small purse and gave Bill a small smile before zoning off into the world of Youtube makeup blogs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'God this is so weird. I'll have to check it out the next time I'm alone' Bill thought as he placed his hand protectively over the lump the Ahn'Ger Stone had created in his pocket. He couldn't let anything happen to it, it was his one and only ticket back to normalcy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever it is, you better put it in your carry-on before we get on the plane, Bill. Last thing we need is you causing another delay and making us miss our flight\" Gene said as he zoomed the station wagon past a row of semi-trucks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they'll think you're some kind of gem thief\" Greg said snarkily, \"They'd have to do a cavity search\" The former father and former cheerleader shared a chuckle before Tammy shushed the both of them. The car lapsed into silence as they rolled along the interstate, and Bill simply listened to the old songs that played on a loop on the XM radio station his dad had stuck the radio on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took about an hour and a half to get to Chicago from Shermer, but it seemed to last forever to Bill. He kept his hand latched on the gemstone, and every now and then someone would make small talk. His new parents had eventually lapsed into talking about Gene's job, working under Jon Ingerman's father of all people, and the eventual tense silence that followed when Gene snapped at a otherwise innocent question from his wife. Eventually the silence was broken as the countryside gave way to concrete and pavement, the Chicago skyline rising above the suburbs of the outer Chicagoland metro area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're almost there!\" Tammy said happy, reaching back to pat Bill on the knee, \"You getting excited, honey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah. Yes. Yes I'm uh, pretty jazzed up!\" Was all Bill could think of to say, earning him a half-smile as his 'mother' simply turned back to the window. Rose and Greg had pulled their faces away from their phones as they looked out the windows of the station wagon, Rose, since she was in the middle seat, alternating by leaning over Bill and Greg to get a better view, pressing up against each. of them in an almost provocative fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Is...Is mom coming onto me?' Bill thought as the younger teenage version of his mother, who in her day had been quite a beauty and now was once more, pressed up against him as Gene dove in and out of the chaotic urban traffic as he made a mad dash for the airport exit ramp, made worse by the near constant toll booths that plagued the Chicagoland area due to the trainwreck the state's budget was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you you should have gotten over sooner!\" Tammy cried out as Gene pushed the station wagon through a gap in the traffic that was just wide enough, earning him several angry honks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JUST LET ME DRIVE, DAMNIT\" Gene roared as the exit to the airport loomed in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: The Vanapolous family and friends make it to the airport and their gate on time. While there, BIll is pulled aside by Tammy, who inadvertently fills him in on the purpose of the vacation in the hopes of improving Bill's mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: The Vanapolous family misses the exit and wind up in downtown Chicago on a long, time consuming detour! Gene grows ever angrier, eventually provoking Bill into making a wish that, as expected, goes horribly wrong.</span></div></div>",

The car behind them honked angrily in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind your own damn business, prick!\" Gene said, rolling down the window and sticking a hairy arm outwards, middle finger raised as he focused on the road once more. In the seat next to him, Tammy gave him 'the look' that usually meant he was in the doghouse as she stepped up to her son's defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gene if you can't control your temper then maybe you should just take a taxi home from the airport\" Tammy said with as much of a growl as she could manage, \"If you can't be civil then maybe you just shouldn't go\". The threat earned her a intense glare from her husband, which she met until he finally yielded, turning back to the road with a noise that landed somewhere between a groan and a swear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Gene mom'd into submission, Tammy turned in her seat to look back at Bill, who was pale as a ghost and staring at the four of them in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bill, sweetie, what are you talking about?\" Tammy said slowly, while Martha and Greg simply stared at their friend in shock and disbelief. From the driver's seat in front of him, Bill could see the dark, angry eyes of his 'father' staring at him from the rearview mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs four pairs of eyes settled on him, Bill clenched the still broken Ahn'Ger Stone tight and whispered \"I wish you all remembered who you really are!\u201d What are the effects of this new wish?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: The damaged Stone makes the wish go awry once more, as Gene and Tammy now remember being Martha and Greg...While Martha and Greg remember being Gloria and Tammy!

However, due to the Stone's damaged state, the memories are quickly shaken off and mostly forgotten save for a feeling of unease among the group.</span></div></div>",

He couldn't see anything, he couldn't speak, but Bill had the strange feeling that things were changing around him, and a peculiar sense of everything being..rewound?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then reality blasted back into shape around Bill as the blinding light turned out to simply be the morning sun rising over the trees. The birds were singing, the weather was pleasantly warm and the last few banks of fog hugged the ground as they were slowly evaporated by the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill jumped upwards in alarm, spinning around and finding himself back on his front porch. He checked his watch, his grandfather's present to him reading 7:32AM. The sounds of his mom, dad and to his relief, his little sister Kimberly coming from beyond the screen door that led into his house. And Willow was nowhere to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enormity of what just happened hit Bill like a sack of bricks, and he had to lean against the porch railing for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did...did I really just travel back in time?\" Bill asked himself quietly. And then he spotted it. The stone that had caused everything was sitting in the exact position it had been before Bill had picked it up in the former timeline. All the chaos it had caused in just a few short moments. It had only been in his life for twenty minutes and in that time it had changed himself, his best friend, his best friend's ex into middle-aged adults. It turned his best friend into his wife, it had created a entire new reality in which he was a father. And then once again changing everything to where he was born to different parents, his best friend was his girlfriend, and his daughter from the future was now his older sister. And now a grand reset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that caused by a tiny gemstone, smaller than the palm of his hand. Bill suddenly realized he was reaching for the stone once more and pulled his hand away.

An intense feeling of deja-vu hit BIll as he approached Tim, the other teen's face looking just as pale and exhausted as it had originally during the confrontation with Gloria. There were the bags under his eyes, the dark circles where the other boy had barely gotten any sleep, the same jeans Tom had worn yesterday, two lifetimes before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill quickly reached the far side of the pavement and elected to not show the gemstone to Tom, letting the artifact slid into his pocket. Everything went insane the last time because he had immediately flaunted the stone around and had allowed Gloria to get her scheming, vindictive hands on it within seconds.

After all, given what Tom had been going through, something even crazier might happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two friends exchanged a fistbump and made their way along the concrete, their footfalls and birdsong the only words between them for a few minutes before Bill finally broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom's already sluggish stride quickly slowed to a halt as Bill walked a few feet ahead before turning around, his face full of concern.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bill waited with annoyed impatience at Gloria's \u201cbig news\u201d. As if to spite him, the teenage girl hesitated just a little bit, drawing out her proclamation just for the drama. She took a deep breath, stared at Bill for a moment with an impartial look that, once she fully had his attention, suddenly transformed into a countenance of righteous outrage, her eyes bulging and furious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can't <i>believe</i> that you hit me you little shithead!\u201d yelled Gloria, immediately slapping Bill hard in the face. Bill reached up to defend himself, but Gloria got one more lick in before he could, both stinging and deeply reddening the right side of his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you like it, huh!?\u201d Gloria continued to rant. \u201cHow <i>dare</i> you!\u201d she screeched, tears of anger practically in her eyes. \u201cYou fucking pig! I should have you arrested for assault and battery! Or better yet, I should sic that idiot Big Jon on you! Everybody knows that he's just dying for the opportunity to kick the ever loving shit out of you. Which, to be perfectly honest, I'm not entirely against at this point. How long have you been dodging that ape, half the school year? Oh, but you can hit girls though, can't you? You fucking pussy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh officer, I had a magical stone that re-wrote reality and erased the family of my ex-boyfriend's best friend! And I turned my ex into a girl! And then his best friend hit me for being a total bitch!\" Bill spat back in a poor imitation of Gloria's voice, \"Yeah, good fucking luck convincing the cops of that, you fucking witch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill himself was so angry at this, at Gloria's narcissism, that he really wanted to just wish her into nonexistence with the stone, but he reminded himself not to get involved in the same trap that he had earlier. Seething and dodged another vicious slap, he just quietly marched away from Gloria, ignoring her taunts about his alleged micropenis and his faggotry, ignoring the rain storm that was rapidly hitting Shermer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU'LL FUCKING PAY, BILL!\" Gloria screamed at Bill's retreating back as she hurriedly pulled an umbrella from her stylish 'more a purse than a bookbag' backpack. As the nylon canopy unfurled, she glared down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'll get that magic rock again too!\" She hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the school day, Bill couldn't take his mind off of the magical events that had transpired this morning, In every class, he found himself patting down his pocket every thirty seconds just to make sure that the supernatural artifact was still there and hadn't been stolen by someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Math class, he sat across the room from Gloria, who was shooting daggers at him the entire time. It was clear to Bill now that the younger Vanapoulous wasn't the forgiving type, the type to let past digressions just be water under the bridge. No, quite the contrary. This girl held grudges. She was the very definition of the \u201cwoman scorned\u201d idiom, even though she had brought all of it on herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, in the paranoid part of Bill's mind, he just knew that she was going to try and do something to Bill to make his life more difficult for defying her. Throughout the day, his suspicions proved right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the following two classes, the teenage boy immediately noticed a subtle shift in the zeitgeist of the student body. While he was never Mr. Popularity, nobody aside from Big Jon and probably by extension Rob Bolstrum actually <i>hated</i> Bill. At best, they were indifferent to the geeky young man, tolerating him and allowing him to go about his business undisturbed. But now...now he was getting dirty looks from everyone. He said \u201cHi\u201d to various students as he passed by them in the hallway- Damien Franzese, Rachel Bennett, Jason Wong, Abby Flint, etc- all students whom he was casually acquainted with if not necessarily friends. Not a one would even look in his direction, and Abby, who normally could be counted on to at least make with the small talk and pleasantries, explicitly told him to fuck off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad Gloria and her crew of flunkies gotten to the entire school already? Was Bill's name mud now, just as Tom's had been thoroughly trashed? That appeared to be the case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust great\u201d sighed Bill as he stepped over Adam Ford's obvious attempt to trip him as he ascended the flight of stairs to the second floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the other fly in the ointment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn History class he sat next to Tom, who thanks to Bill's rage powered wish this morning had been restored to his handsome male self. Which meant that his perky Girl Friday Tammy was out, and isolated, sad Tom Ackerton was in. Bill tried to lighten the mood as he usually did with his best buddy, getting Tom's mind out of the doldrums with easy humor and camaraderie, not wanting to admit that he needed some companionship himself. To Bill's disappointment, today he found that it was an almost impossible task to cheer Tom up. Tom's brief time as his distaff counterpart had irrevocably changed something in his brain. After becoming Tammy Ackerton, after seeing an entire alternate reality where things were better and brighter than they were here, the basketball star had finally fallen off the edge. He was now a fundamentally different person than he had been yesterday. Aside from the change in gender orientation, Tom was now firmly in love with Bill. Not in love as a friend, but head over heels, mushy, sentimental love. Bill was his kindred spirit and soulmate, the Prince to her Snow White, or the Kristoff to her Anna. In Tom's mind, they were literally destined to be husband and wife. When he looked into Bill's eyes now, they were with soulful longing and a deep feeling of frustration that he couldn't act upon what he was feeling inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond, Tom was no longer willing to accept being ostracized or being slandered against by Gloria, or being physically intimidated by Big Jon's gang. Being stuck here at Shermer High was Hell, but prior to today, Tom thought that this life was all he had. Now? When a glorious future lay just over the horizon? No. Fucking. Way. Was. He. Dealing. With. This. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had made this all very clear to Bill, pleading with him to use the stone, just to make himself...herself whole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC'mon, hon-uh, dude. I'd do it for you\u201d he pleaded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill looked at Tom and sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe later on at home, dude. I've got too much on my plate right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw in Tom's lovelorn eyes that he gave the wrong answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTom, I <i>promise</i> we'll talk about this later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething you want to share with the class, Mr. Strasserman?\u201d asked Mr. Cassidy, noticing Bill's backtalk during his lecture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Sir\u201d stuttered Bill, straightening up and ignoring Tom until the bell rang, signaling that it was lunchtime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: During lunchtime, Gloria sets up a situation where one of her minions pickpockets the Ahn'Ger Stone from Bill while he's distracted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: A misunderstanding between Tom and Big Jon escalates into something very bad in the cafeteria, forcing Bill to quickly bring out the stone and make a hasty, ill thought out wish. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

And behind him was his usual entourage of bullies, including the sullen, red-headed giant Rob Bolstrum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY BILL!\u201d shouted Jon again from the sidewalk in his Incredible Hulk-like vocal range. \u201cARE YOU GONNA WAIT FOR YOUR BOYFRIEND TOM TO SHOW UP AND EAT LUNCH WITH YOU?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill stopped himself from telling Jon to shut up. Lobbing insults the brute was a waste of time. As Mark Twain said \u201cNever argue with a fool, onlookers may not be able to tell the difference\u201d. So he just stood there, momentarily forgetting about the omnipotent gemstone in his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWELL COME ON!\u201d shouted Jon. \u201cDO SOMETHING, STOOP WIMP! AFRAID OF LITTLE OLD ME?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill didn't want to admit that he was. Sometimes he wished that Jon knew what it was like to be scared of bullies. This was like a bad, school play version of Back To The Future, but Bill didn't have the effortless charm of Marty McFly, nor did he know how to skateboard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes went by with neither man moving, staring at each other like two outlaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamnit Tom, where are you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill figured that his buddy must have seen or heard Big Jon and ran in the other direction. Tom was athletic, but he was still no match for the local Frankenstein's monster. Especially not with Big Jon's lackeys there. Tom was heroic but Bill knew that Tom would put his own self-preservation ahead of some heroic sacrifice. Or rather, that\u2019s what Bill believed. In reality, thanks to his new feelings for Bill brought about by briefly being married to him, Tom would risk himself for Bill in a heartbeat. Unfortunately, unknown to Bill, Gloria was running interference by keeping Tom distracted while Big Jon did her dirty work. She wanted Big Jon to beat Bill up and take the gemstone he likely had in his pocket, but he wanted to make it look like Bill threw the first punch, to he decided to provoke him by lightly shoving him. This caused Bill to remember his brief scuffle with Gloria in his effort to get the gemstone from her and fix what it did to his life. Remembering everything the stone did, something inside Bill suddenly erupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWILL YOU FUCKING LEAVE ME ALONE ALREADY?!\u201d screamed Bill so loud that the entire school likely heard him. Including Tom, who immediately started rushing to the cafeteria, despite Gloria\u2019s protests. Just as Tom arrived at the entrance to the cafeteria, Bill spoke words that would change his life once again. \"I WISH-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: YOU KNEW WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE BULLIED!\u201d The stone changes reality so that Big Jon is the scrawny kid whose being bullied by Big Bill, essentially switching their roles in the school\u2019s hierarchy. Lucky for Bill, this undid everything Gloria had done to ruin his reputation, but made everyone afraid of him in the process. Bill, Tom, Gloria, and Big Jon all remember how reality was before the wish, and Jon is now terrified of Bill because of their swapped physiques, but is confused as to how this happened since the gemstone was still in Bill\u2019s pocket, so he doesn\u2019t know it caused this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: YOU WERE A NICE PERSON, JON! SOMEONE PEOPLE ACTUALLY CARED ABOUT!\" Bug Jon Ingerman becomes Joanna Ingerman, Bill Strasserman\u2019s beautiful, kind girlfriend. Bill is reluctantly enjoying having Joanna as his girlfriend, making Tom feel jealous and betrayed, and plots to get the stone from Bill to restore himself to being Tammy, Bill\u2019s wife, and mother of his child, Willow.</span></div></div>",

It was awful, and on top of feeling stressed and VERY anxious as the bell rang and he exited out into the hallways of Shermer High, the super highway of students where anything could happen, he couldn't help but slide a hand into his pocket and grab the Ahn'Ger Stone. It briefly flared as it fed off of Bill's anger at the situation; his anger at Gloria for being so vindictively petty, at Tom who continued to badger him about being Tammy once again, and about all the students that were currently trying to ruin his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to take solace in knowing that his family, his original family, had returned from whatever magical oblivion that they had been shunted off into, especially Kimberly, who had simply ceased to exist, but still the stress of the day was wearing on the teenager. But he couldn't give in. The Stone, whatever it was, was clearly malicious. Bill could easily become snared in another trapped scenario if he gave in to the impulse to simply wish his problems away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut knowing the option was there, well, Bill couldn't help but feel the temptation. But for now, so long as it was just this petty bullshit and nothing else, he was confidant that he could figure it out later at home and just wish everything away like he had before, but this time with no mistakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother snide comment here, another attempt at harassment there, Tom's incessant badgering about wanting to be his wife...But the thing that set it off was the unexpected run-in with Big Jon and his flunkies, cornering Bill and Tom near one of the high school's bathrooms. Bill had expected some kind of physical confrontation as the Bullies surrounded them and their blonde haired psychopathic leader stomped towards the two of them...But instead Big Jon had simply patted Bill on the head like some kind of dog and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About time someone put Titsapolous in her place. Always knew you had it in you, slugger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPraise. Praise from Big fucking Jon about hitting a woman. the few members of the student body who hadn't steered clear of the bully blockade began murmuring and nodded to themselves, pointing at Bill, whose blood began to boil furiously. If anyone had doubted whatever rumors Gloria and her G-Squad were spreading, approval from Big Jon would all but seal his fate as an abuser of women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll because Gloria got what was coming to her, all because Bill tried to save his family. He couldn't take it anymore. The Teenager gripped the Ahn'Ger Stone and glared at Big Jon, whose cruel smile turned to a frown. Bill felt a painful pinch as Big Jon's heavy hand on his shoulder began to squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Goddamn Gloria' Bill said as his hate for the dark haired queen of the school finally pushed him over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish...\" Bill hissed as the stress of his situation finally got the better of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: \"I wish that Gloria didn't exist!\" Targeting Gloria as the source of all his problems, Bill's wish erases Gloria from existence, but that doesn't seem to fix his problems. Now there's a new girl running the show and she seems far more dangerous than Gloria ever was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: \"I wish everyone would listen to me and not Gloria!\" With a flash of light, Bill suddenly finds himself getting praise and approval from everyone in Shermer High!

If you pissed off Rob or got in his way, you were dead meat. Pretty much the only people that were 'safe' from Rob's wrath were women and children. If you were a woman and you pissed him off, Rob would just verbally assault you, and if you were a kid, Rob would terrify the shit out of you. Which he did once, to a third grader. Even most of the teachers were terrified of Rob simply because he was a volcano of anger and outright meanness. And as they are wont to do, Rob had, over the years, established his own small army of enforcers; neanderthals like himself that preyed on the weak either through sheer physical force or intimidation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Jonathan Ingerman had transferred in and had quickly beaten the shit out of Rob in a epic confrontation. In the aftermath, Bolstrum had quickly found his powerbase eroded as his gang had quickly fallen in line behind \"Big Jon\". And for his own survival, Rob had bent the knee and become Ingerman's right hand man. And it had only made him angrier. Where there had once been a beast that could be reasoned with (or at least paid off), now there was an almost mindless force of nature. A violent storm that simply had to be weathered and survived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was part of the reason why Rob was currently storming onto Bill's property instead of playing it smart and waiting for Bill to leave and be out in the open, as Ingerman would have done. Rob simply did not care that he was trespassing. His pride was gone, all he seemed to have now was the need to hurt others regardless of the cost to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, that was the assumption that Bill, Tom and his other friends had made of Rob's new position in the bully pecking order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Bill, in the interest of self-preservation, quickly grabbed his backpack and scrambled back inside his house, slamming the door behind him as the heavy footfalls of Bolstrum's boots thundering onto the porch.. Surely Bolstrum wouldn't be stupid enough to follow him in, would he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY, SHITTERMAN YOU FUCKING COWARD GET OUT HERE!\" The bully roared, slamming the twin battering rams of his fists against the front door of Bill's house, the glass in the window clattering loudly as it threatened to shatter from the force of the impacts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill's hand slipped towards his pocket, where the stone waited...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bill watched from behind the decorative glass as Rob slammed his fists against it, the twin battering rams ending their assault on the front gate of the proverbial Castle Strasserman. Behind them Rob was hunched over, his green eyes glaring at the smaller teen as the bully was clearly struggling to prevent property damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a clattering of dishes and the sounds of his family calling out to him, but Bill only heard their voices and not what they had actually said, so focused was he on his own personal Balrog looming inches away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get. Out here. Right now!\" The muscled mountain hissed, and Bill swore he could see white froth forming at the corners of Rob's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the little voice in his mind telling him otherwise, Bill couldn't help but smirk and tap his side of the glass. \"Are we at the zoo? You look like a gorilla who got the last banana! Monkey so angry! You gonna throw your poop next? But sure, I'll come out there, after all you're just making it SO tempting, Rob!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill knew that antagonizing (scientifically inaccurate as it had been) the being that was a foot and a half taller, nearly three times as wide and at least four times as strong as him was the worst thing he could have possibly done but the petty side of him couldn't help it. Rob was a bully, and bullies deserved to be taken down a peg; it was just something that was ingrained within him from all his years watching media like Back To The Future or the numerous superhero films he'd seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH, YOU WANT TEMPTING? IF YOU DON'T COME OUT HERE IN THE NEXT FIVE SECONDS, I'M GONNA DO WHAT I WAS SENT HERE TO DO BY BIG JON.\" Rob roared again, his nostrils flaring outward like a bull as he gave the front door a heavy pound with a closed fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's that, paying me back the money he owes me for busting my car?\" Bill said, rolling his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO YOU PIMPLE POPPING CUNT, I'M GOING TO BURN YOUR FUCKING HOUSE DOWN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had caught Bill's attention and the hackles raised on the back of his neck, though he tried to play it cool as a hustle of footsteps came plodding towards him from the kitchen as the rest of his family approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you gonna bash some rocks together? 'Ook ook! Rob make fire!'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHITTERMAN, I GOT MY GAS CAN RIGHT HERE!\" Rob's bulk disappeared from the door for a brief moment as the giant rushed down the stairs and retrieved something square and red from the bushes in front of the porch, returning to crowd out the door's window pane as he shook the can dramatically, producing a wet sloshing sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh shit!' Bill thought, his eyes nearly popping out of his skull in surprise. He had known that he'd made a dangerous enemy with Rob, and even moreso Big Jon but this...This was on a whole new level of psychopathy for both of them. And given who Big Jon's dad was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill gulped at the thought. Ragnar Ingerman, Big Jon's father, practically owned Shermer. That was why Big Jon was able to get away with everything that he did at school save for when Bill had tricked him into a fight. If Big Jon was confident enough to order an arson attack on Bill's home then... The geeky teenager shot a hand down into his pocket, his fingers curling around the magical gemstone that had already drastically altered his morning. He felt the sides of the artifact dig into the sides of his palm as he tried to push through the fear and become angry again, as that seemed to be the only way to make it actually work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, now you fucking listen! Get out here and I'll-\" Rob began, but then his eyes flashed away from Bill, looking beyond the scared teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in god's name is happening out here!?\" Greg Strasserman said as he placed a hand on his son's shoulder. \"Is this that trailer trash punk you've been telling me about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill looked over his shoulder at his father's scowling, bearded face and shook his head, gulping heavily. The middle-aged man narrowed his eyes and gently moved Bill out of the way, taking his son's space in front of the door. Bill stumbled to the side, joining his mother who looked white as a sheet and the confused form or his little sister Kimberley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's that?\" She whispered to Bill, and Bill just stared at his smaller sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look, daddy's here to save you!\" Rob mocked as he backed away from the glass, \"Hey it's old man Shitterman! You raised a fucking faggot for a son! Probably says loads about you, Limpdick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now listen here you little shithead!\" Greg cursed and reach over to grab the baseball bat that was propped up next to the front door, his free hand reaching for the door knob. \"Now I'm gonna give you five seconds to get off my property or I'm going to call the cops!\" Greg said, his voice booming with the learned managerial authority he'd picked up from all his years of dealing with unruly employees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuckin' A,, bring it ON old man!\" Rob howled with manic glee as his eyes locked on the baseball bat. The gas can went flying down the steps behind him as Rob curled his hands into fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAD DON'T-\" Was all Bill had time to say as his father swung open the front door...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And immediately took a fist to the face as the giant, now unrestrained, wasted no time in getting the first blow. Greg grunted in pain and staggered backwards, his glasses flying off his face in a shower of blood as his nose crumpled from the impact. Stars filled his vision as he crashed into the staircase banister behind him and he limply, blindly swung the bat out in front of him as he struggled to recover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAD!\" Bill cried out as his mother and sister screamed in terror. Bill released his hold on the Stone and rushed forward towards Rob, adrenaline, fear, anger and the urge to protect his father overriding his urge of self-preservation. \"I'LL FUCKING KILL YOU ROB!\" Bill roared, leaping at the grinning monster that lurked in the doorway. But then the monster moved and Bill found himself flying backwards, crashing into his mother and sister and the three of them collapsing in a heap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the record, Billy-boy\" Rob growled ass he crossed the threshold into the house, green eyes glittering with sadistic glee, \"I only wanted to talk. But now you started something dear old dad is gonna have to fuckin' finish!\" '<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'GET. THE. FUCK. OUT. OF. HERE' Part of Rob's mind screamed, but a much louder part laughed back 'This is so fucking insane, this is awesome!' Rob thought to himself as his blood thundered in his veins. There was no getting out of jail for this but, not even Big Jon could prevent it...Though that had been the point anyway, so fuck it. Big Jon had sent Rob over to burn the Strasserman house down after the family had left for the day and get some measure of revenge on Bill but the larger plan, the one Rob had figured out, was to get Rob arrested. The one threat Big Jon had to his leadership over his private army of thugs permanently removed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Rob had wanted to do was just TALK to Bill, use the little faggot to help him plan a way to get back at Big Jon. But things had gone wrong and something had finally just snapped within Rob. He was tired of being shit on by rich assholes, he was tired of being ordered around. He was just...tired, and suddenly a large part of him just stopped giving a shit. He was going to end up in jail eventually, why not just get it over with?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get...Get out of my house!\" Greg yelled, and despite the painful stars still blinding his vision and the river of blood pouring from his shattered nose, the patriarch of the Strasserman family righted himself and staggered forward, the bat swinging out at the looming shadow...Which ducked under it with a cruel laugh that sounded more like the bark of a rabid dog. Then a hand grabbed his out-stretched arm in a vice-like grip, twisting it until the metal back tumbled out of Greg's hand and to the floor with a loud CLANG.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I always wanted to do this to MY old man the next time I saw him! But guess you'll have to do!\" Rob sneered with glee, pulling the much older man towards him and then painfully body-checked him, sending Greg Strasserman flying backwards into the stairs once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GREG!\" Bill mother screamed as she pulled herself out of the pile and rushed over, only to have Rob backhand her to the ground, her head colliding violently with a nearby end-table as she fell limply to the floor, her body still and motionless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOM!\" \"MOMMY!\" Bill and Kimberly screamed in unison, and Bill scrambled to his feet, pulling his little sister up and shoving her towards the backdoor that led out of the kitchen and into the backyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KIMMY RUN! GO TO TOM'S AND CALL THE POLICE!\" Bill said as he practically tossed the twelve year old out of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHO!?\" Kimberley screamed, but Bill was already headed back inside. The twelve year old looked at her brother's retreating form and, on the verge of tears, took off running for the only place she could think of: The Ackertons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill dashed out of the kitchen and back into the foyer to see Rob deliver a crushing kick to his father's chest that was followed immediately by a sick, wet crunch as something, or multiple somethings, broke from the impact. Rob bent down and picked up the gasping, groaning, bleeding form of Greg Strasserman and effortlessly threw him back towards the front door, reaching down to grab the baseball bat as he stomped along the trail of blood left by his victim, who was weakly crawling out the aperture while coughing up streamers of blood and bile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ROB STOP!\" Bill yelled as loud as he could, but the towering colossus ignored him as he closed the gap between himself and Greg,straddling the defeated man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't fuckin' care anymore\" Rob said with a grim finality as he raised the bat high over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill looked at the groaning, bloody mess that was his father, terrified, ashamed and angry about how easily his dad had been defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bat swung down like the Sword of Damocles itself, Bill pulled the Stone out of his pocket and screamed...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The artifact glimmered with it's strange viridian light as it channeled Bill's anger into itself, and right as the aluminum bat made contact with Greg Strasserman's skull, Bill blurted out the first thing he could think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish my dad was someone Rob wouldn't beat up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ahn'ger Stone pulsed, and the bloody reality in front of Bill was wiped away by a tidal wave of light. Bill clenched his eyes shut as the luminous changes passed over him, not knowing what would happen, but hoping that maybe, just maybe, it would turn his dad into an equal physical match for Rob. Or maybe transform Rob into someone or something that was incapable or harming his dad and thus eliminate the horrible reality he was exiting from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then as quickly as it appeared, the light receded from the world and Bill felt the cool April spring air on his skin. He snapped his eyes open, blinking away the terrible after-image of his dad's skull splitting open and was surprised, but not as much as one might have thought, to find himself back on the front porch of his house, right where EVERYTHING had started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did...Did it send me back in time again?\" Bill muttered to himself as he looked down at the Ahn'Ger Stone as the last of the magical light died out inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck are you talking about, nerd?\" Came a female voice that Bill didn't recognize. He snapped his head towards the voice and this time he WAS very surprised at what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, sitting in the swing on the other side of the porch from him, was a busty, dark haired woman that looked maybe a couple of years his senior. Her hair was cut short, barely reaching her neck and tipped in electric blue while one side of her head was almost shaved bald. Her brown eyes were glaring at him from under a heavy application of eye shadow and Bill counted at least six different piercings dotting her angular face. Her full, pouty lips were painted black to match her eye-shadow and a spiked collar hung around her slender neck. Her torso was dominated by her breasts, which were covered by a tank-top that was clearly a size (or two) too big and threatened to slip off her shoulders, and was cut away at the bottom, revealing a bare mid-rift that had yet another piercing glittering in the morning sun. A generous portion of side-cleavage hung out front the shoulder straps, and two slender arms crossed themselves over the woman's bountiful chest, revealing that her right arm was covered in an elaborate tattoo that ran from the shoulder to her wrist, from which dangled a small spiked bracelet. And in that hand, held between two long feminine fingers, was a lit cigarette, smoking trailing lazily from the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sense of fashion followed to her lower half. The woman was wearing a tired looking pair of jeans that had the knees ripped open, and while they didn't quite hug her legs Bill could see they went on for figurative miles, ending in a pair of small feet that were hidden in a pair of ratty looking black Converse sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hello? Earth to Bill?\" the woman said again, her voice dripping with annoyance and irritation as she took a drag from the cigarette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-who are...\" Bill began, but then a sharp pain entered his head as answers came to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Greg Strasserman no longer existed. Instead his uncle James had been born an only child, growing to adulthood alone and eventually meeting their mother, Martha, while in college. But instead of Bill having been born first, now he was the second child, while Grace Strasserman (the current incarnation of Greg) was Bill's older sister, the first born child of James and Martha Strasserman. She was only 21, and Bill was now sixteen, his parents wanting another child soon after Grace had come into the world. The two had grown up together, and while being typical siblings, Bill was definitely a momma's boy while Grace had definitely been a daddy's girl. And she was definitely pretty, but was far too much of a tomboy to ever truly embrace her feminine side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill's interests and hobbies were relatively unchanged save for that he was simply younger now, but Grace, Grace had taken an interest in many of the same things that Greg had been interested in as a child. Outside of having been a cheerleader (their mom's idea) Grace enjoyed being outdoors, action movies, bad comedies and cars. She loved to go horseback riding with her dad and sharing 'gearhead' time with him in the family garage, and the daddy-daughter combo had also started learning to play the guitar. And while Bill still found himself, due to his interests, still relegated to the lower rungs of Shermer High's social ladder, Grace had been contently upper-middle, a nice circle of friends and an even wider one that just knew her as a good person that always tried to be nice when possible. She was intelligent and had wanted to go into banking (like Greg had done) and had been looking at universities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that Grace had disappeared when James had suffered a fatal car wreck a year and a half ago. Grace had been devastated, retreating into herself, barely speaking, eating, or leaving her room. Her grades suffered and her potential college prospects dried up as she simply stopped caring. And her relationship with her suffering mother had turned angry and toxic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for her other interests, Grace had simply stopped caring about them as well save for still learning the guitar. She'd taken up smoking, and more than once Bill found himself being woken up or being kept awake by the loud thumping punk-rock music that seemed to constantly emanate from Grace's room. She'd barely managed to graduate and her old friends had quickly left her for their own college adventures, leaving her to, in Grace's own words, 'to suffer in this piece of shit town'. Soon after she'd taken to sneaking out, and before long had found a new group of 'friends', or rather, the group of girls and boys that were associated with the Shermer Fields trailer park, aka Skid Row. Ones that, once she turned 21, abused her age to hook them alcohol and sneaking into bars and parties. They'd also apparently convinced her to fill her face with piercings, and that getting an elaborate sleeve tattoo was a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than once Bill had found Grace exceedingly hungover after a night out with them (if she even came home) and sometimes stinking of marijuana (or worse).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally her 'friends' seemed to be the only time Bill heard remnants of the Old Grace poke through. A laugh here or there, a smile, brief flashes of excitement on her face when they did something new and not always legal. But as apathetic as Grace seemed to be about most things now, Bill could tell, like any good brother, that his big sister was lost, and deeply, deeply hurt. But any attempt he'd made to get close to her had simply ended in a verbal thrashing or just angry silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd eventually stopped making an effort to talk to her at all, if she didn't talk to him first. Leading to the awkward moment Bill had found himself in now, as he waited on his small group of friends to show up so they could walk to school together only to find himself joined by his sister, who was normally just going to sleep as he left for school.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...I mean, ummm, I didn't say anything Grace?\" Bill said, robbing his pounding temples as his brain struggled with the multiple layers of memories that were now contained within it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, keep your secrets. Probably something gay anyway\" Grace said with a roll of her eyes, turning back to her cigarette and staring out at the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill followed her gaze and felt the need to ask his new sister if she remembered...Well, anything about being Greg Strasserman, being married to mom, or anything about the previous reality. But instead his new memories bid him to just turn away. He opened his palm to look at the strange gemstone again and frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Dumb rock messed everything up AGAIN! How the hell do you get it to do what you want!? And how does this keep Rob from beating him..her up!?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Bill's internal monologue was ended as the screech of tires shattered the quiet suburban morning. Looking up, Bill saw a familiar truck careen around the corner and screech to a stop in front of the Strasserman abode. Behind it, look a little frazzled, came a small group of teenagers, three girls and a greasy, dark haired boy. In the heat of the moment, as the truck rumbled to a stop and a VERY familiar red-headed giant stepped out, Bill struggled to recall who they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck! Rob!\" Bill began to shout as Rob, moving far too fast than anyone his size had any right to be, raced across the yard. Bill quickly stuffed the Ahn'Ger Stone back into his pocket and warily eyed the behemoth on his porch, wary for a re-enactment of the reality he'd just left...But Rob didn't even notice him. Instead the giant was focused entirely on Grace, who tossed her cigarette away with a wry grin and rose from the swing, sauntering over to Rob, stretching upwards and wrapping her arms around his bulging neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Robbie\" Grace purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, beautiful\" Rob grunted as he pulled her closer, almost straddling her in a perverted inverse of the bloody scene from earlier. And then Bill watched as the two shared a long, passionate kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick, let's get out of here before my mom sees you. Totally do NOT want to deal with that bitch this morning\" Grace muttered when they finally parted lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine by me babe\" Rob growled. The two turned to leave, hand in hand, before Grace suddenly stopped and fixed Bill with a strange look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey dweeboid. You wanna...come with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\" Bill said, startled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're gonna go have some real fun, get out of this shit town for a while. You in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I mean, I've got school, Grace!\" Bill whined, looking at the his group of friends standing on across the street, eyeing the scene with curiosity and concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to your sister, dickwad. Live a little!\" Rob said with a twisted grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill...</span></div></div>",

On one hand, as much as he KNEW that Grace was his sister, he also knew that she was, in fact, his dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'She's my sister...But this isn't right. This isn't what I meant to happen!'</i> Bill's mind stumbled as it put together a response. Grace was into some heavy shit, her depression and grief over the loss of their 'father' James had caused Grace to fall in with a VERY bad crowd and was leading her down the wrong path. But at the same time Grace was supposed to be Greg Strasserman, Bill was supposed to be eighteen instead of being sixteen again, and his family wasn't supposed to be broken! The two versions of Bill's memories began to toss suggestions at him in a non-verbal battle of the, well, Bills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'She is your SISTER. You have a whole life in your head that tells you this! You need to be a good brother and try to help her out of this!'</i> The mental version of this reality's Bill said adamantly, stomping a metaphorical foot on the equally metaphorical ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'The Stone messed things up! You need to wish things back to normal! You've got to get dad back! You can deal with Rob now that you know what is going to happen!'</i> The mental version of the previous reality's Bill pleaded, his voice a little fainter and weaker as if he was shouting from behind a window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the mental Bills made valid points to Bill, it was true that this reality WAS a mistake, but what was reality when there existed an artifact that could create or reprupose beings and memories out of nothing? The existential angst of it all was giving the newly regressed teenager anxiety and he suddenly felt the need to puke. But instead he simply watched as Grace rolled her eyes and extended a small hand out to Bill and gave him a small smile that shook the new version of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'She hasn't smiled like that since before dad died'</i> The current version of him whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'SHE IS DAD' </i>The past version of himself screamed through the mental pane of glass. But the moment passed as another voice, shrill and full of anger, rang out from inside the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GRACE LYNN STRASSERMAN YOU GET YOUR ASS BACK HERE RIGHT NOW!\" Martha screamed as she saw her delenquint daughter sneaking off AGAIN with that thug she'd hooked up with. The harried former wife turned single mom came stomping down the stairs of the house in her work attire and heels, looking far more worse for wear as her makeup couldn't hide the dark circles under her eyes or the streaks of gray that had appeared in her formerly healthy brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace's hand retracted as she her head snapped towards the sound of her mother's approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, there's the bitch. Let's go!\" Grace said, pushing Rob forward off the porch and hustling towards Rob's truck that was parked halfway on the sidewalk. There was a flash of black and blue hair as she turned towards Bill once more. \"BILL! YOU IN OR OUT!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'If you go you can keep an eye on her, maybe you can keep her from getting into trouble again'</i> Current Bill's mental voice said, wavering as Bill watched his sister flee, a spark of hope that maybe all she needed was her little brother to help her out of this personal crisis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Just make another wish! Get back to normal!'</i> Yelled Past Bill, banging his metaphorical hands against the window that separated his old memories from his new ones. But then the moment of choice passed as Martha Strasserman burst through the front door of the house and stamped angrily across the porch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GRACE! GET BACK HERE RIGHT NOW!\" The widow screamed at the top of her lungs, her formerly peaceful face contorted in a mask of rage and worry. Grace, however, simply flipped her mother the bird as she piled into Rob's truck, the door slamming shut as the engine turned over and, with a roar, took off down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GRACE!\" Martha wailed as she rushed out onto the front lawn. But it was no use, the red truck squealed as it took the next corner far too fast and disappeared into the April morning. Bill's mom stood there for a moment before a hand covered her face and she shook her head in frustration as the normal morning ambiance of Shermer returned. Across the road, now that the drama had ended, Bill could spy the group of other teens that had stopped on the other side of the street, the girls whispering to themselves as the greasy haired boy stared at Bill with an unsettling gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bill your...your friends are here\" Martha said as she turned back towards the house, wiping at her eyes as a trail of tears began to ruin her makeup, \"Have a good day at school, okay?\" She said as she stepped back onto the porch, giving her son a weak smile before vanishing back inside the darkened interior of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Well, guess that decides that'</i> Current and Past Bill both said in unison before immediately falling back into arguing over what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Mom has enough on her plate right now, just go to school, maybe you can talk to Grace later!'</i> Current Bill said hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'MAKE.THE.WISH'</i> Past Bill roared again, and Bill forced his former self to be quiet for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough. Just...Enough\" Bill muttered as he rose out of the chair he'd been sitting in and grabbed his waiting backpack. There was already too much drama this morning ad with several different lifetimes in his head, Bill was just ready for the banal normalcy of school. The two mental Bills fell silent as Bill looped the backpack across one shoulder and stepped down off the porch and began crossing over to the waiting group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, guys. Sorry about that\" He said as his sneakers stepped off the asphalt and onto the concrete of the opposing sidewalk. He felt embarassed about his sister's behavior. Usually it wasn't so...public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay Bill, we know it's been hard for you!\" Came a soft, sweet voice that made butterflies erupt in Bill's stomach. He looked at the older teen, the Senior out of the group of Sophmores that Bill was once again part of and had graced their little group with her presence since she lived just down the block from Bill's house. She was a little shorter than Bill, topped with golden blonde hair and sweet blue eyes that sometimes hid behind a pair of glasses. Her Star Trek Beyond shirt and green flannel top accented her curvy short-stacked figure perfectly, and Bill felt himself smiling as he tried to ward off the boner forming in his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Tammy\" He said, trying to hide his blushing face as he gave the goofy grin on his face to the other girl in the group, Paige. Paige Walters was like a dark, funhouse mirror version of Tammy. She wasn't very attractive, VERY overweight and covered with acne. But she was a geek like Bill was, and she was friends with Tammy (but honestly who WASN'T friends with Tammy, aside from the cliquey cheerleaders or the assholes of Shermer High) and was nice enough to spend time around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Bill!\" Paige said, her pockmarked face dominated by the bright smile that was on it. She hadn't said anything to him about it, but between her and Tammy (who was so pretty and geeky yet still hung out with the group of Sophmores, despite them being near the bottom of Shermer High's popularity ladder), Paige was head over heels for Bill. He was the only boy that WASN'T a creep that gave her the time of day. And didn't make fun of her. And the way he looked at her every morning with that silly smile just made the various teasing and cruel comments from the rest of Shermer's school population much easier to bear. She'd even been trying to diet and lose weight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Paige\" Bill said, looking at Paige long enough for the awkward boner he had for Tammy to fade away as he fell in with the group. He looked over at the other male of the group, the greasy haired Matt Harris, who was still staring at him, but now had a almost scary looking grin on his face. Matt was...weird. He was a perv, quick to anger and overall was considered a bit of a psychopath. He was even seeing a shrink, though no one knew why other than 'to help him control his anger'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Matt. What's up?\" Bill said as friendly as he could. Matt was nice enough to him, but there was always just something off about their friendship. Really the two had, in this reality, just sort of hung together since grade school, but it always felt...off. But Bill just assumed it was just Matt being Matt. He raised his hand for their typical high-five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, your sister is SO hot!\" Matt said, and Bill immediately regretted being nice. He felt the sting of Matt's little-too-hard' return five and gave the greasy haired teen a look of annoyance. \"What? WHAT!? I mean it's a compliment! You see the way her boobs-\" Matt whined as the group collectively rolled their eyes and took off walking. Matt immediately felt his eyes shift back towards Tammy's ass even as he sputtered \"Hey, wait up!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill had forgotten in the heat of the moment but there was another figure with the group this morning, a smaller one in an nerd-chic outfit that looked more like it belonged on Tammy, one who rode to school with her mom. Her long blonde hair was tucked into a ponytail and her large glasses made her already huge eyes even larger as they kept sneaking glances back at Bill. He felt like he knew the face but yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I already told Paige and Matt but have you met my little sister, Kimberly? She's gonna hang out at the high school today!\" Tammy said as the group stopped at a crosswalk. \"Kimmy's doing really great in her classes and they're thinking about moving her up a couple of grades next year! They wanted her to see what high school is like before the summer gets here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smaller girl turned tried but failed to suppress a wave of nervous giggles from escaping her red as a beet face as Bill's eyes nearly popped out of his head as he realized who the smaller girl was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H...Hi Bill!\" Kimmy Ackerton squeaked.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Like a matador fighting an angry bull who refused to be tamed, Bill Strasserman reluctantly took shelter behind the safety of his family's front door. He watched from the Strasserman's foyer with concern as Rob's furious bulk threatened to break down the heavy wooden entrance.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of the frying pan and into the fire. Story of my life\" sighed Bill, who was still tripping out from the fact that he had literally just traveled through time twice today. Once into the far future of 2058 where he was a grown man with a fully grown daughter and was married to his best friend, which was freaky and raised all sorts of concerns about free will and destiny. The second time had been to return him to right here and now...and it had been completely by accident. He had been so upset, so <i>blood boilingly angry</i> at Gloria's intrusion into his life, how she had ruined Tom's reputation and seemingly erased his entire family from existence, that he had made a furious wish without even knowing what he was saying. Now that he had time to think about it, he was immensely grateful that someone up there seemed to be looking out for him, because in retrospect things could easily be much worse right now if he had simply used another word or turn of phrase. If he had wished for Gloria to be dead, or to shrink down to ant size so he could step on her, or to buzz off, who <i>knows</i> what could have happened? Bill wasn't particularly religious, but it just seemed too much of a lucky break that his wish had turned back the clock. He imagined to his horror all of the myriad ways that it could have gone badly, and he couldn't stand that all of this happened because he couldn't control his temper. He fucking detested Gloria, but with this monkey's paw he now owned, he needed to be a lot more careful. He needed to learn self control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teenage boy fished the magic emerald out of his jean pocket and turned it around a few times in his hand. The golden core in the middle of the stone was creating beautiful sparks which rained down to the surface of the stone like a miniature snowstorm. Bill found this beautiful, and he became briefly hypnotized by its alluring charms....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No! No! Snap out of it, Bill!\" grunted the eighteen year old to himself. He knew that this thing was dangerous and probably at least partially sentient. The stone <b>wanted</b> Bill to use it, like in that old Jim Carrey movie The Mask.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill knew enough, at least through TvTropes and through pop culture osmosis, that magic artifacts like this were dangerous. No matter how tempting that it may seem to use it, that it inevitably corrupted you. Like the Monkey's Paw, which he mentally made an analogy to. His intelligent, analytical mind had a strong desire to test the stone. He wanted to see if he could crack it somehow, to get past the unwritten clause that one must be in blind, unthinking fury to activate it, as he had been ten minutes ago, and then use its reality bending magic to make improvements to his life and maybe down the road even turn the world into a utopian society(Bill was a dreamer like that), but he was also wise enough to know all of that needed to be done in a safe work environment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis current situation, with the ogre like Rob Bolstrum pounding away and screaming verbal abuse at you? That seemed to Bill like the opposite of a safe work environment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET OUT HERE RIGHT NOW, YOU BALLLESS FAGGOT!\" he heard Rob yell through the door, Rob snarling through gritted teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, you're making it sound so tempting!\" yelled Bill back through the door sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH, YOU WANT TEMPTING? IF YOU DON'T COME OUT HERE IN THE NEXT FIVE SECONDS, I'M GONNA DO WHAT I WAS SENT HERE TO DO BY BIG JON.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's that, paying me back the money he owes me for busting my car?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO YOU PIMPLE POPPING CUNT, I'M GOING TO BURN YOUR FUCKING PIECE OF SUBURBAN SHIT HOUSE DOWN  TO THE GROUND!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope you brought your matches with you! Or can your family not afford matches?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BITCH, I'VE GOT MY GAS CAN RIGHT HERE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Rob couldn't seen him behind the door, Bill's eyes went wide in terror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew that last insult had probably gotten under Rob's skin the most, as he was noticeably insecure about the poverty he lived in while most of Shermer High came from middle to upper middle class families. Or in Big Jon's case, a fucking loaded one. Which Bill felt bad for, but it was still no excuse to being a bullying piece of shit. Plenty of people came from tough backgrounds and didn't do what Rob did. But Rob was unstable. He might actually follow through on his threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill glared hard at the stone in his hand, which he sensed was laughing at his predicament as the pretty yellow sparks continued their flurry throughout the universe of the Ahn'Ger Stone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was about to contemplate his decision further, Bill's father Greg ran down the stairs with a baseball bat in hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bill, what's going on?!\" Greg demanded. \"Who's that punk I've been hearing banging on our door? I've already called the cops. Is he the one you told me about? Rob Bolstrum, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH, IS THAT YOUR OLD MAN, SHITTERMAN?\" Rob taunted. \"SIR, I'M THE GUY THAT'S GOING TO DESTROY YOUR PROPERTY IF YOUR SON DOESN'T SHOW HIS FUCKING FACE RIGHT NOW!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill grunted deeply. He finally had it. He didn't travel through time to have some <i>second</i> asshole threaten his family. Gloria had done it once today, and Bill was adamant that it wouldn't happen again. Getting his dad involved had crossed the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n LThe tall, skinny teenage boy finally made the decision to make another wish. One that he hoped was neutral enough to not cause any undue butterfly effect type changes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I WISH THAT YOU WERE A NICER PERSON, ROB!\" he yelled through the thick oak door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gemstone reliably activated in his hand, glowing for all the world like a piece of kryptonite, and then everything went dark...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cheap Lasko fan circulated air throughout the tiny, cramped bedroom Bill now found himself in, the only recognizable sound being the repetitive telltale hum of the motor and the blades as they continued their endless revolutions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange room Bill now found himself in was tiny, cluttered, and apparently belonged to someone with low standards of tidiness. Offhand, he thought that his mother Martha would have a field day in here.  Wherever he was, the owner apparently was a big fan of heavy metal judging by all of the posters of different bands adorning the walls. An older model CRT TV sat on top of a small dresser parallel to the to the bed he was laying on, and...and was that a VCR sitting on top of it? A VCR in 2019? Really?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRays of early morning sunshine burst through the bottom of the blinded window to his immediate right, indicating that it was still early morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he was naked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis observations on where the gemstone had stranded him now was interrupted by the last thing he had ever expected: A curvy, equally naked red haired girl entering from the left and jumping right on top of him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wheee!\" she squealed happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmph!\"was the only sound that Bill could make, as said gorgeous redhead unceremoniously shoved her entire tongue down his throat and gave him the most enthusiastic French kiss of his life(Correction, the <i>only</i> French kiss of his life, and the only kiss period outside of his family), her generous breasts bouncing along his flat chest all the while, causing the bed, which Bill now realized that he was laying on, to begin squeaking wildly. She pressed soft hands against his cheeks to help push her tongue in even further to the point where it felt like she was giving his esophagus a bath.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Bill's ecstacy, the stranger's thick, luscious lips tasting like bubblegum, he was self aware enough to realize to his astonishment that his genitalia and this woman's genitalia were interlocked with one another. This...this girl was literally riding him! They were having sex! Holy shit, he was having sex! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho <i>was</i> this girl!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, he got his answer. Not in the way he wanted, but he got an answer. A door cracked open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bobbi, you and your idjit man whore get out of my house! You're both late for school, and I'm not having the truant officer stopping by here again!\" screeched an aging battleaxe with dyed platinum blonde hair and wearing a faded white bathrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Whatever you say, <i>Sheila</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you call me that again you little bitch! I'm your stepmother, and you better start acting like it!\" muttered the woman before slamming the door shut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" loudly exclaimed the redhead, who apparently was named  Bobbi, as she slowly glided Bill's condom clad penis out of her vagina and leaped almost acrobatically off of the bed. \"Shitfuck, Billy, why didn't you tell me what time it was?! Stepmom's right, we've got to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl known as Bobbi violently tore open a nearby dresser drawer and tossed all of her clothing onto the cluttered floor while muttering various curse words to herself, sounding like an adorable George Carlin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she began hastily getting dressed, Bill removed the condom from his junk and tossed it across the small room into a half filled trashcan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice shot, honey! I'm surprised you never made the basketball team\" laughed the strange girl gently as she slipped on a pair of aqua blue colored panties over her long legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to his side of the bed, Bill noticed that his jeans, boxers, shoes, and T-shirt were scattered around. Without taking his eyes off of \"Bobbi\", he slowly picked these garments up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(To Be Continued...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Instead, he wordlessly watched as the girl who took his virginity clip a bra to her chest, followed by slipping on a black Little Nas X T-shirt and a long green flannel overshirt which she left unbuttoned. She then climbed into a pair of blue capris, practically pouring herself into the tight jeans, struggling to wiggle her wide hips and generous posterior into them. Finally, the redhead grabbed a pair of brown moccasins from off of a nearby shelf, which she casually slid her tiny, size six feet into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Billy, what the fuck!? Get dressed, honey! We've got to hit the fucking road!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill watched the strange girl in utter awe before quickly following orders and got dressed. To his relief, he found the Ahn'Ger Stone sitting in his left jean pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was finished, Bobbi grabbed his hand firmly but gently, and he noticed that the tall girl was strong. She could probably beat him up if she really wanted to. Thankfully, she seemed to be in love with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry sweetie, as much as I get wet seeing you naked, we're in a bit of a hurry, so if you don't mind, let's blow this shit stand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bedroom door already open, Bobbi pulled Bill like a mother dragging her child along and forcibly walked him through what he now realized was a double wide trailer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye Sheila, see you never!\" giggled the redhead, sarcastically waving at her stepmother as Sheila sat on the living on the couch angrily watching daytime television, deliberately ignoring what she thought of as her boyfriend's spoiled brat of a daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill and Bobbi strolled across a gravel lined lot of run down trailers as the early morning sun shined it's glorious rays upon the two teenagers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going?\" asked Bill, still lost as to what exactly was going on or who this person was he had just screwed around with. In the back of his mind, he told himself that this couldn't possibly be Rob Bolstrum. Could it?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chicago for now. I've got some friends in the city who said that we can crash at their place until we get on our feet. After that? Who knows. Hopefully someplace warm. I'm aiming for California. Vegas maybe. Or maybe Miami? Anywhere but fucking Illinois. I've had enough winters where I freezed my ass off to last me a lifetime. Did I ever tell you about when I was six and my dad was too drunk to fix the propane heater, so I woke up with literal icicles in my hair? And my doll's hair? Jesus. Meth man, gotta love it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of Bobbi's spiel, they both had walked past a trailer where a mean looking, bulldogged faced girl who was watching in a cheap lawn chair. Bill thought he recognized her. He remembered someone in his class who he heard lived in the Shermer Fields trailer park who dropped out early on during  their Sophomore year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Bobbi, is that your knight in shining armor? He looks like a faggot to me!\" she yelled from twenty feet away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Bobbi flipped this girl the bird with a long, red tipped finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you very much, Marcy!\" she announced in her new telltale impudent tone of voice before rounding a corner with Bill into a mostly empty parking lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked up to what...to what Bill realized was <i>his</i> car!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobbi smiled cheekily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice having a girlfriend who knows her way around a wrench, isn't it? I fixed all the damage Big Jon did to it. I'm sorry that he's such a fucking douchebag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're my girlfriend?\" Bill stuttered, his jaw slightly dropping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're my boyfriend, so by logic, that would make me your girlfriend, right? I mean, if you want to keep being my boyfriend that is. After what you did for me, I'd follow you anywhere. I'd be just as happy being your friend, your Chewbacca.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I...what did I do for you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobbi sauntered over to Bill and gave him another deep kiss. When she finally let go, she spoke in a gentler, softer tone of voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so modest. If you hadn't been the only guy nice enough to ask where my black eye came from, or my busted lip, I'd probably still be stuck with that psychotic asshole. The way you confronted Jon in front of everybody, how you provoked him into attacking you and got him expelled, goddamn, that was <i>so</i> hot to me. You may be a little skinny, and you may be a geek, but you've got the biggest balls I've ever seen. Marcy was right, you're my knight in shining armor. You're my hero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobbi let go of him, and Bill almost started floating from all the butterflies currently flying around in his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis girl, this wet dream...was his girlfriend?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now come on and get in\" said Bobbi, already climbing into the driver's seat of his now completely repaired vehicle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck school. Get in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill walked over to the passenger's seat and climbed in, off on some unknown adventure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What the...\" Bill muttered, leaving the Stone alone and rubbing his eyes in disbelief. \"How...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy gave a girlish squeal of excitement and darted across the empty street, her breasts bouncing painfully from the rapid movement but she didn't care. She leapt from the pavement, over the sidewalk and left a small tidal wave of dew in her wake as she stormed across the yard and up the short flight of steps, crashing into Bill's completely unprepared form and sending them both crashing to the hard wooden surface of the porch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Bill could even moan in pain, he found his lips locked with Tammy's as she pressed herself against him. He felt his cock rapidly stiffen and strain against the tight fabric of his jeans, but he suddenly disengaged, pulling himself free of Tammy's soft, beautiful form. He extracted himself as carefully as he could and then backed himself against the porch railing, staring at the girl in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Tammy?\" Was the only thing Bill could think of to say as he slowly pulled himself to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy grinned and pulled herself up as well, brushing off some dust before striking a pose. \"Ta-da!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...how?\" Bill stammered as his brain attempted to process everything. If he'd gone back in time and reverted everything...Unless he really hadn't gone back in time? What if this was just another new reality? What if-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! Hey, shh, it's okay!\" Tammy said, her face growing serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...how? I made the wish! I just wanted everything to go back to how it had been! You should be Tom, not Tammy!\" Bill nearly shouted, and immediately regretting his choice of words at the hurt that flashed across Tammy's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I like being me...\" She said with a sniff as she fought back tears, \"Why does everyone want me to be Tom!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill took a deep breath and shook his head, \"Shit, I'm sorry, Tammy. I'm just-I'm a little freaked out right now, ok? I just want to know what happened! You remember, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA single tear flowed down Tammy's pretty cheeks before she wiped it and the remaining tears from her eyes, \"Well, you freaked out and got the stone from Gloria, then you made the wish. The next thing was the light and I felt myself changing and I just...wished that I could stay as me? Then the next thing I know I was back around the corner, right where Tom was, and I was still me! My driver's license is me, my phone shows me...I'm Tammy!\" Her face lit up as she gestured to her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthen her face grew serious again and she moved closer to Bill, who was still propped up against the railing of the porch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember it all, Bill. Tom wanted to kill himself. You were the only reason he didn't. And then when he became Old Tammy, he felt how loved he was, even if it was all created by that\" She pointed to the gemstone, still sitting on the railing where it had appeared, \"And then he became me. And then we got young again. And the whole time I was so afraid of going back to being Tom, to losing you...I don't know. But I don't want hide that I truly want this anymore. I want you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning light began to dim as storm clouds rolled in overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if it was...artificial. You felt it, and I know I felt it. I want to be your girl, Bill. And when we're ready, I want to be your wife, and the mother of your children. You know that we make it work. We just have a whole lot more time now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Tammy, I...We, the timeline-\" Bill started, his mind racing as it processed the information, but he never got to finish as she slid against him, sliding her arms around his neck as rain began to fall just inches away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just shut up and kiss me, you big dummy\" Tammy whispered, pulling herself up and giving Bill an impossibly deep kiss. He only resisted for a moment before he wrapped his own arms around her and pulled her tighter. And there they stood, two young lovers in an embrace that last for several minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill chuckled when Tammy's arms slipped away from his neck and she pulled away, \"So, now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy slid him a very 'Tom' like grin, \"Maybe you could treat a girl to some breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be late for school...\" Bill began, casting a look down the road towards the high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a perfect record and one tardy mark this close to end won't make the world explode for either of us\" Tammy said, sticking her tongue out at him playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if my lady insists...\" Bill offered his arm to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She does!\" Tammy said, sliding her arm in his, trying hard not to break out into what she knew would be an endless gigglefest of happiness. This was everything she wanted. She was living the life she wanted now, she was happy, she had her soul-mate...what else did she need, Tammy asked herself as the couple walked arm in arm towards the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut out of the corner of her eye Tammy spotted something dull and almost lifeless sitting on the railing. Bill didn't seem to notice it at all, and as they passed, Tammy slid three slender finger out and grabbed the gemstone, sliding it softly into her pocket without Bill ever noticing a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArm in arm, they entered the Strasserman house, and Tammy was greeted with a warm, loving welcome from Bill's, and one day her, family.</span></div></div>",

It was still simply a gemstone, just one with otherworldly powers that could bend and shape reality on command. And when Bill's attack on Gloria caused her to fling the Ahn'Ger Stone down the hallway, it had cracked. In the heat of the moment Bill had no idea that the artifact in his hand was damaged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his wish, the power coursing through the stone was not released safely or in a way that obeyed the rules that bound the stone to it's purpose. Not even it, if the stone did or did not possess such an ability, could guess at what would happen when Bill's wish was granted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever Bill wished for next was going to go utterly, horribly wrong no matter how he said it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: \"You'd fuck off like the trashy whore you are!\" Due to the damage, the Ahn'Ger Stone is unable to exclusively target Gloria and fulfill the wish, turning the girl into a trashy prostitute. Instead, the Stone simply tosses the magic out, affecting everything and changing it to match Bill's wish. The end result is a dark, dirty, crime filled world. Pollution, murder, corruption are everywhere, sunlight is rare, and the world resembles an enormous Red Light District run by organized crime, biker gangs and cartels replacing the governments of the world. Bill, Gloria, Tammy and Willow are now adult whores, struggling to survive on the incredibly mean streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: \"You'd fucking shut up and just listen to me!\" Due to the damage, the Ahn'Ger Stone is unable to exclusively target Gloria and fulfill the wish, making Gloria be quiet and obedient to Bill. Instead, the Stone releases the magic in a wild and unfocused burst, affecting everything and drastically changing it in an attempt to match Bill's wish. The world is now a cyberpunk wasteland. Humanity largely exists only in massive urban sprawls that span hundreds of miles while massive factories dot the wasteland between them. In this reality, mankind has successfully created both robotic and genetically engineered lifeforms called Biofakes, both of which are considered slaves and second class citizens to humans. Bill, Tammy, Gloria and Willow find themselves as part of this reality; Gloria is the personal Robodroid servant of Bill, who finds himself as a Biofake assistant to Willow, who no longer remembers being anything but a corporate executive in this new reality. Tammy is nowhere to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Bill makes a different wish.</span></div></div>",

Fearing the worst, she ran inside to go see what her little brother was furious about, the last she saw a flash of green/gold light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill didn't even know where he had gotten that expression from. He was so incensed, so unbelievably pissed by how nonchalantly Gloria had used the stone, erasing his family in the process, that all the eighteen year old boy could do was say the first vulgar, hateful thing that came to mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore either he, Tammy, Gloria, or Willow could even react to Bill's wound up rage, reality itself began to melt and rearrange itself. All four kids temporarily lost the cozy feeling of a corporal existence, their bodies and minds being molded and reshaped by unseen and unknowable forces, though somewhere in the void between time and space, Bill immediately felt a deep sense of regret...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen reality settled upon a new form, Bill realized that he was no longer on Bancroft Avenue, no longer in the safe suburban shire that he had lived comfortably in for all his life. Instead, he was standing somewhere downtown underneath the shade of a drab brick building. He didn't recognize the street exactly, there were no identifiable landmarks to be found, so he guessed it was a side street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no, what the hell did I do now? he asked himself mentally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking above the concrete jungle, the confused teenage boy could see that the sky was overcast and glum, with an unexplainable mist drifting lazily through the air and a sixth sense telling him it was going to rain soon. Sounds of rumbling traffic and pedestrians could be heard in the distance somewhere going about their respective business, but overall a foreboding and eerie quiet was the word of the day. Combined with the endless rows of identical, filing cabinet like buildings as far as the eye could see, Bill overall was left feeling rather depressed and dour. It was almost as if he had just stepped into one of the Silent Hill games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA burst of unforgiving cool wind suddenly blew in Bill's face, forcing him to retreat closer to the entrance of the building he had been crouching under. A few scant paces immediately made him took notice that he was no longer himself. Sighing with frustration at what that damn stone had done now, he looked down at what his body looked like this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust great\u201d he said in a melodious, slightly nasally voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time he had turned into a woman, and apparently his parents, if they still existed, were much more lenient in terms of the clothing options their children were allowed to wear. Case in point: he was wearing a low cut black and white striped top which emphasized his new large milky white breasts. These breasts seemed larger than any of the women in his family, so Bill worried that perhaps they were artificial. Below that, he sported a waspish waist, curves that he would desperately have lusted over had they not been a part of him. Below that, he noticed that instead of his cargo shorts he was now wearing a red plaid skirt, which helped explain the draft he had felt brush against his bare legs from the wind a moment ago. Below that, Bill discovered the reason why he had almost tripped. He had almost face-planted because of his new footwear, a pair of four inch high-heeled strappy sandals. In the reflection of a nearby window, Bill noticed that his brunette hair had grown wavier and longer, resting cutely on his now diminutive looking shoulders. His face was unmistakably feminine, looking uncannily like photos of his mother he saw from when she was in high school. Or more accurately, he looked virtually identical to Willow, his future daughter turned older sister turned...who the hell knows what she is now? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill reckoned that in this new body, he could definitely join the popular kids at the lunchroom table if he wanted to, which he didn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Bill became lost in his own beauty, like the myth of Narcissus. He stared deeply into his soulful blue eyes, which stared back at him, betraying a kind of weariness and frustration that the teenage boy chalked up to his frustration at this morning's magical mayhem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cFuck, what am I going to do now?\u201d</i> he whispered to himself with soft red lips. \u201cWhere's the stone, Bill? Where...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY!!\u201d came a loud, booming voice from behind Bill, shocking him out of his reverie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around to see who was yelling so forcefully, Bill's eyes immediately went wide. He felt his heart-rate begin to steadily increase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Big Jon! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill blinked just to be sure that he wasn't hallucinating. Yep, standing inches away from him was Big Jon, in all his neanderthal glory. His brawny arms encased in a blue Letterman jacket, he was counting a stack of money with a shit eating grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn Willow, you really outdid yourself last night. If your sister ain't careful, she'll get another fat lip at the end of the month\u201d he said, chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Jon swaggered up to Bill and intimidated him into a corner <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill immediately looked down at himself, terrified to know that he was now even less capable of defending himself against the vicious bully than he had been this morning. He was never Mr. Muscle, but now he couldn't hurt anyone, unless smothering Jon with his boob flesh was a possibility, Bill joked to himself. But this was no laughing matter. He was terrified at the thought of this bully not only beating him up, but sexually assaulting him. He had heard enough of the whispers among the gossip mill that Jon had already molested enough girls at his school to develop a reputation of sorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill fearfully realized that he had no pockets now, no secret compartments where the Ahn'Ger stone could possibly be hiding, so if Jon wanted to hurt him, there was no way out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jon bared his toothy grin, he suddenly handed Bill five crisp twenty dollar bills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere's your cut. Don't spend that all in one place\u201d said Jon, winking sardonically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-t-thank y-you\u201d stuttered Bill, palming the money in his hand. He suddenly noticed that he was trembling with fright, literally <i>trembling.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo get some breakfast or something, go see a movie, enjoy yourself, because you're sure as shit going to earn that all back tonight, one way or another. If you worked that hard last night, I know for damn sure that I'm not going to let you start slacking off anymore.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? You're letting me go?\u201d Bill squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, if you want some right now, lets go upstairs and start kicking it...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!!\u201d Bill yelled out with instinctual fear, which he immediately regretted. Would Jon hurt him now for being such a weakling that he felt he needed to scream? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, well then get your sweet ass out of here. See you tonight\u201d said Big Jon, who walked inside the building and climbed the staircase to somewhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was getting extremely annoyed already at these heels he was walking in. His feet were killing him, and they forced him to walk in a sensual sashaying motion which he was sure was extremely degrading to him if only he could see the way his buttocks wiggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing Jon's advice to go get some breakfast, not because Big Jon said so but because he hadn't eaten this morning, Bill decided to walk into the first diner he saw, located on the corner of Elm and Main. It was called Sandy's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill entered an looked around, surprised by the number of people in here at this time of the morning. There was a couple sitting in a booth down the end of the building, a pair of teenage girls chit-chatting over coffee, a bunch of other pedestrians of all ages, ethnicities, and sizes congregating over eggs and hash browns and other early morning goodies. Yet somehow it felt different to Bill. He had never been in this establishment before, so he didn't have any reason to think poorly of it, and before today he certainly was not one to believe in superstition, but some unknown sense of intuition was warning him that something ominous was going to happen if he stayed here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst his better judgment, he sat in a booth and ordered some chocolate chip pancakes and orange juice. The waitress wrote down the order with a weary smile and walked away to give it to the cook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bill looked around, a classic oldie began playing over the intercom:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"There is a house in New Orleans. <br>\r\nThey call the rising sun. <br>\r\nAnd it's been the ruin of  many a poor boy<br>\r\nAnd God I know I'm one...\u201d </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the song continued to play, something horrible slowly dawned on Bill. Another set of memories. Just like how he had remembered the life of being a full grown man running a business, being married to a woman named Tammy who he loved with all his heart, raising a lovely artistic daughter with her in wedded bliss...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he recalled something awful. Not just a bad life, but a bad reality. That abominable stone had twisted reality into something ugly, something horrible, something elementally terrifying. It had created a  dystopian nightmare where even a small, work-a-day town like Shermer, Illinois felt more like Gotham City. The government and its law enforcement arm were never something to write home about, but now they were almost comically corrupt, like out of a bad video game or an episode of The Twilight Zone. The city and its suburbs were now almost all slums with small pockets of obscene wealth embedded deep inside of it. It was overrun by crime and a far lower standard of living akin to the worst fantasies of Orwell and Bradbury. It was a paddock with wolves on one side and sheep on the other, and Bill, no, her name here was Willow here...Willow was definitely one of the sheep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: As Bill is waiting for his order to arrive, Bill runs into Gloria, Tammy and his now twin sister Willow. In this new reality, they are all strung out prostitutes under the employ of their sadistic pimps Big Jon Ingerman and Rob Bolstrum. Needless to say, life treats them cruelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Bill waits for his order to arrive. Meanwhile, an old man sits down next to Bill. He claims he is a wizard, and he needs Bill's help to recover the Ahn'Ger Stone and set reality straight. </span></div></div>",

The light was distorted, more gold than green and was washing across everything like a wave, dragging the changes along behind it in slow motion, though Bill didn't realize it was simply his  The hallway of Bill's home changed in it's wake, rapidly expanding outward as the carpeted floor turned to elaborate marble, the walls expanding outwards, the ceiling extending upwards. Massive support columns rose out of the floor, stretching upwards until they reached the now vaulted ceiling while the far wall shifted into floor to ceiling windows. Bill's gaze slowly turned away from the changing interior of the house right as the wave hit Gloria and Tammy, watching the world beyond the huge windows change as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere there was once a typical American suburb filled with trees, blue sky and nice houses was now a dark, oppressive environment dominated by the seemingly endless sprawl of buildings, silhouetted by the glow of a setting red sun above a lifeless looking ocean as pollution clouds closed around it. Skyscrapers rose out of the gloom, though few reaching the height at which Bill now apparently stood. In the far distance, almost beyond Bill's line of sight and shrouded in a heavy downpour, were buildings that were so huge that the term Megastructure entered Bill's mind as a flash of lightning illuminated only a fraction of the building's pyramidal design. On the buildings below, vast trenches of lights began to appear as the inhabitants of this new world popped into existence and as massive advertisements appeared for brands that Bill did not recognize.Dots of lights began zipping through the sky, smaller than any plane that Bill knew about. And far off in the distance as the sun disappeared entirely from view, Bill could see a intense, large white flash as something huge rose from the dark surface of the ocean and into the cloudy sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last vestiges of the golden wave faded beyond the horizon as time began to return to normal speed for Bill, and the sound of strange classical music he did not recognize flowed into his ears. He turned around, and was just as equally shocked to see how luxurious his home had become. The walls were so high up that he had to crane his neck to see the ceiling, from which hung enormous drapes that appeared to be made of fine silk and illuminated from above by what looked to be...free floating lights? Huge fireplaces, separated by the towering support columns ran the length of the huge chamber, now longer than any room he'd ever been in in his life. In front of the massive set of windows a very large and expensive looking desk had appeared on top of a thick rug that looked very old yet still in perfect condition. The desk's clearly wooden frame had ornate carvings; twin lions...no, sphinxes on either side of what looked to be either large beetle within an ankh, or a extremely artistic styling of a gemstone. The surface of the desk was empty, but a thin line of lights around the perimeter told Bill that this was yet something else out of science fiction. For the moment, Bill felt compelled to leave it alone as he turned to look for Tammy and Gloria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so caught up in the severe changes to his environment that Bill never felt or realized the changes to his own body finalize as the stone went dead and cold, the crack along the side becoming even larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to his alarm, all he saw was a clearly mechanical version of Gloria, standing silently at attention, dressed in what was clearly a futuristic version of a maid uniform. The black outfit hugged Gloria's figure, which was still very clearly female, accentuating her bust, hips and legs. Gloria's exposed skin was a soft, pearl white, a texture that looked something like flexible plastic. Thin black lines clearly denoted joints and other moving and clearly removable parts, especially around the robo-girl's face, which was still very clearly that of Gloria Vanapolous but...perfected? As if every minor flaw, inconsistency or assymetricalality had been wiped away. Her arms were tucked behind her back but Bill could see similar joint lines there, as well as across the exposed portions of her legs. Gloria's eyes blazed a bright, electrical blue as they tracked Bill's movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit Gloria, where are we?\" Bill said, looking around once more at their new environment and for Tammy, \"What happened to you? Where's Tammy? Did you see what happened to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Gloria gave no answer. The only movement on her body were those eyes that simply stared back at Bill, and though they were emotionless, Bill could fill something behind them. Anger maybe? Fear? Bill wondered why the robotic Vanapolous couldn't speak before he remembered his wish only moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Uh, Gloria, you have my permission to speak!\" He said, and breathed a sigh of relief as Gloria's body seemed to adopt a much more casual pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GL-OR1A unit #698 is currently experiencing a large amount of sensory feedback. Please wait while it undergoes a momentary maintenance cycle\" Gloria's voice was, outside of being precise and exceedingly formal, unchanged aside from a metallic, electrical hum. To Bill's surprise, the former human turned artificial life form suddenly went limp, the blue light in her eyes dimming to almost nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gloria!\" Bill cried out, placing a hand on the frozen form of his changed...well, he wasn't sure what Gloria was to him, but he was concerned nonetheless. Even with a shake, her inactive form did not move aside from a slight rattle of plastic and metal components jsotling in their positions. Gloria's skin was also barely warm. Not cold, but cooler than a human's and had a texture that made Bill shudder, as if it was like if someone had tried to apply the texture of human skin to the hard plastic of a mannequin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked by how...artificial Gloria felt (Bill had known she was a very artificial person but this was a level beyond what even the previous adventures with the Stone had prepared him for), Bill took a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TAMMY!\" Bill yelled, sprinting away from Gloria's frozen form as he searched behind a nearby column, darting behind the desk, looking in every nearby nook and cranny that he could reach, \"TAMMY, WHERE ARE YOU!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill, in his panic did not notice the flicker of light from far above as small slats slid away from the tops of the support columns and small camera lenses slid outwards. What he did notice was a large ball of multicolored lights appear in front of him and slowly assume human shape. Bill stumbled backwards in surprised, but blinked as the blob of light's shape become much more defined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clearly Tammy, the face gave it away. But much like Gloria, so much of Tammy's body had been...perfected. Gone was the cute chubbiness in her form, the girl next door looks. The casual clothes. The adorable dirty blonde hair. Instead this version of Tammy was thin and fit, her cream colored body wrapped in an almost retro looking white business dress that promoted her large breasts while styled blonde hair cascaded down her exposed back. Her face was stunningly pretty, clearly Tammy if she had been a supermodel, and done up with makeup that only increased her attractiveness. Her dress ended  slightly above her knees and showed off the almost unending length of her legs, ending in diamond studded, thick heeled sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please hold while your Tailored Autonomous Multitasking Intelligence exits hibernation. While you wait, did you know that this model is the latest in customizable holographic assistants from AhnCorp? AhnCorp, bringing the future, today!\" Tammy's face did not move from the soft smile it was in, but her voice seemed to come from the barely see-through hologram that made up her body.  Her voice sounded the same, but far more upbeat and chipper, almost like a commercial, and Bill had to struggle to pull his jaw closed as the hologram of his best friend turned wife turned girlfriend turned hologram blinked and began to move naturally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap, what happened!? Where are we? Who are you!?\" Tammy cried out, her disembodied voice taking on a much more recognizable tone as her photonic body began spinning around, taking in the changed environment and herself before pointing a flickering finger at Bill, who blinked in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tammy, it's me, Bill!\" He said, but Tammy merely shook her head in denial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Bill doesn't look like that, he isn't a...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"No, Bill doesn't look like that, he isn't a woman!\" Tammy's clearly projected voice said, jabbing a flickering finger down towards Bill's chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill followed Tammy's finger downward until finally his own non insubstantial breasts swelled into view. And suddenly, Bill was aware that the rest of his body was indeed changed. The former teenage boy turned woman brought the same hand he had touched Gloria with up to his eyes, seeing how slender and feminine it was, the shimmering of his longer nails from the lights floating above. that same hand felt his face, the changed shape of it, his puffier lips, perfectly smooth complexion, tugging on smooth, highly styled hair that was tied into some sort of pattern on top of his changed head. Bill's hands traveled down his apple-less throat, caressing the soft flesh of his new assets before venturing further down, traveling across the slightly sexualized business dress he now wore, feeling his hips and rear swelling out against the fabric of the skirt like they never had before, before sliding across perfectly smooth legs. It took Bill a moment to process where his feet were before he realized his new breasts were hiding them, and he twisted slightly to the side and felt his balance shift as he saw he was in a pair of black business heels. His arms were the last thing Bill inspected, they were bare up to the shoulder, clearly meaning to further advertise his new breasts, but he paused when he saw the marking on the underside of his left wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, in tiny print that he realized that he would have never been able to read before, was stamped:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">AhnCorp Biofake Model SB-11098</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath it was a string of numbers that meant nothing to Bill, followed by what was clearly a barcode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, bitch, where is my Bill! Who are you, and why can't I feel my body!?\" Tammy hissed, clearly impatient, her holographic form tapping it's foot against the marble floor in silence, \"You better not have done anything with him or I'll...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Tammy, it really is me, Bill! I used the Stone, I just wanted Gloria to shut up!\" Bill flashed the lifeless gemstone in front of Tammy's face before pointing his own slender finger at the frozen artificial form of Gloria, \"But something has gone really, really wrong!\" His voice was so...light and airy as Bill truly heard it. There was a very proper cadence to it, with a hint of a accent. British? Irish? Scottish? Whatever it was, like the rest of his body it was a far, far cry from anything Bill had experienced before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit...\" Tammy whispered, her avatar taking a few steps back as she took in the stone and Gloria's robotic form, \"But...what happened to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...think you're a hologram?\" Bill stammered, shrugging his newly female shoulders and for the first time, feeling the ripple of movement across his additional flesh. Why hadn't he felt all this before? Was something wrong with him? Did...the stone do something else to him besides making him a woman?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy's face looked horrified as she examined herself, \"This...This can't be happening. This cannot be happening! I don't want to be a thing! I'm a person!\" She cried out as simulated tears began to stream down her equally simulated face, \"Bill, you have to change us back! I want to be human again! I want to just be Tammy Ackerton!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill stared at the stone in his hand and noticed, for the first time, the large crack that ran down one side. Peering even more closely at the stone he could see tiny flecks of gold, either actual gold or gold light, trickling out from the center of the gemstone. Whatever it was, he had a really bad feeling about it. But Tammy was right, he had to try. Bill clenched his pretty little fist and closed his eyes, focusing on how messed up everything was, how it was all Gloria's fault, how he didn't deserve this...But no anger came. He knew he should be angry but he simply could not force himself to be. He opened his eyes and stared at the stone, and then at the troubling markings on his wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it because the stone was damaged...or was it because of something else? Something related to the markings? Bill shuddered  and looked away, back at Tammy who was wringing her holographic limbs in a clear state of near hysteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well!?\" She pleaded, and simply sank to the floor in a mass of colorful light with a sad moan. \"Why won't anyone let me be happy like I was? I loved being a mother! I loved being loved! I just want-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Tammy's existential angst was cut short as the sound of a door sliding open near the desk and the sharp click clakc of heels suddenly forced her to be silent as her form flickered out of existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tammy?\" Bill whispered, fear clear and present in his soft female voice, but as the sounds of the heels clicking became louder, Bill found himself straightening up on impulse, pushing his feelings of fear and confusion deeper within as he quickly walked over the Gloria's form and depressed a small LED button that was hidden at the base of her neck, her eyes lighting up once more as she and Bill assumed a very servantly posture as the owner of the heels came around the side of one of the columns. When he saw who it was, the inside of Bill's mind light up in alarm, but he could not force the rest of his body to react. He, outside of his normal breathing, seemed to be standing as perfectly still as Gloria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, making her way to the massive desk, was Willow, Bill's future child turned older sister turned...something that filled Bill with dread. Willow was dressed in a very expensive looking business suit, though clearly not designed to overly sexualize her. She seemed slightly older, maybe in her late twenties, possibly thirty as she rounded the side of the desk, which came alive as holograms flickered out from the lights beneath the raised edge of the desk, and a chair unfolded from somewhere on the far side of the desk, Willow immediately sitting in it and leaning back, a long sigh of annoyance escaping from her lips as she rubbed the bridge of her nose slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bliss\" Willow said, her voice sounding harder, colder, more commanding than Bill had ever heard it before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mistress?\" Bill said, stepping forward as, to his horror, his body seemed to respond all on it's own. Could he be...No, it couldn't be possible...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bliss, I need you to head down to Records and pull all the dataspheres relating to our artificial intelligence development. Take that Gloria unit with you, since apparently this concerns them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mistress. Can I help you with anything else at this time?\" Bill felt himself say, while noticing the slightest twitch from Gloria's fingers at the mention of 'them'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but when you get back, I'll need you to take some notes while I go over the Ingerman-Bolstrum incident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, mistress\" Came Bill's pleasant response, even though every part of his mind wanted to scream or just do something to prove his body, however changed, still belonged to him. But all he could do was perform a slight curtsy and tap Gloria on her shoulder, who immediately turned and followed Bill as he, under a power not his own, walked the length of Willow's massive office and through the equally massive doors at the far end. The whole length of the room he could feel...something looking at him, almost in desperation, but he, and Gloria, if she was truly in that shell, was obey. And all the while the overriding command seemed to float at the front of his consciousness:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Travel to Records with GL-OR1A #698 unit. Go to Records and retrieve all the dataspheres on AhnCorp's artificial intelligence development. Upon return, take notes for Mistress Willow regarding the Ingerman-Bolstrum Incident and comply with any other orders. </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door closed, Bill could, with apparently far superior hearing than he had ever had before, heard Willow call out for Tammy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Bill and Gloria somehow break free of their orders and realize the only way out of this reality is to fix the Anh'Ger Stone. They hatch a plan to escape into the building, but despite Gloria's protests, Bill refuses to leave without first rescuing Tammy from Willow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Bill and Gloria learn as much about this new reality as they can as they traverse the unfamiliar building with frightening ease, currently unable to break free of their orders. Bill and Gloria are only able to communicate with each other as Bliss and GL-0R1A #698, much to their frustration as they try to figure out a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Bill, Tammy and Gloria are built to obey humans. Bill eventually succumbs to being Bliss, Willow's personal Biofake assistant, while Gloria vanishes among the rest of the robodroids, nothing more than expendable property, and Tammy is eventually uninstalled and deleted as a newer program is created to replace her. The Ahn'Ger Stone eventually vanishes just as mysteriously as it appeared in a world that no longer exists.</span></div></div>",

In the heat of the moment Bill had no idea that the artifact in his hand was damaged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his wish, the power coursing through the stone was not released safely or in a way that obeyed the rules that bound the stone to it's purpose.

Instead, the Stone releases the magical energy the wave of light affecting everything and changing it in an attempt to match Bill's wish. The world is relatively unchanged, though Bill, Tammy, Gloria and Willow now find themselves standing in a sunny Californian beach house. Gloria has become a stereotypical airheaded bimbo in a g-string while Tammy has become a platinum blonde. Bill receives a similar treatment, becoming a knockout redhead in a string bikini. Bill and Tammy begin to find it hard to concentrate while Gloria chatters mindlessly, overcome by the changes. Willow is now a male lifeguard unrelated to BIll, and remembers nothing other than being Will, a professional lifeguard more concerned with getting women than saving lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: \"That you'd know what Tom has been through!\" Due to the unseen damage, the Ahn'Ger Stone is unable to exclusively target Gloria and fufill Bill's wish, forcing Gloria to realize the error of her ways and the pain and suffering she had inflicted on Tom/Tammy. Instead, the Stone releases the magical energy in random directions, affecting everything in it's path. In this reality, Gloria is now Gene Ackerton, the long suffering on/off again boyfriend of Tamara Vanapolous, leader of the high school's popular clique. Bill finds himself transformed into Brianna, a sophomore girl apparently desperate for Tamara's approval, becoming one of her lackey's in the quest to make Gene miserable. Willow, still the big sister becomes a high school drop out, choosing the punk life over grades, becoming Gene's unlikely best friend (and harboring a secret, forbidden crush on Tamara).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Bill makes a different wish.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I wish that you'd know what Tom has been through!\" Bill roared, and in a blinding gold-green instant, the entire world seemed to invert. Bill felt himself falling, growing weaker, lighter before suddenly he landed with a muted FWOOMPH on something very soft as reality appeared to re-assert itself. The first thing that swirled into Bill's vision was the familiar pink paint of his bedroom, the Trevor Timberlee posters on the wall, the cute plushies that he no longer needed for anything other than cute decoration, the pristine cheerleader uniform hanging from the back of the closet door. The large bed that he now laid upon. Pulling himself upright, Bill rubbed his eyes and for a moment, felt something important slip from his thoughts. But what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking through the momentary blurriness, everything seemed normal, but Brianna could tell that something had changed, something BIG. She opened her small hand and stared at the gemstone, wincing slightly as she realized how tightly she had been squeezing the stone. Her blue eyes went wide as she saw the deep crack that cut through once side of the stone, almost all the way to the gold core, which itself seemed to lack the luster that it had only moments ago before Brianna had made her wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what did I wish for?\" The sixteen year old whispered to herself as she gently rolled the stone around in her palm, realizing that it looked much larger now than she remembered it being. She curled her fingers around the artifact and saw that she could just barely cover it. But that was to be expected, though; Brianna was small and rather petite (though her breasts certainly kept her from being a stick), making her the perfect size for the complex launching routines the cheerleading squad performed. Even though she felt insecure about it, next to some of the taller girls...But as much as everything felt right, felt normal, the unknowingly changed teen just had a feeling that something was wrong. She furrowed her brow as she sat on the edge of her bed and tried to remember what she had wished for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFragments, flashes of what had been before surfaced, but they were still vague and blurry. They almost felt like a vivid dream, thirty minutes after waking up, where other stimulus began to push it away. But these remained, which for Brianna, meant they were real. She remembered finding the rock on the front porch, being older, a boy, three girls? She knew that at least one of them was her high school idol, Tamara Vanapolous, but the others were too vague to make out. She remembered being angry at someone and making a wish, but then what? A pout formed on Brianna's pretty face as she struggled to remember the details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her pondering was cut short as her cellphone lit up on the nightstand next to the bed, it's ringtone blaring out a digitized version of her pop idol crush, Trevor Timberlee, latest hot single. A well ingrained habit pushed Brianna into autopilot as she leaned over and grabbed the purple (a color she was starting to prefer over pink)  encased phone, her face lighting up as she saw who was calling. She immediately pushed the thoughts from her mind and swiped to answer. She still felt something was off, but this was SOOOO much more important right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasn't it? Brianna Strasserman shook off the distracting thoughts as best she could and focused on the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Tamara! I was just thinking of calling you!\" Brianna said, trying not to gush too much. Tamara was her cheerleading idol, her mentor in all things girly and popular at school. Brianna was convinced that the Senior was grooming her after Tamara graduated next month. They spent so much time together, it was impossible that it couldn't be it, right? Sure, the Bolstrum girl was next in line for cheer captain but she was so moody all the time! And smoke and hung out with Big Jon when she thought no one was looking. Those little tidbits of gossip were Brianna's secret ammo against the current Junior upperclassman. Another useful strategy Tamara had taught her; always be willing to use information to get the things she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Bri!\" Tamara's voice said, floating through the speaker of the younger girl's phone, \"I'm coming around the block! Get your butt downstairs, I want to get to school before it rains!\" Tamara's voice sounded joyful, happy, but Brianna knew that the Vanapolous girl expected her every order to be followed to the letter. To disobey was...problematic. There was a reason she was known as Terrible Tammy by those unfortunate enough to earn her wrath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be waiting! We're still having practice after school, right?\" Brianna's eyes flickered towards her uniform, one of her most prized possessions, still hanging from the closet door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Hurry up, I can see your house!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! See you soon!\" Brianna said, ending the phone call, jumping up and racing across her room to grab her uniform, as well as her backpack that was hanging from her makeup station chair. She paused for just a moment, staring down at the stone in her hand and feeling the intense need to know more about what happened, but she couldn't let her friend/mentor/boss down and school was no doubt going to be busy. She could figure it out when she got home tonight. Brianna set the gemstone on top of her makeup station and hustled out the door as quick as her legs could carry her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Thank god whatever I wished didn't make me naked, I'd never have enough time!' She said to herself as she barreled out of her bedroom and bounced down the stairs, her breasts bouncing a little painfully beneath the cute top she wore. As she reached the bottom of the stairs she squealed in horror as a figure came out of the living room entrance and Brianna had to put her gymnastics to use to dodge the larger, lanky form of her big sister, Willow. A flash of white and pink glided by the dark blues and blacks at the bottom of the Strasserman household.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will! Watch out!\" Brianna fumed as she found her footing on the other side of the larger girl. Willow was always like that, getting in the way. And the younger Strasserman wrinkled her nose and took a few steps back from her big sister, \"You better not let mom and dad smell you, you know how they feel about pot in the house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow snorted and rolled her eyes, \"Good morning to you too, Short Fry\", grinning as Brianna bristled under the insult but then frowning. Why couldn't she remember the last few minutes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T CALL ME THAT!\" Brianna screamed before stomping out the door right as Tamara's red convertible pulled up across the quiet suburban street. Willow watched her younger sister with a mixture of confusion and concern as she crossed the street, and tried to not acknowledge the strange feeling that appeared when she saw Tamara's glorious golden maned head and perfect white teeth behind the expertly applied lipstick, even as the convertible quickly pulled away down the street towards the high school that Willow had dropped out of years ago to pursue...something. Was it music? Art? Willow knew it was something but the fog in her head blotted it out for the moment. Willow simply shrugged it off and walked up the stairs and into her room, where she recalled being only a moment ago...But that was impossible, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow's room was a bit of a mess. Her bed was in a state of perpetual unmadeness, album covers and brooding art posters of everything from dark fantasy to iconistic art design covering the light blue walls. Black out curtain hung limply across the closed blinds of the windows, providing just enough light that Willow didn't have to turn on a light, which Willow...preferred? She couldn't remember as she closed the bedroom door. The clothes from previous days lay strewn in piles here and there across the floor, and she quickly pulled her current clothes off and dumped them in their own pile as she crossed the floor to her bed, flopping down on it in her black bra and panties as she reached for her own phone, charging on her own nightstand. Taking one last look at the piles of clothing and making a mental note to do a load of laundry later, Willow turned her attention to her phone. There were the usual texts, her other drop out friends wanting to get together again tonight, pictures of what looked to be a hella great party, the usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then there was the stand alone that drew her attention. It wasn't much, but they never were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Sent From Gene, 7:32am: Hey. You up?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Gene Ackerton, one of Willow's more recent, but quickly growing in importance, friends. He was a good kid, younger than her. He was starting to run in her circle of friends, having been chased out of his own by Tamara Vanapolous, who was his on again, off again girlfriend. He was interested in her, but Willow had made it clear that she just didn't swing that way, but Gene had taken it well. Instead she just found herself becoming a rock for someone that was clearly not in a good place, being there to talk, and to give him a ride to school, which was probably what he was texting her about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Sent From Willow, 7:41am: Lol, haven't been to sleep yet :P</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow leaned back and waited for his response. It'd been almost ten minutes, chances are the poor guy had already taken off walking. Oh well, maybe she could toss her clothes back on and run out. In the silence as she waited though, now that she was the only one in the house as everyone else had gone out to start the day, the worrying feeling that something was wrong began to creep back into Willow's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe it's just the weed' She thought to herself as her phone beeped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Sent From Gene, 7:43am: Heh. Well if you're feeling like it, I could use a ride? I'm about halfway there and it looks like it's about to rain...</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow sighed. She couldn't say no to the kid, even if she was entirely weirded out right now. Maybe even because she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Sent From Willow, 7:44am: No problem!</span></span></div></div>",

Her face was too small to be seen from this distance but Bill was certain from the low shrill sound that she was screaming in sheer terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh\" Bill chuckled to himself as he took a step towards Gloria's form, careful not to step on the horrible teenage diva, but close enough and with enough force that his footfall caused the shrunken Vanapolous to tumble backwards from the impact. Bill's face broke into a toothy smile as he crouched down to stare at Gloria, who simply froze under his gaze. From this close vantage point Bill could see Gloria's face clear as day, the slight red spot where he had slapped her, now nothing more than a deep pink dot, and the expertly applied makeup, and the trails left in it as tears flowed out of Gloria's eyes. Bill felt the sudden urge to pick her up and extended a hand, which must have appeared the be the size of a building to the shrunken girl, who simply screamed again in her tiny little voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tammy!\" Bill said, and Gloria's miniscule hands shot up over her ears as her tiny face scrunched tight in pain, \"Come here, you've got to see this!\" The teenager was thrilled to see what his best friend turned wife turned...whatever Tammy was to him would say about the three inch tall Gloria; after all, this tiny, cowering little person in front of him had tortured Tom for years now. But when the expected response never came, Bill looked up, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, in the spot where Tammy had been standing in the hallway, was a tiny woman frantically waving her arms in the air at Bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, Tammy?\" Bill said, his excitement vanishing entirely to a suddenly rising wave of fear and concern. He gave the tiny Gloria, who was currently flipping him the bird, one last look before leaning back on his knees and taking a few half-crawls towards Tammy's frantic form, the kinetic force of his legs moving sending both girls toppling over once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" Bill said as he crouched towards Tammy, and the small girl covered her ears much like Gloria had and giving him a pained, annoyed look. Bill gave his tiny friend an apologetic shrug and slowly stretched out his right hand toward Tammy, who eyed it cautiously as Bill lowered it to the carpeted floor in front of her. Bill watched in amazement as Tammy, like a skittish cat, slowly reached out and touched his skin; she was so tiny her touch barely registered. With another look up at his clearly gargantuan face, Tammy put both of her tiny hands on Bill's own and pulled herself into his open palm, moving to the direct center and sitting cross legged, staring up at him with big blue eyes as he brought his girlfriend closer to his face, trying not to move his hand too fast lest she be swept off to a swift end by the momentum. Now that they seemed to be close enough for communication and BIll had ceased moving, Tammy stood and looked Bill directly in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\"Bill, what did you do!?\"</font> Tammy said, her voice tiny even though it was clear to BIll she was yelling as loud as she could, <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\"Why did I change!?\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I don't know!\" Bill said careful to keep his voice soft and low, and suddenly he felt compelled to look at the Ahn'Ger Stone. He brought his left had up even with his right and opened it, revealing the lifeless green stone in his palm. That was when he heard a barely audible gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\"Bill!\" </font>Tammy said, he tiny eyes wide, <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\"It's broken!\"</font> Tammy made her way as fast as she could across Bill's palm, heading towards his left hand, which he brought in closer, setting it next to his right hand so that Tammy could cross over and join the Stone. Even next to the small gemstone, Tammy looked incredibly small, and Bill watched as she moved her hands across the surface of the magical artifact, tracing the length of the massive crack that had spread from nearly one end of the stone to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\"That must be why the wish changed me also!\"</font> Tammy said, looked up at Bill as the color drained out of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if the stone is broken, if breaking it made the wish go bad...How do we fix it? How do we change you back?\" Bill said, and Tammy simply stared at him, at a loss for words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly BIll's phone began ringing, causing the teenager to jump in surprise and almost send Tammy toppling off his hand and to the floor below before Bill raised his other hand to keep the tiny teenager from plummeting to her death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\"Bill! Be careful with me!\" </font>Tammy screamed in anger, her voice straining to be heard above the shrill sound of Bill's ringtone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" Bill said, and after a moment of being at a loss, he simply sat Tammy and the stone on the carpet before sliding his hand into his pocket and pulling out his cellphone, where the name 'Willow\" and a picture of his future daughter turned big sister was plastered on the screen. Suddenly filled with dread, Bill tapped the phone and held it up to his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bill! Oh my god! Something happened! I'm in the car but I'm tiny!\" Came Willows voice, clear as day and on the verge of hysterics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh no' Bill thought to himself, looking down at Tammy and the Stone, and blinking as Gloria's tiny form staggered into his field of vision, the shrunken Vanapolous bent over and wheezing from exertion; clearly not wanting to be left out of the loop Gloria had run the short yet massive distance to join Tammy next to the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bill, help me! Call mom and dad! Or 911! Come get me!\" Willow cried out over the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, right. Yes I will, I'll come get you! Be right there, bye!\" Bill said, and despite Willow's frantic cries to not hang up, Bill ended the call out of habit and slid the the phone back into his pocket before looking down at the little women in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, Willow got shrunk as well\" He said, and he watched as Tammy's jaw went slack as Gloria simply laid on the floor, still panting and clearly beyond caring. \"She's trapped in the car, I'm gonna go get her and bring her back inside. But I can't leave you guys here so...\" Bill trailed off, ignoring the almost furious ringing of his phone as he extended another hand out towards the girls while his left hand plucked the Stone up once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy nodded, and then rolled her eyes as Gloria simply flinched and curled up into the fetal position as Bills giant hand descended towards her. Bill could see Tammy's mouth moving but he couldn't hear what she was saying, and found himself staring in surprise as Gloria's former boyfriend marched over, pulled the tiny Vanapolous up to her feet, and marched her towards Bill's palm before forcing her onto the fleshy elevator. Tammy looked at Bill as Gloria attempted to make herself into a even smaller ball in the center of Bill's hand, and pointed upwards with her index finger before quickly sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill, despite the insanity of the morning, couldn't help but chuckle, and with the two women in his hand, he slowly stood up and made his way carefully down the stairs, each step causing Tammy and Gloria's hair to rise and fall. Despite his concern Bill couldn't help but marvel at how physics now worked for the two girls, even the slightest movements affected them wildly. When he reached the bottom of the stairs, his cellphone still blaring loudly through the empty house, Bill made a short detour into the kitchen and to the table where he deposited Tammy and Gloria onto the soft cotton of the decorative doily in the middle of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right back!\" Bill said, and quickly dashed towards the garage door, going through it to see Willow's car, still running but no one sitting in the driver's seat. He made his way to the driver side door and, praying that it wasn't locked, pulled the handle, the door popping open with a soft clunk. There, at the back of the seat, tiny cellphone plastered to her ear and tears making her tiny face soaked, was Willow..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god Willow, I'm sorry!\" Bill said, keeping his voice quiet as he reached in and turned the ignition off. Willow screamed...something, but Bill couldn't make it out. Instead, he crouched down once more and got close to Willow, who simply recoiled from her father turned big brother in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Willow...I, uh, think I know what happened. IT happened to Tammy and Gloria too. I've got them in the kitchen, so I'm gonna pick you up and take you to them, ok?\" Bill said softly, holding out his empty hand to the small woman, who nodded warily and after a few moments of hesitation, climbed up into Bill's palm. Sheltering his sister as best as he could, Bill rose, shut the car door, and made his way back to the kitchen where Tammy and Gloria were waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the kitchen door, he saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bill felt horrible as he tried to not to get overwhelmed by the tiny woman in his hands. In just the span of twenty minutes, he'd gone through several different versions of reality, and now the one thing that had changed everything was now broken and potentially even more dangerous to even use! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, Willow, I'm sorry\" Bill said, glancing down at his future daughter turned older sibling, who was too busy freaking out to really notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill opened the door from the garage into the kitchen and made a bee line for the table, setting Willow down as carefully as he could before looking around for Tammy and Gloria, seeing nothing but a empty table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tammy? Gloria?\" Bill said in a sudden panic as he looked down at the floor, the reality that the two had fallen to a messy death a terrifying possibility, only to hear a deep chuckle that was more like a grunt. Bill spun on his heel at the sound and a electric current of shock and alarm traveled down his spine at the source of the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, standing by the basement door and holding Tammy and Gloria in one hand, was the walking mass of muscle that called itself Rob Bolstrum. The former head bully of Shermer High, now a disgraced lackey under the thumb of the new head bully, Jon Ingerman, was roughly stroking the heads of the two girls with his free index finger, the girls clearly screaming in fear and pain from being held in his vice-like grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just the little shit I was looking for. Hello, Strasserman\" Rob growled, taking a step forward and causing Bill to take a step back, stepping in front of the tiny form of Willow, who was currently screaming from the top of the table. \"Love the dolls, always knew you were a weird faggot\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what the hell do you want, Bolstrum!?\" Bill said as the shock wore off and the hateful adrenaline kicked in, \"What the fuck are you doing in my house!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob smiled, his thick piggish lips parting to reveal a full set of yellowed teeth and a cloud of foul breath that made Tammy and Gloria visibly gag. the bully eyed the two shrunken girls one last time before he leaned against the counter top of the kitchen's island, dropping Tammy and Gloria into the empty sink with almost an afterthought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been waiting for you, Strasserman. Big Jon sent me, he says it's fucking judgement day for you\" Rob's voice was the typical growl that Bill was more than familiar with. But before Bill could raise his fists, Rob broke out into a rumbling laugh that BIll felt just as much as he heard. On the table and in the sink, Willow, Tammy and Gloria all clutched at their ears in pain as the giant above them guffawed, ignorant of their pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, Shitterman!\" Rob said as he reined his laughter in, a handful of final chuckles fading away like thunder in the distance, \"I'm not going to do anything! I'm here to help us solve a...mutual problem\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill refused to drop his guard as he kept his eyes locked on Bolstrum. He had learned, from experience, that you never took your eyes off your attacker. \"So, what do you want then?\" Bill sneered, feeling his fists tighten further. He had to get Tammy, WIllow and Gloria away from Rob. He'd kill them on accident, or worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you, but you have to tell me how you got these\" bolstrum said, pointing a finger down into the sink, \"I knew you and Ackerton were geeks, but this is impossible! How'd you get Titsapolous and Ackerton together and how'd you make then small? Tell me, and I'll tell you why I'm here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill simply glared at Rob before the bully rolled his eyes and stuck a finger down into the sink that contained Tammy and Gloria and gave it a flick, a small thud echoing off the far side of the basin as one of the girls, Bill couldn't tell which, was flung by Rob's cruel action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or I can sit here and play with my new toys. Either way, I'm not going anywhere\" Rob sounded bored but the look in his eyes was anything but. He made to attack the girls again, spurring Bill into action.</span></div></div>",

The TV was on, but silent, apparently whoever Bill's new parents were, they still preferred to watch the morning news in silence with the closed captioning on, and, much like his original mom and ad, still forgot to turn it off when they left for the day. Bill paid it no mind as he gently lowered his hand to the table and let Willow slide off onto the soft cotton that had served as soft landing for Tammy and Gloria, watching as his daughter from the future turned big sister in the present stumbled over to Tammy and Gloria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's all three of you. I'm really sorry, guys!\" Bill said apologetically, but then raised an eyebrow in confusion as Tammy and Gloria didn't bother to respond as Willow began trying to get their attention herself. \"Guys?\" Bill asked again, and after Willow touched her shoulder Tammy turned to face her, pointing a slender, small arm towards the television, her face white as a ghost. Bill turned his head to follow Tammy's arm and his eyes locked with the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, the words 'BREAKING NEWS' was plastered at the top of the TV screen, while a large block of rapid fire captioning took up most of the screen. Bill blinked for a moment, trying to read it all, but after a moment he simply reached for the remote on the kitchen counter and turned the closed captioning off and un-muting the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-gain for those of you just joining us, there has been a worldwide event of unknown origin as women across the United States of America and other countries have suddenly been reduced to three inches in size\" The older anchor's voice was steady, but there was a hint of panic in it, \"Here is live footage from our own station just moments ago as my co-anchor, Tessa McKnight was affected\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The video feed suddenly cut to a shot of the two anchors sitting at the desk chatting, clearly during a commercial break when suddenly green light from an unknown source tinted the camera feed as Tessa quickly began to shrink, losing foot upon foot of her height within seconds until she vanished below the lip of the desk, the male anchor jumping up from his seat as shouts the sounds of men yelling from off camera are heard.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is, unfortunately, not localized to our station. Here is more footage of this strange and unknown event happening at several of our affiliate stations\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Video from different television stations begin to play, many of them news broadcasts, but several of them early morning talk shows as all females visible begin shrinking to three inches tall within moments of the Ahn'Ger Stone's light appearing.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We also have footage being sent in from elsewhere in the world as this phenomenon has sent the entire human race into a moment of chaos\"<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nMore footage, this time from cellphones in New York, London, Germany, Canada, Mexico, even South Africa and China as women immediately shrink in size as cars and buses suddenly veer across roadways and streets.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And unfortunately we do have to announce that we do have confirmed reports of multiple fatalities as out of control vehicles claim lives as their occupants were affected by the same mysterious light.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The trio of Tammy, Gloria, and Willow watched from the middle of the Strasserman family dinner table as Bill's face grew increasingly more horrified. Staring at the magical gemstone in his hand,and then back at the TV, hearing the talking heads on the news describe the hundreds of deaths(And counting) his wish had caused, he grew sick to his stomach. He began breathing heavily. He started to tremble, guilt ridden by the cataclysmic butterfly effect his wish had created. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBill, are you OK honey?\u201d he thought he heard one of the miniature voices scream, but he didn't respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis trio of friends and family watched as he clumsily stumbled backward, a hand reaching out for a chair as he grew lightheaded, just before fainting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God!\u201d screamed Willow and  Tammy, covering their ears, the collapse of Bill's  body to the floor creating a thunderingly loud sound effect to the three inch high women. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow and Tammy immediately sprinted to the edge of the table, Willow throwing off her now useless heels, both girls frustrated by the inconvenience of their new size. Gloria stayed behind and retreated back into her fetal position before forcefully shutting her eyes. She told herself that this was only a bad dream and that she was going to wake up from it very soon, rocking herself into her mental happy place. She prayed that a fly didn't pick her up and transport her away somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former mother and daughter team meanwhile were peering over the table at Bill's unconscious  face, a face betraying a young man overwhelmed by the power of the artifact he still gripped tightly in his right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe's bleeding from the forehead\u201d announced Tammy rather obviously to Willow, pointing towards the big gash near the top of Bill's forehead, an injury he sustained when his head hit one of the dinner table's four sharp corners.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy God, is he dead?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't think so. He's still breathing. I think he just knocked himself out cold\u201d Tammy continued before lamenting. \u201cOh my God, my poor Bill. We have to try and wake...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's going on?!\u201d screeched Willow, interrupting the geeky blonde in a cracked up hysterical tone, her teary-eyed, snot filled, terrified voice quivering with confusion. \u201cWhy are you so calm, Tammy?!\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomebody has to be!\u201d yelled Tammy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what happened? Why are you acting like this isn't the most insane thing ever? Half of the human race just shrunk down like Ant-Man or seomthing, and you seem perfectly OK with it! Didn't you see that green light?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did see it. There's...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy saw that Willow was starting to breath heavily herself like Bill had, so she immediately stopped talking and instead tried to comfort Willow by hugging her tightly, stroking Willow's hair and waiting for her to calm down. Tammy's residual memories of being Willow's mother in the previous reality suddenly came into focus. She recalled Willow as a little girl and as a teenager. Willow Strasserman had largely a happy child, but the few times she hadn't been, she had cried in her parents warm embrace, and those sad moments were burned into Tammy's recollection. Tammy had known exactly what to do and what to say to make Willow feel loved and safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's going to be OK, Wills. I can explain what's going on. But it's going to sound absolutely bug fuck crazy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two let each other go, Willow feeling much better, having the impression that Tammy was levelheaded and a good person to have with you in a crisis like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt can't be any crazier than being three inches tall. We're insect bait.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy laughed a little at the joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't be so dark. Now listen very carefully. This morning, Bill found a gemstone sitting on your family's front porch...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy gave Willow an edited version of events as she understood it, leaving out the parts where she was originally a depressed young man by the name of Tom and that she had briefly been her mother, instead giving a fictitious but equally outrageous story about how the Ahn'Ger Stone had made Bill, Tammy, and Gloria swap bodies with one another before Bill had figured out the right turn of phrase to swap them back. Willow's surprised looking face implied that she had bought into the half-truth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously? That thing in Bill's hand caused all this?\u201d the twenty year old asked, pointing downward at Bill's body. His right hand was clenched, but the glittering green artifact was clearly visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy shook her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did the thing on our porch to begin with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know. It just did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like the sound of that. So...so all we have to do is get down there and fix this. We need to just be touching the stone and wish everything back to normal, like the magic lamp in <i>Aladdin</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasier said than done\u201d said Tammy. \u201cThis might just be a regular old dinner table, but at our size, we may as well be standing on top of Mount Everest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Tammy and Willow discuss ways of getting down to Bill and reach the Ahn'Ger Stone. Meanwhile, an opportunistic looter notices that the Strasserman's front door is open and lets himself inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Gloria's fear is realized as the trio are set upon by a member of the animal kingdom.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tammy and Willow stared down at Bill's colossal (and unconscious) form on the floor of the Strasserman kitchen. Tammy still couldn't believe how small she was now and how big the world was, especially with the memories of being the 6'3 Tom still lingering in her mind. That had been one of the first sensations when the Stone had...changed? Fixed? Whatever it could be catagorized as being almost half Tom's original size had been disorienting. And now? Now she was smaller than ever! And she was going to stay small forever if they didn't get to that magical rock. She tossed a quick look at Willow and felt a ping of sadness at how different the girl that had once been her daughter looked but the miniature Ackerton still felt a motherly bond to the curly haired girl. She had to take charge and figure out a way to get to that rock!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" Tammy said as she carefully peered over the edge of the table, \"We can't stick around here and wait. Bill needs help and we need to get big before something happens to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what, Tammy?\" Willow's voice was wavering on the edge of hysterics. The now elder Strasserman was holding it together, but just barely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy gave her former daughter a re-assuring squeeze on the shoulder. \"Don't worry. We'll figure out...something. There's got to be a way down somehow...\" Tammy gave Willow a small smile and carefully made her way to the very edge of the table, being careful as the thick tablecloth beneath her feet made walking a little difficult. And then Tammy gazed out upon the sheer drop to the kitchen tiles and her stomach filled with butterflies. The Everest comparison she'd made moments ago seemed less fitting now. Instead the image of an oceanic drop-off came to mind, a memory from a future honeymoon where she and Bill had gone scuba diving in Australia and the strange terror seeing the ocean floor drop away to...nothing. And abyss. Even though she could clearly see the floor below in this situation, the thalassophobia still crept into the back of her mind and made her shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're...We can't jump, Tammy!\" Willow said  from behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, honey. I just need to get a good look at what we're dealing with, okay?\" The short blonde replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's with that? All that 'honey' stuff? You've never called me that before today, Tammy. It's really weird for someone five years younger than me to be calling me that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief moment Tammy was afraid of a unpleasant conversation. If Willow somehow pieced it together, now that she knew about the magic gemstone and all this insanity happening...She had to act more like the teenager Willow knew instead of like a mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Oh, sorry, Willow. I'm just, I mean we're three inches tall? I'm allowed to be a little weird, okay?\" Tammy said, deflecting the question as she pointed to the nearby skyscraper that was one of the table's chairs. \"And that means we're too small to climb down those. You got anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what about grabbing the end of the tablecloth and letting it drop us down?\" Willow said, giving the dry, thick cushion of fabric a soft stomp, \"That might work...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy shook her head. \"No, there's nothing up here except for the plastic fruit bowl. With all three of us it'd fly right off and we'd break our necks\" Tammy said with a sigh, turning to face Willow again and pointing to the building sized bowl of fruit that Gloria was currently huddled against, tiny head buried in her knees. Tammy felt her eyes narrow as darker thoughts entered her mind. 'Serves you right, Gloria. Now you get to feel what it's like to be vulnerable to the world and like you're nothing'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore evil thoughts entered Tammy's mind. About leaving Gloria that size, if they somehow managed to get back to normal. And maybe make everyone forget about her...Tammy wasn't sure if it was her thinking or the residual memories of being Tom, but either way, she was enjoying the mental image of an inch tall Gloria having to survive like that old film 'The Borrowers'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tammy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow's reedy voice cut through the dark cloud in Tammy's brain and forced her back into reality. The tiny short blonde looked at the tiny tall girl blankly for a moment before the haze dissipated. No, she couldn't do that to Gloria, not even after all the shit the drama queen had put Tom through...That was a different life, and she was a better person now. And that meant finding a way down and being the hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry I was just...thinking on how to get down\" Tammy said with a smile that felt about as fake as it probably looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, because you totally weren't shooting daggers at her\" Willow said, tossing a thumb towards Gloria, who was now peering over her knees at them with big watery red eyes. \"Listen, Bill loves you Tammy, you don't have to worry about him cheating on you. Especially with Gloria. I don't know why she was here this morning but I can promise you, she's not having an affair with Bill!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Tammy wasn't listening. Instead a lightbulb had turned on in her mind as she started walking towards Gloria and the fruit bowl. Maybe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you listening to me?\" Willow said, jogging over to the girl that had previously made oup half of her genetic code.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Willow, I think I might have just found a way down!\" Tammy said, pointing up at the plastic fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Tammy has found a plastic fruit that has a hole large enough for them to fit into. Using the piece of fruit as transport, Tammy thinks that they could survive the trip down to the kitchen floor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Tammy wants to somehow toss the fruit off the table and try to wake Bill up!</span></div></div>",

Look at the peach! Look at what's under the leaf! If we can get in there, we can use it to get us down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there, almost invisible had it not been for the last remnants of sun poking through dark rainclouds, was a hole that looked big enough for the girls to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I see it! But how are we gonna get it out of the bowl? We're not...\" Willow took a moment to look at herself and swallow the sudden panic entering her mind again, \"We not big enough to get in the bowl, Tammy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy looked up at the rim of the brown wooden bowl, suddenly thankful for the fact that whoever Bill's new parents were, they had the taste (or maybe lack of taste) to put the cliche decorative piece on the table. The rim hung over her, and she, now being the shortest of the group, had no chance of reaching it but maybe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Willow, do you think you can put me on your shoulders? I might be able to reach it!\" Tammy couldn't help but give a sad chuckle at the absurd irony of it, memories of carrying a baby Willow around on her own shoulders fresh in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..guess? I've never done that before though. Would you be ta-\" Willow saw the frown forming on Tammy's face and silenced herself before she insulted her friend. In her mind, she'd always found it really funny how Bill found one of the shortest women she knew to hook up with. But now it seemed like her brother's fun-sized blonde wasn't going to be much help other than giving ideas. And she knew that sometimes Tammy could be...sensitive about her height, which was part of the reason it was so strange that Tammy was taking the current situation so well. \"Uh, I mean, what do we do once we get in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we get it out of the bowl and get in, I think we might be able to force it to roll! We use the chair on the way down to keep us slow and the peach to protect us! Then we just climb out, go get the Stone and make ourselves big again! Then we can help Bill!\" Tammy's face brightened again, but Willow could see some red on her cheeks. But the smile faded as soon as a sniffling cruel voice cut into the planning session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're fucking insane, Tom\" Gloria chuckled bitterly as she slowly rose to her feet. Now that the hysteria had passed, the teen diva was starting to think a little more clearly. She shrugged off the glare Tammy gave her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom? Who is Tom?\" Willow asked, confused and somewhat alarmed at the look on Gloria's face. It was the look Tammy had just a few minutes ago only made worse through a mask of smeared makeup. Gloria shot her a look but quickly turned back to Tammy, whose face was turning red and tiny hands balling into fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean look at you! You're short! You're the shortest person I've ever seen outside of TV! How's the weather down there, short fry?\" Gloria hissed as she closed in on Tammy, standing almost a full head higher over the blonde. \"If you were still my man, if you'd just listened to me, we wouldn't even be here! WE could be at school and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP!\" Tammy screamed, a tiny fist rocketing into Gloria's gut, knocking the taller girl over and causing her to wheeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU DON'T GET TO SPEAK! NOT NOW, NOT EVER! YOU'RE THE REASON ALL OF THIS HAS HAPPENED! NOW EITHER HELP US OR SHUT UP!\" Tammy's screamed, her voice cracking as it reached the highest octaves it could manage. LArge, hot sweaty tears boiled along the rim of her eyes and she ran a arm across her face, wiping them away with a choked sniffle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh ahh heh he ahh heh\" Gloria wheezed as air flowed back into her lungs. \"S-still a big cry-crybaby! Ma-maybe you-ahh-deserve to be like th-this! H-ah!\" The raven haired beauty did an un-ladylike spit of mico phlegm onto the tablecloth as she pushed herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't..Don't make me hit you again Gloria. Just because I can now doesn't mean I want to\" Tammy lied through gritted teeth. Some part of her burned with a fury that overrode her patience, her reason. There was a part of her that very much wanted to throw Gloria over the side of the table and just finish it. Suddenly those thoughts of leaving her small for eternity didn't seem all that bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's just what you want to be, h-huh? A woman beater? You can go join Ingerman and the rest of the no life fucks! I'm sure they'd be glad to have you around! Get yourself a real man, not like half-a-fag laying on the floor there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUCK YOU GLORIA!\" Tammy screamed as the last of her reason crumpled before the tidal wave of rage. She launched her small body at the cheerleader before suddenly she felt herself being pushed back. Tammy turned her hate-filled blue eyes upwards and saw the terrified face of her former daughter staring back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TAMMY! STOP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately the rage receded back to it's place at the back of her mind. She had almost, she had, all in front of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god\" Tammy whispered to herself as the blood drained from her face. The memories of her past life, of teaching Willow to be a good person, always do the right thing and be kind, to turn the other cheek and be the better person, they all came rolling back. \"I-I'm sorry honey! I just, she you, your father-\" Tammy's hands shot to her mouth as she realized what she was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't now what any of this is about, but as of right now I'm telling you both to end it, okay? I have plenty of questions but can we just focus on being big again, please?\" Willow tried her best to sound authoritative, to hide the anxiety attack that was just waiting to be acknolwedged. Tons of thoughts were floating around in her head, none of them good, but even as her breath became shallower she focused on the plan. They were small, they were trapped, and this was their only option. But her show of force seemed to work as the two girls back away from each other, Gloria with a hateful little smirk on her face and Tammy, tears freely flowing, hands still over her mouth as she stared at Willow as if she'd shot a dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, whatever works' Willow thought to herself as she closed her eyes and took as a deep a breath as she could manage before looking over to Gloria. \"Gloria, you're about as tall as me. Will you help us get into the bowl? Onece you're up you can pull Tammy up, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This plan is still fucking nuts..\" Gloria said, and it looked like she was about to say something else when Willow cleared her throat and fixed Gloria with her best 'don't you even try it' look. The messy shrunken teen paused and then let loose one final cough. \"Fine, whatever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay with that, Tammy?\" Willow asked, softening her gaze as it turned to the girl that she didn't remember being her mother. The look on Tammy's face was still shock an shame, but it looked as though the blonde could speak now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah. Sure I can do that\" Tammy said, and went right back to screaming at herself mentally for letting it all slip. Willow was doing fine now but it was only a matter of time before the questions came. Before Tammy had to tell her the full truth and how Willow, technically, wasn't real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, good. Good. Gloria, are you ready?\" Willow asked, to which Gloria just nodded. \"Okay, here it goes...\" Willow said as she lowered herself to the soft cottony surface taht now counted as the ground for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria walked on the uneven surface as best as she could and after a few moments of whining and with Tammy's silent help, managed to get into a crouched position on Willow's shoulders. There wasn't too much difference from cheerleading, but it still felt incredibly weird to be on the shoulders of a woman that hadn't even until an hour ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit, this hurts!\" Willow gasped from beneath Gloria's rump, and after several failed attempt,s finally rose upwards, her hands clamped tight to Gloria's ankles and leg's dangerously knocking from the strain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy could only watch from below as Gloria reached up as high as she could and...grabbed the rim! With more than a few shares of hissed 'fucks' and 'shit' Gloria lifted herself upwards, engaging her core body strength to pull her arms above the rim as he feet began to leave Willow's shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me!\" She cried as she felt her hands and arms slipping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I CAN'T GO ANY HIGHER YOU ARE KILLING ME\" Is the only response she got in return. Instead Gloria forced herself upwards, clearing the rim of the bowl and staring at the mountains of plastic fruits and vegetables. 'If only there were real...' Gloria sneered as she climbed fully onto the rim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH THANK GOD\" Willow screamed from below. But she was alreadty resetting to lift Tammy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should just let her fall...\" Gloria thought to herself. If she couldn't have her man, then she was going to make do and head for Sol. Her first instinct, looking into Tammy's eyes whas wide enough that you could easily with just one herb. But all that did't matter now As Tammy stood painfully on Willow's shoulders. Their fingers reached toward s each other as Tammy swayed back and forth as Willow's own legs threatened to give out on her...But it still wasn't enough!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jump to me!\" Gloria barked and with a look of pure pain, Tammy pushed herself off of Willow's shoulders, making the taller girl scream in pain as Tammy was, for a moment, weightless. And then she...</span></div></div>",

He furiously blinked and rubbed his eyes once more, concerned that maybe the flash of light had damaged his vision, but there was no change in what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were now four versions of Gloria standing side by side just a few feet away, all of them staring at each other with shocked looks on their faces while a group of Tammys did the same. And suddenly Bill was very aware that he was no longer the only person standing near the upstairs bathroom door. As the realization of what happened dawned on him and he slowly turned to face the very familiar form just to his right, a piercing reverb of a scream came from somewhere outside, sending the shocked crowd of multiple quadruplets into a frenzy of activity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne Tammy made a break for the stairs while another one simply fainted on the spot, another Tammy quickly trying to catch her while the fourth one's expression went from shock to eerily calm as she wandered over to the open door to Bill's room and sat quietly on his bed. The gaggle of Glorias erupted in similar fashion, as the outermost one began shoving the others as a sneer appeared on her face. The Gloria next to the sneering Gloria cried out in pain as she was slammed against the upstairs coffee table and then onto the floor, crumpling into a ball as the sneering version delivered several swift kicks to her abdomen. Another Gloria immediately leapt to the fallen Gloria's defense, grabbing hold of the sneering version and the two quickly snowballed into an outright catfight, while the final Gloria, a look of shock and fear on her face, simply tried her best to get around the two mirror images that were currently trying to kill each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Bill? Well, Bill suddenly found himself caught in a similar struggle as a frowning version of himself grabbed him in a choke hold and began clawing at Bill's closed fist which still held the Ahn'Ger Stone. As he was suddenly fighting for his life, Bill had no idea what the other two versions of him were currently doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd meanwhile, outside in her car, Willow was suddenly dealing with her own group of clones, one of which was currently joining the fleeing version of Tammy while another one, now sitting in the passenger seat next to her with a smooth hand on her shoulder, had quickly calmed down and was telling her not to panic. Another version of her, sitting in the backseat, was reaching for the left side passenger door that the running Willow had left out of, a look of casual annoyance on her face. As Willow tried her best not to freak out, she couldn't help but notice that there were A LOT more similarly people on the street than there had been just moments before, as chaos seemed to erupt everywhere.</span></div></div>",

A heavy steel door dominated one side of the bare wall and was seemingly closed tight. There were no windows, the only other breaks in the oppressive design of the room were two air vents on the walls near the ceiling and a circular drain in the center of the bunks, one of which was clearly occupied by a prone form, though the harsh light and shadows currently made identification impossible. The entire room was deathly still and quiet save for the very distant sound of electrical humming and the low sound of air pushing in through the vents. Bill was suddenly aware that he was uncomfortably cold, and he brought up his hands to breathe on them, still aware of the strange magical artifact cupped in his right palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, what am I wearing!?\" Gloria's high, panicked voice echoed in the spartan chamber and made Bill wince as his eardrums throbbed in pain. He whirled, a finger out-stretched to point in Gloria's face, but any angry retort he had vanished as his current focus of alarm shifted to Gloria, Tammy, and then his own clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of the upper-middle class American outfits that all three teenagers had been wearing just moments before, now they were all clothed in heavy, bland brown clothing that reminded Bill of something out of one of the good Terminator movies, or perhaps a wintery version of Zion from The Matrix. Gloria's previously glorious mane of silky black hair was now wrapped into a very short bob and hidden beneath a ratty sock-cap that made her now plain face seemed gaunt and harshly angular in the unforgiving light. Tammy fared no better, cloaked in a giant brown coat that seemed close to swallowing her, her blonde hair nothing more than a jagged pixie cut while a pair of glasses framed her thinner looking face. Gone was the small layer of adorable softness and soft dusting of make-up, now there was just a face that looked like it had been quite a while since Tammy had eaten any sort of meal of significant size. She looked at herself, and then cast a terrified look at Bill, who looked down to inspect himself, expecting his own major changes to appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he saw was...</span></div></div>",

As the realization sank in that he was now the opposite gender, Bill could feel something strange and alien cradling the two mounds of flesh that were somewhat hidden beneath what had to be at least two wool sweaters and an undershirt, and a frightening void now existed where Bill's penis had comfortably dangled. Bill was almost too terrified to move as he simply stared downward at the lumps on his chest, but eventually he guided two small, gloved hands up to his face, noticing that instead of the somewhat meaty male fingers now he had painfully thin and distinctly feminine ones poking our of the fingerless gloves. He probed his face, the angles of it all wrong from what he had remember, lips a little plumper than they had been, cheekbones a little higher, a nose that was smaller and slightly up-turned, and hair that was tied off in a short ponytail sticking out from beneath a fraying ballcap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god\" Bill said, his voice high and reedy, not all that different from Willow's voice as he slowly began to feel the rest of his changed body. His lower body, once he had awkwardly moved his newly acquired breasts out of the way, were clothing in a pair of jeans that seemed to be a little too large for him, and it was clear that he was wearing at least two layers; a pair of long underwear and some jeans that had definitely seen better days. His feet were covered in rough looking boots, the now smaller appendages covered in layer after layer of socks that did little to keep the cold from seeping into his toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't...how..\" Bill stammered, feeling overwhelmed as he felt tears welling in his eyes, but before he could succumb to the feeling, he felt two arms sliding around his and bringing into a tight, slightly warmer, embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh...It's okay...\" Tammy whispered into Bill's ear, and both of the former men were suddenly aware that Bill was now the shortest of the transformed trio. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why all of this? Why couldn't it just fix your dumb girlfriend?\" Bill said, ignoring the stale stench of body odor that was interwoven with Tammy's clothes, \"Why change me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Gloria snarled from nearby, though both Bill and Tammy ignored her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, maybe it works differently than we thought?\" Tammy said as she released Bill from the stabilizing hug and gave him a small, somehow still pretty smile that made BIll's new lips split into their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, maybe...\" He said, and Bill brought the tiny hand that still held the Ahn'Ger Stone up to his and Tammy's faces and slowly opened his fist, their eyes going wide at what they saw. \"Oh no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What happened?\" Gloria said, stomping over. For the briefest of moments she felt like swiping the stone from the now much smaller Bill, but what she saw in the tiny gloved palm made her freeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ahn'Ger Stone had a massive crack through the middle of it, a deep wound that pierced the steadily dulling golden core as small flakes of gold oozed from the artifact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...It's broken!\" Tammy gasped, taking a single step backwards while Bill simply stared at his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. NO! I will NOT be stuck like this just because you were the dumb bitch!\" Gloria screamed, her hand twisted into a grasping claw as it darted for the stone. Whatever happened to this world, she couldn't take it. She was not going to be stuck here looking like this! She'd make Bill and Tom pay for doing this, she'd get the Stone, fix everything and then make them suffer! She'd...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Need to be faster, as Bill's fingers snapped shut protectively around the gemstone and yanked his arm out of Gloria's clawing reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get back!\" Bill screamed as Gloria fell upon him with a hateful snarl, suddenly aware that being smaller meant she was much weaker than her attacker. In just the few moments of struggle, Gloria was close to overpowering the former boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly...</span></div></div>",

As her fingers brushed the Stone it pulsed weakly as the anger, rage and hate flowed into it with each touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she'd be back to normal, soon she'd punish BIll and Tom for ever standing in her way, soon she'd...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Gloria's internal monologue of anger and hate was suddenly interrupted as the harsh white light of the chamber turned red and a loud buzz deafened the three women in the chamber, Gloria releasing her grip on the small version of Bill to shield her ears from the noise as Bill and Tammy did the same. Moments later the red light flashed back to white and the massive steel door swung inwards as a group of large, helmeted figures in full military combat gear wielding assault rifles charged into the room shouting orders that neither Bill, Gloria or Tammy could hear from the ringing in their ears. The guns were enough for Bill and he rolled onto his back, his new breasts cresting above him as one of the figures advanced on him, rifle barrel jutting dangerously close to his face. Out of the corner of his eye he could see Tammy laying face down as another armed figure loomed above her, gun pointed at the back of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Gloria, being Gloria, resisted out of stubborn, brattish pride, and for her efforts received the heavy end of a rifle into her once pretty face, and she crumpled to the ground in a bloody, motionless pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother apparent guard hauled the fourth occupant, whose identity remained a mystery to Bill, out of bed while the figure standing over Bill proceeded to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Occupants of Female Cell Block 88930, explain why you are violating the Karmic Law!\" The figure, whose voice was clearly male, shouted in Bills face though all Bill could see was his reflection in the visor of the full faced helmet. Some part in the back of his mind registered that he did not look much different from a plain version of Willow, from the reality before this one. But Bill's attention quickly snapped back to the man pointing a gun at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't...\" Bill stammered, the complete lack of knowledge at just what, exactly, was happening. The guard clearly did not care for his lack of an answer as he pressed the barrel of the rifle against Bill's bountiful chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not give me a reason to use this! Answer the question!\" The guard repeated, and there was a slight metallic buzz to his words, though Bill's mind raced to give the aggressor an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh, she, Gloria wanted my gloves!\" Bill stammered as he tried to put together a convincing story. The guard above him stood motionless for a second before there was an audible click as he suddenly backed off, dropping the rifle barrel into a prone position, though Bill still followed the weapon with his eyes, fearful for his life. But the guard simply straightened and wordlessly signaled the three other guards, who immediately backed off of Tammy and the unknown stranger that had been sleeping in the cot. The guard over Gloria bent down and grabbed hold of both of the teenager's limp arms and began dragging her effortless towards the chamber door, not caring about the river of blood oozing from her broken face. Bill followed her unconscious form until it disappeared beyond the door's horizon, before looking back at the guard next to him, who was staring down at him through the reflective faceplate of his helmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Citizens. As required by Karmic Law, this cell block will now be placed under a twenty-four lockdown to monitor for future Imbalances. Food and water rations for the day as suspended. Once the lockdown is lifted, you will be assigned a new cell mate.. Thank you for your continued adherance to the Karmic Law. You keep humanity alive.\" The guard said, and just like that, the remaining guards in the apparent cell block filed quickly and silently out of the chamber, the heavy metal door groaning shut and a large bolt clearly sliding into place beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's just great\" The stranger said, pulling themselves up. Whoever it was, their dirty hair was long and impossibly curly, hiding their face from view. But the voice was definitely female, and as Bill and Tammy picked themselves up the stranger parted her hair to reveal that she was...</span></div></div>",

In the harsh brightness and the long shadows of the chamber's single overhead light source Bill could see a hint of fiery red through the dirt and grime<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Yeesh, she's tall'</i> Bill thought to himself, craning his neck upwards as the stranger rose to her full height as huge breasts pushed through the heavy leather jacket she wore. But then Bill's eyes went wide and he let out a very feminine gasp as the woman's large, gloved hands pulled the cascade of curls back behind her ears and revealed her face. His tiny palm flared in pain as the edge of the gemstone cut through the thin fabric of his gloves and pressed against his flesh as his grip tightened in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god\" Bill whispered as the female version of Rob Bolstrum stared back at him and Tammy, her eyes narrowed in an annoyed glare. Bill shot a sideways glance at Tammy, who looked equally nervous. In a reality lost several iterations ago as Tom, Tammy had had more than a few run-ins with Rob to recognize the body language and similar facial features as one of their tormentors. Bill tensed his new body for a fight as Rob shuffled towards them as the bully's own massive breasts swung like pendulums...But then the female version of Rob Bolstrum simply shuffled around Bill's form and moved to where Gloria had been laid out by the guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's just great\" Rob's new voice was smoky and low, as stared at the small stream of Gloria's blood trickling down the room's drainage pipe. \"Now everything is gonna smell like copper for days until we get a new water ration. Gotta say though, glad she's gone, I was getting pretty tired of her attitude. I know you girls had to be as well. Just hope we don't get someone worse as a replacement\" She said, casting a backwards glance at Bill and Tammy, who simply stared on in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Rob?\" Bill asked, after a moment, and fought the urge to recoil in his much smaller body as Rob turned to face Bill, a scowl on her face. Bill craned his neck upward to peer above the twin cannons that he was now barely eye level with. Why had the gemstone made him so small?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Willow?\" Rob said, her voice hard and mocking, \"Do I really look like a Rob to you? It's Roberta\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right. Sorry, Roberta\" Bill stammered out. In the original reality Bill was scared of Rob Bolstrum, anyone with a brain would be, but he either always stood his ground or outsmarted the former bully and his crew of lackies. Showing fear would just make it even worse, especially after Rob became Jon Ingerman's lackey, but there was something about being so small on top of this alien reality that had made Bill's Flight or Fight Syndrome click closer to Flight. And if Bill was now WIllow...What happened to the other Willow? The one created by the 'old person' reality? Had she simply ceased to exist? And why the hell was Rob even here to begin with?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. I'm going back to bed. Fastest way to get through this damn quarantine. Try to keep it down, okay?\" Rob, or rather Roberta moaned as she made her way back towards her bunk. Bill's newly terrified thoughts were inclined to let the feminized giant slumber, but he saw Tammy reach out and grab the former bully by the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rob...berta. Roberta\" Tammy's voice was low and calm, and Bill was reminded of the much older version of Tammy, \"Can you tell us why we're here? Do you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoberta fixed Tammy, and then Bill with a strange, confused look. \"What? You're joking, right Tammy? There's no way you and the little princess over here could have forgotten the last ten years!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, um...Assume that we have. Assume that we don't have any idea of why we're here, or why our friend just got violently beaten up by a bunch of robots\" Tammy's voice faltered for a second as the shock of how many years they had all just lost threw her mentally off balance for a moment, but she recovered quickly, releasing her hold on Roberta's jacket as the giantess turned to fully face both of them once more. A long, awkward silence passed as the giantess stared at the two of them, Bill slowly creeping behind Tammy without even realizing it before Roberta's face softened and she rubbed her angular face with her right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine. But I swear if this is some kinky new roleplay thing between the two of you, the next time you two start fucking I'm going to take a shit on your bunk. But can we sit down, please?\" Roberta motioned towards the bunks and with a nod, the small group of women moved towards them, Bill tagging along behind Tammy and sitting close to her on the bottom bunk of opposite of what was apparently Rob's bunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so...\"</span></div></div>",

Something happened, no one really knows or understands what, but it caused the best and worst parts of people to transform them into crazy powerful monsters. Some of them, the 'good' ones look like angels, gold, big ass wings, glowy eyes and a unremovable stick up their ass. The other side is simply demons like out of some nerd book. Big, scales, fire and brimstone. Lot of teeth and hate everything. The only solid information anyone had on what these things were is that A: They used to be people and B: The changes were based on your attitude and how you acted towards others. Be nice but snobby? You turn into an angel, be mean and hateful? You turn into a demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome people called it Judgement day, Armageddon, but the funny thing is that people couldn't turn to churches, because that's where all the 'good' guys came out of, shooting light at anyone they didn't find to be 'pure and good'. Which is most of humanity. And then the prisons, the cities, those were instantly filled with demons. Next thing you know, the entire world is on fire and we're all hiding out in the woods. You girls, me, Gloria, we were all at Willow's house when it happened. I was down in the basement, hiding out because my boyfriend Jon Ingerman had beat the shit out of me and despite everything I had done to you guys, you let me in to sleep on your basement couch. Then right before school it all went down and the next thing we knew Gloria's mom was some big dog looking thing eating people alive and spitting fire everywhere. So we ran out the back and hid out in the woods by the river, this little cave where you and Tammy used to go to fuck each other because you guys hadn't come out yet. We eventually just went on the move, meeting up with others before finding out about the safe zones set up by what was left of the military. Dangerous as hell but there was food, water, shelter. They all kept falling apart, people would turn, like Gloria started to, or some demon or angel would show up and just shrug off a tank shell like it was nothing. Shit got bad, we were lucky to survive as long as we did, and getting to stick together. Lot of dead people out there, caught in the middle of shit that bullets can't kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter like two years of shuffling around, the new sanctuaries were revealed, converted missile silos, big ass underground warehouses, all top secret shit that was useless. So we just came here to Sanctuary 12, where they divided us up into Habitation Blocks based on gender, region of origin. But only if we let them stick the transmitters in our brains. That's why there are robots, they constantly patrol and monitor us for chemical imbalances, the closest thing we can get to knowing who is about to change. That's what Karmic Law is, we keep on the path, not too good, not too bad, just right in the middle. You start to dip into either side of the red, the robots show up and take you down. Gloria was lucky she just got knocked out, most of the time they just put a bullet in your head while you're still human and killable. And that's why we're under quarantine, to make sure we don't go either way. If we do they'll just flood our cozy little home with nerve gas and then drag our bodies out for recycling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now, we just survive. Eat shit food, drink filtered piss water, exist. We've been doing this for at least ten years, and I guess they want to start trying to repopulate, because our Hab-Block is up for mandatory reproduction duty next cycle, since they've got all us girls in this Block synched up now. I wonder if that's why Gloria flipped out, she must have forgotten to take her Balance pill when it started\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoberta took a breath and leaned back on her bunk, eyeing Tammy and Bill, both of which had grown more and more horrified as the former male bully had told them the history of the last decade, and now she wasn't so sure that this was just a kinky roleplay thing. The look of confusion and fear was just too convincing for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...guys did know all of this, right? Roberta said, suddenly very unsure of the two women she had come to consider family, her sisters during the end of the world.</span></div></div>",

In the far distance, surrounded by a mountain range of jagged peaks, was cradled a small, flickering sun like object arrayed by countless twisting strands of gold that formed a shimmering, elongated halo as it was pulled into a titanic rip in the green sky, so bright that Bill had to shield his eyes from staring directly at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic gripped Bill as he suddenly realized he was shielding his eyes with his left hand, the hand that had been holding the Ahn'Ger Stone when he made his wish. It was empty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap!\" Bill yelled and furiously searched the limited amount of space in the outcropping for where he might have dropped it, but finding nothing but slick crystal surfaces that curved back out to the alien vista.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" Bill muttered as he took in the eerily calm view as best as he could, his voice distant, almost an echo that only carried a few feet. \"What?\" Bill said again, cautiously touching his mouth with his right finger, \"What is wrong with my voice?\". The teen jerked his hand back and hurried over to the nearby wall of the outcropping, his reflection appearing in the cloudy crystalline material as he frantically looked for any signs of change to his body, but finding none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's a plus at least\" Bill began to sigh in relief, but froze, watching as his reflection said the words, it's mouth saying everything perfectly but his voice carrying on few a few moments after his mouth had shut. Bill's eyes widened as he backed away, his reflection dissipating into nothing more than a vague Bill-shaped blue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's crazy! I wonder if...\" Bill said before letting out a random, wordless yell. He felt his mouth close before the cry had ended, and Bill shook his head in amazement and more than a little confusion. 'It's like a video game with really poor audio synching' Bill mused to himself as he walked back to the ledge of the outcropping. Taking a seat on the hard material and letting his legs dangle periously over the edge of the cliff, Bill once again looked out over the alien landscape, keeping his gaze low and away from the ominously large wound in the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually his eyes adapted, and Bill could see smaller details on the plain below, allowing his eyes to stretch to the horizon just enough to where the jagged crack appeared to touch the surface somewhere beyond the horizon. A path of destruction seemed to race out from the tiniest speck of the tear, a river or broken emerald that snaked it's way outwards in a path of geological rampage that led up to the towering mountains surrounding the small sun. As Bill's eyes adapted to the white light flooding from the rift as best as they could, he could almost swear that there was the dimmest outline of a coffee table and window frame somewhere within it. But it might have been a trick of the light, as Bill began to notice that the air around him was shimmering and rippling as if he was underwater. The sun-like object flickered again, this time violently, and Bill looked away as it pulsed and strobed against his eyes as pain rippled through his skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later a enormous pressure wave hit Bill and tossed the teenager backward, slamming him hard against the rear of the outcropping. As the new world around him spun back into view, Bill saw the ground shift nearby as the emerald green rock seemed to melt away into a path that curved out of his line of sight around the far side of the cliff, while the area within the outcropping seemed to shrink as the walls shrank towards the cliff edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...What is this place?\" Bill said as he scrambled to his feet, the encroachment of the walls stopping the moment the boy was once again upright. He cast another look out at the world beyond the outcropping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I in the stone?\" He wondered, but his introspection did not last long as the outcropping began shrinking once more, this time the hard green stone pushing Bill towards the small pathway that had appeared moments before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay! I get the hint!\" Bill stammered as the rock face not-so-gently pushed against him, and Bill walked forward, placing a foot onto the pathway, testing it's weight. \"Seems sturdy enough...What do you think?\" Bill said, turning his head and seeing his muddled reflection in the walls around him, \"Should I stay or should I-\" Bill's reference was interrupted as the stone surged forward and pushed him out onto the path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez!\" Bill cried, stumbling to catch his balance on the very exposed and narrow walkway, \"For a rock, you really are impatient!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mountain seemingly responded as several inches from the pathway melted away before his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I get it. You don't like jokes\" Bill said, and began to slowly make his way forward.<br>\r\n___<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time and a lot of walking later, the pathway before Bill hit a dead end, terminating seamlessly into the emerald rock. Bill knew better than to look behind him or stop however; the mountain was clearly sentient, and very impatient for Bill to get to wherever it wanted him to go as it was removing the pathway behind him, giving him just enough room to catch himself if he somehow tripped and fell but not much more than that. It was impossible to tell time, but Bill was certain that he'd been walking for at least three hours, following the path as it curved itself downward towards the plain below. And he was also certain that he was now actually INSIDE the gemstone itself, and whatever power or being that granted the wishes was communicating through the environment, pushing him to go...somewhere and vaguely threatening his life if he stopped for more than a moment. So instead Bill kept up his pace and right before he ran face-first into the mountain, the wall of rock melted away and Bill stepped into another wide outcropping. But instead of an vast, otherworldly view lit by a sun, there was a small chamber filled with shadow that overlooked a field of absolute destruction that stretched to the horizon on this side of the mountain. It was almost if someone had taken a hammer to a jade statue, or the obliterated terrain left behind by a tank's treads. A crippled peak grew out of the rubble and reflected the pale light of the sun towards the outcropping, and Bill blinked twice as his eyes adjusted to the weak light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthere, at the center of the outcropping, lay a small, still, human form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\" Bill yelled as he raced forward, dropping to his knees next the person in front of him. His brain immediately shifted to Tammy, that his best friend turned wife turned...whatever the relationship was between them now and any harm that could have befallen her, but it immediately shifted to mild alarm as he pushed aside the green tinted hair to reveal Gloria's unconscious face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. It's you.\" Bill grumbled bitterly, leaning back on his legs and staring at his...friend? Rival? Annoy mutual acquaintance? Whatever Gloria was to Bill at this point, he was still convinced that she was the cause of all the problems that had happened this morning, of what she had done to Tom, and then Bill's parents. Causing Kimberly to vanish out of existence. Bill felt his blood go hot as he stood up, towering over the completely helpless form of Gloria as a fist balled into existence. Around him, beyond his tunnel vision, golden shafts of light coalesced into existence, swimming through the emerald mountainside as they reached out from the cloudy walls of the mountain in wispy, snake like tendrils. Emerald stone pooled and gre from where the light broke through the surface of the mountain, stretching outwards in wobbling crystalline tendrils around the golden light, trying to contain it as the light-reflecting mountain in the distance began to crack and fracture. As the light within the outcropping dimmed, golden strand whisked across the back of Bill's neck as he gritted his teeth, coiling back as if to strike as Bill's mouth opened and his distorted voice warbled to life...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wi-OW!\" Bill yelped in pain as a large chunk of emerald stone detached itself from the ceiling and dropped unceremoniously down on top of Bill's head. Pain replaced the simmering anger in Bill's gut as he covered his head with his arms to protect himself from any other falling objects, not noticing as the predatory tendrils of light vanishing into nothing or the grasping emerald formations sinking back into the rock surrounding the two teens. The reflective mountain in the distance regained some luster and the light level within the small cave grew again, though not to the level it was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Gloria muttered, her eyes fluttering open as Bill rolled his. Bill stepped back while Gloria pulled herslef to her feet, her eyes going wide at the alien landscape around her before landing on Bill, his arms folded as he started at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bill, whats...whats going on? Where are we, what did you do!?\" Gloria said as panic crept into her off-synched voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's going to be a long day' Bill thought to himself as he began to explain what had happened, and where he thought they were.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"There's no way this is actually happening. We must be, like, having some kind of drug trip or something\" Gloria said as she and Bill made their way further down the mountain and towards the ruined emerald landscape below. Gloria wasn't into fantasy or science fiction, the closest that she had ever gotten to anything related to geeky things were the Disney movies that her mom owned and rarely let her watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, Gloria Vanapoulos's world was dominated by her mother's obsessive control over her, a timid ghost of a father that was always gone on business trips, and the fleeting moments of freedom where she could put some of her mother's lessons on being a 'lady' to use at school and getting people to do what she wanted. And Tom. But Tom was currently a chick and much like everything else, Gloria wasn't really ready or capable or processing that yet, not even after the alternate realities she had experienced. And there was a growing part of her mind that was trying to convince the rest of her that Gloria was simply having a /very/ elaborate dream, that she was still at home in her bed and sound asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, as Gloria glanced behind her at the path she and Bill were both walking along disappear into nothing but a sheer, deadly drop into oblivion, her mind never had much capacity for flights of fantasy, and now that she was apparently living in one, she was running our of ways to sanely cope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gloria, I don't do drugs, you don't do drugs, Tom-Tammy doesn't do drugs. And even then, there's no possible way both of us could be having the /exact/ same trip. We're here, we're walking, just deal with it.\" Bill spat back, not bothering to turn around to look at the girl that had somehow, someway, managed to ruin both his best friend's life and his own. How did she do it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\" Gloria began to shout back, but just a glance out at the ruined, alien landscape around her made her fall into silence. There was no point in arguing with Strasserman, he was already against her in the beginning, and now with all this magic, this...wherever they were, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Okay, so if we ARE inside the gem, how do I get out? I can't be stuck here, I'm not going to be trapped like some genie in a lamp!'</i> Gloria fumed in silence, and she let a single manicured hand slide across the surface of the mountain next to her. It was cold and unnatural feeling but for lack of anything else to do but walking forward, she let her fingers glide across the cloudy crystalline surface, unaware of the faint golden trails behind her that moved in time with her fingertips. They struggled to keep up with the teens as the mountain seemed to shift, becoming cloudier and opaque until the gold trails were smothered out of existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long period of silence and walking, and walking and silence, Bill and Gloria finally made it around the much larger base of the mountain, once more coming into view of the stunning vista within this strange alien world. Bill's hand flew up to protect his eyes from the burning white of the overhead rift, grinning as he heard Gloria let out a wordless squeak of pain as her eyes were subjected to the full force of the rift. Part of Bill felt like a dick for not warning her, but a larger part of him felt justified in doing...something to her. It was her fault they were here after all. Little miss perfect could do with a little pain here and there. Up ahead Bill could see the pathway curving into another wall and his mood brightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, maybe Tammy is in there!' he said to himself as he quickened his pace. Maybe Tammy was in there, and maybe, with someone that actually understood what was happening and not just whining about it, they could figure out just what to do next. Other than walk, of course. It was pretty clear that the forces within the gemstone, if that was where they truly were, wanted them to get to the bottom of the mountain, but after then, who knew? The only other points of interest were the cradled sun and the enormous debris field stretching as far as his eyes could see. But first things first, reunite with his...whatever Tammy was to him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bill, look out!\" Gloria said from behind him, and Bill simply grinned to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just gotta say the magic words\" Bill threw his arms up in the air dramatically as he continued to walk towards the wall of green rock, \"Open sesame!\" He cried as he stepped forward and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...went face first into the mountainside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Shit!\" Bill yelled as he bounced backwards, his nose flaring in pain as he ran a finger over it. It wasn't bleeding or broken, thankfully, but it hurt like hell. He cast a look behind him to see Gloria trying her best not to laugh, and further back the disappearing pathway had ceased to disappear, instead the wall of reclamation mountainside holding steady as Bill couldn't help but feel as if someone, somewhere was standing with their hands on their hips giving him a 'I told you so' look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, some master of the mystic mountain you are\" Gloria snickered behind a raised hand, her eyes twinkling in cruel delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah\" Bill muttered, turning back to look at the wall he had just bounced off of, \"That, uh, didn't happen before. It's supposed to melt away just like the...\" Bill's explanation trailed off as the mountain seemed ready to grant his request, opening slowly like an iris, revealing the cave beyond. He gave the rock in front of him a glare, \"And for a pile of rocks, it has a /very/ odd sense of humor\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mountain may have rumbled in reply as Bill ducked through the still opening iris and planted his feet firmly in the cave, staring with excited hope at the prospect of being reunited with someone who he enjoyed being with...only to be disappointed by nothing more than an empty outcropping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Bill muttered and kicked at the ground, wincing in pain at impact of a tennis shoe impacted against unyielding stone. \"Where is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not in here? I thought you said you woke up in one of these?\" Gloria asked as she waited for the iris to open fully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did. I thought it was here when I found you! But no no, I had to find Gloria 'Useless' Vanapolous, queen bitch of the school, ruiner of lives and all around awful person!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria bristled at the insults, \"You think I'M the awful person here!? YOU'RE the one who hit me and then made the wish that got us stuck in...wherever this is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made the first wishes after stealing the stone from me! You wished us into the future, you made Tom into Tammy, you created Willow and then ERASED my parents and sister! I had every right to hit you before you made it even worse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't see how you think you and Tom are the victims here! He wanted to break up with me, ME! And then what, I'm just supposed to LET him!? You don't get it, caveman, I'm SUPPOSED to be with Tom! Not the sulking little pathetic loser he is when he's around you, but the real Tom! The basketball star, the handsome chiseled jaw, son of upper middle class workers! I'm Gloria Vanapolous, and if you knew ANYTHING about me, anything at all, you wouldn't keep denying me from my fucking destiny, Bill!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of them noticed that the entire cave was now glowing with golden light, tendrils of magic stretching out towards both of them as their anger and hate for each other rose. Just as the argument was about to hit a crescendo, both teens opening their mouths to utter an echoed wish, the distant sun began to pulse and strobe once more, and the massive shockwave that followed it knocked both Bill and Gloria to the hard stone floor of the cave, which immediately gave out. The floor beneath them vanished, melting away. Then the next floor, and the floor after that. Each time Bill and Gloria fell precisely three feet, their bodies smacking painfully against cold, hard stone as what appeared to be a impromptu elevator ride lowered them deeper and deeper into the mountain before they finally reached the bottom, bruised and battered by the trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit...Well, I was tired of walking anyway...\" Bill cursed as he pulled himself into a sitting position while Gloria merely let out a long, girlish whine of pain. After a few moment,s Bill stood and craned his neck upwards, staring back up the shaft they had just descended. Far above the two of them was the curved ceiling of the cave but it vanished as the mountain quickly began filling the void, slabs of crystalline rock sliding back into place at an alarming speed. Near Bill a large archway appeared, leading out onto the shattered plains within the Ahn'Ger Stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Bill yelled, \"Gloria, come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Gloria said groggily, but a look upwards made her gasp in fear and surprise as the slabs raced lower and lower. Then she felt herself being jerked upwards and rushing towards the entrance, her hand wrapped in Bill's as he hustled thw two of them through the opening right as the final slab slammed into place behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was close\" Bill said, panting. After catching his breath, he looked up to see...</span></div></div>",

Aside from the sound of their hearts pounding in their chests by the near death experience, the only other sound was that of the impact's echo, fading in the unnatural atmosphere of the strange world they were stranded in.. They shared a look, Bill staring at Gloria's green-tinted face as her once fine hair was frazzled, her eyes wide with fear as she patted herself down and releasing a small cough from the cloud of dust that flew off her designer clothing. The way even her cough seemed to sound indignant and outraged made Bill chuckle as he patted himself off, sending another small cloud of dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good to know you find almost dying to be funny\" Gloria said, her voice shaky and whiny, \"That's just what I need\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill rolled his eyes as he turned away from Gloria and taking in their surroundings. They were no longer on the mountain, that much was obvious, now they were standing on the plains below, which was far less uniform than it had looked from higher elevation. Bill had assumed that it would be a glassy, unbroken plain, an endless slab of green crystal, but that was not the case. Instead, it looked far more like a desert, small dunes of green dust standing motionless, flat lowlands that were riddled with millions, probably billions of tiny fractures running deep into the gem. Even where they stood, piles of loose rubble were everywhere, clusters of crystalline boulders creating an alien badland that stretched towards the distant ring of mountains where the sun was nestled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" Bill said after a moment, \"I guess we just keep heading towards the middle? Maybe we'll find a way out there\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or we die of starvation, dehydration or by another stupid trap!\" Gloria whined, but she dutifully fell in line behind Bill as he took off walking across the emerald desert, but then she gasped as suddenly a path of green bricks formed out of the ground and quickly sped into the distance towards the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm never going to get used to that\" She said, and her eyes narrowed into a glare aimed at the back of Bill's head as he chuckled once more, \"Oh, shut up!\" She muttered, falling into line as Bill began walking once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'At least I'm stuck with a nerd' Gloria thought to herself, trying to ignore the aching pain in her feet, 'If I was stuck here with one of the girls, we'd never get out'</span></div></div>",

This wasn't like them, usually Bill and Tammy were always ready to go, Tammy not wanting to break her long-standing streak of being tardy-less and Bill following her into the car with clock like precision. Of course, Gloria being there was something Willow wasn't used to, maybe they were talking about something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow's eyes went wide at the thought that crept into her head. \"Oh Bill, you didn't...\" Willow said, her voice low and quiet. Being the big sister, Willow was always looking out for her little brother and had, over the years, casually guided Bill and Tammy together. They had always seemed so perfect for each other and as far back as Willow could remember she had played matchmaker for the two, though despite all the time they spent together (and the blushing, giggly stories that Tammy had told her in private) they had yet to actually confirm to anyone that they were in fact a couple. But Gloria Vanapolous...Willow also knew that Bill sometimes had a 'type', at least for physical appearance, and Gloria matched it. Her little brother had been acting strange the past couple of months, and Gloria had been showing up more and more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I can't let it end like that!\" Willow cried out, shutting her car down and fleeing back into the house that she had lived in all her life, trying her best not to fall over in her heels and red dress. Why did she have to pick today of all days to dress fancy!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow hurried up the short walkway, scaled the porch stairs and dashed through the front door of her house, determined to break up whatever teenage relationship drama that she felt was happening right at that exact moment, her blue eyes tunnel-visioned on the stairs and the landing above where she had last seen the trio. She kicked off her heels as ascended the stairs three at a time, eyes full of panic as she arrived at the top of the stairs to find...no one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bill?\" The elder Strasserman sibling called out, hurrying over to her brother's bedroom door, opening it, expecting to see her brother and at least ONE sobbing teenage girl, only to be greeted by his usual untidy room of video game and other geeky sci-fi junk that she knew Tammy was into. \"Maybe downstairs?\" Willow said to herself, turning back to the stairs that led to the first floor of the Strasserman home. The house had a full basement and Bill and Tammy had sort of taken over the area as their own little hideaway where the two often spent most their time together in, binging movies or making out on the old couch down there. Willow quickly made her way downstiars and through the remainder of the house, flinging open the basement door with wild abandon only to be greeted by an unexpected face that seemed just as surprised as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHH!\" Willow screamed, stumbling backwards and almost bouncing off the kitchen island counter, her hand flailing for something, anything to defend herself with while the towering, hulk-like form of Rob Bolstrum stood paralyzed in the doorway to the basement, one hand still outstretched for the doorknob that Willow had jerked unceremoniously out of his hand. After a moment silence, Rob staring blankly at Willow while she fumbled cartoonishly against the tile of the counter, her hand eventually finding a handful of freshly washed spoons, which she seized and waved menacingly at him. The sight of a potential weapon, however small seemed to stir Rob into motion, and he chuckled as he stepped calmly through the doorway and into the kitchen proper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET OUT!\" Willow screamed, aware of the futility of her weapons against the wall of muscle in front of her. This was no random burglar, this was Rob Bolstrum, one of the assholes at Bill's school that had made his life hell. Bolstrum had been the 'head bully', all the other creeps taking orders from him until a new student, Jonathan Ingerman, had kicked Rob's ass and taken away all his clout and power, turning the former top dog into nothing more than his errand boy enforcer. \"I SAID GET OUT!\" Willow screamed again, raising the fistful of spoons high over her head, \"DON'T MAKE ME USE THESE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or what, you'll spoon me to death?\" Rob's voice was a playful growl as he stopped in mid-stride, :I mean, I'm done for a little spooning with you, babe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I MEAN IT!\" Willow screamed back, hoping that someone, somewhere was listening and would either do something heroically stupid or smart and reasonable like call the police.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please don't I'm at your mercy!\" Rob said, mocking Willow as he raised his hands up as though he was surrendering before busting out into a laugh. \"Relax, chica, I ain't gonna rape you. I'm just here for Bill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck do you want with Bill, creep!?\" Willow didn't relax, though she was able to slide around the edge of the counter and put more space between her and the intruder. If he made a move, she could probably make it to the door before he could grab her...And then she saw the troubled look come over Rob's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob looked around for a moment before shutting the basement door behind him. He slowly crossed the kitchen floor, raising his hands once again though this time there seemed to be /some/ sincerity behind the action, before turning on the sink and runing his calloused hands through the clear liquid that poured forward. He stood there for a moment before cupping his hands and splashing water on his bulldog-like face, taking an obnoxious slurp before shutting the water off and facing Willow once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I need his help. I know, sounds like a bunch of bullshit, but I'm not here to hurt him. Take me to him and I promise he'll never have to worry about anything from me ever again\" Rob's face looked sincere enough, his cheeks flush with embarassment as Willow stared at him in distrust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, it does sound like bullshit!\" The elder Strasserman said after a moment of disbelief. She knew this asshole, she knew what he had done to Bill, to some of her friends, to all the other kids at the high school. She had gotten away unscathed out of pure luck, and because back then, Rob didn't go after girls. It was only after Ingerman had shown up, and after Willow had graduated, that Rob's fury had truly been unleashed. In front of her, Rob's look of embarassment crumpled into his usual scowl of hate and rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? Well does this sound like bullshit? Fucking Ingerman sent me here to burn your goddamn house to the ground, bitch! I've been in your fucking basement for almost an hour, waiting for your fucking dipshit parents to leave so maybe, just maybe, I could get to Bill without worrying about the fucking cops getting called on my ass!\" Rob's stuck a large, blunt finger in Willow's face before she could realize how quick he'd moved. For someone of that size, Rob was frighteningly fast.  Willow's heart was in her chest as the fight or flight instinct kicked in, but then Rob reared backwards, moving to lean back against the counter in a move that obviously took some effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...yeah. Listen, I'm...sorry I scared you. I know what I am, but I'm not going to prison for Ingercunt's wounded fucking ego. Bill might be a little shit but he's fucking smart, I'm not. If he helps me take Ingercunt down, I'll be in charge again and I'll stop being an asshole. To him. Bill.\" Rob's voice was as close to pleading as Willow thought it could get, and although her better judgement told her otherwise, some part of her believed the big palooka in front of her. But then another thought crossed her mind as the adrenaline began to fade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you've been down there for an hour?\" Willow pointed to the basement door, \"Then no one is down there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously\" Rob said, rolling his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then...where did they go?\" Willow gave Rob one last wary look before setting her fistful of spoons down on the counter with a noisy clatter before sliding around the brute, heading back towards the Strasserman home's main entrance and the stairs. Without a word Willow grabbed hold of the banister and ascended to the second floor once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Rob asked, clomping behind her in his heavy boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bill was here with his girlfriend, I was taking them to school...I went out and got in my car, waited for five minutes...and nothing. So if I didn't see them leave...Did you hear them leave out the back door in the kitchen?\" Willow asked, going door to door of the upper story and checking each of the rooms to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's why I was coming up, all I heard was some yelling, then you. Figured it was a good time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was never a good time. You couldn't have just called him?\" Willow said as she closed the bathroom door and looked out the hallway window, scanning the backyard for any sign of the teens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady, I've been held back three times, I live in a skid row trailer park, I have a reputation and any more I get out of pummeling twerps I have to give to a Thor wannabe. I'm too broke for a phone\" Rob said as he climbed the stairs, leaning against the wall and taking the opportunity to scope out Willow's ass as she gazed out the window. That's when he saw it, a small, dark object laying at the wall near Willow's bare feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's that?\"</span></div></div>",

She followed his gaze and, for a moment, thought the disgraced bully was pointing at her chest, but then saw what he was truly looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, at the edge of the small table beneath the window, was a dull green stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Willow said, furrowing her brow as she reached down to pick the unknown object up. Her fingers wrapped around it and she shivered at how strangely cold it's hard surface felt. She brought it up to hold in the sunlight, what remained as a early morning thunderstorm rolled in, and stared at it in confusion. It was a large teardrop of emerald, cloudy with something large and dark at the core of the gem, and a massive crack that ran down one side of it. The light seemed to dull as it passed through the gemstone, and while Willow was no geologist she knew that whatever had damaged the gemstone had clearly ruined it's luster forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? What is it?\" Rob asked as he stepped closer, his huge face suddenly far too close for Willow's comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh\" She began, trying her best to wiggle away from the much larger man, \"It might be my mom's? I didn't know she owned anything this large, though\" She held the mysterious stone out at arm's length to Rob, who simply engulfed her dainty hand with a massive, calloused paw, pulling it from her fingers as he turned it once more to the fading sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh\" Bolstrum muttered, and for a moment he could have sworn there was a golden flash from within the gem as her rolled it around in his palm, the weak, graying light outside bending for the briefest moments before Rob shook his head. No, that was just faggoty make-believe. He'd pawned more than his fair share of jewels and none of them did that, it was just his eyes playing tricks on him. With a grunt and a shrug, Rob turned towards Willow once more and tossed it towards his unexpected partner. \"Well, whatever it is, it's trash now. No one wants a gem with a huge ass crack in it\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow's eyes went wide and she snapped out an arm to catch the gemstone, fumbling it clumsily out of the air before it smashed against the hallway wall..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not pawning it! It could be a family keepsake!\" Willow hissed, glaring at Rob as she cradled the stone protectively in her hands, and if either of the two had been paying attention, they would have seen another weak glimmer of golden light emanate from the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that brief moment, as anger between the two unlikely allies rose and the magic within the Ahn'Ger Stone seemed to respond, what happened?</span></div></div>",

In this new reality, Tom is friends with Big Jon and Rob, and is just as mean as they are. Without Tom, Gloria\u2019s rebellious streak never starts, and she is as ladylike as her mother expects her to be. She and Bill used to be friends before she became more reserved around boys in middle school. In this reality, Bill was his parent\u2019s first child, and they were hesitant to have another when Bill had trouble making friends. As a result, Willow is only thirteen.</span></div></div>",

Older than eons, it often waited dozens or hundreds of years before another mortal stumbled across its vessel, blissfully unaware of the chaos that laid within it. Now that the gem's latest owner, the one known as Bill Stasserman, was in the throws of unleashing his fury at the one known at Gloria Vanapoulos, the entity watched with what passed for baited breath, excited once again at the opportunity to feed on Strasserman's righteous indignation.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish...\u201d said Bill with more command in his voice than he had ever featured before as he towered over Gloria's body as she shrank against the wall, desperate for an escape route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish...\u201d he said again with an almost imperceptible drop in venom as he held his gemstone clad fist in the air, trying to clear his head to think of an appropriately demeaning punishment for the bitch that magically erased his family from existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could come up with something, he felt someone grab his wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBill. Stop\u201d demanded another voice, the one known as Tammy Ackerton, formerly Tom. Despite being a teenager, her voice carried a motherly demeanor to it(Perhaps leftover from the previous reality), speaking to Bill in a firm yet sympathetic tenor. Bill craned his neck to look at his former best friend turned wife turned girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBill. It's not worth it\u201d continued Tammy in a calm, measured voice. \u201cI know what Gloria did, but this stone is dangerous. Making another wish will  just screw things up even more. Lets calm down and talk about what to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few seconds, Bill noticed that his heart was beating rapidly. He was sweating. His face felt flush to the touch. He was hyper. Tammy was right. He nodded at her in agreement. \u201cOK.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then turned to Gloria, who had grown quiet as a church mouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut first, I think we can both agree that she needs to leave. Get out!\u201d Bill yelled at the young woman like a drill sergeant, pointing firmly towards the front door downstairs. \u201cGet out of my house and don't come back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Gloria had been a little wiser, she would have rushed down the stairs as rapidly as her legs would carry her. If she had simply read the room better, she would have known not to provoke the vengeance obsessed lunatic with the nigh omnipotent magic wishing rock. If she had only been less juvenile, she would have known that this was Bill's one and only warning. She would have known that he was emotionally wounded by her reckless wishing and needed time to heal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, if Gloria couldn't have the last word, if she couldn't dig in her heels even in the face of Armageddon, she wouldn't have been a Vanapoulos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you, Bill!\u201d she yelled defiantly, not allowing her pride to buckle for one second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA painful migraine suddenly erupted in Bill's cranium. He couldn't <i>believe</i> it. His head swished between Tammy on one side and Gloria on the other. He couldn't BELIEVE that someone as kind as Tom/Tammy was had landed someone as irredeemably awful as Gloria. He gritted his teeth as he glared fiercely at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou stupid bitch! I give you a chance to escape, and you still do this shit!\u201d Bill screeched so loudly that he was losing his voice. \u201cI wish that you and Tom had never gone out with each other!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entity within the gemstone smiled. This was the angriest wish the trio had made yet. The upstairs hallway rapidly filled with a thick green-gold mist. Bill heard the screams of Tammy and Gloria before both voices fell into oblivion. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Our hero felt the pangs of disorientation for a few moments before he came to once again, now in his third alternate reality of the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill now  felt like an old pro at the reality hopping business, and so he was not surprised as he found himself not on top the stairs, but standing idly on his front porch. He looked around as he breathed heavily, waiting for the migraine in his head to disappear, quietly listening to the birdsong in the distance. Realizing that he was in a dark place right now with his anger and despair, Bill laid down on the porch hammock and tried to calm down. For about twenty straight minutes he did nothing but concentrate on getting better, and with those precious minutes, get better he did. When he felt ready, he sighed heavily and grinned, his heart beat slowing down to his usual resting rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm going to get through this\u201d he told himself as a mantra. \u201cI'm going to find Kimmy and Mom and Dad, no matter how many wishes it takes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then threw his legs over the hammock and took a minute to enjoy the glorious pleasant suburban morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill sniffed, smelling the pleasant scent of dew and freshly cut grass. His skin exploded in exaltation as he felt the strong gust of wind blowing off of Lake Hopkins not far from home. Gazing downwards, he saw that he was holding the damaged Ahn'Ger Stone tightly in his right hand. He almost wanted to throw it away, but he couldn't, because he needed it. Fleeting thoughts of using the stone's power for more productive purposes crossed his mind, but he quickly put them away for later use. This wasn't a Green Lantern Ring. This wasn't an Infinity Gem. The Ahn'Ger Stone was a curse as long as he didn't know how to properly use it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGazing around the neighborhood, he blinked out all the madness of the last hour. Feeling his face, he felt normal. Oh God, where was he now? No, really? Did humans in this reality all have forked lizard tongues like on that Halloween episode of The Simpsons? Was Tom still a woman? Did Willow still exist? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe neighborhood was eerily quiet. He saw no one around except for a passing blue pick up truck, which he recalled belonged to Jay Rasmussen, a neighbor of the Strasserman's as he was on his way to work. Bill waved at the man in a calming gesture, and as Jay waved back at the young man and turned around the corner, Bill sighed. At least things were a little bit normal here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hands, where did his friends go? Did Bill just wish Tom and Gloria away? God, he hoped not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly one way to find out\u201d he told told himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter resting for nearly a half hour, our hero felt refreshed and peeled his butt off the hammock. He walked inside the front door of what he assumed was his family abode. To his relief, the foyer and the living room appeared to be exactly as he remembered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyone home?!\u201d he shouted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe're in here, Bill!\u201d came a reedy voice that he immediately recognized as belonging to Willow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat\u201d he sighed, realizing that this wasn't his old world, strolling apprehensively into the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen he indeed saw Willow. She was still in her pajamas eating a bowl of Cinnamon Toast Crunch and drinking hot chocolate from a coffee mug with a picture of David Lynch saying \u201cThat's a damn fine cup of coffee\u201d printed on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other end of the breakfast table, with her back to Bill, sat Gloria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey sleepyhead\u201d said Willow with a mouth full of cereal, an impish grin on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So she's still my sister.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Willow\u201d he answered her with caution as he sat down at the table with the two girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just talking to Gloria here over what you did. You're really brave, dude. Really brave. All those superhero stories you like really paid off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Bill asked, genuinely confused. He looked over at Gloria, whose face looked unnaturally shy and mousy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor, um, for sticking up for me in front of the entire school\u201d Gloria answered, practically blushing. Her eyes didn't carry a hint of the pride or vanity that Gloria's eyes usually revealed about her. Right now, they only carried hurt(And possible gratitude?). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't remember doing that. What happened?\u201d asked the teenage boy, feigning(Though not completely feigning) ignorance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point in time, he couldn't imagine ever sticking up for Gloria. Sticking her in a fire maybe, but not helping her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow began explaining, waving her spoon around in the air as she talked with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yesterday that bitchy cheerleader whose in your grade, Vanessa Chandler, outed Gloria in front of the entire school right before the football game. She grabbed a huge speaker phone and told everyone sitting in the bleachers. I wasn't there, but I can only imagine how horrible it was. Gloria said that she started crying, totally humiliated, and ran off the field. People laughed at her. It's...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait\u201d said Bill. \u201cOuted?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria stared at Bill with a weird look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that Tom Ackerton hit you pretty hard, Bill, but still, I didn't expect you to forget that I'm gay\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...\u201d stammered Bill, not knowing how to respond to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe we should just let Bill rest a little more until that concussion goes away\u201d said Willow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria looked at Bill again and grabbed his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry for snapping at you. I'm still glad for what you did. It's nice to have one friend in this town. It's just...God, why are people such trash?\u201d asked Gloria, her defeated face hiding a toxic cocktail of anger, trauma, and exhaustion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's hard to believe, but even in 2018, small towns like Shermer are still virulently homophobic\u201d replied Willow casually. \u201cI should know. Just wait until the people in this town find out about drag queens and genderqueer people\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...somebody hit me?\u201d said Bill, confused.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Tom Ackerton\u201d answered Gloria this time. \u201cAfter Vanessa.,,after she did what she did... people said you ran down the bleachers and grabbed the speaker phone away from her. I guess you really let that bigoted bitch have it, calling her out and telling her and everyone present how ashamed they should be of themselves for their prejudices and their petty bullying bullshit. Then her boyfriend Tom ran up behind and sucker punched you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur parents said you put up a good fight. I'm so proud of you, little brother\u201d grinned Willow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow, Gloria, and the kitchen began to blur out of focus as Bill took in all of this new information, shaking despite himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of world did he fall into now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Continue with Bill, Gloria, and Willow in this new reality<br>\r\nOption 2: Lets meet this reality's Tom Ackerton, sitting in jail. <br>\r\nOption 3: Something else<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

For some ominous reason, he could sense that he far, far away from home, as if the magic rock his was holding had transported him into the Twilight Zone. The bizarre, uncanny mist probably helped, but it was something else too, as if Bill were somehow communing with the Stone itself, sensing its overwhelming life energy like some kind of New Age Retro Hippie gobbledygook. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn invisible presence made itself known to Bill. A strange, androgynous voice that felt omnipresent yet far away began to speak to him: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cThe vessel. You broke it.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho's there?!\u201d yelled Bill, cautiously looking in every direction for the voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cIt will take time to fix. You must find a way to repair what you have broken. Someone who can channel my energy into something more stable. It is no longer safe for you to go home. Chaos reigns there. I only have enough reserve power to transport you to the reality of your previous wish.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice seemed like it was unfamiliar with the concept language, intelligently but clumsily translate its thoughts into words. Bill guessed that the mysterious voice must be involved with the stone somehow. What did it mean by the reality of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d the boy yelled. \u201cYou mean the reality where I'm older?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice didn't respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't want to be a middle aged man. I just want to be me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cThat is not currently possible\u201d</b> announced the voice in its booming authoritative tenor, cutting the teenager off. With that, Bill once again felt his body being yanked into yet another alternate reality...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGah!\u201d Bill screamed, looking at what strange place he was stuck in now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill shook his head, feeling almost jet lagged by the experience. Our hero looked around, and saw that he was no longer was standing in an endless fog.  Now he was sitting in somebodies living room. Not his own Strassermen family living room, but one that was unfamiliar to him. It looked pretty. Heavy curtains draped against long bay windows, the sun casting shadows over two solidly built camelback sofas(One of which Bill was sitting on), a grandfather clock, a large flatscreen TV, and an old fashioned writing desk tucked into the corner of the room. A large Persian rug covered most of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of Bill laid an antique Ottoman coffee table with an open laptop sitting on top. Before Bill could see what was on it, the front door opened and closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Mom. Working on your new book?\u201d asked a happy, inquisitive voice as its owner locked herself inside and skipped over to Bill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Bill a moment to realize it, but the girl was Gloria. Despite having no reason to believe so, something in his mind just clicked. He just intuitively knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face was structured differently now, her Mediterranean good looks replaced by the WASPy countenance of Bill and Tom's family lines. Her distinctive green eyes were now a bluish-gray, the same color as Tom's. Her hair was now a dark brunette like Bill instead of a glossy black. In some ways she looked like a slightly older version of Kimberly, just mixed with some of Tom's characteristics. Still...everything else about her was Gloria. Her voice. Her mannerisms. The way she carried herself. This was Gloria, in spirit if not appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut why did she call Bill Mom? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, why are you staring at me like that? Mom, are you OK? Mom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down into a pair of breasts, Bill received his answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, not again!\u201d he screamed in a husky, sensual voice which clearly wasn't his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill ran upstairs to find a mirror...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily, as if this body wasn't used to any form of exercise, Bill huffed and puffed as he reached the upstairs bathroom and locking himself into it. Gazing into the mirror just above the sink, he realized that he was indeed now a middle aged mother. Roughly twenty minutes ago, the Stone transformed him into a middle aged man. Now  he was a middle aged woman, and if that weird voice was telling the truth, the stone was now broken. He might be stuck this way for a long time. Damn you, Gloria! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs our hero took a deep breath and calmed down, splashing some water on his face from the bathroom sink, he gradually took greater stock of his new face. He looked strikingly like his own mother Martha, just slightly off thanks to his father's genes playing a role in the cocktail that was Bill. Nevertheless, he was obviously his mother's offspring. His now diminished height, his long brunette hair, his bone structure, the curvy body shape. If he had been born female and been allowed to grow into middle age, this is probably what Bill would end up looking like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was pretty, thought Bill, for an older woman at least.  He noticed that his new body was dressed slightly bohemian, sporting a floral tunic dress and some black leggings. He had a pair of black framed cats eye glasses tucked into the collar of his tunic and a gold necklace adored with some sort of occult symbol. As he continued to breath, his not insignificant breasts rose up and down, up and down, up and down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud knock erupted from the bathroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: \u201cMom, are you OK?\u201d asked the altered Gloria, worrying why her mother had flipped out all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: \u201cWillow? Honey?\u201d asked the grown up Tom Ackerton, Bill's new husband, who has a few secrets of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Bill hyperventilates and passes out.</span></div></div>",

The teenage boy had been entirely unaware of the damage to the Stone, and had no idea that his wish wasn't going to be granted in the way he wanted or expected. He just wanted the Gloria problem to end once and for all, and in his enraged state he rambled off the first thing that came to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when the clouds of light rolled away into nothingness and Bill was able to see once more, he knew that something was very, very wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Due to the Stone's damaged state, the magical artifact determines that the nicest person in proximity to it is Tammy, and is doing so, changes Gloria to be Tammy's daughter!

As he waved his arms in a vain attempt to clear the air, the teenage boy wasn't sure why the magic had been released in a cloudy smog like fashion as opposed to just pure light, but Bill knew something was different as the air cleared and visibility returned to his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Bill knew that something had changed. He was now in the living room, on first floor of his house, sitting on the couch alone with the Ahn'Ger Stone with Tammy and Gloria nowhere to be seen. While he wasn't overly concerned with Gloria's disappearance, the lack of a Tammy in his home was cause enough for alarm. As he was about to call out for his erstwhile best friend turned wife turned...whatever Tammy was to him now, a loud pounding on the Strasserman home's front door forced him to put that particular worry aside for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling himself up from the familiar comfort of the couch, Bill cautiously crossed the threshold between the living room and the foyer and stared at the large wooden door and the figures beyond it's cloudy crystal glass pane. It was always hard for Bill to tell who was out there if it wasn't someone whose silhouette looked familiar to him, like Tom's did...had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill paused for a moment to look down at his left hand which held the strange wishing artifact that had forever changed his life for the weirder. Just like it had Tom's. But the larger figure beyond the glass lifted a fist and began pounding on the door once more, shaking Bill out of his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming!\" He called out, moving towards the door and opening it to a shock which caused his jaw to go limp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, in the doorway, stood a very tired looking Tammy and a much younger, blonder version of Gloria, clutching Tammy's hand and staring at Bill with wide, brown eyes. A version of Gloria that looked to be only three years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Beyond, parked on the curb, was a somewhat dinky looking Cavalier that had the same pain job as Tom's Mustang had, right down to the pinstriping, although on this particularly car, said pinstriping was chipping all along the length of the car and the idling engine seemed to be stuttering as it waited for it's owner to return. Clearly Tammy was no longer the 'walk to school' type of girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Tammy turned to Bill, dragging his attention back to the woman, and the soft look on her face turned somewhat hard, similar to how Tom had looked when the fighting with Gloria had first started, before it had nearly broken him.

As Bill's mind processed the information, he managed to get a good look at Tammy, and it was clear she was still the same girl she had been moments earlier, before his wish had twisted things even further from the reality that they'd all originally started in what felt like a lifetime ago. Although the dark circles under her eyes and the lack of any sort of make-up, the barely combed hair and least amount of effort outfit clearly did not show the same adorably sexy geek girl that Bill was familiar with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm sorry I'm running late, okay? Between finals at school and taking care of Gloria I just overslept\" Tammy said with a sigh while Gloria huddled closer to Tammy's leg, still staring at Bill with wide, brown eyes that clearly only he remembered being a different color just minutes ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former Vanapolos was wearing a pink My Little Pony shirt, a pair of black tights and tiny Frozen shoes that lit up as Gloria shifted back and forth on her feet. A small, pink MLP backpack hung from her tiny shoulders, previously concealed by the matching pink shirt and Gloria's lengthy golden hair. Now that he could get a good look at it, Bill could see that there was only enough of Gloria's previous identity left in her face to make him recognize who she used to be, instead, Gloria's face was a mix of Tammy and Bill's own features, brown eyes, blond hair, flatter cheekbones and a slightly upturned nose that had replaced the sharp, elegant one that Gloria's previous genetic make-up had given her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was absolutely no doubt about it, this version of Gloria was Bill and Tammy's daughter. But if they were still teenagers and Gloria looked to be at least three years old...The consequences of his wish made Bill's mind do some additional somersaults while Tammy's face began to turn hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you coming?

He couldn't exactly remember why, but that seemed so unlike her, Bill somehow recalling his girlfriend being a very serious student concerned with getting into a good college. In the original reality, Tom Ackerton was never exactly Mr. Punctuality, and Bill never remembered him having concrete plans for his future after high school. So why did he remember Tammy as...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh shit, Bill thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree sets of memories, one brain. All of the trips through the different dimensions caused by the stone was messing with his ability to keep them all straight! Memories from one reality where he and Tammy began going together suddenly came to mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiddle school. Eighth grade.  They were study buddies. Tammy had helped him out in biology once, and he helped her in algebra. They started geeking out over different mutual interests, and that was when Tammy first pecked him on the cheek. Then one thing led to another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the other, other reality, where Bill and Tammy grew into middle age and married, he now recalled how they sat together in a college class on human sexuality. She was much more studious than he had been, and indeed, had never been late for class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a depressed realization, he guessed that in the reality he currently found himself in, Tammy being a teen mother had taken up all of her time, preventing her from focusing on anything else, whether that included school, her appearance, or Bill himself. Aye yai yai yai yai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney?\u201d he heard Tammy ask, who along with Gloria was already hallway down the sidewalk to the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Right. Sorry. Zoned out for a minute\u201d said Bill as he locked his front door and followed the mother and daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood thing I listened to the weather app and brought an umbrella\u201d Tammy casually mentioned as everyone settled inside the Cavalier, Bill in the passenger seat and Gloria in the back, still using a car seat. The clouds were now considerably darker than they had been ten minutes ago, the light drizzle had intensified into a full on thunderstorm. Windshield wipers up, the young family drove down the avenue and around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither Bill nor Tammy said a word during the trip, the two damaged lovebirds just focusing on the drive. Tammy's phone was playing \u201cSeasons of Love\u201d from the Rent soundtrack as it sat on the dashboard, Bill recalling that his girlfriend was into musicals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria meanwhile was enraptured in a Little Golden Book adaptation of the last Star Wars movie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin exactly seven minutes, the two young parents arrived at the daycare facility where Gloria would stay for the day until 3:30 P.M when Tammy picked her up, her own parents not arriving home from work until later in the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to come in?\u201d asked Tammy through the passenger side window as she held little Gloria in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill stared at Gloria as her brown eyes bored right through to his soul. He couldn't...he didn't WANT to believe that the girl that he hated was now this sweet little cherubic angel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm fine. I'll sit here\u201d he practically whispered through the window, the raindrops sounding like Iwo Jima as they pelted Tammy's loyal vehicle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuit yourself. They make pretty good hot chocolate here\u201d said the sweet blonde as she walked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill waited, staring intensely at the Ahn'Ger Stone as he took it out of his pocket. He just wanted to just get back home to normal life. He didn't even necessarily mind if Big Jon and Rob Bolstrum were there. He just needed some normalcy. Maybe when he could control the powerful artifact would he ever consider using it again. He thought of different ways he could trigger himself safely into anger so he could make a wish, not noticing the crack which ran through the gem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later, Tammy walked back outside, an umbrella shielding herself from the onslaught of cold rain as she held a white Styrofoam cup of hot chocolate in her other hand. She closed the umbrella, got inside, put the drink in her cup holder, and shut the door harder than Bill expected a girl of her size to. She then stared at Bill with the saddest eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBill, honey, we really need to talk. Before we go, we really, really need to talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about?\u201d he gulped, feeling vaguely uncomfortable by the environment he found himself in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout us\u201d she said forebodingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...\u201d she said, hesitating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI've done everything I can to comfort you through this, Bill\u201d she continued, grabbing his right arm tenderly. \u201cI know how much you didn't want to be a father this young. I know I sure as hell didn't expect to be a mother this young, but I think we're finally going to have to start sharing responsibility for Gloria.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill stared at Tammy as her face went through a torrent of emotions- Frustration, anger, empathy, despair- before going on with her plea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know how much my life has taken a hit since it happened. Stuff you'll never have to worry about like stretch marks, losing the baby weight, being called a slut by Big Jon and his gang of pricks and a whore who should have kept her legs shut by bitchy neighbors like Mrs. Casey. My life's been hell\u201d she said, laughing bitterly, rolling her eyes at the memory of the old bat attempting to shame her one morning. \u201cMeanwhile, your stock went up. You get called a player. A pimp. You have guys on the football team congratulating you, saying \u201cI didn't know you had it in you!\u201d. You can understand my frustration in the double standards we both had, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill nodded his head. He hadn't expected this at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry, Tammy. If I only knew...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's fine. You're a good guy deep down. The sweet little dork I fell in love with isn't dead yet. I know that. Anyway, my parents have been really cool about Gloria for the most part, but hey, I have ears, OK? I hear them talk at night when my door is shut. I heard Dad whisper to Mom one night that he was disappointed in me, and I cried myself to sleep. Bill...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA memory emerged in Bill's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...know how close you and your dad are. That must have hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt did\u201d said Tammy. \u201cBut like I said, they're mostly cool about it. They like being grandparents. Still...I need a break. I...I just wish that you would do your part and take care of her every once in a while. To stop shirking responsibility. To stop making excuses. Be a Dad. I have a life too! And we both owe it to her that she sees both of her parents.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill's eyes betrayed a total and complete blindside. In this new, colder reality, he was apparently a deadbeat father. It floored him. He stared dead eyed at Tammy for what seemed like an eternity before she snapped him out of it. He had thought that a world without Kimmy or his parents was the worst reality he could imagine, but somehow...somehow this might have been even worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust think about it\u201d said Tammy, starting the engine and pulling away from the parking lot on the way to school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: At school, Bill discovers a big surprise: Willow is there! She is still Bill's sister in this reality, and is his only real friend there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Lets follow the life of childless Ariadne Vanapoulos<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Meanwhile at daycare...</span></div></div>",

In the brief moment he had before Tammy handed him a small duffel bag that had been, until now, sitting unseen off to the side of the door, Bill realized she must have been at least five years older, making her twenty-three, at least. And her outfit was entirely different, gone were the geek-chic clothes that teenage Tammy had worn, instead replaced with a simple pair of jeans and a featureless sweatshirt that was at least one size too big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Bill realized he felt slightly...off. Had he been changed by his own wish? And if this was his 'day of from work' and not a single mention of high school at all, did that mean the he too was older? But he had no time to check his body for any changes as the duffel bag was thrust into his arms and Tammy was leaning down to Gloria's tiny form, enveloping the former Vanapolous in a massive embrace ending with a tender kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy loves you, Gloria, have fun with daddy and I'll pick you up after work okay\" Tammy said, ending the embrace with another kiss on the cheek before placing a hand on the back of Gloria's My Little Pony shirt and pushing her gently towards Bill. The small child took a few steps forward and reached a tiny hand our for Bill's much larger one, sliding tiny, soft fingers onto Bill's hand, the one that contained the Ahn'Ger Stone, still clenched behind the flesh and bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay mommy, I love you!\" Gloria said, her voice youthful, full of energy and a hint of sadness as Tammy stood and faced Bill once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we have time later, we really need to talk, okay Bill? It's important\" Bill's mind was currently doing a somersault as it tried to process the information, but he could see that Tammy was fighting back tears. The look on her face was something Bill had only seen when Tom and Gloria had, several realities ago, had their big 'relationship talk' that would always end with them getting back together. Was...was that what is was for Bill and Tammy now? But the sad look on Tammy's face hardened as Bill remained silent, eyes that were almost pleading with him narrowing at his silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill didn't need another hint. \"Uh, yeah! Yes. We should talk later\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy's face softened again and the hint of smile flashed across her face. \"Good! Maybe tonight?\" Tammy's face brightened as Bill agreed, a hand reaching out and giving his right arm a soft squeeze. And with that, Tammy turned and walked off Bill's porch and back to her car. With one last kiss blown and a wave, clearly intended towards Gloria who simply waved and screamed out \"BYE MOMMY I LOVE YOU!\" at the top of her little voice. And then Tammy was gone, pulling down the street and off into her apparently very busy day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of watching the brake lights fade into the darkening morning as the storm rolled over the town, Bill felt a tugging at his hand and he looked down at an eager little face that only held slight traces of Gloria's previous parentage, and was largely a younger version of Tammy's face with a smidgen of Bill's own features thrown in. She was clearly Bill's daughter. Gloria Strasserman. Or would it be Gloria Ackerton? Or instead of finding out, maybe he should just try to wish everything back to normal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy can I watch your TV?\" Gloria asked, her eyes shimmering with excitement.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I wish you'd been raised by someone that taught you how to be nice to others!\" Bill roared, and the upper hallway of the Strasserman residence was immediately filled with a heavy green bank of fog that poured forth from BIll's clenched fist. His vision fell away to nothing but a wall of pale green as the clouds engulfed everything before suddenly receding back within the gemstone. Blinking the last vestiges of smoke from his eyes, he saw that the only two people in the hallway were now himself and Tammy, who was rubbing and blinking her own eyes, clearing the remnants of the magic from her vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Gloria was nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill couldn't help but crack a hateful grin at the empty spot on the carpet that Gloria had inhabited just moments ago before relaxing his fist and sliding the Ahn'Ger Stone out to rest between his thumb and index finger, a thin tendril of green smoke trailing of of the large crack in it's surface that Bill had yet to notice.  Had Bill had noticed the damage to the Ahn'Ger Stone, Bill might have realized that his wish to create a nice version of Gloria had gone horribly, utterly wrong. Instead of making it so that Gloria had been born to a family that would raise her not to be so controlling, manipulative, selfish and uncaring of others, instead the damaged Stone had done the complete opposite. In it's damaged state it had reached out and detected the two meanest individuals in the area, changing them to be suitable as parents of the former Gloria Vanapolous. But Bill knew none of this, and he began to revel in his victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, you do something right for a change!\" Bill said triumphantly, giving Tammy a huge grin as though he'd just done something amazingly heroic. For so long Tom had suffered, and by extension, Bill had suffered under Gloria's tyrannical yoke, and with the final straw of changing Bill's entire family around, wiping his little sister from existence and putting his and Tammy's daughter in the role as his older sister was just too much to bear anymore. He had done it, Bill had finally removed the problem from their lives! Now he could (maybe) wish Tom back to normal and they could go on enjoying their lives as it should have been, not what Gloria had turned it into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as his eyes focused on Tammy, he saw that the disgraced basketball star turned adorable geek girl next door had undergone changes herself, and not for the better. His grin faded immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGone was the slight layer of fat that had given Tammy her adorable softness, now the teenage boy turned girl was clearly overweight as her waistline had ballooned outward, her face now chunky and splotched by acne marks, rounded off by a double chin while a pair of tired eyes stared out from behind a pair of glasses. Her hair was now a mess, a mousy, dull nest of blonde hair that looked like it hadn't been properly cared for in a long time, and even Tammy's imported fashion sense, geek-chic had been replaced by a pair of oversized jeans topped by a featureless gray sweatshirt, both of which did little to hide Tammy's newly oversized body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bill, what did you do?\" Tammy asked weakly as she stared down at herself in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Meanwhile, elsewhere...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings had happened so fast for Gloria. One moment she had been confused as to why Bill had seemed so upset, and then the next moment he had hit her and taken the gemstone! Then Strasserman had screamed his wish and then everything had gone...green? She felt herself moving, her body changing and shifting before suddenly the world popped back into focus, and Gloria found herself laying on a bed that smelled strongly of cheap beer and cigarettes, stinging her sensitive noise as her body suddenly felt weighed down, her stomach churning as her head began to throb painfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, oh god...\" Gloria moaned, and pulled herself upright, untangling herself from the sheets of the bed and stumbling across thin carpet, alien glass bottles clattering as the teenager struggled to maintain her balance while the contents of her stomach began a quick and violent climb upwards towards her mouth. She reached for the dim outline of a door and jerked it open without stopping, Gloria stumbled out of the very small room and crashed into the opposite wall of a very narrow hallway. Somehow, she instinctively knew where to go, barefoot thundering a few steps down the short hallway and into the darkened opening she somehow knew was a particularly filthy bathroom. Her hands flew out into the shadows and bounced painfully off the hard plastic of a light switch, her fingers stinging as she reached out again and flipped the switch upwards, filling the bathroom with weak, yellow light. Had Gloria had the time to take in her surrounding and not make an immediate beeline for the toilet, she would have seen that it was filthy, stains on the walls and tile, an overflowing garbage basket and a tub that more than a few beer cans in it. But Gloria simply dashed for the porcelain throne, knelt in front of it, and vomited up the contents of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcid and bile surged through Gloria's body while salty tears stung her eyes, her hair dangling dangerously close to the foul water of the toilet bowel. Gloria's body heaved and retched for several minutes as it purged itself of the excess booze and stomach acids before finally she pulled back as the last of the bile spilled from her mouth in a long tendril of drool. She spit the last of the terrible contents out of her mouth and collapsed backwards against a wall that seemed far too thin as the world swirled around her. Gloria closed her eyes and shifted into a slightly more comfortable position for a few moments before finding the energy in her drained body to pull herself upwards, a hand that lacked her manicured nails grasping the small counter that held the bathroom's small sink, and above it, the lone medicine cabinet. The only one in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'How do I know all this? 'Why do I feel so weird?'</i> Gloria thought to herself as she slowly pulled herself up, her free hand pushing the toilet's handle downward and sending the stinking mess from her insides down into the septic tank, her entire body feeling strange beyond the massive hangover that she was clearly suffering from. Her questions were answered as she finally stood and looked at herself in the mirror, her changed eyes going wide in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of being almost a foot taller, Gloria's entire body had been changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGone were her Mediterranean looks, the large nose, the silky black hair that once hung down her back replaced with short strawberry blonde curls that barely went past her ears, her eyes now a strange blue-green crowned by thick eyebrows that had more than a few piercings. A light smattering of freckles across her plain cheeks and thin, pursed lips that replaced her previously full ones completed a face that could have, with enough work and make-up, been attractive. Now she was rather plain, with vague Nordic features that seemed to be cancelled out by the other half of her new genetic code. Even below her neck, Gloria's good looks had been re-arranged, her breasts were different and larger than they had been before, hanging freely beneath a ratty gray t-shirt that had more than a few stains on it. Gloria's arms were larger than she remembered them being, toned and muscled, and covered in tattoos that led to two large hands that seemed to be almost twice the size of their original form. Her hips were more or less gone, simply small curves on the road to her legs which, despite feeling like they were made of concrete at the moment, were clearly just as toned and muscled as her arms were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god!\" Gloria screamed, throwing herself away from the counter and slamming once more into a wall that felt perilously thin. \"What did Bill do to me!?\" She screamed, as she stared at her new body in horror. Even her voice was different! Gone was her cute soprano, her voice now deeper, huskier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut further inspection was impossible as a great rumbling came from the next room over. A bed creaked loudly and the sound of two feet thundering closer through the clattering of bottles and cans before the door next to the bathroom tore open and an ominous, very angry shape appeared in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck did I tell you about making noise!?\" The very female voice hissed in anger, and it took a moment for the identity of the older, topless woman in front of her to register.  Knowledge, unbidden, began to pour into her mind, reinforcing the familiarity of her surroundings as suddenly she became aware that beyond her physical appearance, she wasn't Gloria Vanapolous anymore. There was something else in her, something that was born of the small, falling apart trailer she now knew was her home, had been her home her entire life. Anger, resentment, hate, survival instincts against not just the woman in front of her, someone she knew she was stronger than but still felt an intense fear towards, but the rest of the world for how she had been raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-fuck!\" Gloria barked, the expletive feeling...familiar yet alien to her, \"I-I'm sorry...mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You damn well better be!\" Hissed...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Now get me a beer! Better be fucking cold!\" Bobbi Ingerman hissed at Gloria as she scuttled down the narrow hallway, new memories emerging from some hidden recess in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't Gloria Vanapolous anymore. She was Carol Ingerman, daughter of Jonathan Ingerman and Bobbi Bolstrum, which she now knew as her parents, but the clinging memories of her previous life told her that this was wrong, that Rob and Big Jon were the bullies of the high school that Gloria...Carol barely attended. And was always on the edge of expulsion from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her parents were older, not teenagers, and Bobbi, mom, definitely wasn't a guy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe handful of photos that hung on the stained walls of the small single wide trailer confirmed the new memories: A couple of photos of mom and dad when they were in high school some thirty years ago. Short stack mom's perpetual scowl and mane of wild red hair sitting above two large pendulums barely contained by a crop top, arm wrapped around dad in his varsity jacket. A picture of them getting married, mom in a cheap thrift store veil and low cut dress, dad in a dress jacket that was obviously loaned, a court magistrate behind them. A picture of herself as a infant, then another one that had clearly been taken just a few years ago as Glo...Carol scowled at the camera outside a bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I...Why is this happening!?' The part of her that was still Gloria said as she stopped to stare at the photos before taking in the rest of the small domicile she now/always had lived in. The 'living room' was little more than a pile of trash, pizza boxes, beer bottles, cans, fast food wrappers and more ashtrays and cigarette butts. The brown curtains that at some point in their lives had been white were pulled tightly shut, while a long, threadbare couch and a decrepit looking recliner dominated the rest of the room. An old box TV, one that still had a VHS deck and a DVD player sat lifelessly in the far corner. Carol's memories knew that it didn't work most of the time, not that anyone in the Ingerman 'home' ever bothered to watch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make me come get it myself, you stupid cunt!\" Came the harpyish cry of Carol's mother, and Gloria's fragile train of thought stopped dead in it's tracks as the 'new' part of her took over, a spike of fear forcing the girll's new body on a familiar path through the garbage and into the attached kitchen, which was in no better shape. Carol reached the buzzing fridge, opened the door to the unwelcome smell of food gone bad, and pulled out a bottle of Brier's, mom's favorite brand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming, mom!\" Carol called out, her voice croaky as her heart tried to leave her throat. Her mother was not to be crossed, Bobbi Ingerman, back when she was a Bolstrum, had always been trouble. Her body blooming at an early age, using it to her advantage and royally destroying anyone that got in her way. High school drop out, frequent patron and employee of bars in the local area, chain smoker. She only barely cleaned up her act when she met Jon Ingerman, a football star that had more than a bit of a bad boy streak. They'd hooked up, and then mom got sent to women's prison for two years for assaulting another girl that had flirted with Jon, and during a conjugal Carol had been conceived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly all of Bobbi's pregnancy had been in prison, under watchful lock and key. In the back of her mind Carol knew she had the same prison system that she herself was narrowly avoiding to thank for not being born some booze baby retard. Not that it had saved her from other things, given Bobbi hadn't been much of a mother, doing just enough to stay on foot ahead of having her 'welfare ticket' taken away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she made her way back through the living room and down the hallway, where her mother waited in the doorway of the trailer's 'master bedroom', she subconsciously rubbed the cold beer bottle on the scar where, during one drunken night when Carol had been little, the little girl had accidentally knocked over a lamp while playing, and Bobbi had beaten the shit out of her, snapping her arm to the bone and forever instilling within the girl a deep fear of her mother. There had been plenty of other beatings, some deserved, some undeserved, but Carol knew that her mother was a woman to be feared above all others, even if what she was now was a short, overweight hag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, mom\" Carol said, reaching her mother at the end of the hallway, who simply grabbed the bottle and turned back into her darkened bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow as hell. Should have had your dumb ass aborted when I had the chance\" Bobbi said, turning and sneering at her daughter. Carol shrugged off the insult, adding it to the mountain that had accumulated in the eighteen years of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, mom\" Was all she could say, looking down at her feet like she was supposed to. 'I guess she's too tired or hungover. No slap' she thought to herself as she waited for her dismissal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobbi stared at her for a moment before grabbing hold of the door with a fat, meaty hand, \"Just get the fuck out of here and go to school. Or better yet, follow in my footsteps and get a fucking job and start helping pay the bills. Should just throw your skank ass out for freeloading\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, mom\" Carol said, and for a long moment she expected another tirade of insults, or physical abuse to come flying her way, but with a disgusted sigh, Bobbi Ingerman simply slammed the door in Carol's face. From beyond the door the teen could hear her mother crack open the beer and mutter \"Just like her fucking father...\" before Carol turned and made her way back to the tiny closet that was her room in the tiny trailer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria resurfaced as the teen entered the small bedroom, which was littered with a handful of beer bottles and stank of cigarette smoke, dozens of butts filling up an ashtray on the smallest bedside table Gloria had ever seen sitting beneath the window. The Carol part of her mind told her she should get out of there, and Gloria found herself drifting over to the closet, pulling out a pair of jeans that had seen better days and the most conservative top she could find; which was a black t-shit, one of the few that looked like it wasn't for sleeping in. Quickly changing clothes (and discovering that she was right at a D cup bra size), Gloria/Carol pulled on her sneakers and left the trailer, exiting out into another world that was both alien and familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Shermer Fields trailer court. Little more than a tornado bait collection of run-down trailers, the Fields were skid row. It was quiet this morning, but that wasn't anything unusual. Most of the inhabitants of the Fields were much like the Ingermans; poor, and perpetually drunk or high, living in squalor because they simply could not hold down any sort of real job for longer than it took to get a paycheck or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh that saw the Gloria part of her personality slip back beneath the mental waves, Carol made her way towards the trailer park's entrance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe the bitches will be there' She thought, her small group of equally...financially disabled lackeys that grouped together not out of any particular like of each other, but because it was easier to get what they wanted when they stuck together. Carol at least hoped that Marcy Collins was there, she was the one with the car after all. As she walked, the last words of Bobbi floated back into Carol's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like her fucking father...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol barely knew the man who had given her the height, the athletic build and slight Nordic features that poked through her mother's genetics. At best, her earliest memories were of a phantom that drank heavily and largely ignored her, and then as a name of a child support check. He and mom were not divorced, but it was clear whatever marriage they had was long over. Carol hadn't even seen the man in four years, the last time he had shown up had been for a day, long enough to sleep off a hangover before he was gone again. Carol knew he was still in the local area, that she had half-sisters somewhere out in the world. That her mother had ruined whatever career her father had hoped to have in football by turning him into an alchoholic and trapping him for good after the fateful conjugal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuck seemed to be with Carol as she rounded the last trailer and saw Marcy sitting there in her rusting green car. Giving the bulldog faced girl a short wave, Carol marched across the gravel and, with a painfully loud creak of the ancient car's doors, settled into her 'friend's' vehicle, which smelled exactly like Carol's bedroom. The two exchanged a quick hello, and then they were off to school. Carol stared out the window at the world passing her by as her thoughts lingered on her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of being like him made Carol bristle, the old familiar anger surfacing quickly and easily. Not just at her father, but her mother, her life. Herself. Much as Carol tried, she  couldn't escape her mother's words. Violence came easily to her, the pent up emotions from a non-childhood of neglect and abuse, falling into the same spiral that had trapped her mother and father. Carol wanted to be better, to be more than she was, but all she had been able to do thus far was stay one head above the rising water of life; grades that were just high enough to pass and keeping her business at school away from school. And mostly away from the cops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until that fucking Tammy Ackerton had squealed about Carol vandalizing Mr. Kirkpatrick's car after the old fool had given Ingerman detention for being late to class. Again. The little pig had been Carol's favorite target in life, the mousy little thing and her pushover personality. Carol's constant verbal and sometimes physical abuse had led to girl into stress eating, making her get fat and miserable. And that faggoty little nerd she went out with...what was his name?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bill!\" Gloria said as she drifted further and further away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ackerton's fucktoy? Why you talking about him?\" Marcy's gravel voice asked.</span></div></div>",

She squeamishly poked at the flab on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTammy, I...I didn't mean to...I...\u201d Bill stuttered, in equal disbelief as he stared at his girlfriend with eyes that shifted between distress, guilt, and subconscious disgust. What the hell had just happened? The lanky teenager couldn't understand what part of his wish had caused Tammy to transform into a four-eyed pizza faced blimp!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA foreign part of Bill felt guilty about thinking of Tammy that way as he rubbed his eyes to remember something that had just slipped his mind. He knew how much the female bullies of the school like Carol Ingerman liked to torment her, just like how the male bullies such as Jules Harper enjoyed tormenting him. Bill knew that overeating and other eating disorders were a common if unhealthy way many people dealt with stress... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Wait.</b> Who the hell was Carol? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, who is Carol Ingerman?\u201d he asked Tammy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone who I\u2019d never not talk about right now\u201d Tammy answered sarcastically, sighing at the expansive rear end she now owned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, I\u2019ll figure it out myself\u201d muttered Bill impertinently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne part of Bill already who Carol was, a tall and tattooed troublemaker who came from a broken home in the bad part of town, and more or less Jules Harper\u2019s gun moll, someone who Tammy was utterly terrified of, but something about that just felt wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother part of Bill, the part that felt less real and yet somehow more <i>right</i>, had never heard of such a person. This part of him felt a mental cavity, a gap in his memory of someone else who constantly caused drama for him and Tammy, someone who never failed to make him really, really angry. He knew that it wasn't Carol Ingerman. It was somebody similar to Carol, but not her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew her name, it was just on the tip of his tongue. Greta? No, but it definitely started with a G. Gretchen? Gwen? Georgina? Grace?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry as he might, he just couldn\u2019t place her. It was such a frustrating, almost alien sensation, like a page torn in the middle of a novel you're reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Jules? Jules Harper was a known bully, yet another member of the infamous Shermer Fields peanut gallery and nobody that Bill wanted to cross, but wasn't it somebody else who always gave him a hard time? Or was it? It was so hard to tell with his brain bearing the weight of two separate versions of reality. One version was telling him that Jules was the kingpin of Shermer High with Carol at his side, and the other one said that Jules was just a flunkie of someone else, someone bigger and meaner than him. Jesus Christ, what else had changed in Bill\u2019s life?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raged at the inanimate object he held in his hand, resisting the urge to throw it against the wall. Tammy\u2019s head swiveled up from appraising her newly fattened physique, her rat\u2019s nest of blonde curls limply falling to the back of her neck. She saw that her boyfriend was still not in a good place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe stone fucked us again, Tammy! First it erases my family, and now it's playing with my memories!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurious and frustrated beyond belief, his face flushed with red and his lungs breathing hard. He was about to give in to his urges childishly throw the stone against the farthest wall of the hallway, hopefully smashing the fucking thing into itty bitty pieces, when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBill, stop! You're better than this\u201d Tammy demanded. Impulsively, she clasped his hands. \u201cThis isn\u2019t you. The man that I love isn\u2019t a raging lunatic. He\u2019s kind and compassionate and thinks things through!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Bill felt a surge of electricity course through his veins. Even though Tammy was chubby and to his shame admittedly less physically attractive to her now, her voice still sounded like honey, and her embrace still felt angelic. She was also, as she always was, the far more levelheaded of the two. Like a passing summer breeze, his anger went away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m sorry. Tammy, I think that I\u2019m going crazy! I\u2019ve got two different sets of memories in my head. I mean, apart from the memories where we\u2019re married, which I\u2019m still having trouble accepting, and...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, I know. I'm going through the same thing. Listen, I think I know what happened. When you lost your temper and slapped Carol in the face, I saw it fly out of her hand and launch towards the window. See?.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy pointed towards the window overlooking the backyard, where a spiderweb full of cracks in the glass could be clearly seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no!\u201d Bill moaned again. \u201cMy new parents are going to kill me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're missing the point. I think the gem is broken.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBroken?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTammy, it\u2019s not an X-Box controller. I mean gemstones are formed under extreme heat and pressure, right? They don\u2019t just get damaged.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes, they do honey. Trust me. I\u2019m a woman who knows her jewelry. Remember all the pretty things you used to buy me for our anniversaries? I mean, emeralds aren\u2019t as fragile as eggshells or anything, but they get scratched all the time, and if you throw them hard enough, they\u2019re going to get chipped.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like Carol\u2019s a professional baseball player or something!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBill! Whether or not that awful bitch deserved it or <i>not</i> is not the point! She was scared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, OK\u201d stammered Bill impatiently. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying that when I slapped Carol, she accidentally threw the stone against the window, and then it got chipped or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr something. It\u2019s probably worse than chipped to be perfectly honest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd then what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know! Maybe the magic inside spilled out. Like, um, like...remember that episode of Buffy The Vampire Slayer? The Wish?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never watched Buffy. That was your show, not mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh for God\u2019s sake. I\u2019m saying that the emerald is like a vessel, OK? It\u2019s filled with magical energy, and once it got broken, the magic spilled out or something. You made some kind of wish about her being nicer. Good luck with that by the way, but maybe once the emerald got damaged, it\u2026.misunderstood what you were saying? Goddamn it, Bill, just open your hand and let me see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill reluctantly opened the his clenched palm, and Tammy gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight in the center of the gorgeous gemstone was a deep fault line. Faint wisps of green and gold smoke could be seen billowing out from it like a burning ember from a campfire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gloria darted out of the bathroom and began to scuttle down the narrow hallway when she felt a had grab her shoulder. She spun around on the spot and suddenly the realization clicked as new memories flooded into her mind. This was her mother, Joanna Bolstrum, and the hulking mass of muscle beyond her in the darkened 'master bedroom' of the single wide trailer was her father, Rob Bolstrum. But that couldn't be right, Rob Bolstrum was a bully at Shermer high, and Joanna was supposed to be Big Jon Ingerman, the ringleader of all the bullies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What is happening here!?' Gloria thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. Carol, honey, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. I'm just tired, Your father just went to sleep, and the last thing either of us needs is for him to wake up\" Joanna Bolstrum's voice was softer, quieter than it had been moments before. In a flash of emotions Gloria felt herself giving way to the flood of memories as she realized her name, along with everything else about her, was different. She wasn't Gloria Vanapolous anymore, she was Carol Bolstrum!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol turned to face her mother once more, and felt a enormous need to hug her. Large breasts pushed against large breasts as Gloria...Carol pulled her mother in close. The two women were of equal size, though Joanna was so much more curvier, even if years of hard living had dulled her once staggering beauty somewhat. She was where Carol got most of her physical attributes from, the large breasts, the strong Nordic features that poked through her father's genetics, the blonde of her strawberry blonde hair that would very easily cascade down her back if she ever let it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, mom\" Carol whispered as she felt the comforting embrace of her long suffering mother, \"This was just a pretty bad one. I feel terrible\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, dear. But you've got to take others into account. After all, it's not you who has to fight with your father to keep him from doing stupid things until six in the morning\" Joanna whispered back, releasing Carol from the embrace. \"Come on, I'll fix you some breakfast before you head to school\" Carol reached for something on her side of the door and pulled out a faded robe, sliding it over her bare shoulders and tying the not like it was second nature before gently sliding past Carol and moving down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carol followed her mother down the narrow hallway and into the rest of the single wide trailer the Bolstrum family lived in, Gloria resurfaced, having been momentarily shoved 'below water' as the intense emotions of Carol had overwhelmed her personality. The trailer was, despite the bathroom's appearance, was remarkably clean. It wasn't filth free, but it was clear that the public part of the house was kept in a state of presentability. The floors were clean, and only the small coffee table that sat in front of the faded couch had six beer bottles on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you get those for me, dear?\" Her mom said as they passed the small mess, and suddenly Gloria flickered away for a moment as Carol stopped and dutifully collected the bottles, before following her mother into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you like?\" Joanna asked, as she opened the refridgerator door, revealing a somewhat small but non-expired selection of food. \"I'm feeling like...eggs, okay\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, mom\" Carol replied as she gently set the beer bottles on the tile counter and began to quietly slide them into the trash can. It was getting pretty full, she'd need to take care of it today. Finished with her task, Carol sat down at the small table that sat on the far wall of the kitchen as Gloria sparked back into being, her mind immediately slammed by an influx of new memories as she took in her new 'home'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the walls were dozens of pictures. Plenty of Joanna, in the prime of her life as a knockout beauty, as head cheerleader for Shermer high. Of her and her girlfriends cheering in uniform, graduation. Then the towering form of her father sliding into the frames as mom's high school cheerleader outfit became a college one before suddenly disappearing. Pictures of Joanna and Rob in clubs, of new friends, a wedding in which Joanna desperately tried to appear elegant in a thrift store dress and make up while Rob simply wore a suit that looked one size too small for him. Pictures of a priest, but no one else. Then of Joanna pregnant, a small blonde bundle wrapped in a blanket and too many pictures of Joanna and Carol doing things, with only a few featuring the entire small Bolstrum family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria, or rather Carol, knew that her mom had fallen for Rob Bolstrum as a freshman in college, one fateful night at a bar with her old cheerleading squad. He had been such a bad boy, so strong and muscular, unafraid of anything and those intense eyes. Joanna had made the mistake of hooking up with him, despite learning that he had barely made it out of high school and was known for being violent to those that crossed him. It had turned her own, and after a whirlwind romance in which Joanna suddenly found herself ostracized from both her old friends and new, and even worse, her family, she discovered she was pregnant. Unable to keep up with classes and finding herself on the bad side of her sorority, Joanna had dropped out of college, and shortly after had moved in here with Rob and his own mother, and the two of them despised each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the problem had resolved itself as Joanna had talked Rob into getting his mother to move out into another trailer, even if it meant both of them had to take on jobs in order to pay two rent bills. But a few months later Rob's mother drank herself to death, ending the main problem in Joanna's life. After nine months, Carol had come into the world, and Joanna had wasted no time in being a mom, quitting her job despite Rob's loud, angry protests that always ended with the both of them at some level of intoxication, much like what had happened last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sizzle of eggs brought Carol's attention back to the present as her mother slid a plate onto the table in front of her. The mass of edible yellow was followed by a slice of toast, a glass of water, and a quietly placed fork. Carol smiled up at her mom and began eating, easily hiding her disappointment at plain toast and water. And as always, her mother was able to read Carol like an open book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you like butter and milk but we can only stretch the money so far...\" Joanna muttered sadly as she sat down across from Carol, \"I'd get a job as well, but unfortunately your father's reputation, and the fact that I haven't worked since you were born, it's just so hard to find someone willing to hire an old cow like me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol put her fork down and reached across the table, taking her mother's small hand into her own larger one. \"Mom, you're beautiful! And smart! You just have to try!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh baby, but then who would take care of your father? I have to be here to wake him up, otherwise he'll miss his shift and then we'll all really be in trouble!\" Joanna breathed a heavy sigh as she curled her fingers over Carol's. \"No, we'll just have to make due. I was even thinking about cutting out TV service. It's all just fake news anyway. Be a few more dollars we can save, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol felt her heart drop. She knew her mom loved TV. It was her one real outlet outside of homemaking. A new resolve filled her and maybe it was just the eggs, but Carol was filled with determination and resolve now. This woman had given birth to her, had given up EVERYTHING in her life, for Carol to exist. And putting up with her volatile dad...mom was right, they deserved to have some of the finer things in life other than the cramped shoebox they lived in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom\" she began, \"I'll find a job! I can help!\" Carol exclaimed as her teal eyes glittered, \"Let me help pay the rent! It'll be hard with cheerleading but I know I can do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoanna's face brightened for a moment, but then fell again, \"Oh baby, you know you can't do both. You'd be making such a sacrifice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care! I don't really enjoy it anyway, being the captain is more planning than I thought it was going to be anyway. Let me do this mom. For you, okay?\" Carol pleaded, her eyes on the verge of tears. After a few long moments, Joanna gave her daughter a weak smile and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think that's for the best, honey\" Joanna Bolstrum said, her voice sweet as honey to Carol's ears, \"But first you need to eat so you can get to school!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeaming back at her mother, Carol quickly wolfed down the remainder of her breakfast and hurried to get around for the rest of the day. Gloria flickered back into being long enough to pick out a cute pink top and a pair of tight jeans before Carol engulfed her once more. Carol hated to lose cheerleading,after fighting so hard to get on it, and especially captain, but she owed her mother everything. It was the least she could do, and after all, it wasn't like she was going to be completely giving it up. She controlled the rumor mill at school, through force and manipulation, she would be able to stay socially relevant so long as she took down the right people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to help her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting ready for school, Carol bid her mother a teary farewell as she slid into the cab of the only vehicle the Bolstrum's owned: An old Chevy Cavalier, and took off for school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah' she thought as she passed street after street, getting away from the skid row that was Shermer Fields trailer park, she could get anything she needed from her network. And if anyone crossed her or tried to make some power play while she was at work? Carol would simply crush them like she had crushed Tammy Ackterton. Now there was a target that Carol enjoyed harrasing in true Mean Girls style. She'd made the mousy little thing turn into a plump balloon in just under a year, she could-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Carol's mind gave way to Gloria as she suddenly blurted out 'OMG TAMMY! AND BILL! THE STONE! I can fix this and be me again!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bill clenched his fist tightly as he glared at the cowering figure of Gloria Vanapolous, the egotistical bitch that had ruined his entire life. He could feel the sharp edges of the magic wishing stone that he'd found earlier digging into his skin and the warm, wet feeling as a trickle of blood ran out of the spaces between his hand and fell freely to the carpeted floor of the upper hallway of the Strasserman household. He'd just slapped Gloria in a anger-fueled haze over what she'd caused to happen, the gemstone flying from her grip and nearly shattering against the hallway wall as a large jagged crack appeared at the point of impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Bill never saw this as he snatched it up in his hand, nor did he realize the strange light that emanated from it was slightly off, slightly more gold than green and pulsing rather than simply shining bright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it, the moment where Gloria would get what was coming to her. The dumb bimbo had taken all of them into the future, made them all old adults, Tom into his Tammy and had created a daughter out of nothing! And then she'd brought them all back to the present but Bill had ended up with different parents and his little sister Kimberley erased entirely in exchange for changing his future daughter into his BIG sister! And to another extent that no one had noticed (not even Bill himself) was that the teenager's actual appearance had changed to make him look similar to his new parents!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll because Gloria was a dumb bitch who put her ego and mouth before the two brain cells in her head, always speaking when she shouldn't be, always too fucking slow to see the damage the smallest of her errant, cruel little comments could do to anyone and everyone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe she should look about as smart as she really is!' Bill thought as he held his bleeding fist towards Gloria, the glow from the magical wishing Stone convulsing violently as it fed off the pure rage that was fueling Bill despite the damage that had just been done to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish that you'd look as dense as you really are Gloria!\" Bill roared, and then the world vanished in a maelstrom of light and smoke that wormed it's way into Bill's nostrils and through his bared teeth. He coughed once, a husky, hacking sound and felt something heavy press down upon him as the light began to clear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And Brianna yelped in pain as she let go of the shiny green rock she'd found, the lifeless gem falling to the carpeted floor of her house as she wrung her hand in the air, her flabby arms shaking in the arm and the motion transferring through the resistance free fat and into the rest of her overweight, obese body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooowww!\" She whined dully, looking at the red imprint in her hand before looking up at her friends, Gloria and Tammy, \"Did you girls see what happened? I think I got stung by something!\" The obese, brace-faced teenager held her sausage fingered hand out towards her friends while she used her free hand to push her limp, greasy brown bangs out of her beady eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria leaned forward as far as she could, her titanic, saggy breasts hanging heavily off her chest and pressing against the thick fabric of her light sweater. She was even fatter than Brianna was, and with a free flabby hand of her own wiped a sheen of sweat off her perpetually sweaty brown. \"Um, I don't know Bri...Maybe you just got a sunburn or something?\" Gloria's voice held none of it's usual high pitched bitchiness as her triple chin began to jiggle, her previously emaculately glossed and lipsticked lips now more like thin pink rubber bands that spent most of their time hanging slack...Or by the amount of pimples on her new chubby face, shoving down sweets and greasy fast foods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think Tammy?\" Brianna offered, swinging her arm slowly towards her other friend, Tammy Ackerton, who was staring at them both with wide, blue eyes that sparkled out of her chubby but cute face as her puffy, done up lips opened wide in surprise. Brianna always thought that she and Gloria were so lucky that such a pretty, older girl would hang out with the two of them. Tammy was big like them, but she wore it well of her curvy frame. Her blond hair was styled and curly, pouring down around her cute round face and laying on her boobs. And Tammy was always so confident, unlike herself and Gloria, the two Sophmores were really...um...they knew they were fat but Tammy always helped them feel better about it because she always wore really revealing clothes that made her boobs and booty stand out more than her belly. She even had a boyfriend!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/izWExyL.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/izWExyL.png</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Tammy, is it, um, a spider bite?\" Gloria chimed in as she leaned against the hallway wall for support. She felt like she knew what had happened...But at the same time she was just sort of hungry. Maybe Brianna just wanted some more breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Tammy's mind was racing as she stared at her best friend turned husband turned boyfriend and her former evil ex. The two of them had changed in an instant, and she had as well, turning the three of them into...Into heavy girls! And what was worse, Brianna-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, that is Bill!' Tammy scolded herself as she stared into the cloudy brown eyes of her former love, fighting the rush of memories that were sweeping over her just like it had when they'd become old people. And then there was some kind of odd fogginess in her brain, she felt like she knew less now than she just had, but whatever had happened, it seemed like it had changed both Gloria and Bill on the INSIDE as well as on the outside! In fact, Tammy was pretty sure that Bill probably didn't remember being Bill at all! Instead the rush of memories told her that she was the older best friend of Brianna Strasserman and Gloria Vanapolous, two obese teenagers who spent most of the school day in their own remedial classes and had very few friends. She'd felt sorry for the girls, who were mocked and bullied both behind their backs and to their faces (most of the time not getting the cruel jokes the other student threw at them). Tammy had decided she'd be their friend, to help them as best as she could through high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd because Brianna's big sister Willow had been her own upper classmen friend when Tammy had been a Sophmore. Every girl needed someone to look out for them, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But...Willow is supposed to be...' Tammy pushed back against the fogginess. She knew Willow wasn't real...She WAS real but clearly not like, real real...But what had she been the first time they had all changed? Didn't she go to the future with them? Or did she come back from the future with them? She was important to her, but that was because Willow was her friend, right?Tammy suddenly felt very scared that she couldn't remember such an important detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, remember you dumb bimbo!' She yelled at herself silently as she stared at the rapidly fading red spot in Brianna's hand, who herself was looking at Tammy with those dull brown eyes expecting an answer. \"Um, Like, I think you just bumped it on something!\" She said in a throaty, but still sing-songy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, okay...\"Brianna said with a heavy nod. Really it didn't even hurt anymore, so it must not have been that important. What was important was that her big sister Willow (who she was slightly jealous of because she was so thin and smart and allowed to drive) was waiting downstairs, and that the three girls were running late. \"Uh, Willow said she needed to be somewhere today so we should get going\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tubby teenager rubbed her greasy palm on her pants which seemed to be barely containing the thick trunks of her massive legs, which trembled as she waddled forward towards the stairs. She didn't like stairs, they were so hard for her to use. She wished mom and dad had put her room on the bottom floor or lived in a one story house. Every time she and Gloria used stairs they always got sweaty. Well, sweatier. It was so dumb. She gripped the banister and took one uneasy, slow step after another as she descended, the reinforced wood shaking slightly with each impact until she finally stepped down onto the hardwood floor of the first floor. That was when Gloria made her own slow descent down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'OMG they're like turtles!\" Tammy thought as she watched Gloria's entire body jiggle violently with each heavy step. They really had to start eating better like she'd been trying to show them but-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No Tammy, focus! This isn't right! You're supposed to be smart and Gloria and Brianna are not supposed to look like that! What were we using?' Tammy spun around on her own heavier but well carried body and looked around the upstairs hallway. They had been using something...IT was a little like that movie with the old car but a lot smaller...You had to hold it and you had to be really upset to use it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when the memory clicked into place as her eyes fell upon the dull, lifeless gemstone that had bounced under one of the end tables in the hallway by Brianna's door. With a squeal of excitement she bent over and snatched it up in a hand that was only a little chubby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is it!' She thought to herself, casting a sideways look down the stairs as Gloria finally finished her descent, 'Now all I have to do is make a wish to fix this!' Tammy furrowed her brow in concentration, she knew she had to be really focused...Or was it upset?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, why is it so hard to remember!?\" She hissed as she clenched her eyes shut, not noticing the weak flare from the gemstone as it detected a hint of anger in the thick chick's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um Tammy, we really need to go...\" Brianna called from downstairs and Tammy snapped her eyes open. That was right, they were running late for school and Tammy couldn't afford any more tardy slips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the gemstone before slipping it into the front pocket of her plus size (but still really cute) jean shorts. 'I'll just have to figure it out at school!' She thought with a roll of her eyes before she hustled down the stairs towards her two obese friends.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tammy trundled down the stairs of the Strasserman home, feeling her curves jiggling with each step and being confused by the conflicting feelings in her head, which was itself feeling rather strange and foggy after Brianna had made her wish. On the one hand the jiggling felt normal, the soft sloshing of her bulging breasts and tummy as they jiggled with motion, but on the other hand part of Tammy's brain was telling her that it was wrong. Sure, she'd been overweight when they'd ended up in the future, but not this much...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And what did we wish for anyway? Did we, um, want to see how we'd look as old people?' The former jock turned middle aged wife turned cute geek turned thick chick thought, scratching her curly blond head as she stepped down off the stairs and followed the twin immense bulks of Brianna and Gloria into the kitchen. The kitchen itself was drastically different than Tammy remembered it being; before it had been very clean and orderly, almost the perfect model of a suburban home but now it was almost the exact opposite. Jars of sweets lined the counter while a stack of dirty dishes sat in the sink. Unopened bottles of soda were stored next to the fridge and bags of chips and other junk food lay within easy reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hungry\" Gloria whined as she followed her friend Brianna into the kitchen. She'd thought that maybe the other large girl had just been hungry upstairs and it had just reminded her that it had been a whole twenty minutes since she'd last eaten breakfast at the Strasserman residence, the plate full of eggs and bacon and pancakes that Brianna's mom and sister always had ready for when her dad would drop her off on his way to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too\" Brianna replied, the notion of being hungry had derailed her own train of thought and she paused along with Gloria to start grazing from the readily available junk foods, but a loud honk from the garage proved enough of a distraction. \"But...Willow is supposed to be somewhere to do...something. She'll get in a lot of trouble if she doesn't do it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm starving! Gloria said, stamping massive cankle on the ground and shaking the room, \"I wanna eat something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...Oh!\" Brianna turned in a slow circle as her piggy eyes scanned her favorite room in the house. There had to be something they could eat quickly...And that was when she saw the brightly colored packaging from a carton of chocolate chip cookies partly buried under a potato chip bag. \"Let's take these\" She said, batting the bag of chips away with a puffy hand and picking the carton up to show Gloria. The boy turned old man turned dumb fat girl felt proud of herself for coming up with such a solution, but the small grin on her face died as she saw Gloria stare at the package of cookies in disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just that one?\" Gloria said, her already squished face scrunching up into as fierce a pout as she could manage. It was so small! And if there was only one she'd have to share!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We might have more...\" Brianna started as she stared off into the expanse of the kitchen once more. In truth she didn't even want to go to school anymore, she just wanted to stay home and snack now. Maybe take a nap after. She started to drift further into the kitchen, ignoring the second honk of Willow's car horn from the other side of the nearby garage door, but through her layers of shoulder fat she felt a hand give her a squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, we really need to get to school girls. C'mon!\" Tammy clasped another hand on the even larger hump of Gloria's flabby shoulder and tried her best to move the two human boulders along with little success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'OMG' Was all she could think as the two girls stood there staring at her with dull eyes before a third honk decided the vote. With slow, ponderous movements Brianna and Gloria turned once more towards the garage door and waddled towards it, opening the door and sliding partially sideways through it and into the garage. Tammy just let loose a sigh of relief as she closed the door behind them. They just needed to get to school and then Tammy could focus on seeing her boyfrien-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, focus! You have to figure out how to use the wishing rock!' She kicked herself again, giving the tiny bulge in her shorts pocket a pat as she turned towards the waiting vehicle, her eyes widening once more as one memory betrayed another in her mind. But this time, at least, she knew which one was the real memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, sitting in the middle of the garage and looking very much worse for wear, was Willow's large faded purple van. Tammy knew this was wrong because before the wish (whatever it had been) had done whatever it did, Willow had had a almost brand new red sedan. And Tammy's eyes went even wider as she saw Willow glaring at the three of them from the driver's seat. Instead of the skinny, healthy and kind looking Willow that Tammy clearly remembered there was now another overweight (though not as much as Brianna, Gloria or even Tammy herself) girl that clearly looked like she didn't care for her appearance and was getting very little sleep. Another fake but real memory floated to the surface of Tammy's mind; Willow was very much her sister's keeper. Her parents relied on the older girl to babysit Brianna and by extension, Gloria. She had to help her mother fix them breakfast, had to get them to school, help with what little homework they had on top of her own schoolwork. The stress of being a caretaker and essentially a second mom had clearly taken a toll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon! Tammy, you were supposed to have them out here twenty minutes ago! What fucking gives? I CAN'T miss my test and it takes thirty minutes to get to the college!\" Willow barked at the tubby trio, her voice hard and angry and utterly different from what Tammy knew it should be. \"Quick, get your butts in here and...\" Willow trailed off as she spotted the package of cookies in her little sister's bloated hand, \"Christ, again Bri? How can you be hungry again after everything you had for breakfast!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments Brianna just shrugged and moved to open the sliding door of the van, revealing an interior that was even worse than the exterior. Instead of a mid-sized middle seat and a long rear passenger area, instead there were two large, clearly not factory standard, chairs bolted into the floor of the van. The vehicles shook and shuddered and began to noticeably sag as Brianna and Gloria pulled themselves up into the van with no small shortage of feminine grunts from the obese dullards until finally both girls had settled into their cradles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a cookie\" Gloria snapped, pawing at her friend who quickly unsealed the package as Tammy simply stood there and watched as sausage like fingers began plucking the small discs of cooked dough and chocolate chips out with frightening speeds. In a matter of moments the carton was empty as Brianna let it fall to the floor of the van as she and Gloria messily devoured their snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Tammy suddenly felt a little upset the two girls hadn't at least offered her one. With all the confusion she was feeling a cookie might have helped ease her befuddled mind (and soothe the small hunger pang she suddenly felt).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rear in gear, Tammy! Don't make me leave you!\" Willow barked once more, shaking the curvy blonde out of her thoughts again and Tammy wasted no time in getting into the front passenger seat. \"Jesus\" Willow said as she put the clearly long suffering van into drive and rolled out of the Stasserman garage and into the spring rainstorm that had developed over Shermer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive to the school was rather short. In truth Tammy, Brianna and Gloria could have walked it and Tammy sometimes did, but her other friends clearly wouldn't have made it more than a hundred feet down the sidewalk without needing to stop every few steps. As Gloria and Brianna let out several burps from the back seats, Tammy looked out the window while a hand went to rest on the bulge in her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to fix this. I'll figure out what went wrong and fix it. I promise Bri...I mean Bill!' Tammy thought as the van rolled down the street. She'd always forgotten that Brianna wasn't supposed to be Brianna and was instead a guy named Bill. And Bill was very important to Tammy, maybe even the most important, but for why, much like WIllow, Tammy was having a hell of a time figuring out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned away from the window and looked over at the frustrated face of Willow, who was clearly annoyed with her. Tammy knew that asking a question was a bad idea but maybe Willow knew something, anything, that could help her figure out what went wrong with their wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, um, Willow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, WHAT, Tammy!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did....did I ever used to be so ditzy like this? Or have I always been like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow simply gave her friend an annoyed look before turning back to the road. Before long the van full of girls arrived at Shermer High, though not at the front doors. No, Brianna and Gloria spent most of the day in remedial class, and their presence in the halls of the school were someplace that the girls simply wouldn't survive as kid upon kid would crack their usual jokes. Instead Willow pulled around to the back of the school, near the doors to the girl's gym. It was what was best for the girls, after all. As the trio piled out of the van Tammy could feel as well as see the reinforced automobile raise dramatically back up to it's factory standard ground clearance. The moment the passenger door slammed shut the van whirled to life again with a blast of carbon out of the poorly attached tail pipe as Willow took off angrily from the school and headed to her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we go home now??\" Gloria asked as they watched the purple van speed down the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Gloria, you know we all have to, like, go to school. It's the, um, law and stuff\" Tammy felt herself saying as she turned to head into the gym doors. But she gasped in surprise as she broke into a huge grin as she saw someone waiting for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was her boyfriend, Rob Bolstrum!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"ROBBIE!\" Tammy squealed in delight and shot across the pavement as fast as she could and practically jumped into the muscled arms of her towering boyfriend, wrapping her arms around him and latching her lips onto his in a deep, passionate kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shivered in delight at how he tasted, feeling his strong arms wrap around her girthy but still short frame as he stumbled backwards into the brick wall of the high school. Tammy had been confused about a lot of things this morning and knew that something had gone terribly wrong with the magic wish stone, but she knew across all of her memories that she had a boyfriend that she loved more than anything else in the world, that her boyfriend was her soul mate and had saved her from being super sad all the time about...something, but that had been so long ago Tammy had forgotten what she had been sad about..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tubby, short blonde and the redheaded giant held each other in the embrace until a deafening crack of thunder startled the two of them aprart, Tammy's eyes snapping open as she shrieked in surprise before collapsing into a fit of giggles as pressed herself against Rob once more. She smiled as she felt something large begin to grow stiff against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, sugarbuns\" Rob growled playfully as he ran his large hand through her curly blonde locks, \"I was beginning to think the Lame-Mobile had finally broken down. Almost thought about getting the car and coming after you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my big handsome knight on his powerful, um...horse\" Tammy said, looking up at Rob's chisled face. Really it was Tammy's car, but since she'd been helping Brianna and Gloria she'd just been walking every morning from her own house. Plus the exercise was good for her, even if she often negated the positive benefits with snacking just a little too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can give you something powerful to ride...\" Rob growled again as he gave one of Tammy prominent butt cheeks a tight squeeze before lowering towards her round face for another kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew\" Gloria said flatly as she and Brianna shuffled further under the awning. Her feet and knees already hurt from the effort of staying upright for so long this morning without support, she was a little wet from the rain, it was too hot and humid (despite it being a little on the cool side of an April morning) and she was still hungry. The cookies hadn't done anything for her, especially since she'd had to share with Brianna. Plus the scene in front of her just made her feel weird inside. She had no idea what it was but she thought the romantic scene was just gross. Also what if she caught cooties from all of this? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Brianna just fumed in silence as she watched the couple in front of her. She didn't like Rob at all. He was too big and muscled and she could remember when he would make fun of her, Gloria and Willow when Willow was still in high school. The mean names that he'd call her in the lunch room. And seeing Rob with Tammy, seeing how happy her much more intelligent and prettier friend seemed to be with Rob just made Brianna feel sad that she didn't have anyone, or that whenever Rob was around Tammy always spent less time with her and Gloria. The corpulent brown haired girl felt like she needed to do something about it, that she COULD do something about it, she just needed find...to find...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe painfully loud ring of the high school's bell caused Brianna's unusually thoughts to scatter into the wind once more. That was the first bell! They had to get all the way through the school to hers and Gloria's room before the second one or they'd get in trouble! Not that the two girls would have actually been punished, given their...reduced mental faculties in comparison to the rest of the student bod, but Brianna didn't have the ability to comprehend that. All she knew was that her teacher, Mrs. Orville, would be upset with her and Gloria. And Mrs. Orville was so nice to the two girls that Brianna never wanted to make her upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tammy, the bell!\" Brianna croaked, causing the two lovers to part with Rob giving her an annoyed look while Tammy just stared at her in confusion before the blue eyes lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG! Yeah, we need to get to class!\" Tammy hustled over and opened the double doors that led into the hallway that ran in front of the girl's gym. She stretched her arms out as far as she could, each door only opening so far and clearly not wide enough for the approaching twin feminine bulks. \"Um, Robbie, can you help?\" The blonde said over her shoulder, and her boyfriend gave her a weird look before he sighed and stomped over, taking one of the doors out of Tammy's grip and pulling it open wide as Tammy did the same with her door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground shook as Gloria and Brianna's heavy footsteps came closer until they crossed through the threshold and into the school proper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Tammy!\" Brianna said cheerfully, meanwhile Gloria simply grunted something as she wiped her perpetually sweaty forehead as the two waddled forward down the hall. Brianna...kind of knew where to go? She wanted to show everyone that she was smart like everyone else while Gloria simply followed her friend on instinct. The former queen of Shermer High didn't much care where they ended up so long as she eventually got to sit down and eat something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F'sure!\" Tammy beamed before letting go of her door and wincing as it slammed shut with a loud CLANG while Rob's did the same. She darted over as fast as she could and reached upwards for Rob's neck, the redhead titan bending down and the two sharing a quick kiss as the blonde pulled away to do her daily duty of guiding the two girls to class. Without her they would routinely get lost in the winding corridors of Shermer High, and before Tammy had stepped in to help, Willow had been their daily escort. And she couldn't let them stop, Brianna would typically keep moving but Gloria would be a pain and a half to get walking again if they stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby, I'm gonna help the girls, you should get to, um, class\" Tammy said as she hustled behind her charges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. See you in a little bit.\" Rob called after her, watching as Tammy's gloriously large ass swished and swayed down the hall after her friends. Rob rubbed his face as the trio disappeared around the corner before he turned and began walking the other way towards his first class of the day, which thankfully was a bit of a joke class run by a joke of a teacher: Shop Class, led by Mr.Santini who was retiring at the end of the school year and thus gave zero fucks if students in his class did anything or not. Or even showed up, which suited Rob just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob loved his schedule, and really, loved his life. In the previous reality he'd been beaten by Big Jon Ingerman, the rich kid whose dad more or less owned the town and fancied himself lord of the school. He'd beaten Rob, taken away his gang and made Rob his lackey, eeven ordering him to burn down Bill Strasserman's house as part of a final trap to get Rob out of the picture entirely and get revenge on Bill for getting him suspended. Rob had been at the Strasserman house, as ordered, but he'd planned on getting Bill to help him, to use the geek's cleverness that Rob himself had been forced to deal with more than once to take down Ingerman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then the Ahn'Ger Stone had tossed that reality to the wind, and now Rob Bolstrum was living his best life. Due to the damage to the Stone, the magic hadn't fully twisted Rob's mind like it had before. Instead he still distinctly remembered Bill Strasserman and Gloria Vanapolous as they had been, Seniors instead of Sophmores and smart instead of retarded. And Tammy...Tammy had been Bill's little geeky fucktoy and just as smart as him. But now...Now Bill was gone, replaced by Brianna, and Tammy was HIS. His own perfect little fucktoy, big tits, big ass, a sexy thicc bimbo that drooled all over him. Rob didn't really understand or know how any of it had happened other than a flash of green light that had whisked him away from Bill's house and dropped him off at school with a complete set of new memories, but he wasn't going to question it, not with how everything was turning out golden for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as for Big Jon...Without Bill Strasserman, without the previous version of Tammy Ackerton or bitchy, vindictive Gloria, Rob's powerbase had never weakened. Big Jon was still around, but the rich bully had chosen to simply pay for Rob's services rather than take control of the Shermer bullies himself. And Big Jon paid well. Rob (and to a lesser extent, the rest of the bullies) were earning shitloads of cash by being Ingerman's enforcers. And at this point that basically meant that Rob could do whatever he wanted with little fear of repercussion so long as nothing blew back onto Big Jon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob wasn't even living in the trailer court anymore! With the money he was now making Rob had been able to rent an apartment in Old Shermer. It wasn't the best, but it was his and it was cheap. And it meant that he could get shitfaced drunk as often as he wanted, and more importantly, fuck Tammy on a regular basis without interference from her parents (who tolerated him simply because they loved and spoiled their daughter, and allowed him to eat with them most nights).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And who doesn't love free meals?' Rob thought with a chuckle as he stomped into the Shop room, where the rest of his gang was waiting, including his own right hand man, Jules Harper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey boss, you finally get tired of, heh, pounding dough?\" Jules snickered, sending a wave of good-natured chuckles through the assembled gang. Before Rob would have been pissed, but now he simply took the ribbing with a wry grin. The boys respected him and in this new reality, liked to give him shit about Tammy being on the heavy side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call your mom and see, shithead!\" Rob jeered back, and the entire group erupted into raucous laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah' Rob thought as he oversaw his little kingdom, 'It's good to be the king again'</span></div></div>",

He didn't care though, he was too angry to care. Gloria had to pay for what she'd done. She'd changed Tom into Tammy, made Tammy his wife, made them old, gave them a daughter and then had brought them back to their proper ages only with his ENTIRE family messed up! His mother and father were entirely different people (still named Strasserman, but looked entirely different. Even Bill looked different due to his new parentage, but it seemed like none of the gathered teens or Bill himself had noticed the slight change to appearance) and had erased his little sister Kimberly from existence and had replaced her with his future daughter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of that, and Bill hadn't even gotten to USE the Stone, which had come to HIM first!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Gloria, that self-righteous egotistical little BITCH had run her mouth again and placed the straw that finally broke Bill's patience. He'd slapped Gloria, the pretty dark haired girl grabbing her face in shock as the magical rock flew down the upstairs hallway of the Strasserman household, causing it to unknowingly crack as it hit the wall. Bill had grabbed it before anyone else could and with the furious anger of a small star, focused on the one thing he wanted right now more than anything else: He wanted Gloria Vanapolous out of his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, due to the damage to the Ahn'Ger Stone, not a single one of the collected teens knew that any wish made on it now would go horribly, horribly wrong no matter how much anger was channeled into the wish-granting artifact. And perhaps it was just Bill's own anger clouding his mind or perhaps the influence of the Stone itself, he phrased his first wish poorly, not knowing the consequences of what would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I WISH YOU'D JUST BUZZ OFF, GLORIA!\" Bill roared, and with a flash of light and a deafening ringing noise, the world was changed as the STone's magic reached out and touched not just Gloria Vanapolous, but the world as well.

A set of wings twitched along a swollen abdomen while her six new legs rubbed themselves together on instinct. She was bloated and looked diseased, and Bill couldn't be more thrilled at the result. He'd just wanted the bitchy teen to leave but seeing her as a disgusting insect was so much more satisfying, to see he get a taste of her own medicine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that was when he realized something had gone horribly, horribly wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Bill realizes that Gloria is still human sized and can talk!

As Bill comes to grips with what his wish had done, he realizes the Stone had been damaged!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Gloria is now a regular sized house fly, but so are Bill and Tammy!

There was only the sound of Bill's own heavy breathing as he stared hatefully at the girl who had ruined everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Gloria merely collapsed on the floor, her eyes rolled into the back of her head. Nearby in the sudden, absolute stillness, Tammy's body fell to the floor in a lifeless heap. Horns began blaring from below, outside, from everywhere.

Thuds on the roof of the house as things began to fall out of the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Bill's hand, still clutched tightly around the Stone, still held towards Gloria's crumpled body, still bleeding, something shifted. The sudden change snapped Bill out of his red-fueled haze. His entire body was stiff, his muscles taking their time to un-clench and the pain in his jaw an teeth pulsing as he released them. The red faded, the adrenaline capped, and Bill fell to the floor, his breath heavy and ragged in his chest as he opened his closed fist, wondering where the blood dripping out of it had come from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there, it two distinct pieces, was the Ahn'Ger Stone. Whatever inner light it had possessed was gone, the inner gemstone, if it even was a gemstone, crumbling to golden dust and mixing with BIll's blood slowly dripping into the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what? I...\" Was all the teenager could mutter as he started as the broken gemstone in disbelief before casting a terrified look at the motionless bodies of Gloria Vanapolous and Tammy Ackerton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, oh god\" Bill said as the contents of his stomach made a mad dash up his throat, hot and burning as breakfast and bile spilled out on to the carpet, the now destroyed artifact tumbling out of his grip and onto the carpet. When the contents of his stomach had ceased rising, he began to dry heave, pain wracking his body as panic and fear began to merge into shock. He vision tunneled and he heard himself wheezing, before he tumbled to his side, curling up into a tight ball, his eyes closed as he silently wished to take it all back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nearby, VERY loud explosion pulled him from his shock a few moments later, and as the entire Strasserman house shook violently from the shockwave, Bill managed to crane his neck to see the top of a nearby plume of fire and smoke cresting in the hallway window. He pulled himself up, trying his best not to look at the two bodies laying in his hallway, mere feet from his bedroom as he struggled to make his suddenly filled with cement legs move. When Bill eventually made it to the window, other plumes of fire and smoke were rising in the distance as the thunderclaps of explosions echoed into the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd below him was something out of a movie. Bodies were everywhere, cars over turned, pedestrians laying on the sidewalks where they had been walking. Bodies in parked cars. And not just human bodies. There was a carpet of deceased wildlife as far as Bill could see as another plane dropped from the heavens and crashed in the distance. Masses of squirrels, birds, dogs cats, raccoons. Even insects were not spared from Bill's wrathful wish as a spider in the window hung limply in it's web, a half-spun insect dangling next to it. Even the trees, plants and grass seemed to be affected, the brilliant greenery of springtime turned lifeless and dull, fronds and limbs drooping low as leaves began to simply release themselves from the branches they had just grown onto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god. Oh, oh god\" Was all BIll said before the stress of it broke his mind, and he collapsed to the floor unconscious as all life ended around him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Years passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill grew, unlike everything else around him. The Strasserman had grown accustomed to the silence of his new world. The unchanging world. The world of the dead. And it truly was the world of the dead, as not even bacteria seemed to have survived. Nothing rotted, though the stench of billions upon billions of bowels reflexively emptying and the constant smell of smoke and ash from the still raging fires had nearly driven him insane. Or had. At some point Bill reconciled that if no one was already to tell him he was crazy, then he obviously couldn't be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he woke up, lungs burning he breathed in smoke, he had barely enough time to scramble out of his home as a raging fire engulfed it. His immediate reaction as he watched home burn was that he had left the Stone in there, in his frantic scramble to get outside. His one chance, the only thing that he knew that could fix it, was gone in the blaze. And then his thoughts turned, he had leftTammy and Willow in there, that if nothing else he needed to bury them, but there was simply no way he could brave the inferno that was quickly consuming his neighborhood. So Bill had dashed into the garage, tried not to collapse as he pulled Willow's lifeless body out of her car, and took off in the direction of anywhere else that wasn't on fire. Eventually he simply headed out into the forests, moving car to car as one ran out of gas. Eventually he had gotten far enough from the remains of civilization that the air cleared and smoke and fires faded away into absolute silence. He'd lived out of an intact resort for awhile before he noticed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air was getting thinner. At first Bill had chalked it up to simply higher altitude, he had passed through so many states fleeing from the fires that he had come across mountains. But eventually he had to forage in the lowlands, and that's when he realized that if the trees, if all plants were also dead, there was no more oxygen being produced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly his priorities for survival had changed from 'find food' to 'keep breathing'. He'd gone from a reaper robbing the graves he had created to a desperate ghoul, prowling through hospitals, elderly homes, anywhere that would have a breath of air in a world that was quickly becoming airless. The irony hadn't been lost on Bill that the search for oxygen was a self-defeating endeavor, the more he searched, the more he needed to breathe, and the more he needed to breathe, the harder he had to search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Bill knew that eventually, he'd join the corpses. Eventually he'd run out of hospitals, retirement homes, supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd one day, after Bill had grown into a man, muscled, raggedy, poorly clothed and bathed, that he did. Prying open a crate of crate in the ruins of Los Angeles, the last oxygen tank Bill had went dry. He ripped off his mask and gasped in the toxic atmosphere, hands pawing weakly at the crate in front of him as salty tears stung his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then he was gone, a single, raspy gasp in a silent world as the final living being on the planet Earth died. But not just on Earth, Bill's wish had reached across the entire universe, snuffing out life, and was continuing to snuff out life as the wish magic traveled the stars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill had become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds. But even Death had to die. And so he did.</span></div></div>",

With a hacking cough the teenager pulled himself upright as his brain completed a very fast, hard restart. What was going on!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the memories came back. He'd killed everyone. A stupid wish that murdered everyone and everything and had caused the Stone to shatter. And then an explosion...and fire! Bill had no time to process anything but survival as he bolted upright and stumbled through the smoke, he feet knocking against the lifeless body of...someone. He was pretty sure it was Gloria, but he couldn't concern himself with that. Instead he stumbled down the stairs trying his best not to breathe in any more smoke, crashing through the front door and into the front yard. The low, ominous rumble of fire burned behind him as Bill coughed the ash and smoke out of his lungs before flopping backwards, watching his home burn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around him the neighborhood burned, a suburban inferno. Dead bodies of people and animals surrounded him and he could smell the sickeningly sweet smell of meat cooking as fire washed over prone bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did this\" Bill whispered to no one but himself. There was no one left to whisper to. No one left to love or hate, ignore. There was only him. And what point was there to staying alive? To suffer a horrible solitary existence moving from one location to the next, staying ahead of fires while looking for food? What kind of a life was lived entirely alone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry\" Bill said. And with that, overcome by the loss of everything and everyone he had ever known, Bill stood and raced back into his home as it collapsed into a cloud of smoke and embers. The heat and pain was intense as he flesh was stripped away by flame, and his brain simply cooked away, leaving Bill another charred pile of ash the world of the dead.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was the smoke that woke Bill from the blackness. A formless world of darkness that had suddenly become very warm as the fire from the nearby plane crash had quickly spread across Bill's neighborhood and had nearly engulfed the Strasserman home before Bill's lungs had alarmed him to the danger. Snapping upright, his mind performing a hard reboot in a matter of seconds, Bill stumbled through the smoke, his feet catching on one of the two bodies that were up there with him. He was pretty sure it was Gloria, and he paused just long enough to see a glimmer of green through the smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THE STONE!\" Bill coughed, and he pushed his way through the smoke to find the two pieces of the Ahn'Ger Stone, inches away from the roaring blaze. Risking catching himself on fire, Bill scopped the two broken pieces up in his hand and with a final look through the deadly glood at where Tammy's body was obscured, he shot down the stairs and crashed through the front doors, hacking and coughing, eyes stinging as the entire building imploded behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-holy shit!\" Bill gasped, sparing a look at the ruins of his home before seeing just how deadly the inferno had become. The entire neighborhood was on fire, every single building a blaze as the fire spread uncontained or uncontrolled. Realizing that he still wasn't safe, Bill clutched the ruined artifact close to his chest and stumbled out onto the street towards a pink car that he didn't recognize. The driver was some girl around Willow's age, pretty, if it weren't for the slack look of death on her face. Bill had no time to worry about that as he pulled the corpse from the car, trying hard not to be overwhelmed with what he had done, letting the girl fall to the sidewalk with a unceremonious thud as he climbed in the driver seat and turned the ignition. Hot coffee spared Bill's seared nostrils the smell of smoke for one moment, and a low fat donut lay beside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry\" Was all Bill whispered as the ignition growled to life and the lone survivor of the kiss of death quickly, but carefully made his way down the street, the entire world looking like something you'd expect out of an apocalypse film.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only those don't actually happen\" Bill thought grimly to himself as he navigated the treacherous route, rolling past massive multi-car wrecks, burning cars, and cars that were just stopped where their drivers had perished. And everything was on fire. There was no end to the fire. No matter how far into town he went, and no matter how far into the suburbs and the more rural areas of Shermer that Bill drove, everything was, to some level, on fire. Eventually Bill just decided to head west, surely somewhere out there was a place that wouldn't be touched by endless flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he drove for a long while. State signs passed him by, but he paid no attention. It didn't matter anymore. The car ran out of gas, so he simply took another one, the occupant having unfortunately released his bowels within. And the silence was deafening. There were no sounds outside of the car's engine. No birdsong, no insects chirping, nothing, especially once he had made it away from any inhabited areas. The radio was nothing but a endless loop of static, though the satellite channels still played music on an automated loop, advertisements for businesses and services that were no longer operating due to everyone being, well, dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill's urge to run eventually gave out, and he pulled into what he assumed was some sort of park next to a creek. It was there, finally away from the danger and at least some form of natural sound from the rippling water allowed him to break down into a long, hard cry, his body and mind finally breaking under the strain. He wasn't sure how long he cried, but the day had turned to twilight before he was finally able to pull himself together, and he fished the remains of the Stone out of his pocket, staring at the broken fragments. Out of desperation, Bill pressed the two pieces together, noticing for the first time the massive crack that didn't match up with the stress fractures caused by his crushing grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is...this what did it?\" Bill whispered, and suddenly realized there was no need. No one was around to hear his secret. No one at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"christ...There has to be a way to fix this, there has to be!\" Bill hissed as anger rose in his gut. For a moment he thought he might have seen a glimmer from the destroyed artifact, but try as he might it never appeared again. Any wishes Bill made went ungranted, and the teenager had to come to terms with being the only thing alive on the entire planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...This just cannot be happening\" Bill said to the dark night around him, a glow in the distance as the city engulfing fires burned on. \"there has to be some kind of way out of this mess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was the pit of despair that Bill found himself in, the last living thing alive in a dead universe where the only other thing that seemed to be active was the inferno inadvertently caused by the teenager's wish. In a stranger's car so far away from his now destroyed home. Utterly and completely alone, with only the radio waves full of ghosts to keep him company. He clutched the broken artifact in his hands and openly sobbed at how trapped he seemed, how wrong everything had gone. If he had just controlled his rage, if he had simply kept the Stone hidden from Gloria, all of this could have been avoided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain and anguish he felt was crushing. A large part of him wanted to simply bust one of the car's windows and slit his wrists and throat, to join the mountain of corpses, the reaper claiming one last victim to complete it's work. The rest of him just felt like curling into a ball and sobbing until he physically could no longer do so. Bill eyed the jagged edge of the broken Ahn'Ger Stone. It looked sharp enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why ruin a perfectly good car?' Bill thought as he raised the sharper, less jagged of the two fragments to his left wrist and pressed the cold gemstone against his flesh, closing his eyes as he tensed his right arm, bracing himself for the pain that was about to go through his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see you soon, everyone\" Bill whispered, and with a sharp inhale, pulled the gem across his wrist, waiting for the flare of pain and the feeling of warm blood. Yet nothing came. Confused, Bill opened his eyes to see that he was no longer holding the Stone fragments. And then he heard it, a slight click of something very close by landing on the hard plastic that framed the car's dashboard. Bill looked towards the sound and saw...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...A fairy? Or something close to it. It was crystalline, though there was no one color to it. Instead every color of the rainbow shined like a prism as the small, winged creature sat in a half-crouch, tiny face watching him with what looked like a morbid grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting a little...edgy there, aren't you, Bill?\" The fairy asked, it's voice male and female at the same time, as if two people were trying to talk one moment ahead and behind each other. It made Bill's head hurt. The fairy stood and fluttered it's large wings, a network of crystal latticework that caused it to float towards the confused teen with the slight sound of grinding stone. Bill instinctively pushed himself against the driver side door of the car, and the fairy stopped, slid a hand to it's palm and sighed in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Bill, we're both here because you fucked up and you're not dealing with it very well. I mean, you're doing better than the other version of you who decided to cosplay as pot roast...\" In the empty framing of one of the fairy's wings, a impossibly clear image of Bill running back into his house as it collapsed, allowing himself to die, the grisly detail as his body cooked and sizzled in the extreme heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck\" Bill's eyes went wide at watching himself die, \"But, I didn't do that!\" The fairy rolled it's eyes again and struck a pose that, if Bill had been paying any sort of attention, looked remarkably like Gloria when she was being catty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's called the Multiverse, sweetheart. You did that in another universe. In another...\" The fairy flicked another wing and a picture of three identical versions of Gloria were fighting over the Stone on the sidewalk outside of the Vanapolous house. And another showed Bill and Tammy holding hands on the front porch sharing a soft kiss. And another showed a female version of Bill clinging tight to a very male Tom as they walked to school, hands clasped together and not a single sign that that version of Bill remained behind the girl's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Bill's eyes flickered back to the scene showing him running into the blazing fire of his house and killing himself via immolation, and he couldn't help but shudder. The fairy flicked it's wings and the images vanished, shrugging it's tiny arms dramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right? Really fucking edgelord shit in that one. I mean at least in...well, most of the other ones, nothing bad happens. Yet. Those timelines are still being explored...But yeah, that one version of you really overreacted. It's not like any of this doesn't really matter anyway. Fucking tryhard\" The fairy scoffed as it floated through the car's interior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what do you mean 'doesn't really matter'?\" Are you here to undo the wish? Can you make everything normal again!?\" Bill's mind began racing. Perhaps this fairy, or whatever it was, was sent by the same thing that had given him the Stone! Maybe it was some sort of cosmic maid!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I'm gonna skip the long explanation. No, I'm not here to just reverse everything..That's not how it works. Well, aside from the one reality, but even then things don't go back to the way everything started. That makes it too easy to repeat the same mistakes, to tell the same story without any variation, which causes closed loops where the reality just constantly repeats\" The fairy, seemingly bored with floating, took a seat on the passenger side headrest. \"No, you have to live with these choices. But I'm told to offer you a way out of this particular reality, at least. The other two timelines caused by this have already ceased to operate and those Bills are dead. But you're alive, so instead of just let you tell the same story of being a wimp and killing yourself or struggling against unbeatable odds, here's what's going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy stood, spread it's wings wide, and the latticeworks of it's wings intensified, more and more...Bill couldn't help but compare them to screens, appearing that showed so many realities playing out before him.  Other version of him with his friends and family, in one Gloria was apparently his dog? Most of this new set, however, Bill didn't even recognize, some focused entirely on people he didn't know. One seemed to be tethered to a Remote, other,s a two families going on vacation...And two guys messing around with tools?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know\" The fairy said, rolling it's eyes again. \"Seems dumb, but since there's nothing left in this timeline, you get to jump ship to another. They can either be one of your realities, or they can be the reality of someone else's story. I'm not really supposed to tell you this, but basically if you choose any of your timelines, you're gonna constantly just get screwed over. You may keep the Stone, you may lose it, but you almost always end up suffering because of it Huh, I wonder if that's the point...\" The fairy floated off for a moment, turning away from Bill as it seemed lost in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem\" Bill said after a long moment of silence, and the fairy jumped in mid-air, turning back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops! Yeah, sorry. Basically you go back into one of your realities, there's already a Bill there. You can't inhabit the same space. You'll be someone else, but it'll be a life that you're...well, everyone you know is alive, at least. IF you choose any of the OTHER realities, it's not your story anymore. You'll be back in a living world, you might even be allowed to be you, but you'll no longer be the main character. Maybe. Or you can stay here and ignore the offer from 'on high'\" The fairy paused again and looked up at the ceiling of the car with an eyebrow raised, \"And die like you do in the other two realities. Word of advice though, if you choose the edgelord option, try to make it interesting? No one likes repeat performances\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill's mind buzzed with information. There was...some form of a chance to fix his mess. Or escape it? Bill wasn't quite sure, but anything had to be better than here. He could be someone else with a different life, the burden of having infinite and very easily abused power no longer around his shoulders like an anchor. But one question still remained....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what are you?\" Bill asked the fairy, who was somersaulting itself in the air despite physics not working like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider me a life ring.  And yes, I'm sent by the same thing that sent the Ahn'Ger Stone\" The fairy rolled it's eyes at the confusion on Bill's face, \"The Stone. The shiny green thing that only granted wishes when you were angry. That was the name. And no, I can't tell you anything about where I came from. That breaks what little remains of the rules. Can't give away all the secrets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't, but we're starting to run short on time here. I highly suggest you take what time I've got left to think about your choices. I can show any available reality that you can enter, sort of like endless TV channels. When you've picked one, all you've got to do is touch it and you'll pass into that reality and whatever new life is waiting. Sound good? Because I'm tired of talking and flying. I'm gonna sit here on the dash while you make your choice\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, points off for being a rude little shit' Bill thought, and the fairy held up a tiny little finger, almost as if it had read his mind. Not wanting to tempt fate<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is a really good idea, I might add\" The fairy said, interrupting Bill's train of thought once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FINE!\" Bill said, frustration boiling over as he sat angrily back in the car seat and began viewing the realities available to him, swiping through them like pictures on a cellphone. Before long, he decided too...</span></div></div>",

There were so many choices, so many worlds, full of strangers in strange places before he finally decided that trying to jump into a entirely new place with no friends or family that was just too much of a hassle. He wanted familiarity, his friends and family back, even if, according to the fairy, things might be slightly askew for him personally. But anything was better than trapped, surrounded by fire and death. If none of the realities centered on him seemed safe or fit, Bill would still be happy to go with something new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can...Can you just give me all the choices from MY reality?\" Bill asked the fairy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they're not YOUR realities. Just ones you're familiar with. But yeah, I can do that\" The fairy fluttered it's wings and the images of all the different and strange realities disappeared as those revolving around the Ahn'Ger Stone flickered into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" Bill didn't want to offend the one chance he had at escaping by not being polite, but the fairy just shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Bill began to scroll once more. Here, there was a reality where he...Well, he looked like Willow and was snuggled against an older version of what looked like Gloria. There were subtle differences, but the resemblance was incredibly strong. But what caught his attention more than anything was the fact the two seemed to be orbit the planet Saturn!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"weird\" Bill said, looking at another option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere was one where Bill was, once again, a woman while Rob Bolstrum and what looked like a walking wetdream had him cornered in one of the hallways at school, the Stone flashing triumphantly in Rob's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't want that one..\" Bill said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, because spoiler alert, you'd be the little brainless whore that trog has wrapped around him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did say spoilers. Ironically enough it's a reality where you would have actually been yourself, if slightly idealized. Stronger, more popular, the whole jock stereotype. But doesn't end well for you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so weird, you know that, right?\" Bill said as he watched that particular version of himself shove a tongue down Rob's throat before the Willow version of himself lashed out at the Stone, seizing it and turning Rob and the whore version of himself into statues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well...blame the editor\" The Fairy said, point a finger to the roof of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother reality was Bill being confronted by Rob again...And becoming a chicken? And then a really gross chicken lady married to Tom, who looked like a rooster? And his entire family being very strange humanizations of barnyard animals?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always liked that one, simply because of how weird it was\" The fairy replied, chuckling to itself. Bill just rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were so many options to choose from. HEre, stuck as a little girl with Kimberly and his dad, another where he and Kimberly switched bodies and simply accepted it? Another version where HE was Gloria's mom, Tom was his second daughter and Gloria's real mom was Bill's youngest child!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be a nightmare\" Bill muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. Well, yeah. But it's fun to watch the other version of you become that. I have no idea where you'd end up there, though. None of the main characters in that reality remember who they used to be, including that version of yourself. Eventually you just sort of...go to work and be a bitch to your underlings. Started fun, ended blandly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"and what about this one?\" Bill said, pointing to a screen below the weird...chickenwoman one. It showed Rob running rampant with the Stone, causing chaos without end as the bully became ruler of the world, fighting demons and any other manner of foolishness before two men in black showed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh...It just sort of becomes a power fantasy. I mean all of these are power fantasies based around the desire to change your reality with a wish, but that one more so than the others. He ends up trapped forever in...you ever see the original Superman II?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill shook his head. His preferred version of Superman was the one in Man of Steel, the old movies were just too campy for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the bad guy gets locked away in this mirror thing and shot off into some alternate dimension. Same thing happens to the trog, he fucks up because he's an idiot. Again, no idea where you'd fit into that world\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill chuckled, and despite himself, found he was having a little bit of fun, despite the fact he was still in a reality that he had essentially murdered all life. \"Yeah, Rob's an idiot. The biggest one I know\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I mean, there's several more recent realities, your current one included, where he's smarter. Still a bit of a blockhead, but he had to become smarter because of the new addition\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill, for some reason, felt a strange sense of actually having something spoiled for him, but he couldn't resist. The fairy was clearly talking about the world Bill inhabited right now. \"What do you mean, 'new addition'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jonathan Ingerman. If you look through most of these you'll see it's just Rob Bolstrum. 'Big Jon' is someone new to this particular selection of realities\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill just blinked in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, you gonna pick something or are you just gonna reality surf all night? I've got places to be also, you know\" The fairy said, tapping it's foot against the dashboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bill thought for a moment, and decided to ask the Fairy one more question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many realities are there to choose from in this list?\" Bill reasoning was that while all of these looked interesting, well, they were also a bit weird. It might be better to continue searching for one where he was better off. But the Fairy seemed to know what BIll was planning as it fixed him with a 'seriously?' look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kid, it's the Multiverse. That means an infinite number of realities stacked next to each other. You've not even looked at 0.01% of the first group yet. That's how many there are. So if you're not picking these, keep looking because, spoiler, there's only a finite amount of time that you'll be able to live in this reality, given your wish also killed off the planet's plant life that create the oxygen you need to breathe\" The Fairy began inspecting it's nails again as Bill jaw went slack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what!?\" Was all Bill could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you not been paying attention? Everything died apart from you. That means eventually you're gonna start running out of air\" The Fairy pointed to a 'screen' in it's wing that switched from showing another Bill pleading with a grown woman that had moments ago before been a unknown teenage boy to a much older, adult version of Bill gasping for air in the ruins of a city as the oxygen tank he was carrying ran dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what happened to the other Bill that made the same wish you did, only he decided to tough it out while the other version went crispy critter. You in particular get a ticket out. So sure, you can keep trying to find that absolute 'perfect' reality for as long as you want, but you're on a time table\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe information stunned Bill for a moment. This world really was all th way dead, and eventually he would be as well. But he had a choice of infinite timelines at the choosing...But that also meant that there would never be a end before HE ended. The Fairy was right, Bill had to choose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but can I get like a list or something of the ones I've already looked at? Hard to keep track of them all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fairy snapped it's fingers and the 'screens' within it's wings folded away, the crystalline latticeworks collapsing in on themselves until the gaps between the Fairy's wings were large. And there, a list of text began to form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And when you're ready, just tap on the one you want and i'll open the portal to that reality. And if you simply just cannot make up your mid, just swipe like you did before, and more realities will show up in the list. Might be more fun that way, total surprise\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill leaned in close to the Fairy. Despite the fact that it had enlarged it's wings to make room for the text, said text was still quite small. It was a little hard to read,but Bill began to read down the list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Far Beyond the Stars<br>\r\nDefiance<br>\r\nBarnyard Bill<br>\r\nThe Strasserman Triplets<br>\r\nRob Triumphant<br>\r\n</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do they have titles?\" Said Bill, suddenly confused again. The Fairy snorted derisively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because the Editor has a thing about defining different realities so that they're easier to find. Every reality has it's own name, and these are just the first few that you looked at\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\" Was all Bill could think to say. After a few more moments, Bill decided to pick one of these new realities. </span></div></div>",

So he closed his eyes and went through the options one more time, weighing which ones were the <i>least</i> preferable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely don't want the chicken lady one\" he whispered to himself as he wiped sweat off his brow. \"I definitely don't want the one where I'm Rob's bitch. I <b>definitely</b> don't want one with an all powerful Rob Bolstrum running around. So that leaves two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange fairy waited impatiently, tapping its crystalline feet as the unintentional harbinger of doom made up his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The little girl one or the space one. The little girl one might be OK. I can fake being Kimmy's sister for a while until I fix the stone. The space one is weird as hell. Why am I with Gloria of all people? Where's Tammy? Where's everyone else? Are they dead? Is it the future? Why am I Willow?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill was giving himself anxiety as he asked himself these questions. Outside the stolen car, several large oak trees had suddenly collapsed in tandem upon several now vacant homes as the ravaging fire continued to spread across Shermer. Despite the homes being far enough away to be out of sight of Bill, the crash had created a crashing noise so deafening, it finally shook the teenage boy out of his indecision. He opened his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's a wake up call if I heard one\" answered the fairy in a dry tone as the androgynous being continued to tap it's feet to a staccato melody. \"The clock is ticking, buddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK OK OK! I'll pick the space one!\" Bill said in a rush, finally accepting the magnitude of what his wish had done. Bill had singlehandedly destroyed the Earth. Humanity, in all its two hundred thousand year history(Give or take), hadn't been finally done in by global warming. Not by nuclear winter. Not an asteroid impact or a caldera explosion or a vaccine resistant super flu. It was one lone eighteen year old boy, barely an adult and for all intents and purposes not one, who had rung the bell. Massive pangs of guilt were plaguing his brain as he remembered the motionless bodies of Tammy and Gloria laying in his family home, knowing that he was the one who had killed them. Bill began to well up with tears as he selected the option furthest to the left of the array of incorporeal TV like screens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>FAR BEYOND THE STARS</b> said the selected option in small blocky letters in the caption below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill touched the screen, feeling a clicking sensation like the pressing of a button. He watched the screen expand to encompass the fairy's entire wingspan.  The Willow version of himself and the older version of Gloria seemed to be discussing something important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like I'm staring into a crystal ball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy nodded its diminutive little head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why this one?\" it asked softly, surprised by his decision. The fairy was sure that Bill would go for The Strasserman Triplets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill sniffled through an answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've always wanted to go into space. I never thought I'd have a chance to. I...I wanted to be an astronaut when I...I was little. Gave... gave up on...on it\" he said as he fought back tears. \"I convinced myself it was too hard. Living on... living on a spaceship orbiting Saturn is the next best thing, I suppose. Plus, the Earth has had its day\" he chuckled grimly, in shock as the fire continued to claim his small town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heat in the car was now unbearable. Bill felt like he was baking in an oven. He saw the modest body of water he was parked next to. He had ridden past it on his bicycle so many times growing up, never giving it a second thought. It looked so beautiful now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magical benefactor glared at Bill with what the teenager had confused with sympathy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try not to screw this reality up so bad, honey. I'm not coming back a second time if you do\" it answered flatly as it flew over to Bill and touched his forehead with its tiny hand. Everything went dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill Strasserman chuckled as she poured herself a cup of Venusian coffee and stared outside of the viewport of her kitchen into the blackness of the solar system, her body wrapped in a comfortable fluffy white bathrobe. The rings looked so beautiful this time of morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She</i>   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been over four years since Bill had been blessed(Or cursed) with the Grellstone, and it was finally now, during this moment alone, when the former teenage boy was finally comfortable using female pronouns on himself...or herself, rather. She had finally come to terms with her identity issues, at least the biggest chunk of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back of her mind, it still seemed a bit odd to Bill. She was still a teenage boy at heart, and she still wasn't entirely comfortable referring to herself as her current identity. At least in private, anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, in front of Ursula, her drop dead gorgeous wife, who was currently on Ganymede on a shopping trip, Bill played the role of Willow Strasserman effortlessly. Ditto for Willow's many, many new friends in this reality, not to mention the hundreds of thousands of people who worked for her. Bill still had trouble believing that her new persona had created an animation empire to rival Walt Disney, but the immaculate penthouse she lived in with the breathtaking view of Saturn, the constant vacations around the burgeoning stellar empire that humanity was carving out for itself, and the seemingly unlimited cash flow were reminders that, yes, this was very real. In front of employees and acquaintances, she was Willow Strasserman, genius, trillionaire, philanthropist, businesswoman, artist, futurist, and icon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't who she felt she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her mind's eye, she was still Bill Elias Strasserman. She was still that geeky kid from Shermer, Illinois who loved Star Wars and Marvel and Rick &amp; Morty, who listened to Bruce Springsteen when everyone else his age thought Born To Run was old people rock, who maintained an extensive gaming collection in the basement, who solved differential equations for fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe worried that she was going to wake up from this dream life one day and find herself back on Robinson Avenue. Back on Earth. Back in the 21st century, waiting for Rob Bolstrum to jump him and Matt Harris on their way to school. Or maybe his mother Martha Strasserman would come outside and yell at him for not feeding the cats that morning. Or maybe his sister Kimberly would try her best to irritate Bill in her vapid, tweenage way. The Bill portion of her brain was still waiting for her first date, her first kiss, her first prom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Grellstone had taken all of that away from her. The magic gemstone, shaped like a teardrop, had ferried her from the comfort of her life in 2015 into the far future of the 24th century.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt so irresponsible for not having tried harder to escape back to her original time period. She felt like she had abandoned her <i>real</i> family and her <i>real</i> friends. And yet...she was happier here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides the beautiful wife and all the money and fame, it was a paradise for a geek like Bill, who had loved imagining  what the future held in store. She remembered wanting to grow up to work for NASA as a little kid, but had been discouraged from it early on once she realized how much work went into it. Now she <i>lived</i> in outer space, and life in the 24th century, thankfully, did not disappoint in the Star Trekesque technology department. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor instance, the brunette beauty which Bill now was perpetually appeared to be about thirty years old. In reality, Willow Strasserman was actually 355 years old, having been born a few years shy of the turn of the third millennium. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to the miraculous nanobots swimming around her body, she was effectively immortal. Ageless. The microscopic robots which she had elected to become part of her were constantly maintaining and repairing her cells, tissue, DNA and more, keeping Willow's ancient flesh in tip top shape and preventing her from withering into a mummified husk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Bill had learned about that, she had been simply stunned into disbelief. And Ursula had undergone the same treatment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow didn't dare tell Ursula who she used to be, or who <i>she</i> used to be. Once upon a time, several iterations of reality show, Ursula had been Matt Harris, his (male) best friend and star of the school's football team. The two of them, along with Matt's bitchy girlfriend Gloria Xanthopoulos, had accidentally used the stone to become triplet sisters, and through an improbable series of subsequent wishes, Bill had become Gloria's <i>mom</i>, Matt/Ursula's teenage girlfriend, and finally, after wishing to be far away from Shermer, Ursula's wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pondered.. Should she risk pulling out the Grellstone? The magical artifact had transformed itself into a pretty necklace. Ursula believed that she had bought it for Willow as an anniversary present, and she often wore it out in public on special occasions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she could use it somehow to bridge the gap. Maybe visit her original timeline. Maybe bring her parents and Kimmy and Matt to the the 24th century so they could live in splendor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were drugs out now that could trick the body into believing that it was angry when you actually weren't. Maybe if she popped one right now, she could fool the Grellstone enough where you could make a controlled wish.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, that was the trick with the Grellstone. It could alter reality, but only when you were furious and not thinking clearly. Bill had been too scared up until now to test the limits of the Grellstone, to see if it could be manipulated, but now she felt ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Bill could make a decision however, a green portal opened in the middle of her kitchen. Verdant light she immediately recognized spit out a boy of about eighteen years old, landing him on his spotless kitchen floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe coughed for a minutes, and then stood up and introduced himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi...I'm Bill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After scrolling through several different screens depicting various different realities in which the Ahn'Ger Stone was present, Bill sighed. He couldn't do it. He couldn't face his friends and family knowing that he'd accidentally murdered them and left most of them to burn into ash in a fire caused by the sudden apocalypse. No, Bill knew that the only real choice was to go someplace else, to start over in a new world. And who knew, maybe he'd end up better off over there anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you just show me the different realities not related to the Stone?\" Bill asked the fairy, who gave him a tiny thumbs up and flapped it's wings once, causing all the 'screens' within it's wings to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill immediately recognized a couple of them. Once again, the two guys in some house in what looked like California, messing around with a bunch of tools. And almost predictably, both of them became changed by the tools, resulting in several awkward encounters that...for some reason, left Bill grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that one is fun\" The fairy said, looking over it's shoulder at that particular screen, \"It's fairly lighthearted and goofy. It kind of reminds me of Dumb and Dumber, in a way. Oh and the sister of the more idiotic character is such a stoner. Like yeesh, talk about stereotypes am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...sure?\" Bill said, unsure of what else to say. He looked to another screen, the one with two families preparing for vacation. One family looked pretty unhappy, there seemed to be a lot of waterworks and yet nothing happened as a teenager and her younger brother were left at home while to adults left for a trip to Vegas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That one gets a little convoluted. Lot of different realities for that one\" The fairy said with a shuffle of it's wings and all the screens became different viewpoints of that said world. \"Basically you have the 'main' reality, which is Wilma and Fred Flintstone\" The fairy pointed the husband and wife that clearly were trying to repair their marriage, \"Getting into a fight and there's wishes, transformation, lot of crying, etc. With Betty and Barney here...\" The fairy pointed to the other adult couple in a different screen, \"Basically the wife goes a little mad with power and tortures her husband. It's fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fun!?\" Bill said, watching the brunette command her husband around like a dog, using his money while the husband seemed like he just wanted to disappear with the other man and go fishing. \"How can you call that fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, because it is? I mean if you haven't noticed, kid, a lot of these stories torture the shit out of the characters. I mean even you, you're the guy that had infinite power in his hands, yet the only time you actually got to use the Ahn'Ger Stone was to wipe out all life. Doesn't seem like fun when you're living it, does it? But watching? That's a entirely different can of worms\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the fairy said made sense. Despite the nightmare Bill was currently trapped in, he was honestly having a bit of fun watching the various universes play out. But there were other things to explore before he got caught up in another introspective spiral. \"What about the kids in that story?\" Bill asked, looking at the fairy's other wing where the screens seemed focused on the kids of the first adult couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, they get into the typical hijinks. Kids with magic, I suppose you know how that goes\" The fairy grinned at Bill, and the teenager's face with hot with embarassment and anger. \"But no, they actually get all mixed up at one point and even the Magic itself gets stuck in the situation. Might go places, though again I have no idea how you'd fit into any of these. Most of this particular story never made it past the first twenty minutes. Brand new worlds, lot of potential.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill pondered it for a moment and then shook his head, \"No, not yet. Can we go back, please\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I, Alexa? Do you want me to play Despacito for you while you browse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rude\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kid, I'm a five inch tall magical construct with wings the size of buses, trapped in a car with a dirty, smelly teenager in the middle of night on a planet where everything is dead. I'm allowed to be whatever I want to be\" The fairy rolled it's eyes and leaned back as best it could while keeping the wings upright and visible for Bill. Strasserman couldn't really argue with the logic and wasn't about to look a gift horse in the mouth when it came to escaping his colossal mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo instead he went back to browsing. The next big reality seemed to be pretty grounded. Another bunch of teenagers just out of high school enjoying a bonfire with friends in the state of Cascadia. then a dare and two boys wandered off into the northern woods until reaching the spot they had to stay at until morning. A not un-attractive punk chick up there waiting for them. And then nightmare creatures springing out of the forest, changing one of the boys into a woman while the punk chick and another boy managed to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Wackerknobs. You know originally it wasn't supposed to be that, well, serious. But it really came together into a bit of a cohesive reality. The magic there even has rules it has to play by, which to me is just crazy. But yeah, apparently there was a huge plan for it but blame the editor.\" The fairy pointed a finger towards the roof of the car \"Interest was lost. But yeah, maybe injecting yourself there could work to make it interesting again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,  what else is there?\" Bill said, feeling the same dis-interest in that particular world. Maybe if he couldn't find anything else, it looked normal enough that it could be his back-up home just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see...\" the fairy mumbled and flexed it's wings, different realities popping up in the 'screens'. Many of them were simply blank, worlds that had yet to fully take shape. There was one that was about some kind of Magic Pen, a weird morphing app. One that had someone getting a head massage when suddenly they were in a some kind of high school romance manga. The The one that looked like Fallout seemed interesting, but Bill had already lived through the apocalypse that he had caused, and he wasn't sure if he wanted to live through another one. One that had time travel...one about some crazy tropical resort that had transformations....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill realized something \"Hey\" he asked the fairy, who was picking something out of it's crystalline fingernails, \"Why are all these stories focused on transformation? There can't just be a normal world where nothing happens and life goes on as normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because that's boring, kid. And these are the 'clean' realities. There's more out there that I'm not allowed to give you access to that are just, well, fucking gross, if I'm being honest. Handful of good ones, but most of them are just disgusting. It's better to stay in this general grouping of Multiverses if you don't want to be grossed out. And if I could give you access, well, that'd be on you, and I'm pretty sure you'd regret it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Anyway, you gonna pick something? I do have other places to be\" The fairy yawned and stretched it's tiny crystal limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this one that seems focused on holidays seems neat\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Editor wants to get it up and running but the words aren't falling into place the way they need to be. Got a very 'Nightmare Before Christmas' vibe about it, though. Originally it was supposed to be all about monsters and getting trapped in mirrors, but the plan changed to be more light hearted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the casino one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another one the boss wants to get going but is stuck on. Could be fun, up in the Big Green, rolling dice and gambling away your body! Though fair warning, the Editor did sort of have plans for that one to go dark. Not as dark as this nonsense you made, but more of a 'seedy criminal underworld' kind of dark\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this one about a Remote and some guy named Mark? Bill asked, pointing towards another reality where a some slacker of a guy had found a remote with a hologram woman in it, and subsequently transformed himself into a almost disgustingly busty Asian woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah. Forgot about Mark. Basically a screw up gets the tech version of god powers and inevitably screws things up for himself even further attempting to stall the apocalypse. He hasn't made it very far in his current reality, but elsewhere...\" The fairy shook it's wings to the right and left as other images of Mark came into being. One of Mark becoming a woman for life, getting married to a senator, another trapped as a cheerleading outfit and then...as lipstick? Or ending up stuck as a teenager working at McDonald's before losing the Remote forever. Another trapped at a wedding as a flower girl, or even as his fiancee's mom. Even one screen that showed him as an almost racist depiction of a large, mad black woman on her way to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That guy doesn't seem very lucky\" Bill said as he watched Mark bumble through various adventures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, in other, older realities, Mark was a bit of an idiot. But that sort of seems the case for a lot of these. I mean hell, you make some pretty stupid moves yourself elsewhere. And, well, here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just calling them as I see them, kid. Now you gonna pick something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill leaned back in the driver seat of the car and thought about it for a moment before he...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill sat back and continued to swipe through the available realities, most of them remaining pretty blank.</span></div></div>",

But as Bill still activated the Stone's wish-granting power, magic is still released into the world, changing more than just Gloria due to the Stone's damage.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bill gripped the Ahn'Ger Stone, the mysterious artifact that had he had found only a half hour before, and could almost feel the anger and rage he felt towards Gloria flowing into the gemstone. He couldn't believe Gloria. Even now, when his little sister had been erased from existence, when even his parents had been changed, she still blamed Tom for everything that had happened. And yet to so many others Gloria Vanapolous was queen of Shermer High, little miss perfect. So pretty on the outside, yet only Bill and Tom really knew of the cold, toxic heart that beat underneath that naturally tanned skin and dark hair. Well, now it was time for everyone to know. For Tom, for Kimmy, for his parents, and even for Willow, his daughter turned older sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish everyone could see you for the monster you truly are!\" Bill roared, and with crack of thunder, sickly green light that looked decidedly different from the other wish-granting flashes that morning poured out from Bill's hand. The teenager grinned at Gloria's terrified face, a slender hand pressed against her cheek where Bill had struck her moments before, not realizing it had led to the magical gemstone to become damaged, it's emerald shell cracked when it had collided with the wall before the enraged boy had retrieved it. But in the brief moment, before the flash blinded his vision and the world fell away under his feet, Bill realized that the light looked decidedly different from the earlier flashes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then the world re-materialized around him, and Bill found himself falling through the sky above a mass of blue-brown water, a large city straddling the coast as the sound of rushing wind filled his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH SHIT OH SHIT!\" Bill screamed at the top of his lungs as he began to spin in panic, his hands flying open on instinct and the Ahn'Ger Stone was ripped away into the sky, a glimmer of green as it caught the sunlight. Not that Bill noticed as he tumbled quickly towards the rippling surface below him. But he then felt strange, a burning sensation, piercing pain rushing through his body, almost like he was having...growing pains? But a million times more intense. He felt himself slow slightly as he seemed to get larger, his clothes shredding away from his enlarged form. But then he smacked painfully into the surface of the water and everything went black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had never seen the falling forms of many other individuals around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It was strange, this dream. Bill was wandering through what seemed like a hall of mirrors lit by green flourescent lights. In each one there was a different version of him. Fat, tall, short, skinny, girl, boy, stud, nerd, human, animal, alien, chair. Mirrors that showed family and strangers alike, all on their own adventures. He finally reached the end, where a small crystalline entity gave him a incredulous look, but it felt like it wasn't really looking at Bill, but rather someone behind him. Bill turned to look, seeing nothing but a damp concrete wall, and when he turned back to the crystalline creature it just sighed and snapped it's fingers as a brilliant white light engulfed him.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill felt wrong. Strong, powerful, but wrong. The groggy teenager opened his eyes and was surprised at how bright everything seemed, and how barren the world around him was. Above him was a large glimmering patch of light, shifting strangely and causing him to wonder what it was before the teenager realized where he was. He was underwater, laying in sand? He should have been panicking but there was only the throbbing pain across his body that was rapidly receding as he started to feel stronger and stronger. With a groan, Bill pushed himself out of the muck with arms that felt exceedingly more muscled than they had just a few moments ago, rising upwards as he picked himself up out of the muck. Water began rushing past his ears and he felt strange weights on his back. It was almost as if there was something back there helping him get balanced? Like a third leg or arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What the hell happened?' Was all Bill thought as the world around him brightened further still as he rocketed towards the surface of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, from the shoreline of Lake Michigan, even in the early hours of the day hundreds, possibly thousands of individuals had been gathering on the sandy shores as large cargo ships pulled in and out of port. But everything and everyone paused when the weird rumbling sound had come from the water, and the beach-goers began to scream in alarm as the ground shook as something VERY large and VERY powerful moved underneath them. And then the WHOOSH as a massive pillar of water erupted far off-shore, and something even larger appeared within it. Something that had scales, claws, massive plates that rose off it's back and a gargantuan tail that lazily whipped back and forth as if it had a mind of it's own. Something that had a threatening, predatory mouth lined with teeth and piercing eyes that showed only a hint of the intelligent mind behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt let loose a growl as it's clawed, building sized hand rubbed it's blunted wedge shaped head. The sound caused the entire city of Chicago to grind to a halt as it rolled across the skyscrapers, down the streets and over the millions of people that had just started their day. Everyone froze and turned their gaze towards the lake as something else responded. As the stunned silence began to wear off and more and more of the populace caught glimpses of the towering being in the water, chaos erupted on the streets of the American metropolis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, Tammy, where are you!?\" Bill cried out, not realizing that he was no longer 'speaking' in English. In fact, he was no longer saying any sort of discernible words at all and instead sounded like the massive beast he now was. He blinked for a moment as he stared into the city of Chicago, recognizing the skyline from the Sears Tower and several other landmark skyscrapers. But why did it look so small? Were those ants on the beach? Why were they all running away from the water?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BILL! BILL HELP ME!\" Cried Tammy's voice from somewhere off to his right. Bill's eyes opened wide as he turned towards the sound, unaware of the huge waves his body caused as his titanic reptillian mass displaced the water with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TAMMY!\" Bill called out as he made his way through the water towards the beach. Windows shattered in smaller buildings and cars closest to him but they were so small that they escaped notice. \"TAMMY WHERE ARE YOU!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M HERE!\" Came her reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill's vision finally locked on a something large and gray with a streak of brilliant gold running along it laying along the beach nearly where the cargo ships were docked. Whatever it was it was huddled defensively around Navy Pier, the wharf that had been converted into a shopping and entertainment center, which itself was covered in some weird looking mass of..seaweed? A massive rose was rapidly growing at the center of the ball-like mass as tiny figures fled the building that it was covering, but it seemed inert. Instead Bill turned his gaze to the lumpy mass on the beach below. It looked almost like a caterpiller? As Bill crossed the distance with surprising speed he could see the massive ball of flesh undulating in the sand as...whatever it was turned to face him, mandibles dripping with some kind of sticky webbing as two blue eyes stared upwards at him in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bill, oh god, what happened to us!?\" Tammy's voice said from the mouth of the thing. It wiggled to look at itself and recoiled in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tammy? You look like some kind of worm! Let me...\" Bill said as he opened his arms wide. He almost felt like he should pick Tammy up and he bent over to do so before her wriggling body recoiled once more. Streamers of some kind of silk flew from her disgustingly insect-like mouth. On the pier above the mass of seaweeds seemed to tremble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! YOU'LL HURT ME!\" Tammy cried out, \"BILL, YOU'RE A GIANT LIZARD! I'M A WORM! WE'RE MONSTERS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill blinked in confusion before looking down at himself for the first time. Instead of pink, slightly hairy and only a little flabby skin and plain bony fingers, instead there was only an expanse of green scales and muscles. Massive clawed hands were stretched out before him, alien and strange.  Bill turned to look at the nearby skyscrapers and could see, in their millions of panes of reflective glass, that he did indeed look like some form of colossal dinosaur. He even had a tail and plates on his back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Oh shit. OH FUCK!\" Bill cried out in surprise, and the sides of the buildings he was facing erupted as his voice shattered them all into countless shards of glass that fell onto the swarm of ants...of people below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to those people below, in their sheer and utter panic to get away from the titanic creatures only heard a series of roars and chittering, not understanding or comprehending. The only thoughts in their minds were to escape, to get away from the monsters that dwarfed everything else around them. There was a massive exodus but there was no escape as three new monsters rose out of the cityscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne was insect-like, two glittering wings rising above a chitinous body that ended in two scythe-like claws. Another one stretching it's wings, a dark red as fires roared to life as it's body oozed a magma-like substance from a cruel, long beak. And another one, larger than all the others that rose in front of the approaching storm clouds from the west. It had three heads on three serpentine necks, two huge wings and a body covered in golden scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world erupted in noise as the new monsters began to scream. A familiar female scream coming from the insect while masculine roars of anger came from the red winged reptile and the golden dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to make matters even worse for the Chicagoans, something massive and green descended from the sky. It was a teardrop within a teardrop, radiating with strange light as it settled over the center of the city.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The roar of the other monsters, at least to Bill, sounded human. To the mass of people running through the streets of Chicago however, all they heard was the deafening screeches of terrifying monsters, ones that had appeared out of nowhere and were already destroying the city as they flailed about, as if they didn't know how to work their bodies. And to Bill, the bellowing screams of rage and anguish sent a shiver through his body all the way to his tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'My tail. Holy fucking shit what is even happening!?' The teenage kaiju thought to himself, looking down at his claws once more. But before Bill could get further introspective, the growing layer of clouds over the metropolis parted and the immense version of the Ahn'Ger Stone descended from the sky and hung over the city. And Bill noticed, for the first time, the massive crack that ran length-wise down one side of the gem. It began to pulse rhythmically, flashes of green gold light rippling across the city as Bill suddenly felt drawn towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tammy, look!\" Bill said to his wiggling girlfriend, who was busy squirming her bulk between the large support beams that held up the pier. \"Its broken! That must be why the wish went wrong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care!\" Tammy grunted back in frustration, more streamers of webbing flying from her mandibles as her strange new body crushed the wooden and concrete supports, causing the structure above her to groan dangerously as it struggled to hold the weight of the shopping center plus the mass of flowering seaweed, \"I have to hide! I...I can't be seen like this! Just go grab it and wish us back! Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill watched as his girlfriend covered herself and the underside of Navy Pier in the disgusting webbing and felt the need to say...something, but the urge to get closer to the giant Stone was starting to overpower his higher senses. He gave Tammy a shrug and began to march forward out of the water, his titanic bulk shaking the ground as he moved. As he towered over the buildings he could see the other 'monsters' doing the same, tripping and flopping over themselves and crushing buildings in their path as they were drawn inexorably towards each other. Bill was suddenly grateful for his far more normal body and the tail that hung out behind him, allowing him to maintain an almost normal walk as he carefully tried to make his way through the city streets, wincing every time he felt his leathery body brush against a building and leave it nearly demolished in his wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill was so caught up in careful stride that, as he moved inland, he never saw a tendril of seaweed weakly rise from the formless mass that sat on Navy Pier, stretching out towards him as if to hold him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I'm doing better than that bug thing\" Bill said, looking to the south and the cloud of dust and shrieks. The enormous wasp-like creature was the monster closest to Bill was dominated by two massive scythes for forearms, both of them digging at the ground while two clawed legs that were almost hilariously undersized for it's body struggled to lift it's body upwards. The two large wings on it's back beat out of sync with each other in frenetic bursts while a long dragon-fly tail flopped back and forth. The head of the monster was angular and sharp, two huge red eyes with glowing white pupils frantically darting around in it's head while a decidedly feminine cry came from it's fang filled mouth. As the creature collapsed back on it's stomach it let loose a shrill swear of frustration that caused Bill to pause from sudden recognition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Gloria!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill's first thought was to move towards her and help her up because at his heart, Bill was a decent human being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not that it really applies at this moment' Bill thought to himself as he looked back at his massive reptile body. 'Besides, she's the entire reason we're in this mess. Let her figure her own damn self out' Bill let out a cruel sounding chuckle as he turned away from the struggling insect and instead continued his march towards the enormous Stone as the other two creatures finally seemed to understand how their bodies worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red...pterodactyl thing began moving in an awkward, bird-like hop as it drug it's burning body across the urban landscape, smoke and ash billowing up behind it from the gusts produced by it's enormous wingspan as it tried, several times, to take flight before letting out a roar. Bill recognized that voice as well. He'd know it anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Rob Bolstrum. But what was he doing there!? The logic in Bill's mind try to think of a reason why the bully would have been there in monster form. So far the wishes had only affected Bill, Tammy, Gloria and the victim of Gloria's previous wish, Willow, so it was clear there was some form of localization going on...But why was Rob there? Unless...Unless Rob had been lurking nearby earlier that morning? Bill was suddenly glad that he'd waited a few minutes later for Tom, even if it had ended up resulting in this chaos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the group of monsters converged in the center of the city, buildings toppling from their careless, struggling movements, Bill looked up at the towering three headed gold dragon that seemed to be having a very intense conversation with itself. And Bill's blood, if he wasn't already cold blooded enough, turned to ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Jon's voice was coming out of the center head as it snarled commands at the two other heads. The right head seemed just as angry, another masculine voice coming out of it, one that Bill recognized as Jules, one of Big Jon's lackeys...But the other head, the left one that seemed utterly terrified and was jerking itself in every direction, had a female voice that Bill didn't recognize spilling out of a toothy mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up Tara!\" Big Jon's head said as he snapped at her, \"I don't know what the fuck is happening either!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JONATHAN! I'M SCARED!\" The left head squealed as it wildly curled around, throwing the massive conjoined body off balance, \"THIS ISN'T REAL! I'M AT HOME IN BED! WE GOT IN A CAR CRASH AND WE'RE IN AN AMBULANCE! OH GOD WHAT IF WE'RE, LIKE, DEAD! I JUST WANNA WAKE UP! I NEVER SHOULD HAVE AGREED TO TAKE OYU AND YOUR FRIEND TO SCHOOL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I SAID SHUT THE FUCK UP!\" Big Jon's head snarled and his neck began to curl around the left head, constricting it. The left head screeched in pain but ultimately went silent, slinking away as best as it could and cowering close to the golden scaled torso it was attached to as Big Jon's head released a snort of dominance. Whoever 'Tara' was, she was clearly in a horrible position and Bill couldn't help but feel a pang of pity of pity for the former woman, and a surge of anger laced guilt for having made the wish that put all of them in this position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe damaged city and the hundreds of thousands of people that were suffering and had even been crushed as the four titans converged beneath the Stone didn't even factor into Bill's mind, however. Bill allowed himself a growling chuckle as the bird-boy stumbled in his hopping motion, collapsing on his beak (and through several buildings) as he tried to stand upright on his stubby claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, is that you Rob!?\" Jules's voice came from the golden...Jon-monster's right head as it curled down towards the clumsy red avian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES IT'S ME, you'd think with three damn heads you'd have half a fuckin' brain!\" Rob snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WILL YOU ALL JUST SHUT UP!?\" Gloria screeched as she managed to perform some kind of hovering hop as the wings on her chitinous torso seemed to finally sync together. Bill could almost see a relieved expression on her frighteningly toothy face as she perched herself on the side of the Sears Tower, the skyscraper taking the brunt of her weight as metal groaned dangerously. \"I can...I can fix this if you just help me get to that thing!\" She raised a vicious looking scythe towards the crystalline surface of the Ahn'Ger Stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill's eyes went wide in alarm. The last thing anyone needed was for two of the worst people in the world to get a hold of the Stone! \"GLORIA! DON'T-\" Bill yelled, but it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Titsapolous is right!\" Rob said, flapping his wings and sending dust, ash and cars flying about in a small tornado of debris, \"I was hiding in Shitterman's basement just like you said, Big Jon! I heard them yelling and snuck up right as Shitterman wished for something about Bug breath over here being a monster! It's his fault!\" Rob raised his beak and pointed towards Bill as ten eyes turned to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strasserman...\" Big Jon hissed as realization hit him. All three heads, even the cowering one named Tara seemed to take on Big Jon's hateful demeanor, coiling towards Bill, who suddenly felt as if he was inches from a very dangerous snake. \"Maybe this is all just...providence. Maybe the universe wants me to kick your queer little ass...\" the heads were silent for a moment as Bill struggled to keep track of them as them slithered in the air around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe I'll just take Birdbrain's advice and use that thing for myself!\" Big Jon's heads snapped away from Bill as the golden colossus charged forward towards the Stone, hate in it's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Bill roared. He couldn't let Big Jon make a wish. He'd be dead! Or worse! Bill paid no attention to the buildings crumbling to dust around him as he waded through the center of the city on a collision course with his enemy, tackling the golden behemoth to the ground. Behind him, Bill never saw Gloria leap off the building she had landed on, scythes out-stretched for the gem as a plume of ash and fire lurched upwards to intercept her with a deafening squawk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd none of the monsters noticed a flash of green lighting from the sky as the Ahn'Ger Stone began to pulse faster and faster as the city disappeared in a cloud of fire, smoke and claws, a shimmering ring of green light appearing in a miles long circle around the city of Chicago.</span></div></div>",

Everything, EVERYTHING had gone so horribly wrong this morning all because she had the absolute gall to show up and try to use Bill in her pathetic, evil little game of control over Tom. He now had the Stone, he had the power to fix it and deal with Gloria! All he had to do was make a wish...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, no one had noticed that when Bill had slapped Gloria, causing her to fling the Ahn'Ger Stone down the hallway before she could make another wish for the devil knew what, was now damaged with a large crack running down one side of the fragile gem casing. As Bill lost his temper and the sheer power of his anger and rage flowed through the magical artifact, the Stone glowed with a green-gold light that looked sick and diseased, utterly different from the two times Gloria had used the gemstone before. From her vantage point a few feet away from Bill and Gloria's confrontation, Tammy saw it first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That...That doesn't look right!' Her mind raced as tendrils of light seeped out from between Bill's clenched fist. Before, when Gloria had made her wishes, the light from the gemstone had merely lit up the dark haired girl's hand, like she'd been holding a flashlight against her palm but this...This looked wrong. But her observation came a moment too late as Bill's anger boiled forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I wish everyone could see you for the devil you really are, Gloria!\" Bill roared, shoving a finger at Gloria's face as her dark eyes went wide with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BILL NO-\" Was all Tammy could cry out before her vision was filled diseased looking magical light, the tendrils of magical energy intensifying in size and strength as they spun out of control, washing over Gloria, Bill and Tammy like an explosion of ribbons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill had been filled with the rush of actually using the Stone, so much so that even through the magical blindness and the wave of nausea (which he didn't register as wrong, given this was the first time he'd used the Ahn'Ger Stone) he was filled with the petty thrill of victory. When this was all over Gloria would no longer be queen of Shermer High! She'd be hated by everyone because they'd all see what kind of horrible person she was! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that feeling of victory vanished immediately as his vision returned and he saw what he had unleashed upon the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in front of him was indeed Gloria...But not the Gloria he had envisioned when he'd made his wish. Instead of shunned and miserable looking, instead Gloria was now at least two feet taller and her body a deep shade of red as two red, leathery wings stretched out from her back as a thick, pointed tail slithered and twisted in the air behind her. Gloria's feet had been replaced with a pair of black hooves as her legs were decidedly ungulated. She was naked as well, save for blue and black fire that sat against her red skin like she was wearing a burning bikini, covering her crotch and cradling her now much large bust in flames that radiated heat but didn't seem to burn her. As Gloria stretched her newly elongated limbs, Bill could see the other changes to her body. She wasn't entirely just naked save for the hellish flames she now wore; There were flecks of black here and there as well, spurs of obsidian looking bone that poked through her red skin on the back of her arms, her elbows, her shoulders. A pair of wicked looking spikes sticking outwards from the back of her horse-like legs and twin barbs that topped her new tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong black nails tipped her unnaturally long fingers, and more black spikes poked through her red skin in detailed patterns as they ran up her powerful, yet slender arms. Gloria's face had changed a little as well, becoming more angular, sharper. She wasn't entirely unpleasant to look at, but it filled Bill with a sense of dread as the changed girl began to look over herself with a pair of black eyes.Above her, pushing out from her much longer black hair that seemed to move on it's own were two large, curved horns and a small ball of purple fire hung between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria looked just like a demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAverting his gaze, Bill suddenly could see the landscape around him had changed dramatically as well. Instead of a pleasant April morning in otherwise normal Shermer Illinois...The landscape was now twisted as well. The entire neighborhood looked as if a bomb...Or several thousand bombs had gone off, all the houses now nothing more than burning shells and charred frameworks. Thick black clouds covered the sky, and eerie red lightning illuminated far larger...things hidden behind them. It looked as though Hell had come to Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god\" Bill croaked, his throat and mouth completely dry from the heat. In alarm he looked down at himself, expecting to find his own body transformed into some demonic hellbeast...But only saw the tattered remnants of his clothing hanging off his emaciated frame. He looked almost skeletal! Like that one weird Christian Bale movie! Bill turned to look towards Tammy, half expecting her to have undergone the same transformation as Gloria...Only to see that she herself was still human, although little more than a skeleton like himself. She was mostly naked save for an over-size shirt that looked more like a torn burlap sake, and most of her blonde hair was gone save for a few dirty, limp strand. The rest of her scalp was scabbed and bruised, almost as if the rest of her hair had been forcibly removed, and deep black circles hung beneath exhausted, terrified eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh\" Came a sexual moan that drew Bill's attention back to the demon version of Gloria in front of him. She was sliding her clawed hands up and down her new body, slicing her flesh from the sharpness of her nails, oily black blood leaking out of her body before bursts of infernal flame sealed the wounds. A forked tongue slithered out from behind her fangs and across her plump black lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guh-Gloria?\" Bill rasped, \"Is that...Is that you?\" Bill regretted drawing attention to himself. Gloria's new eyes snapped away from her body and onto him, the black sclera broken only by the burning red irises that seemed to bore right into his very soul and made his skin feel as though he was being pricked by a thousand needles. It was a predatory gaze, one that matched the unsettling fanged smile that took form on Gloria's black lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt HURT to look at her! Bill's body shook involuntarily and he tried to turn away, only to be stopped by a single long claw that cut into his dry skin as Gloria forced the doomed teenager to look back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Billy Billy Billy...\" Gloria purred in a voice that sounded like her old voice but tinted with a demonic reverb, \"Oh, how do I thank you for this? I feel so much more like...me!\" Gloria cackled, her wings flapping with delight as Bill fought the urge to void piss himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait, the Stone! I can fix all this if I-\" Bill thought suddenly, but found himself a moment too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But before you do anything...rash, let's just take that pretty little problem away, shall we?\" Gloria purred before her voice took on a much more commanding tone, \"<b>Now. Give me the Stone, Bill</b>\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill felt the urge to do what Gloria said take over every fiber of his being, unable to even fight himself as his withered arm simply rose upwards and presented the Stone to Gloria, the infernal light glittering off it's dull surface. That was when he saw it, the massive crack that ran down the side of the Stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'A crack? That...That must be why the wish fucked up!' Bill thought as he tried in vain to make a wish. But then the Stone was gone, plucked from his fingers by two long black nails as Gloria brought it up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Bill! Such a pretty thing, isn't it? I can feel the energy in it...\" Gloria closed her eyes and Bill felt a pressure lift from his body, regaining control of his limbs. \"Oh, if only we'd known what this really was...I can see it all so clearly now! The power of the cosmos was in the palms of our hands! To think I wasted it on such petty, childish wishes...But then again, we WERE only children. C'est le vie, I suppose\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, right as Bill was about to leap for the Stone, Gloria simply squeezed her fingers together and the magical artifact, the ONLY thing that could have saved them, erupted in a small explosion of green and gold light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Bill and Tammy screamed in unison, and Gloria simply cackled in delight as the energy flowed into her, the flames on her body changing from black and blue to gold and green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't be sad you two! We couldn't let anything else get a hold of that. It would ruin all of our fun\" The demoness said with a sigh of pleasure. She stretched out an unnaturally long arm towards Tammy and with a simple flick of her finger, Tammy's frail form lifted from the blasted rock and flew towards Gloria and Bill, the equally doomed teenager slowing to a stop next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if we're gonna keep hanging out, you both have to work on your fashion senses. Here, let me help you!\" Gloria said with a fanged smile as she slid her claws across what remained of Bill and Tammy's clothing. The sharpness of her talons caused the ruined fabric to simply part and slide to the barren ground, leaving the two humans naked, and very much afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There! Now you both look great!\" Gloria grinned evilly as she flapped her wings, lifting her off the dead ground as she moved behind Bill and Tammy, landing once more and placing two clawed hands on both of their shoulders. Gloria's barbed tail then flicked out from behind her, arcing up like a scorpion about to strike before ripping downwards, a rift of green fire splitting open the air and leading to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill gulped as he saw what was awaiting them. As bad as Earth looked, what lay beyond the rift looked worse. So much worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill felt her pushing him forward towards the gaping maw hanging before him and Tammy. There was no way to fight it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait to show you this, you guys! You're...Well, I'M going to love it!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bill glared at Gloria and squeezed the Ahn'Ger Stone tight in his fist, unaware that the magical artifact had been damaged from it's recent airborne journey down the hall. It hadn't been enough to simply make them all old, and turn Tom into Bill's wife, and now his girlfriend, no no, Gloria had altered his family entirely, making him no longer born to Martha and Greg Strasserman and had erased his little sister from existence entirely! And had warped the daughter that he and Tammy had been given in the future into his older sister! And despite the three teens not realizing it, BIll himself had gone a subtle shift in appearance, his genetics changing to fit that of his new parents. Bill looked over at Tom...Tammy, the cute, geeky blonde currently caught in a loop of examining her newer, younger body and looking at Bill in worry and concern. Only a few minutes ago the curvy, short girl had been the best male athlete in Shermer, but thanks to Gloria was now twisted far and away, not just physically but mentally, from his original form. All because Gloria couldn't stop meddling with people's lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is all your fault!\" Bill hissed, pointing a finger in Gloria's face as he raised his hand holding the strange wishing Stone high in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm Sorry!\" The dark haired cheerleader cried out, large, watery eyes flicked between the enraged teen's face and the sickly off-green light in his hand, the tell-tale sign that the Stone was ready to grant a wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too late for apologies! All you do is hurt people Gloria! You're just as bad as Rob Bolstrum or Big Jon! I WISH YOU COULD NEVER HURT ANYONE AGAIN!\" Bill roared, lowering his glowing fist and shoving it in Gloria's face right as the light pulsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Gloria screamed at the top of her voice, and then everything went green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to all the teens gathered in the upstairs hallway of the new Strasserman household, a red-headed giant was watching them from down below, hateful eyes glaring upwards at them as the trespasser, Rob Bolstrum, wondered just what the hell was going on. The disgraced bully was there to try to convince Bill to help him take down Big Jon, but he hadn't expected Bill's mousy little girlfriend or the queen bitch of Shermer High to be there! Or Bill's hot sister Willow. He'd thought about bailing, but then the fight between Gloria and Bill, the strange other-worldly light had captured his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unknown to everyone in Bill's house, from the three time-traveling teens to the bully and the daughter out of time in the garage, Bill's wish was not going to be granted as he wanted, and the damage done to the Stone lashed out at all of them as their bodies began to change. And then as quickly as it had begun, the changes were over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the world returned, there was only darkness and heat, and the rhythmic thumping of something behind him told Bill that his wish had gone very, very wrong.<br>\r\n__<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow busied herself at the kitchen counter, mature hands gliding over four pieces of bread as a knife spread a creamy application of golden-brown peanut butter upon the exposed sides of two of the slices before placing their companions on top of them, and then using the sharp blade to cut both of the new sandwiches in half, creating four small rectangles. The curvy, curly haired woman dropped the knife into the sink as she minced across the kitchen and retrieved the plastic wrap from one of the higher shelves and returned to the counter, quickly tearing off several pieces and expertly wrapping the small sandwiches up securely. With that chore done she took the small delectibles and placed them within the nearby brown paper bag, along with a small bag of grapes and a Capri Sun juice pouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we are...\" Willow said quietly to herself, glancing up at the kitchen clock that now read \"7:00AM\". She smiled as she rolled the top of the bag down until it was reduced to half of it's original size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still plenty of time. Way to go Wills! You're on it this morning!\" The big-bottomed woman allowed herself a little victory dance in the kitchen before swooping the brown paper bag off the counter. She moved out of the kitchen and into the foyer of the large house, placing the brown lunch bag next to a pink backpack that had a cartoon pony emblazoned upon it, and in one fluid movement moved to and up the stairs. She passed by the wall of family photos that where hung there, the numerous pictures of her and her parents, of her husband Rob (who was already at work for the day), the two of them on vacation, the look of happiness on both their faces, and of course, the swarm of photos as a small child appeared in their arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowed her pace however as she came to the upper floor of her home, creeping out onto the second story landing and making her way quietly down the hall to a door that was covered in a mess of multi-colored streamers. Willow's hand softly grasped the door knob and gave it a slow, quiet turn, the latch releasing and the door sliding open just as quietly as the adult woman prepared for one of her favorite parts of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door swung upon and there, nestled in a mountain of covers, was her precious daughter, Tammy, the five year old's eyes still softly shut as she lay snuggled in her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, my baby!' Willow thought, her heart almost exploding with motherly love as she padded across the toy-covered carpet. She lowered her substantial rear to the bed and brushed at the thick, burgundy locks that covered her daughter's face, and the small child shifted in her sleep, digging deeper under the covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tammy...\" Willow whispered softly, giving her daughter's face another soft  stroke, \"It's time to go to school!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe child grunted and slid almost entirely under the covers, and Willow fought back the urge to laugh at how cute it looked. Instead she simply stood and slowly peeled back the covers as if she was peeling an orange. As the covers slipped away Willow watched as her daughter curled into a small ball of Paw Patrol pajamas and two tiny bare feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon baby, time to get up!\" Willow said in a singsong voice as she sat back down on the bed, placing a hand on Tammy's back. After a moment her daughter began to truly stir, the small body unfolding from the tight ball as tiny limbs stretched out, a squeak of a yaw escaping from a between tiny, chubby cheeks. From out of the center of the ball two small toys tumbled out of her embrace and onto the bed; a traditional plushy rag doll that was looking a little worn from years of use, and Tammy's newest toy, a posable plastic doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are, booger!\" Willow said with a laugh, plucking the toys off the mattress and setting them on the small beside table, where they slumped against each other, their warm surfaces cooling as Tammy's body heat faded away into the morning air. But Willow didn't pay any mind to her daughter's favorite, (and oldest) toys as she scooped the small wiggling child up from the bed and blew a big raspberry on her belly, resulting in a loud squeal of delight from the five year old in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go get you ready\" Willow said, and without a second look to the bear and doll, carried her daughter out of the bedroom and towards the upstairs bathroom to get her ready for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh god. OH GOD!' Gloria screamed in silence as she found herself unable to move, her eyes locked straight ahead as her new body failed to respond to her commands. Her cotton filled head had flopped at just the right angle for her to see her new body in the closet mirror; she was small, so very small, and her hair, if it could still be called that, was a mop head of black yarn that was stitched into her over-sized, flesh colored felt head that hung down past where her ears should have and ending at the nape of her new neck. Her eyes were two bright green buttons and her mouth was a thin line of pink colored stitching curing upwards in a smile that Gloria definitely was NOT feeling, and her plushy neck disappeared down into a oblong tube shaped body that was clothed in a large black and white polka dotted dress. Curved, digit-less limbs poked out of the obnoxious fabric, two arms she couldn't move and two legs that didn't support her new, almost weightless, body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe COULDN'T be a doll! She was Gloria Vanapolous! The queen of Shermer High! SHE WAS A PERSON NOT A TOY!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'MOMMY!' She wailed in absolute terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What...What happened!?' Bill wondered as he underwent the same realization that he couldn't move. His eyes looked straight ahead in the closet mirror as he took in his new form. He looked like Gloria! Or rather, a Barbie doll version of her! He was wearing the exact same clothes as she'd been wearing before he made the wish, and his face was painted up to look like a much more friendly and happy version of the dark haired bitch that had ruined everyone lives this morning!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You have GOT to be fucking kidding me!\" Bill swore in the lonely expanse of his own mind as he struggled to figure out what had gone wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd unseen by both newly produced toys, the Ahn'Ger Stone slid deeper beneath the pillows of Tammy's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Bill and Gloria are now toys belonging to Tammy Bolstrum, the new daughter of Willow Bolstrum and Rob Bolstrum, who had been transformed by the damaged Stone as well. Unable to move, unable to speak, little more than a few pieces of fabric and plastic, they are vulnerable to the world and completely incapable of changing back on their own. Tammy and Willow return after a few minutes, and a glimmer of hope emerges as the little girl begins searching for the Stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Bill and Gloria live the life of toys as no one else seems to remember the previous reality. then one day, perhaps because of the broken magic of the Stone or perhaps just Tammy's childlike belief that her toys are 'real', Bill and Gloria find that if they focus enough, they can move and even speak to each other!</span></div></div>",

With two sets of memories in her blonde-topped head, Tammy knew just how much Bill hated her former girlfriend. And Tammy couldn't blame him, Gloria had done absolutely nothing but make things worse! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd like, seriously, how could she have ever been attracted to Gloria in the first place? Tammy chalked it up to her thankfully no longer existant raging male hormones. Maybe it was just her own pair of tits talking, but Tammy was so glad to no longer be thinking with a dick and making horrible choices in potential life partners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut yes, from the memories of being older and married to Bill, she knew her former husband turned boyfriend could, when finally pushed to the edge, have quite a temper and make extremely poor decisions. He'd only directed that anger towards Tammy once during an argument about Willow's finances and how draining it was putting their daughter through college on the other side of the country in one of the most expensive states. He never laid a hand on Tammy, but he'd ended up in jail after getting into a bar fight soon after charging out of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow was her chance to prevent her dearest from doing something incredibly stupid, and to get the Stone away from Gloria before she made her own poorly thought out wished that made things even worse. With a unexpected lunge, the small blonde girl leapt on top of Gloria Vanapolous and took the dark haired beauty to the floor of the Strasserman household. Tammy straddled Gloria across the chest while Bill stared on, her un-decorated nails clawing at Gloria's hand, prying the strange emerald loose from her former girlfriend's fingers and rolling off of Gloria with a muffled \"oof!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU BITCH! GIVE THAT BACK!\" Gloria screamed and she scrambled off the floor as Tammy did the same. Before her alternate reality ex could do anything though Tammy bolted into the upstairs bathroom and slammed the door shut on Gloria's face, trying not to smile as she felt the other girl bounce off the hard surface with a shriek. Locking the door behind her, Tammy staggered over to the toilet and sat down, some distant part of her mind groaning that Bill had left the lid open. AGAIN. Miss Ackerton ignored the furious pounding on the door and the yells coming from the other side as she settled down onto the porcelain throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there, on the toilet, Tammy stared into the Stone as it began glowing in her palm, feeling...angry. Not as angry as she remembered being as Tom, not enough to cause an outburst, but it was a deeper simmering anger that seemed more...emotional, if that could be the case. MAybe it was having been completely powerless before, just a victim of change, having her life, youth stripped away (but given back to her in a different way), her sweet daughter no longer hers, or maybe just all the horrible things that she remembered dealing with as Tom, but it was clearly enough to power the Stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing the Stone close to her, nestling it within her breasts, Tammy...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>...no. That was lay madness. Tammy decided that she was going to take a deep breath and think this one through. In less than an hour, her entire identity and sense of self had irrevocably changed. She was never going back to being Tom now, not after what she had experienced, not after an entire lifetime's worth of enchanted memories lay ahead of her with Bill. If the gemstone she held in her hands could produce <i>such</i> a profound effect that she'd want to immediately switch teams, she couldn't afford to make reckless and irresponsible wishes the way Gloria had. Allowing cooler heads to prevail, the glow inside the green-gold gemstone she held in her hand slowly began to fade away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow safe inside the sanctuary of the bathroom, the beleaguered jock turned brainy blonde listened as chaos unfolded just down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bill, get Tom to open that goddamn door this instant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, so you can make another wish?! You already destroyed my entire family! I'm not looking forward to your hat trick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear to God, I'm smashing that door into splinters if you don't get her fat ass out here pronto, Strasserman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Newsflash, Vanapoulous, this is <i>my</i> house! You may <i>think</i> you own the world and can just waltz right into anywhere you like and start breaking things, but when you're on <i>my</i> property, you follow the rules!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm sorry! I <i>clearly</i> didn't mean to make your little sister or your parents disappear, but we <i>need</i> to get that stone back so can figure out what our next move is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean what <i>my</i> next move is! The stone doesn't belong to you, dipshit! It belongs to me! I found it first! You grabbed it out of my hands because you're a fucking selfish cunt that's attracted to shiny objects!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you, Bill! Go get your butt buddy out of that bathroom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill took a deep breath and calmed down just a touch. Wiping sweat from his brow, he realized that his face was flushed from rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easier said than done\" he replied forlornly. \"I...I don't think that she wants to go back to being Tom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think for a second! The reality we just escaped! What, do you not remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm blocking all of that weird crap out of my head. I've got enough drama to deal with let alone remembering how I look when I'm old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well for your information, Tammy and I were married for close to thirty years in that reality. I remember <i>all</i> of it. Our first date. The wedding. The honeymoon. The sex. Running a business. Tammy's pregnancy. Raising Willow as our daughter. If <i>I</i> remember all of that, <i>she</i> must remember it too, and if she does, she'll remember how happy she was. Tammy was FAR happier than she ever was as Tom. It sounds bizarre, but maybe she was meant to be a mom and my wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria began guffawing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you call <i>me</i> selfish!? I see what this is. You want to keep Tom trapped as your little geekette sex slave because you're too ugly to get a date with any actual women!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she wouldn't be this way if you hadn't treated Tom like crap! I heard those fake rumors you spread about him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Which</b>, in case you conveniently forgot, I came here to apologize for, jerk! Fine! If she wants to stay as Tammy, it's no skin off my ass! Go convince your little psychotic schizo girlfriend to get down here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn between the domestic dispute, Tammy heard a door open and close, followed by a third voice making themselves known. She immediately recognized the reedy voice as belonging to Willow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, what's going on? Why are you two fighting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tammy won't leave the bathroom\" replied Bill, suddenly much calmer in front of his daughter turned sister. \"She's uh...she's upset about something\" he continued, struggling to come up with a convincing lie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She stole something from my mother!\" lied Gloria out of the blue, being totally at home with deception. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Yeah\" said Bill, catching on quickly. \"Her mother's gemstone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A precious family heirloom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gloria was trying to show us her mom's gemstone when Tammy snatched it out of Gloria's hand for some crazy reason and then locked herself in the bathroom\" Bill elaborated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh\" nodded Willow, looking at both teenagers skeptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the current reality where Willow was Bill's older sister, she had loved to play matchmaker between Bill and Tammy, knowing the two were perfect for each other while experiencing the vicarious thrill of \"shipping\" them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow knew Tammy extremely well. She considered the studious blonde almost like an honorary member of the family given how often she hung around the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's why she knew that Bill and Gloria were lying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try, guys. I know what this is\" replied Willow with slight cockiness in her tone. \"Bill, how <i>could</i> you?! Is this is why you've been hanging around Gloria so often lately, because you're cheating on Tammy with her!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill and Gloria turned to one face one another, both in stunned disbelief, Gloria even being slightly slack-jawed. The two teenagers <i>hated</i> one another. They couldn't be more dissimilar personality wise. They had nothing at all in common, and both were subtlety grossed out at the idea of dating each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...No?\" answered Bill. He was so shocked by the question that he didn't know how to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't play innocent with me, buster! Go upstairs and apologize to that poor girl. My God, she's probably in tears right now. The nerve you have to do this while I'm late for class and you're late for class...ugh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Willow\" said Bill very patiently and measured, still remembering Willow as his daughter from the previous reality, \"I did <i>not</i> cheat on Tammy. That's not what this is about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared very deliberately into Willow's doey blue eyes as if to further drive home the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what <b>is</b> it about? You two were screaming so loud, the neighbors across the street heard it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Bill could answer, the basement door swung open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHITTERMAN! DON'T YOU MOVE, ASSHOLE!\" roared the very last voice that Bill wanted to hear now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rob!\" gulped Bill with genuine fear in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rob Bolstrum!\" eeped out Willow. Despite being twenty years old, she had attended Shermer High as a Senior while Rob was a Sophomore, and she was just as afraid of his violent temper as Bill was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, what next?\" sighed Gloria. She and Rob Bolstrum had never crossed paths with one another, but she knew enough about his reputation to know that he was a Neanderthal and a pig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rob Bolstrum?\" whispered Tammy to herself. The Ahn'Ger Stone she held between her chest began to glow once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get in here?\" demanded Bill to the thuggish looking bully. He tried to sound tough while stepping slightly behind his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been here all morning, chump. 'Been hiding in your basement right under your noses. Big Jon sent me here to torch your house to the ground for squealing on him. Problem? I don't want to go to jail for some other asshole's personal vendetta. I came here to cut a deal with you, but then I heard all of this nonsense about a magic rock, and I want in. What's it do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic rock?\" asked Willow in pure confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rob...I wouldn't team up with you if Thanos was here. You're shit to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob laughed cruelly at the trio of trembling weaklings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you trying to act tough or something, Shitterman? Like one of your faggoty superheroes? Listen, you might be the rooster in this henhouse, but I'm the fox. I eat geeks like you. Now tell me about this rock Ackerton has before I beat it out of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" screamed Willow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You touch my girl, and you're being carried out of here in a stretcher with broken legs\" replied Bill with empty bravado, having nothing to back up his threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy's eyes widened in terror as the stone now glowed like a miniature star. She couldn't let her Bill get hurt! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob laid a single meaty hand on Bill's shoulder in a not so subtle display of dominance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you <i>feel</i> in charge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill's legs were shaking so hard he was afraid that he was about to collapse. Even Gloria and her normal minimal level of empathy for anyone that wasn't herself began to worry at what was about to happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You couldn't follow through on that threat, and you know it, buddy. Now why don't we go upstairs and talk to your dorky girlfriend about this apparently reality altering stone, and I'll be on my way\" monologued Rob in a faux-friendly voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery reluctantly, Bill followed Rob's lead upstairs to the second story bathroom, his legs continuing to tremble with the emasculating feeling of helplessness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the bathroom door slammed open, revealing a furious Tammy Ackerton. She was holding the Ahn'Ger Stone triumphantly in her right hand, like a character on the cover of a fantasy novel brandishing a sword. Willow and Gloria both gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU WANT MY STONE, ASSHOLE!? WELL YOU CAN'T HAVE IT! NONE OF YOU CAN! I WISH...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: \"YOU'D ALL LISTEN TO WHAT I SAY!\". The stone grants Tammy's wish. Now Tammy has a compelling voice like Kilgrave from Jessica Jones, allowing her to mentally control Bill, Rob, Gloria, and Willow. They will still be themselves, but if she orders them to do something, they HAVE to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: \"... YOU'D ALL JUST BUG OFF!\". Rob, Bill, Willow, and Gloria all transform into barely sentient houseflies, and Tammy finds herself back in her own house. Without any close friends or enemies Tammy is now a friendless nerd who barely anyone notices.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"YOU WANT MY STONE, ASSHOLE!? WELL YOU CAN'T HAVE IT! NONE OF YOU CAN! I WISH YOU'D ALL LISTEN TO WHAT I SAY!\" Tammy screamed at the top of her lungs, and the Stone flashed across her blonde framed vision, blinding her for the shortest of moments along with Bill, Rob, Gloria and Willow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it was gone, fading away into the normal light of day. Tammy opened an eye cautiously and saw Rob lowering one of his enormous arms from his face and looking himself over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, looks like you wasted your chance, Ackertits!\" Rob said as he pushed the near-nothing resistance of Bill away, sending the teenager tumbling down the stairs as the towering bully charged towards Tammy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BILL!\" Tammy screamed as her beloved flopped down the stairs like a broken slinky, and then Rob was upon her, grabbing a small arm in a vice grip, causing Tammy to scream in pain. Tears welled up in her eyes as her pain receptors kicked into overdrive as the bully, well, bullied her. And in her two lifetimes of Tammy memories, the person she was now, she had never felt this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GIVE ME THE ROCK!\" Rob roared as he jerked Tammy around like little more than a plaything. Had Tammy still been Tom, there may have been a chance for the former jock to put up a fight, but now he was a she, and she was a muscle-less little nerd completely at the mercy of a predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was nothing more than prey. It HURT to be prey. Tammy had known physical pain but nothing like this, not even in Tom's memories of dozens of sports injuries. No, this pain was expertly applied and Tammy was suddenly slammed against the upstairs wall of the Strasserman home as Rob pinned her with a slab of muscled meat, twisting the arm that held the Stone nearly backward as fingers that felt calloused began peeling her own away like the skin of an orange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then just like that, she the Stone leave her hand, and the pain (or at least, the immediate pain) left her body. Tammy spun around, the golden-green sun in Rob's fingers a blurry orb as tears flowed freely, running tracks down her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh\" Rob chuckled as he gazed, eyes wide in delight as a toothy grin split his leathery face, but there was no warmth in it. Instead Tammy saw only something that made the very core of her soul shudder in fear. Something was happening at the bottom of the stairs, but Tammy's eyes were locked on the man she had failed to stop. She tried to think of something, any thing she could do to fix the mistake, say something inspired like the heroes in the movies she and Bill watched, in the fantasy novels she adored reading, but all that came out was;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GIVE THAT BACK RIGHT NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just as Rob was about to make his first devastating wish, one that would have resulted in carnage, chaos and disorder on a massive scale, the giant quickly turned and immediately handed the Ahn'Ger Stone back to Tammy, the Stone's powerful glow diminishing to little more than a flicker of light as it transferred owenrs once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Hey, no that's mine now!\" Rob said as he felt his body back up a couple of steps from Tammy. In an instant he went from absolute victory, his perfect chance to get even with the world and to turn Ingerman into something worse than death for the humiliation Rob had suffered...And just like that he'd felt compelled to give it back to the sniffling little bitch in front of him. It was like his mind, on the cusp of making a wish, had clouded over the moment Tammy had told him to give it back to her and telling him the only important thing to do in life was to do as she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy broke out into a hateful grin as the light in the Stone flared slightly as she closed her fist. \"Wasted my chance, huh Rob? Go stick your head in the toilet and flush until I say stop!\" Tammy tried not to squeal in delight as the bully's angry, astonished face went slightly slack as his body took on a rigid, robotic stance, jerkily moving towards the upstairs bathroom where Tammy watched as the bully flicked on the light, moved and kneeled in front of the small in comparison toilet, and stick his head all the way in. The sound of the toilet's plunger jingling in the tank and the rushing water splashing against Rob's head as the bully roared in outrage was a sweet symphony of revenge. But the yelling WAS getting pretty old...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now shut up and think about what you did, Rob\" Tammy said, and Rob's mouth immediately snapped shut, the only sound now being the rushing, splashing water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in Rob's mind, he suddenly couldn't do anything but think about how he'd come up out of the basement and the events that led him to this moment. What had he done wrong!? This wasn't fair!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied that the immediate threat was neutralized, Tammy suddenly remembered Bill, his body tumbling down the stairs like a ragdoll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD!\" Tammy shouted in horror and spun away from the sight of the bully giving himself a infinite swirly. Her tiny feet padded across the upstairs carpet as she barreled towards the stairs, grabbing the banister and freezing as she saw the scene before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, at the bottom of the stairs, lay the crumpled, bleeding mess that was Bill. His left arm and right leg were bent at odd angles, something sharp and white jutting through the skin of his arm. His eyes were closed and his face was slack and limp, the small coffee table that had been at the bottom of the stairs was flipped over and the corner was snapped off, the broken wood laying near a gash in Bill's now bleeding skull. Willow was frantically dialing 9-11 through a waterfall of tears as she became dangerously close to hyperventilating, while Gloria just stood off to the side with a shocked look on the face that Tammy had once been attracted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BILL!\" Tammy sobbed, and she stormed down the stairs to join her once-daughter and once-girlfriend, the Ahn'Ger Stone still in hand. \"Oh god, my Bill!\" She said, falling to her knees and grabbing the teenager's uninjured arm. Tammy only knew the basics of first aide and she immediately flailed as she watched how shallow Bill's breathing was. Meanwhile next to her, Willow had dropped her phone as her breathing began spiraling out of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, what did you do, Tom?\" Gloria said, backing away, and Tammy's eyes shot up from her boyfriend to the girl she used to fuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUCK YOU GLORIA! DO SOMETHING! HELP US!\" Tammy screamed through her tears, so many that she didn't see Gloria's body go rigid, or the robotic movement that betrayed the look of utter fear and surprise in her eyes as Tammy's old reality ex suddenly knelt beside Bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please back away\" Gloria heard herself say in a cold, emotionless voice. It wasn't what she wanted to say, but it was becoming very clear she wasn't in control anymore. Instead she watched as a passenger in her own body as picked up Willow's cellphone and dialed 911 and put it on speakerphone. When the voice on the other end picked up, Gloria heard herself speaking in the same robotic tone to the dispatcher, describing Bill's injuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy, meanwhile, had gone back to sobbing and cradling Bill's good arm against her chest, rocking back and forth while kissing her love's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please be okay Bill1\" She whispered through sobs, \"You have to be ok! BE OKAY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Tammy's new vocal powers extend beyond just simple verbal commands. Instead, she watches as Bill's injuries magically begin to heal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Tammy and Gloria follow the ambulance to the hospital, enduring a very tense silence after Tammy commanded Gloria to just \"shut up and drive\". Meanwhile, Rob remains at the Strasserman household, trying not to drown in the toilet and thinking of a way to get even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Tammy's command having been followed, Gloria punches Tammy in the face and steals back the Stone!</span></div></div>",

Everywhere the lights touched was repaired, fixed, mended. Bones silently set themselves back into their natural position and grew solid once more. Skin once punctured, seamlessly stitched itself back together and the large amount of blood that had pooled around Bill's body was simply gone as the teenage Strasserman let loose an enormous gasp of air as he shot upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLY SHIT WHAT\" Bill yelled in surprise, his head spinning wildly around as he tried to make sense of his surroundings. Beyond his notice though, the lights flickered away as the last threads of Bill's clothes knitted back together. \"Man, what happened?\" Bill said, taking another deep breath as his heart, full of adrenaline and suddenly refilled blood threatened to pound out of his chest. The last thing he remembered was the flash of light and Rob pushing him down the stairs...And then hitting something hard and then nothing. Had he died?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Bill didn't have any more time to ponder, as a crying Tammy shoved herself into his arms and planted a sloppy, salty kiss on his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH BILLY YOU'RE OKAY!\" Tammy said once she released her love from the kiss. She buried her blonde head into Bill's c hest and sobbed some more, gripping the boy she loved as tight as her arms would allow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...wow\" Was all Bill could think to say. The kiss was electrical, sending a shockwave through his body just like he remembered in the old life he had lived with Tammy, but it felt...new. Maybe it was just because they were young again. \"Yeah, I'm okay Tammy\" He said, rubbing Tammy's back and burying his face in her hair. It smelled nice. But that's when Bill heard the panicked gasping that his older memories knew. Willow was having a panic attack! He released Tammy from his grip and turned towards Willow who was as white as a sheet, gripping her head in her hands and rocking back and forth. Bill felt Tammy rasie her head from his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Tammy said as the crying fit seemed to finally be passing. But then she finally processed the wheezing sound as well and blinked her eyes from of tears, \"Oh, shit! Um...Willow..uh\" Tammy paused. In her previous life, she had always calmed her daughter by holding her and stroking her hair, but the larger part of her that was a teenager now simply was at a loss of what to do. It would be weird for her to hug a grown woman, and if she had the power to heal Bill...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Willow, uh, sis, just, just slow down okay? Take a big deep breath and-\" Bill started, but was silenced as Tammy put a small, bruising finger to his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Willow, uh, you've never had panic attack and you're not going to start now!\" Tammy said, staring intently at Willow and seeing if her hunch was right. After a moment of Willow continuing to wheeze and gasp, her skin white and her eyes wide Tammy was fearful that maybe it was just a one time thing, but then she saw it. the lights returned, shimmering up and down Willow's nearly unresponsive form. Her skin regained it's color, her eyes normalized, her breathing slow and stable as her mind was released from it's panic. The lights slid upwards and formed a halo around Willow's head, intensifying in brightness for only a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit, my head!\" Willow cried out as her face that had once looked like both Bill and Tammy, but now only mildly resembled Bill's scrunched in pain as the memories of every panic attack she ever had were erased. Instead they were replaced by memories of being cool and level headed in emergencies. It seemed a little off, but she'd never crumpled into a hyperventilating ball under pressure. She was Willow Strasserman, Bill's big sister and strong willed! And speaking of...Willow's eyes went wide as she saw Bill up and moving around as the memory of him laying broken and bleeding faded away. Bill had just harmlessly fallen down the stairs, but as his big sister she was still protective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Bill! Are you okay? Are you hurt?\" Willow said as she pulled herself up to her feet and moved over to Bill, her fierce eyes scanning him for any injuries, \"I swear to god I'm going to call the police on that Bolstrum shithead! You don't just break into someone's house and assault them, I don't care what he says!\" And with that, Willow quickly found her phone sitting next to Gloria, who seemed to be in some sort of trance state. The 911 call was no longer on the phone, and in fact had never happened since Bill was okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd for Gloria, her mind had simply flopped over. It was too much! It was simply too much. When she had gotten out of bed this morning she had simply wanted to get back together with Tom, who was now Tammy and dating Bill, both of which and herself ha been disgusting and old for a brief period of time, now all this madness! And having Tom...Tammy order her around and have no control over what she was doing? That scared the absolute shit out of her. So instead her brain had chosen simply to check out for the moment while Willow retrieved her phone and called the Shermer police department.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, as Bill and Tammy picked themselves up off the floor, Bill was having trouble remembering what had just happened, both of them unaware of the small thin halo fading away around Bill's head as the memory of Willow's panic attack vanished. She was his protective big sister, it was right for her to be concerned. But then the memories of being older betrayed him, of watching Tammy calm their daughter down. Had something changed here, besides making Willow his older sister? Bill wasn't entirely sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as for Tammy, she was trying to contain her excitement at what had just happened. She could control people! Not just with commands, but she had magic now! Without the weird Stone! She wasn't sure if it was confined entirely to just healing, but the moment she found a chance to do so, she was going to have to experiment. But she was immensely grateful that the powers, whatever they were, didn't mess around ike the Stone clearly liked to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at Gloria and hearing the sound of constant flushing from upstairs, Tammy suddenly had a very mean, very fun idea...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Tammy decides to fix things by saying \"I've always been Tammy Ackerton. Tom never existed. This is who I've always been and everyone in the world will remember that!\" Tammy says, removing the memories of sadsack Tom from the minds of Bill and Gloria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: \"Gloria, you're not old enough to be here, you and Rob get to school!\" Tammy says, glaring at Gloria. Gloria immediately begins getting younger, and suddenly vanishes when she reaches five, appearing in a Kindergarten classroom where Rob suddenly finds himself as the very female Ms. Bolstrum.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tammy Ackerton was overflowing with emotions and feelings that she had never experienced as deeply or as intensely as she was right now Joy. Euphoria. Solace. They were practically seeping from the pores of her skin. She couldn't believe it. She had magic powers! Honest to God magic powers! She had neutered the terror named Rob Bolstrum with her compelling voice, cured poor Willow of her crippling panic attacks, got Gloria to finally shut her big mouth for one second, and most unbelievably, she had through sheer force of will altered reality itself to rescue the love of her life Bill from certain death. Like so many of her and Bill's favorite fictional characters, she was a hero! Everything went exactly as she had wanted it to! Tammy wanted to jump in the air and squeal like a little girl at the torrential downpour of giddy happiness her overstimulated mind was currently struggling to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Tammy got an idea. An awful idea. A wonderful awful idea that would solve all of her remaining personal problems in one fell swoop. An impish grin was forming across her adorable face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if she erased her old persona of Tom Ackerton from existence?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since the quartet of young adults had escaped from the distant future of 2058, Tammy had undergone an absolutely gargantuan shift in identity. It was so hard to explain to others why the change had impacted her as profoundly as it did, but she wasn't denying it anymore. She wanted this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer previous idea as Tom Ackerton had been secretly depressed for years, not having had a genuinely happy moment in his life since he was an eight year old boy resting on his father's lap. He had kept his depression secret from everyone. From his parents. From his mates on the football team. From his childhood friend, Bill. From Gloria. From everyone. Tom publicly wore the mask of the All American Golden Boy of Shermer High, nobody realizing that he was dying inside, Gloria's meanspirited campaign of character assassination and the moral void of Big Jon's existence finally pushing him over the edge into outright thoughts of suicide. No, life wasn't peachy keen for the boy who seemingly had everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clincher had been one night last October when Tom was watching of an old episode of The Twilight Zone with Bill.  The episode had been called \"A Stop At Willoughby\", where the beleaguered protagonist was somehow magically transported into another time period to escape his horrible life. That's what Tom had always wanted to do. He had yearned for some kind of escape, but he didn't know exactly <b>what</b> he was escaping from, or why he felt such a powerful feeling of wrongness to his existence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he knew. He was always meant to be Tammy. Tom was a mistake. Beneath his handsome, rugged exterior had always lain a gentle, feminine soul. Now he finally had a body and a life to match the core of his being, no surgery or hormone replacement  required. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was the point of holding onto an identity he no longer wanted or needed? Tammy surmised, absolutely none. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, being smaller and weaker and more vulnerable to predatory men wasn't exactly something Tammy <i>enjoyed</i> knowing was now a reality for her, nor was getting paid less on the dollar or any of the other crap women went through, but between her newfound powers and having Bill and Willow at her side, it was a trade off worth making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, she could barely contain her urge to giggle uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe adorable nerd girl next door couldn't <u>wait</u> to start living her life. But first, she needed to take out the human garbage. She strolled inside the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later, after giving Rob Bolstrum a few carefully worded commands, the bully robotically pulled his head out of the toilet, wiped off his face with a towel, stood up, and lurched down the stairs. He strolled right past the fearful gaze of Bill and the disgusted eyerolls of Willow and Gloria without even looking at them, without so much as a sneer, his body acting entirely against his will. His face was a picture of tranquility to anyone paying the bully only casual attention, but if one gazed closely at the subtle, barely perceptible displays of body language not under the enforcement of Tammy's vocal command, they would notice the fury of a man being held in a prison, a prison made of flesh and bone and some strange magic from beyond infinity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rob stutter-stepped off the Strasserman front porch, down the short flight of stairs, along the handsome little cobblestone pathway laying parallel to a beautiful garden display Martha Strasserman had planted, he realized that he now harbored a deep hatred for the not just the entire Strasserman family, but the blonde bitch who did this to him, the witch who somehow had sapped him of his free will. She was worse than Shitterman! As he lurched down the suburban street towards Shermer High, where Tammy had ordered him to actually attend classes, pay attention, and do the assigned work for once, Rob swore an oath to himself that if he ever escaped the magic spell Tammy had put him under, he was beating her into unconsciousness. Fuck the bully code he tentatively followed which forbade the hurting of women. That cunt drew first blood. Cunts need to shown their place, especially uppity ones like her. Then, he would steal that magic gemstone from her paws, get his long overdue revenge on Big Jon, and become the king of the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least in theory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tammy smiled at Rob's silent march, admiring her handiwork and cleverness(She had specifically ordered the bully to never interact with anyone from the Strasserman or Ackerton families for the rest of his life), she realized that she was now alone for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Showtime!\" she announced cheerfully to no one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the bright azure skyline of this perfect spring morning gave way to the dreariness of dark rainclouds, with a mild breeze gently whipping Tammy in the face. She giggled at the feeling of the downdraft as little droplets of water tickled her fair skin, the boy turned girl finding the sensation quite pleasurable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the hand mirror which she had grabbed from the bathroom and held it in front of her. For the first time today during this unbelievable morning, Tammy stared into her pretty face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.. I've always been Tammy Ackerton. Tom never existed. This is who I've always been and everyone in the world will remember that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second the words left her lips, the same little pinpricks of verdant light which had healed Bill and Willow now danced around Tammy, bathing her in their reality changing magic. They reminded the girl very much of hundreds of little Tinkerbell's, and she giggled at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed, knowing things would finally be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, I'm late for school!\" yelled Tammy Ackerton as the rainstorm intensified, droplets of water splashing sideways into her soft, beautiful face. She stormed back inside the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe academically minded young woman was proud of her multi year perfect attendance record. She hadn't once been late or absent from school since the third grade when she had the chickenpox, and she sure hell wasn't going to start now, especially not this close to graduation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, class starts in ten minutes!\" she announced loudly and somewhat obnoxiously to her boyfriend Bill and her...well, not friend, her acquaintance Gloria Vanapoulous, who she had been tutoring in science for the last quarter, here to pick up her homework.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh chill out, Hermione Granger\" snarked Gloria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill laughed as he gave his lovely girlfriend a peck on the cheek. \"We're just running a little late, sweetie. It's not the end of the world. Willow's driving us. We really shouldn't have stayed up all night binging Marvel movies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy rubbed her eyes and yawned loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we shouldn't have. But one thing leads to another, and what do you know, we're up until three in the morning debating over whether Ant-Man can crawl up Thanos's ass\" rationalized Tammy with a cheeky grin, grabbing her pink backpack which was sitting next to Bill's own blue-back one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small part of Tammy's mind was confused by all of this. Something felt off. She remembered the MCU movie marathon she had had with Bill last night. She remembered having dinner with the Strasserman's last evening, and before that, reluctantly finishing Gloria's homework for her after the cheerleader bribed her with a twenty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut why had she just been on the porch in the middle of a rainstorm? Why had she beenholding a hand mirror? Tammy didn't recall doing either of those things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How weird\" she whispered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since she had read the novels of Phillip K Dick as a little girl, Tammy had an intense fear of her memories being tampered with. This phobia was so intense that her parents had even taken her to see a psychiatrist over it when she was thirteen. Dr Gold had managed to assuage her fears of somehow magically waking up one day with implanted thoughts that weren't really hers, but a small part of her still wondered if it was somehow possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready guys?\" asked a perky Willow Strasserman as she led the trio of teenagers out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget the umbrella!\" said Bill cheerfully, grabbing his own which sat right by the front door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would I ever do without you, little brother?\" replied Willow in a sarcastic yet loving tone as she locked the front door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill and Tammy huddled together underneath the umbrella as they both ran to Willow's economy car and ran inside the backseat, both of them giggling like the young lovers they were. Gloria, rather childishly, had insisted on sitting in the front seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow put the keys in the ignition, and just like that, the four young adults drove off towards the glorious new day in the new world created by Tammy, a rainbow forming behind them.</span></div></div>",

The Ahn'Ger Stone was forgotten much like Tom had been, but it's purpose was no longer needed when a good hearted goddess roamed the world, changing things for the better with her sweet voice. Anything that ever went wrong, she fixed. Any disagreements, she handled. Any tests she struggled with, she suddenly aced. Anything she desired, she got, and anything she disliked ceased to exist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all the while, no one, not even Tammy herself knew the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, war and poverty, global tensions ceased to exist after night where Tammy and Bill (who was now slightly taller, had more muscles and looked not too dissimilar from Captain America in his first movie due to an offhand, under her breath comment a particularly lustful Tammy had made during their last Marvel marathon) had simply willed the world into peace after another grim news reports of violence in the Middle East. Humanity was united under one banner, and no one ever knew what had caused it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiseases of all kinds vanished with a word. There was no more cancer, no more Alzheimer's, no more heart disease or obesity. Depression or suicides. Everyone was healthy and happy all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a world without conflict, with anger or any true emotions beyond 'peace and love' was a boring one. Technological progress slowed, as there was no need to create new technologies to beat out a rival. Instead technology from Tammy's favorite movies and shows sprung into existence. Suddenly wingsuits like the Falcon's were commonplace, Iron Man suits being used in all manner of construction, starships caosting through the skies and into the stars beyond simply there as if they had always been there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe planet's population ballooned almost overnight as death was simply told to leave and never return, and only for a moment were the resources of planet Earth pushed to the limit before suddenly everyone found their plates full of food and drink. Even Mother Nature herself was bent to Tammy's will, as violent weather stopped and for a brief moment the entire planetary ecosystem was in a state of chaos before a terrified Tammy had simply yelled it away. Now there was only sunshine, blue skies and warm summer breezes. Every now and then there would be a thunderstorm or a snowy day, just enough to be romantic as Tammy snuggled with Bill under a blanket, but these momentary weather patterns only lasted until they were no longer enjoyable and the weather became Good once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew species and extinct blossomed into existence simply from offhand statements, based entirely on Tammy's imagination. Any potential threat that they may have introduced, nullifed by words. Asteroids and comets, new alien species, everyone and everything was simply...made good by Tammy's words. Even the Sun was tamed by Tammy, no longer would humantiy's perfect planet be threatened by the star's former fate of expanding outward into a Red Giant. Global warming simply went away, the ice caps returned, and even the Moon ceased it's slow escape from the Earth's gravitational pull once Tammy discovered it was growing more distant each year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even Tammy was changed by her own words. Over the centuries of life, ages of a blissful existence where nothing Bad ever happened, and everyone was content, Tammy had unknowingly changed herself. She now looked more like Scarlett Johansson from Iron Man 2 with the seemingly godmode intellect of Shuri from Black Panther, Even her personality had changed somewhat, becoming more confident as she copied traits from actresses and characters she admired onto herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and Bill shared a perfect marriage in a perfect house overlooking a perfect golden beach that set next to a perfect, unpolluted ocean. No fights, no discourse, nothing but unfiltered, unabashed love for each other, even if they both barely resembled (mentally and physically) the kids they had been decades ago when they'd first met. They were simply Good together. Like everyone now was, as divorce, marital strife and disloyalty had been erased. Tammy and Bill had dozens of children, all beautiful, all fit, all healthy and intelligent just like the rest of the world. And those hcildren eventually had their own children, just as beautiful as their parents and grandparents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that anyone physically aged beyond twenty-five anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the Ahn'Ger Stone simply vanished. It no longer had a purpose in this sweet, dreamlike plane of reality. Perhaps it was lost, or perhaps it simply returned to wherever it had come from, centuries ago on that fateful April morning that no one remembered. But that didn't stop Tammy from feeling Good. Indeed, it was hard for anyone at all to feel anything but Good, even in the event something Bad ever happened. Not that it ever did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of Eternity, the entire universe knew only that life was Good. And it would remain Good forever more.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gloria was having the single worst day of her life, far worse than the six months when she had been laid up with a broken leg during Sophomore year, or the numerous petty dramas she had admittedly helped instigate ever since she was a little kid, or the even the emotionally cataclysmic day her own mother coldly informed Gloria what she <i>really</i> thought of her spoiled brat of a daughter. No, as horrible as those memories were, they all paled in comparison to the last hour or so. So many outright brain melting things had happened within the span of this morning that Gloria's already stressed out, insecure sense of self simply didn't know how to respond to it all, which is why her mental faculties had temporarily shut down. How do you react to having your entire perception of what reality is not only called into question, but hopelessly, hilariously proven wrong? Can we blame Gloria for simply deciding to tune out all of this paranormal madness?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe temperamental teenage diva couldn't help but tremble at the sight of her former boyfriend glaring at her with evil intentions, grinning like the Cheshire Cat as she stood from the second floor railing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy was so meek looking, which made the fear Gloria had of her even more of a blow to her ego. Tom had been a conventionally handsome, All American jock, with perfect teeth and a chiseled jaw, washboard abs and sinewy muscles, which was a large part of what had attracted Gloria to him in the first place. The fact that he was also sensitive and kind and not cut out at all for the cutthroat world of high school social politics did not detract(At least not immediately) from Gloria's impression of him as a paragon of the manly hunk that she deserved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Tammy? Tammy was, in a word, cute. She never would have been able to climb the social ladder of Shermer High like Gloria had, but somebody like Tammy wasn't at the bottom rungs either. She was undeniably attractive in her own quirky way, in a geek girl sense. She was sweet and charming and just plain \"adorkable\" enough that Gloria wouldn't have felt embarrassed to talk to her in public. In another reality, Gloria had might have even felt generous enough to make Tammy one of her inner circle of girlfriends. On the surface, she was completely non threatening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow this cute little nerd girl had the power to force her will on others. To make other people her puppets and mind slaves simply by talking to them, which she had already done once to Gloria. Gloria's sense of  Pants? Already shit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appeared to Gloria that the stupid wish she had made to turn Tom and Bill into an old married couple had broken Tom's mind, making him really believe that she was Tammy. This hurt and disturbed Gloria more she would ever care to admit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of all of the verbal and emotional abuse, all of the negligent cold shoulders from her when Tom was clearly in a bad place, she genuinely believed that she had loved him. Now it seemed like Tom...Tammy no longer wanted <i>or</i> needed her. That hurt. A lot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria <i>deserved</i> happiness, and she had been cheated out of it! Now she felt like she was trapped in a supernatural horror movie with a madwoman villain ready to pounce. Despite the intense fear Gloria was experiencing, she was still frantically looking for a way out of it. As she slowly backed away towards the Strasserman's front door, her hand behind her desperately searching for a handle to grip on to so she could escape this house of horrors, the tension inside her pretty head spiked to unbearable levels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand touched metal. She found it! Her hand began to turn the knob...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gloria. Stop\" commanded Tammy very casually, as she sashayed down the stairs. <br>\r\nImmediately, Gloria's muscles tightened up. She now stood like a statue, her hand frozen on the door handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So close. So close, and yet so far. I'm not letting you off the hook that easily. Stand up straight\" instructed the sweet blonde, and without thinking about it, Gloria now stood at attention, feeling humiliated and ready to burst into tears at feeling so helpless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpstairs, the sounds of the Strasserman family toilet continuing to flush over and over again continued its monotonous melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gloria Gloria Gloria...what are we going to do with you?\" asked Tammy, tapping her dainty index finger against her chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in luck. I have just the thing, the perfect solution to all of our problems. Before you go, I want you to know that I still care about you, and I don't want to see you get hurt. I'm not a cruel hearted bitch like you were to me. This isn't about revenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria glared at Tammy. Inside those blue eyes, she saw nothing of her former lover Tom, just the power crazed nutcase named Tammy he had been transformed into. She wanted to strangle the bitch, or kick her in the shins, or do <b>anything</b> but just stand at stare at her, but she couldn't. Gloria's bones and flesh and muscle and even her vocal cords currently didn't belong to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that you've got your own issues that you're deal with. I realize you had a tough childhood, and believe me, honey, I sympathize. It doesn't excuse your own shitty behavior, but I understand. That's why I'm going to give you second shot at it. Maybe if you grow up in a more nurturing home, maybe you'll turn out better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy began to speak, and inside, Gloria screamed for help. Her eyes glazed over in a haze of green smoke. Then everything went dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing Gloria knew, she was in a parking lot walking towards the front of a building, her feet already click clacking in stride with a pair of much longer legs clad in black trousers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gloria, honey, keep up with me, please\" asked a mildly harried masculine voice from up above. Gloria tried to look up at the man, but it was the late afternoon judging from the position of the sun, which cast a dark shadow across the man's face. Somehow, his voice sounded familiar, though Gloria couldn't quite place it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both climbed up a short step of stonr steps and into a large brick building, the man politely holding the door for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria had mentally checked out once again, in shock at being Tammy's plaything, and simply walked inside, the man following right behind her. It's not like she had a choice, anyway. Now that they were inside, she got a look at his face. He was dark haired and handsome looking, bearing a passing resemblance to Jon Hamm on Mad Men. He was relatively young, perhaps being in his mid thirties or, at the most, forty. He was dressed nicely, as if he had just gotten off of work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man took long strides as he confidently walked down a long hallway, which Gloria now realized was a school. Judging by the ornaments and posters on some of the doorways, an elementary school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Room 30-A. Here we are, sweetheart\" said the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive seconds later, the man and Gloria had stepped inside what was very clearly a classroom for Kindergarten students, with primers on the alphabet, maps of the world and the solar system, and Roman numerals covering the walls, along with inspirational posters of cartoon characters giving sensible advice on various topics, or just plain \"Believe in yourself\"esque slogans. The room was spread out very openly, with a large, comfy looking rug laid right in the middle, the desks all dotting the perimeter of the room. A green couch was pushed back against the farthest edge of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a long time since Gloria had been in Kindergarten, but just like riding a bicycle, the memories and nostalgia of more carefree days suddenly came rushing back to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when it hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god. Tammy turned me into a five year old!\" squeaked out Gloria in a high pitched, almost babyish sounding voice. She looked down and noticed her body for the first time. It was so tiny! Everything about her screamed that she had physically regressed by more than a decade. As she swung her head around, she even noticed that her dark hair was now tied up in two loose pigtails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there\" suddenly announced another adult voice, shocking Gloria into ignoring the shocking change. She looked upwards and saw an adult woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gloria, are you going to introduce me to your teacher?\" asked the man looking down at little widdle Gloria. Gloria was slowly beginning to suspect that this was her absentee father, Roman Vanapoulous, whom she very rarely saw at home. Suddenly, she felt like she was going to hyperventilate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't recognize the young educator, who couldn't have been more than twenty-five. She was beautiful, Gloria thought, the woman possessing a winning smile and a kind, compassionate looking face. She was dressed in almost anachronistically, wearing her bright red hair in a 1960s flip style and a pearl necklace across her neck. Her yellow top was cute but not sexualized, and her long, hippieish looking skirt was probably bought at a thrift store or homemade. Gloria had no idea what to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman laughed gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK, Gloria. If you want, you can go finish your homework if you'd like while your father and I talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Gloria nodded and found a desk in the back of the room to sit down in. To her humiliation, she realized that her feet didn't reach the floor anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled off her little pink backpack, and looked at some of the paperwork. They were filled simple math and word problems that Gloria found insultingly easy to solve, but she did the homework anyway, just to keep her mind occupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was busy, Roman Vanapoulous, the newly divorced single father, listened on as his daughter's teacher, Miss Bobbi Bolstrum, filled him in on some of her concerns with Gloria's behavior. Apparently while her schoolwork and grades were excellent(Miss Bolstrum had even suggested that Gloria be bumped up to the second grade next semester) she was showing signs of depression and anti social behavior. She politely urged Roman to keep a closer eye on his daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The questions the worksheet was asking her was so basic that she deliberately had to force her mind to stop automatically answering the questions, but before long she simply ran out of ways to delay the inevitable. So as the last question \"If Danny has three apples and eats two, homw many does he have left?\" Was answered with a resound 'one', Gloria simply went back up to the top of the page and attempted to look busy while shooting small looks towards the teacher desk where her long-absentee father was chatting casually with the gorgeous redhead that had minutes before been one of the terrors of Shermer High.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Dad shouldn't be here! He was on a business trip to New York City! Is that Rob? Oh god, what did they do to him? I wonder if he's just acting? I can't believe Tom, Tammy, whoever the hell that bitch thinks she is did this to me! I've got to get back to that house and make her change me back! Then I'll get that Stone and make such a wish...\" Gloria's mind raced through a dozen different ways she could torture Tammy once she got the Stone back. First, Gloria would wish away her voice, then second, she'd make Tammy so fat she couldn't move! And then...Maybe she'd make Bill be disgusted by her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah! I'll wish that Bill hated how ugly and fat she was! I'll rip away her perfect little dream! She'll be begging to be my boyfriend again and I'll just leave him like that!\" Gloria was so caught up in her revenge that she never saw her dad and 'Miss Bolstrum' finish their conversation and that he walked out the door, leaving Gloria alone with the changed bully who slowly got up and began walking towards Gloria, massive breasts bouncing underneath her yellow top until she was standing next to Gloria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem!\" The stunning redhead cleared her throat, causing Gloria to almost jump out of the chair she was too small for. With wide, brown eyes, Gloria looked up to 'Miss Bolstrum' who smiled and said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: \"I don't know what the fuck is going on, Vanapolous, but I know you and Ackerton had something to do with it! Fix me now!\" Rob growls. Turns out he's been acting like a teacher all day and is just now free to be himself again! At least, until Mr. Vanapolous returns...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: \"Gloria, sweetie, your daddy just went to the bathroom for a moment, then he'll be back to take you home, okay? And Your daddy is a really nice man, I can see where you get your sweetness from! Oh, are you done with your homework? Oh, you have just the brightest brain!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a brief window of time, Gloria had <i>real</i> trouble believing that this stunning redhead standing parallel to her desk was Rob Bolstrum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just couldn't be. Everything about her screamed \"Stereotypical Kindergarten Teacher\": from her non-threatening body language, to her bubbly personality, to her bright clothing and warm smile, to the change in vocal inflections she used, being sugary sweet and semi-patronizing when speaking to five year old Gloria but being all business(With a dash of subtle flirtation) when speaking with Roman.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria wondered if Tammy had wished Rob's personality away altogether, giving the bully a magical lobotomy. Maybe Rob Bolstrum no longer existed, and this buxom Christina Hendricks wannabe was all that remained.  Gloria shuddered with horror at the thought, not putting it past her insane ex-boyfriend to in effect murder someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth was actually much worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gloria stared at \"Bobbi\" Bolstrum with her wide, brown doe eyes, the pretty young educator's smiling face abruptly shifting into a hateful scowl. She spoke with icy cruelty:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't what the fuck is going on, Vanapoulous, but I know you and Ackerton had something to do with it! Fix me now!\" she growled through pouty red lips, speaking in as low as a register as she could muster, her posture gradually reorganizing into a more threatening masculine stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Rob? Is that really you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSubconsciously, it was at that moment when Gloria realized that her father was no longer in the room with her, triggering alarm bells to ring inside the most primitive parts of Gloria's brain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're fucking a-right right it's me! I've been stuck in this chick's body all day, and I'll be damned if you or Ackertits or Shitterman don't change me back! I'd rather be dead than be trapped as some prissy little schoolteacher for the rest of my life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tone of Miss Bolstrum's voice was hateful and petty, creating an eerie dissonance between mind and the vessel it was currently residing in. That was Rob Bolstrum in there all right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I didn't do anything! That nerdy bitch has me trapped in here too!\" squeaked out Gloria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think that I <i>want</i> to be a five year old?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you knew, if you <i>knew</i> what I've been through today...\" fumed the bully, lost in his own impotent rage to where he couldn't finish his thought or pay attention to Gloria's logic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob's up until now feminine mannerisms evaporated like mist as she stomped towards Gloria's desk. In a way, it was almost comical, seeing this parodically sweet natured woman march around like she was John Wayne. Still, the message was clear: Miss Bolstrum was on the warpath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria's fight or flight instinct kicked in as she bolted from her seat to the other side of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little bitch!\" screamed Rob in the voice of Bobbi as she ran around trying to capture the fleeing little girl, her arms outstretched in an attempt to snatch her up. For about a minute, the two victims of Tammy Ackerton played the world's most intense game of tag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, since Bobbi was dressed impractically for running, wearing four inch heels on her feet and a highly cumbersome skirt, she eventually tripped and landed on her bountiful chest, her pearl necklace rattling softly against the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh!\" Rob moaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha\" giggled Gloria as she sprinted towards the doorway of the classroom, blowing a raspberry at the indisposed of teacher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was immature, but it felt <i>so</i> appropriate given the circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe click clacking of a pair of men's Oxford dress shoes heralded the arrival of someone walking down the quiet hallway. Gloria peeked outside and saw...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy!\" she squealed, genuinely happy to see her father, running up to see him for the first time in what felt like forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoman laughed and picked up Gloria's sixty pound body, hugging his daughter and carrying her back to Miss Bolstrum's room in his strong, secure arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sugarplum, I just needed to drain the main vein, if you know what I mean. Miss Bolstrum didn't cause any trouble while I was gone, did she?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, about that...\" Gloria said in her cutesy five year old voice as they both entered the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Roman's arms, Gloria noticed that Rob had picked herself up off the floor and was standing at attention in the middle of the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was all smiles again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a single solitary sign of petulance or Rob's inexhaustible anger remained. Not even her pearls were out of place, which felt very, very weird to Gloria. What was that thing he had said about being here all day? It had been less than a half hour ago when they were still all at Strasserman's house.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I think this was an enlightening meeting today, Miss Bolstrum. Thank you so much for informing me about my daughter's emotional needs, and starting today, I will be happily be paying more attention to little Gloria here\" said Roman, winking at Gloria playfully as he lowered her down to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, call me Bobbi\" giggled the bully sheepishly, having reverted back to her previously sunny, coquettish personality.  The redheaded vixen took a couple of steps forward and was now well within Roman's personal space. She stared longfully into the dark haired man's brown eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the pleasure was all mine. Maybe we can go out to dinner sometime and discuss her progress a little more intimately\" she added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoman smiled wolfishly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'd like that. I'd like that very much\" he said, cupping Bobbi's delicate chin with his fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like it even more. Maybe tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria swore that the two of them were about to start kissing and tearing each other's clothes off right here, which both confused and disgusted the former high school diva as she grabbed her backpack and \"homework\". Now she was worried that Tammy had somehow mind fucked her father as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy, can we go now?\" she asked in a whiny childlike voice, breaking up the palpable sexual tension. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoman let go of Bobbi's chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, pumpkin!\" he said, instantly shifting gears. He turned around and paid attention to Gloria's needs as if the previous thirty seconds hadn't happened. \"Got your things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl. Now let's go home\" he said, picking her up once again like a bag of groceries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you tomorrow, Gloria!\" replied Miss Bolstrum sweetly, waving at the dark haired girl with a little wave as the parent-child duo exited the classroom. Not a sign of malice crossed Bobbi's face, weirding Gloria out even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Roman and Gloria were out of earshot, Rob screamed in rage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddamn it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a pair of psychotic looking green years, Rob peered at the calendar fixed to the wall on the left most corner of the room. She looked at the date:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNovember 21st, 1960. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm stuck here, aren't I?\" the frightened ex bully asked himself, as if he were some gender confused Hamlet. \"I'm stuck in the past. I'm going to grow old or die before my time. Why? What did I ever do to deserve this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the future of 2019, Tammy watched the events that had proceeded, and grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Follow Gloria and Roman as they head home, with Gloria herself realizing that she's stuck nearly sixty years in the past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Flash forward to the following day, where \"Bobbi\" is magically compelled to behave as the perfect Kindergarten teacher and young 1960s era woman she is, only being able to behave as Rob in private. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She slowly peeled the covers off her impressive figure and sauntered to her small bathroom, broad hips swaying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked in the mirror\u2026 and Rob Bolstrum reasserted himself again with an animalistic snarl and savage scream of \u201c<b><i>FUCK!</i></b>\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was answered with the angry thumping of a tired upstairs-apartment-neighbor, to which Bobbi Bolstrum returned a sheepish \u201cSorry!\u201d, covering a bashful smile with a dainty hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob ripped his hand away from his mouth and let loose a string of curses internally. He could take being in the sixties, fine. He had seen a commercial for Mad Men once while flipping through channels; it looked like they had it pretty nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut being stuck like <i>this</i>? This perky, saccharine, fawning, top-and-bottom heavy <i>pinup model</i> of a teacher? Another roar clawed its way up his throat and threatened to burst out, but he dug his manicured fingernails into his palms and endured it instead. If she forced her way up again in the next minute he\u2019d go fucking <i>insane</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping into the Bobbi persona was frustratingly easy. If he didn\u2019t think about it or didn\u2019t have any sort of emotion as a guiding light \u2014 which was usually white-hot-rage \u2014 Bobbi would strut up to the command of his body and run things for ten or so seconds before Rob could wrest back control. He looked down at his body with distaste; he was so tired yesterday that he had let Bobbi run some pre-bedtime routines, neglecting to notice the sleepwear she had chosen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was virtually a babydoll; a tight demibra that cradled and thrust his-or-Bobbi\u2019s impressive bust forward, accompanied by a sheer curtain that settled daintily around his wide hipline, which itself was imprisoned in a pair of pseudo-boyshorts that seemed designed to display the distressingly large booty he now seemed to possess rather than contain it. He practically ripped them off with a cold smile that quickly turned into a frown, now that he was completely naked. It would have been nice to see a bombshell like this if it wasn\u2019t, well, <b>him</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis act of rebellion done for now, Rob sunk back into his consciousness and let Bobbi take the reins. It wasn\u2019t out of exhaustion or a sense of defeat; he wasn\u2019t down yet. Some things just\u2026 weren\u2019t negotiable with Bobbi. When he had woke up yesterday morning, he had fought Bobbi on everything: from putting on her makeup in the morning to saying hello to her apartment-building neighbors as she walked her way to the bus-stop. Sure, he avoided putting the makeup on for a couple of minutes and restrained his greeting to a brusque wiggle of the fingers, but Bobbi took complete control for the next four hours. He just had to watch her beam her stupid smile and simper at those little <i><b>twerps</b></i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only in the teacher\u2019s bathroom where he regained control, scowling darkly with a pair of panties around his ankles. Not fun. Briefly, he had entertained the idea of acting along with Bobbi, which meant being <i>nice</i> to those insufferable little brats and mini-Ackertits, greeting those stupid neighbors with gushy regards. Sure, maybe he\u2019d get a little more autonomy, but he had his pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if it\u2019d let him get away from Roman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shiver of mixed pain and pleasure went up Rob\u2019s treacherous goddamn spine. Roman Vanapoulous, Bobbi\u2019s stupid girly crush and Rob\u2019s newest \u2014 and greatest \u2014 enemy. When he was around, the rules <i>changed</i>. He wasn\u2019t Rob Bolstrum, trapped under the smiling guise of a cheery teacher. He was\u2026 <b>different</b>. When Roman was around, Bobbi would jump over whatever tenuous barrier he had erected around his male ego, turning it into an ooey-gooey mess of come-hither winks and senseless tittering. When he was gone, whatever cloying sense of romance he had suddenly developed disappeared just as quickly, leaving only intense burning anger and questioned sexuality in its wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst part was that he <i>liked</i> it. Well, in the moment. Right now, it just brought up a knot of shame and other unfamiliar emotions he didn\u2019t have the time nor skill to untangle. <br>\r\nWhen Roman said it, the half-assed remark:  \u2018They should pay you teachers more.\u2019 made him titter in delighted embarrassment and swat the man\u2019s well-muscled arm.<br>\r\nWhen Roman was there, Gloria Vanapoulous, possibly the biggest bitch in the Western Hemisphere, seemed a perfect a<i>dorable</i> angel, who was being raised by such a wonderful man.<br>\r\nWhen Roman did it, he was fine with another man touching his face and gazing at him with deep, soulful eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not a faggot.\u201d stated Rob to the audience-less bathroom. The effect was somewhat diminished by the ruby-red lipstick half slathered over his plump lips. Whatever. He slunk back to the back of his head as Bobbi finished her morning routine by stuffing her curves into the underwired abominations she called underwear and putting on her best conservative-yet-attractive ensemble, topping it off with her cliche string of pearls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Bobbi bid the doorman farewell with a sunny smile, Rob stomped his way to the bus stop with a comically masculine gait that assuaged his bruised ego at the cost of wobbling his wobbly bits.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis couldn\u2019t go on forever. He\u2019d need to find whatever weird bullshit did this to him and\u2026 reverse it. Somehow. And in order to do that, he\u2019d need to not get swept up in Gloria\u2019s Dad\u2019s weird 60s overtures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus hissed to a stop, and Rob's contemplative frown gave way to another sunny smile. Goddammit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob would... </span></div></div>",

Tammy watched as Gloria shot a look towards the front doors of the Strasserman household before suddenly bolting as fast as her designer shoes would allow her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she only managed to reach a hand out before she heard Tammy calmly say \"Gloria, stop\". And suddenly Gloria's entire body ceased moving in mid-stride as the muscles and bones locked into position and her eyes froze simply on the cloudy decorative glass on the door. Gloria wasn't even sure if she was even breathing anymore! But then she heard movement behind her and the steps as someone came closer and closer. And then, like the moon eclipsing the sun, Tammy's face slowly slid into view in front of Gloria's locked gaze. It was still so strange to Gloria, that only a few minutes ago this had been Tom, but now the face of the girl in front of her only had a few traces of what had made Tom, well, Tom. And she didn't see Tom anywhere in those baby blue eyes. Was he in there at all, or had he been entirely consumed by Tammy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Gloria, now stand up straight\" The blonde commanded, and Gloria felt her muscles and bones shift on their own until she was once again standing normally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'God, I used to have to look up at him! Now he's actually a little shorter than me!' Gloria thought to herself. She wanted to scream, but apparently that was too much in the realm of moving without permission to be allowed. She watched as Tammy cracked a scary smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you really are pretty, Gloria. I always thought you were. That's why I became friends with you when we were kids. You were always my first crush even before any of us knew what crushes were. Even with all the shit you put me...Tom through, he always loved the way you looked. The way you filled out your clothes, Even your hair. God, I really was lucky, wasn't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Tom?' Gloria said to no one but her own mind. The look on Tammy's face was almost...familiar. Something in her heart shifted just a bit and if she'd been able to move, Gloria wasn't entirely sure she wouldn't have been getting misty eyed. But the feeling went cold as the baby blue eyes narrowed as the glimpse of her former boyfriend vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then you kept ruining it. So demanding, so cruel. Well now I get to be the girlfriend that you always should have been, to someone that truly deserves her! I'm breaking up with you Gloria, now and forever!\" Tammy declared, and suddenly grabbed the back of Gloria's dark haired head and pulled herself in, planting a deep kiss on Gloria's lips before just as quickly releasing her. Tammy's face soured and the nerdy blonde rubbed her own soft lips on the sleeve on her shirt. \"Bleh! I really thought you'd taste the same. I guess that proves I'm batting for the other team, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tammy?\" Bill said, finally pulling himself off the floor, but the teen couldn't take more than a single step before Tammy shot him a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bill, honey, you and Willow just wait there quietly until I'm don,e okay?\" Was the gentle command that froze Bill and Willow in place and sealed both their lips shut. And for a moment the only sound was the constant flushing from upstairs, to which Tammy's eyes flashed before turning back to Gloria, who would have shuddered at the look in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I really do think it's a little mean to just leave you without a boyfriend, Gloria\" Tammy said as she began slowly walking around her ex, dragging a dainty hand across Gloria's still frozen body, ruffling the mane of raven black hair as she circled like a shark, \"And you always told me, well, Tom, that you thought her needed to be bigger and stronger. What was it you said? Oh yeah, you said that you should have dated a 'big strong man, a real man' one that 'wouldn't be a wet blanket to you all the time'. Well, dear, I think I found the perfect match for you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria's eyes, if they'd been allowed, would have gone wide in terror. She had said that during her and Tom's last big fight. He'd started fucking crying and it had made Gloria just insult him more, calling him a pussy for not being able to act like a man and stand up to her abuse and prove he had a spine. And that look to the bathroom...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh no. NO PLEASE' Gloria thought as hard and loud as she could, trying to will the words out of her mouth, but there was only silence as Tammy spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gloria, you and Rob Bolstrum are dating and have been dating for years. He's everything you want, big, strong, and he doesn't care about having an emotional relationship with you. And you're everything he wants in a woman. And you can't break up with him until I give you permission\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the green shimmering lights began to appear around her, Gloria screamed in terror inside her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Gloria's body predictably morphs into a big boobed bimbo with a mind to match, as that is what Rob desires most from a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Gloria's body and mind transforms to fit Rob's desires, becoming something that Tammy didn't predict.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Gloria...Doesn't change?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Green haze filled Gloria's eyes as the aurora-like magic danced around her, She could feel her breasts swell by an order of magnitude as her rear plumped out. Gloria felt her makeup become heavy, and something odd was happening with her hair. She flet a chill run up her body as her clothes shifted around her, and even being unable to move Gloria knew she was wearing far less than she had just moments ago. But then again, she'd always been wearing this, hadn't she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Like, what?' Gloria thought as suddenly her brain became...fuzzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy stared as the exotic but elegant form of Gloria Vanapolous swelled almost cartoonishly, her breasts swelling up to a full DD while her ass and hips flared out and her hair went from styled, long and voluminous to messy, shoulder length and flat. Gloria's face became heavily painted with makeup as her lips became plump and caked in ruby red lipstick that now matched red paint on the long nails her hands now sported. Gloria's designer clothes simply melted until there was nothing but a trashy green tube top straddling Vanapolous's large tits and a short skirt that left very little to the imagination as finally the tennis shoes arched upwards as they became a pair of cheap heels. A wad of magically pre-chewed gum appeared within Gloria's mouth as the aurora shimmered away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former light in Gloria's eyes clouded slightly as, in accordance to Tammy's command, her mind became suited to what Rob Bolstrum found attractive. Gloria was still in there, mostly, but now she was just every bit of a bimbo that Rob lusted after. After the green haze faded the new Gloria Vanapolous stood in the foyer of the Strasserman home, looking every bit of a porn star until Tammy said \"Okay, you can move again Gloria\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I can't really remember why we're, like, hanging out, but you better like totes back up!\" Gloria said, her voice oozing sex appeal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, you turned out perfectly!\" Tammy squealed as her former ex, someone that had made her life hell as Tom, stood there smacking her gum and striking a very stripperish pose. Gloria had always prided herself on being the hottest, yet classiest girl in school, and now she was still probably the hottest, but now she looked so trashy! \"Heh, I guess now you really can be 'Titsapoloous!\" Tammy chuckled as she recalled the dirty nickname Gloria's enemies (and the bullies) used to refer to the former cheerleader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'm totally like always perfect, girl! Hey have you, like seen my Robby anywhere? I need my big strong man to, like, fill me up before class\" Gloria said with a brainless giggle as she twirled a long ruby nailed finger in her hair while her other hand drifted towards her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe a little overboard bimbo wise\" Tammy said as suddenly she realized it wasn't entirely Gloria in there. 'This won't be any fun if she doesn't realize it!' Tammy thought to herself and decided to make one final change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gloria-\" Tammy began, only to immediately be interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gloria, you're actually smarter than this, and you have most of your old mind back, just enough to realize what is happening\" Tammy watched as the overly, almost stereotypical bimbo body language of her former ex girlfriend suddenly vanish and take on a much more familiar pose. The dullness in Gloria's eyes lightened as intelligence and the teen's former personality flooded back into her brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Oh my god. OH MY GOD!\" Gloria began screaming as the realization of what had happened flooded back into her mind as the fog lifted and fake memories were pushed aside as real ones took their place. Tammy was controlling people! She was making Gloria into...into a whore! Rob Bolstrum's whore! Gloria's face controted with rage and she raised a clawed hand upwards in a threatening manner. She had to stop Tammy, she had to-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too late,the little nerdy blonde was too quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! Uh, Gloria you can remember everything but you still have to act outwardly like Rob desires!\" Tammy barked out quickly as she stumbled back, away from the wolverine-esque claws that had sprouted from Gloria's fingers. But then the former cheerleader's body relaxed and took on another generic bimbo pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tammy you bitch! You're still not gonna get away with this! I'll tell everyone what you did!\" Gloria hissed, \"And let me spit out this fucking gum! It's disgusting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So close. Okay Gloria, since you reminded me, you can't act or talk like yourself unless I allow it, and you can't tell anyone about this!\" Ackerton grinned as Gloria's eyes clouded over slightly. 'And now to reunite the lovely couple' Tammy thought, eager to let her little project loose, \"Okay, good. You're not able to act like yourself right now Gloria. And Rob is no longer flushing his head in the toilet and is down here and completely dry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'll totally get you for this Tammy. And like I totes hate this gum!\" Gloria whined as the sound of constant flushing ended and Rob Bolstrum appeared with a SNAP and a ribbon of green light that streaked from the second floor. The bully towered over Gloria and Tammy could see a bit of clouds in his eyes as the magic twisted Rob's mind and memories. And then the giant spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ackertits, where's Shitterman? Me and my bitch have something we want to talk to the two of you about!\" Rob growled as he gave one of Gloria's breasts a tight squeeze. The sexual moan sounded very real to Tammy but she could see the anger in Gloria's eyes. And then she realized that Bill and Willow were both staring at her, their eyes wide in horror despite the command to be silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: In a panic, Tammy sends Gloria and Rob to school and unfreezes Bill and Willow, both of which demand and explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Tammy 'tries to fix everything and hears Rob out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Tammy, in a panic, says something that makes everything worse.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as the words left Tammy's mouth, the shimmering lights appeared around Gloria. Tammy grinned, expecting to see the egocentric diva she had, in another reality called girlfriend, turn into something humiliating and degrading. After all, she was setting the parameters for the magic to change Gloria into what Rob Bolstrum thought was ideal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll probably look like such a whore\" Tammy mocked Gloria as her body began to change. But the sadistic grin on the cute little blonde's face collapsed into a frown as Gloria's change seemed to be going in a very different direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe exotic, physical beauty of Gloria shifted as her breasts shrank into her chest, her hips losing their curve, the long mane of raven black hair shrinking into a short scalp hugging haircut. Her took on a decidedly different look as her jawline became rugged, with just a hint of a shadow on skin that was suddenly less flawless. Her lips, once coated in makeup, seemed to deflate as they turned a little plain. And Gloria was growing taller now as her body seemed to stretch towards the ceiling of the Strasserman house as Gloria gained at least another foot and a half before she stopped rising upward. Her arms and legs bulked out as toned muscles exploded out of nowhere onto arms that had been slender and soft just moments ago. The queen of Shermer High's feet creeped forward as well before suddenly something large popped into existence in Gloria's crotch, straining the fabric of her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the magic keeping Gloria immobile, she could see a look of sudden, intense pain on her ex-lover's face before a flash of relief crossed it as Gloria's clothing changed. Gone was the designer top and tight jeans, gone were the feminine shoes and jewelry as a pair of blue jeans and a black t-shirt swirled into existence on Gloria's chest, hugging tight to her newly muscled form and showing off her sculpted body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the light were gone, and all that stood in front of Tammy was a beefcake of a man. She could still see Gloria in the face, but now it was ruggedly handsome, dark and brooding yet impossibly handsome. The rest of Gloria's new body gave Tammy a strange tingle in her own nether regions, something that she found to be very strange to whatever part of her might still be Tom, but she knew the feeling well. After all, it was the same way she felt whenever Bill did something extra sweet, both young and old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh god, she's hot!' Tammy thought to herself as she stared at the still frozen form of the now fully male Gloria Vanapolous. 'But...I said ideal woman, not man! What happened!?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rob, get down here and explain yourself!\" Tammy yelled at the top of her lungs, hoping she was heard over the constant rushing of water from the toilet.  It seemed like she had been as the loud thuds of someone moving clumsily in the upstairs bathroom indicated. And then Rob appeared, red hair and shirt soaking wet as he made his way quickly down the stairs, a trail of water following in his footsteps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Tammy could see that something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Rob is a girl! Rob, harboring a secret fetish, actually desired to be a girl in a relationship with a tall, handsome man!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Rob is still Rob, and harboring a secret that he would have never otherwise revealed, less the bully's target him as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Rob has, somehow, found a way to counter Tammy's magic words!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tammy glanced at the tall, brooding and handsome version of Gloria before turning back to the sounds of someone stumbling around the second floor of the Strasserman household. The sound of rubber squealing on wet tile, the sound of the bathroom doorknob rattling and the soft thuds of feet that should be much larger as their owner plodded down the hall to the top of the stairs and began to descend them in a wet, robotic march.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of what she had expected, the towering, fiery red topped giant of Rob Bolstrum in all his scars and muscles, there was a girl the same general height as Willow stepping gingerly down the stairs, wet sneakers that had replaced steel toed boots squeaking against the wood surface. Her hair was long, dark and utterly soaked as a small river trailed behind the unknown girl, and her face was locked into the robotic mode of someone under Tammy's verbal commands. Her eyes were large and brown, streamers of mascara and eye shadow running from the almond shaped orbs as the water ran down her face as thick eyebrows arced up casually, no doubt to change dramatically once Tammy's command was followed. Her nose was slightly bulbous and upturned with a mouth that was a little too large for her round face. A slender neck led down to shoulders that were covered only by the straps of a black tank top. Her slender arms and short-nailed, small hands gripped the banister as the water caused the girl to lose her footing, the sudden jolt of imbalance sending the C cup breasts jiggling beneath the tank top's damp fabric. Her hips were wide but reasonable and a faded pair of baggy, ripped jeans hung off them, shifting side to side as the girl descended down the steps until she was standing on the first floor of the home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat, it seemed, was enough to satisfy the mental hold that Tammy's command held over the girl as her face went from calm to enraged in less than a second, the thick eyebrows arcing dramatically as the slightly puffy lips split apart in a snarl as a husky voice screamed out \"WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO ME!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Tammy gasped as the new girl charged at her, and Tammy was rescued from a full force tackle as the girl's sneakers slipped out from under her from the pooled water, sending the girl toppling to the hardwood floors with a almost comically girly 'OOF!'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna fucking tear your fucking tits off for this, Ackerton!\" The new girl hissed as she pulled herself up out of the large puddle on the floor, but before she could launch a new attack, her tormentor spoke once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or you will just stand right there and tell me, calmly, who you are? Where is Rob? I want a fully honest answer!\" And just like that, the unknown girl's body seemed to seize up for a moment before it began moving on autopilot, straightening herself upright into a neutral standing position before she began speaking in a monotone voice while pointing a small finger towards the still-frozen male version of Gloria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Rob. You told me to stick my head in the toilet and think about what I had just done to you. After the fortieth flush green lights appeared and changed my body into this, and then I came down here and explained this to you, as commanded\". The girl's face changed from calm to infuriated in an instance, but another command from Tammy to remain calm and still kept the situation from escalating  once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you're Rob, why did Gloria become a guy? Ohmygod, Rob, are you...gay?\" Tammy asked, trailing off the end of her question as she realized how, well, rude it sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Gloria looks really hot to me right now, but before I changed I really liked how hot she looked as a girl, plus I've always had a thing for Shitterman's sister even though everyone knows she's a dyke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff to the side, the faces of Bill and Willow Strasserman, currently forgotten about and still under the command to be silent and wait, shifted from terror to anger, eyes narrowing towards the girl that claimed to be Rob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that doesn't make any sense!\" Tammy whined, \"Tell me why, instead of Gloria becoming your perfect woman, she became a man and you became a woman! Why did it go wrong!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob's new eyes betrayed the calmness of his newly feminine voice as he was forced to respond. \"It's probably because I have a secret fetish involving transgender comics and stories. I've always wondered what I would be like to be a woman and in a relationship with a hot guy. Whatever you did, this is the result. Probably based on the control issues I have being compounded by the fact that I don't hurt girls and being surrounded by a bunch of meatheads. Not to mention how emasculated I've felt since Ingerman took over. I saw some TG art of Captain America being this tiny girl and Thor baiting him into climbing him for a high-five and it just sort of seemed REALLY interesting to me. So whenever I can I go out to the Interstate and leech off the free WiFi at the semi-truck station on my phone and look up stuff regarding it. As to why I look like this and not like a Rule 63 version of my male body, it probably has to do with female bodies that my male body finds both attractive both sexually and emotionally in regards to the gender roles and biases it places on women. Much like how Gloria's male body is a currently reflection of the idea that men should be tall, strong and handsome in order to attract female attention. As it stands now, this body is very attracted to Gloria's current body as a result.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone's eyes in the room, including Rob's new ones, went wide as the tidal wave of exposition left his mouth. Rob had no idea where most of that had come from, instead screaming in his head to not reveal that he was into TG stuff. The rest of it, including the entire spiel concerning control and his relationship with the other bullies, had come out of a part of Rob's mind that he clearly didn't know about, a intelligent breakdown off the concept being pulled out by the controlling magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy's eyes went wide at the revelation. Rob was into TG stuff! She, herself, had only seen it represented in the fandom blogs and Tumblrs she followed, Rule 63 kind of stuff or gender-flipped characters in crappy fanfiction and wasn't much of a fan. Her mind never even thought about the fact that she was currently part of that strange part of fandom, having been gender swapped herself after what had felt like one hell of a long morning. But as much as she hadn't been a fan of it, suddenly Rob's explanation had put a hook in her, a strange curiosity that her analytical mind wanted to see for itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, she was becoming very aware of the fact that she was really, really tired. MAybe it was having three lifetimes crammed into her skull, having two full body morphs and a whirlwind of adrenaline from fighting Rob's old body and then the emotional roller coaster of seeing Bill hurt, then seeing him saved and the spiteful rage of using the powers on Rob and Gloria, but all of a sudden she just wanted a cookie and to go lay down on the big couch in the basement where she and Bill spent most of their evenings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of consideration she...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Tammy, suddenly curious, tells Rob and Gloria to fulfill his TG fantasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Mentally and physically drained, Tammy just sends the two of them away and unfreezes Bill and Willow as she wants to relax and recharge after a crazy morning.</span></div></div>",

Don't move a muscle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the lumbering bully stutter-stepped down the Strasserman's staircase like a marionette, grunting with impotent anger, Tammy even noticing little faint motes of green light outlining Rob's body like an army of Tinkerbell's, the former boy next door turned girl next door was growing slightly frustrated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had wanted to punish Gloria in a way that would really humiliate the catty cheerleader. Make her feel as shitty as she had made Tom felt. Having her be transformed against her will into the girlfriend of one of Shermer High's biggest pigs had seemed to be the perfect way to do that. She had imagined that wish was foolproof, that Gloria would turn into some trashy whore with fake tits and needle marks running up her arm, or maybe a blonde bimbo who didn't know how to read or do anything else besides shop, fuck, and order in restaurants, or some other really degrading thing she could picture Rob desiring. Instead, Tammy's wish had transformed Gloria into a hunky piece of man meat, a tall, dark, and handsome stud that was every bit as classy and clean cut as Gloria had been as a female. Tammy realized to her disappointment that she had to control herself from lusting after him. The question was, why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy couldn't figure it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven when Tammy was fully in control of things and possessed the seemingly unlimited powers of a goddess, life still had a way of shaking out differently than she had planned. She rolled her eyes in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, Tammy realized, she was pooped. After an exhausting morning where two lifetimes worth of memories had been jammed straight into her brain, after she had swapped genders, after she had her sweetheart of a daughter become her boyfriend's sister, after discovering that said boyfriend's actual family has seemingly vanished into thin air and replaced by doppelgangers, after finding out that an ogre had been hiding out in the basement for hours, after becoming blessed with superpowers, after having the love of her life nearly die in her arms, and after permanently breaking up with her ex, she was simply all revenged out. What Tammy really wanted to do was get these two idiots out of here so she could just relax for a while. She could easily just wish today to be a Saturday instead of Tuesday. Yeah, that's the ticket. What she really wanted was to spend the rest of the day snuggled up with Bill under the covers in his bedroom watching campy CW dramedies or playing D&amp;D(Her new memories as Tammy allowed the girl to know that she was now heavily into role playing games, an activity that Tom had never been interested in). Maybe she'd bake some cookies later too, because all of a sudden she was having a chocolate craving, and she now had memories of randomly pigging out when she was stressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, it was not meant to be. Tammy was interrupted from her daydream by a pair of masculine voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What. The. Hell. Did You Do To Me?\" asked an indignant, angry voice just beside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU GODDAMN BITCH! LET ME GO!\" screamed Rob violently as he stood at attention at the bottom of the staircase, unable to move due to Tammy's command. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, both of you just shut up and let me think!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth men were now as silent as statues, standing almost perfectly parallel to one another. They may as well have been statues, as their bodies were unable to move a muscle except at Tammy's request. This rule, however, did not include facial or ocular movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief moment, Rob's eyes and Gloria's eyes briefly locked with one another, and Tammy had noticed something odd. The dark haired Adonis and the red headed thug looked... intrigued by each other. Almost like they were silently flirting. Almost as if they were attracted to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh my God, that's it! That's why Gloria's a man now!</i> thought Tammy, feeling like a large veil had just been lifted from her. \"I'm so dumb\" she muttered to herself, giggling just a little bit <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rob\" gasped Tammy, sounding genuinely hurt instead of terrified as she faced the once terrifying bully with her hands on her hips, \"Did you really think that any of us gave a damn that you were gay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob said nothing, his face a pensive ugly gargoyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops. Sorry. I'm still new at this. Speak up!\" commanded Tammy, snapping her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M NOT QUEER!\" screamed Rob, his face turning beet red and morphing into a weird, demonic shape, furious at his darkest secret being exposed and being powerless to do anything about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not?\" asked Tammy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a fucking heart attack, Ackerton! Now let me go! I swear that I'll never bother you or Strasserman again! This is all getting a little too freaky for me. I don't even want that rock anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy Ackerton was a Gen Z kid. Both in this version of her life and as her life as Tom, she had grown up having absolutely zero problems whatsoever with homosexuality(Or trans people, non binary people, etc) and she was honestly confused by people who <i>were</i> bothered by it. It wasn't even an especially important issue to her. She wasn't particularly liberal or \"woke\", the teen just didn't see the point or value in trying to control the sexuality/identity of others. Bill was very much the same way, and although she had never really mentioned her opinions on the subject one way or the other, Tammy seriously doubted that Gloria was homophobic either. A raging narcissistic bitch, abso-fucking-lutely, but not a bigot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is why Rob's pleas that he wasn't gay were confusing Tammy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ROB, SERIOUSLY, I DON'T CARE IF YOU ARE!\" emphasized Tammy very strenuously, almost sounding out every syllable so the boxed crook would understand. \"Listen here, buster, from now on, you're going to tell me the <b>exact</b> truth! No more evasions or lies. Just tell me the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy once again snapped her fingers, feeling unconsciously cool while doing so. Perhaps it was residual glee after seeing Thanos snap his fingers during Infinity War.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Rob's floodgates opened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES, I'M GAY! IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR, BITCH?! I'M GAY! I'M GAYER THAN LIBERACE! I'M GAYER THAN A THREE DOLLAR BILL! I'M SO GAY THAT I IMAGINE FUCKING INGERMAN IN THE ASS EVERY NIGHT! ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob's face was now extremely red and sweaty, to the point where Tammy was worried he was going to have a heart attack or something equally bad. He was out of breath, and looked absolutely despondent. This was clearly something that was deeply personal to him, something he absolutely hating admitting to, which the soft hearted Tammy felt bad about, even after he had manhandled her earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHot, sweaty droplets began pouring from Rob's tears ducts as his rigid body remained at attention, unable to escape the humiliation of telling someone that he was a poofter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rob, sweetie, being gay is nothing to be ashamed of. I hate you because you're an asshole, not because you like guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you all don't care that I'm a queer!\" squealed Rob, clearly under duress. \"Strasserman is such a wimp that he's half a fag himself! And you Ackerton, you're just a mousy little bookworm. Nobody's looking to chase your tail! If they are, it's either some nerd like Bill or some candy assed social justice warrior beta male. And Shitterman's sister, everybody already knows that she's a carpet muncher. You guys aren't normal. You don't know what it's like for someone like me, somebody with a reputation to uphold!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy was beginning to see the picture. Rob was scared. She didn't notice that her hands were now clasped together in front of her chest, which was a trait of body language she had whenever something was making her sad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would happen if you came out of the closet?\" she asked quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would happen?! My life would be over! They'd kill me! They'd fucking kill me! And if they didn't, they'd make me wish I was dead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who would kill you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EVERYONE!\" Rob squealed. \"Ingerman. Tony. Jay. Ralph. All the other guys. My mom. My mom would fucking freak. She'd kick me right out of the house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? I thought you were fucking smart, Ackerton!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis took Tammy aback. Then she realized that the ogre was right. She was living in a bubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Tammy and Bill and Gloria and a handful of other students at Shermer High being good kids, looking back, she did realize that homophobia was still a problem here. Not a huge problem, but a problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, Shermer was a small town. A Northern, mostly well educated, mostly upper middle class small town that was a stone's throw away from Chicago, but any homogenous population was bound to be more conservative than average.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow... now revenge wasn't on Tammy's mind anymore. She still hated Rob for being a horrible person, but in a way she was also beginning to feel pity for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving to maintain a public image when you're not really that person on the inside is something that she could seriously relate to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Tammy rethinks her plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Tammy wishes for Rob and Gloria(Now Gene) to come out as a couple at school. Fuck him. Let Rob and Gloria suffer for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Tammy says something that accidentally makes things worse.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tammy stared at the crying giant in front of her. Just moments ago she had wanted nothing more than to torture Rob Bolstrum and Gloria for all the horrible things they'd done (and not just personally to her in both of her teenage lives). But now the cold edge that had crept onto Tammy's heart started to thaw as she started to rethink her plans of revenge. Instead of a tormentor about to get his just deserts, instead Tammy saw someone that was as much a victim to horrible circumstance as she had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf not worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Tammy was naturally a sweetheart. She was a good person that found common ground with Captain America, with Superman, the heroic causes in which the heroes of comics and novels and movies all stood for. And this was a injustice that she never knew had existed (at least in Rob's case). And she had the power to fix it. The power to fix ALL of it. Before she realized it, Tammy took a step. Then another step, and another until she was directly in front of Rob whose tears were still flowing freely from his brown eyes.  As Tom she would have come up almost face to face with the 6'4 Bolstrum, but as Tammy she was so short her nose was flat even with his belly button. She stared upwards with shimmering blue eyes at the tearful giant, and then she did something that she never would have dreamed of doing before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy reached around Rob's muscled trunk with both her arms and pulled herself as tight as she could against the vulnerable bully. He was drenched in toilet water, his shirt soggy and cold and she could feel some of that water transfer over to her, but Tammy didn't care. After a few moments she released the towering titan and stepped back, tears welling in her own eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want your fucking pity Ackerton!\" Rob growled as best as he could, \"You're the fucking reason any of this is happening! I was perfectly happy before you made that stupid wish! Now look at me! Look at her! Him!\" Rob motioned as much as he could with his eyes and eyebrows, still locked in place by Tammy's command, towards Gloria's male body, who was simply caught in a loop of glares and soulful longing for the redheaded hunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy took a deep breath and let the rest of her anger roll away. Rob was right, this was all her fault. \"You're right, Rob. I'm so, so so sorry I'm putting your though this, but you left me no choice\" That was in fact a little bit of a lie, because Tammy could have done any number of things to neutralize Rob without ripping open his deepest darkest secret. \"But now it's out there, and I can help! I can help you be happy! Don't you want that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob attempted to lob a wad of spit at his captor, but it must have constituted as too much movement as he was unable to do little more that sputter towards the tiny blonde. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'God, I should have broke her fucking arm or knocked her out or something! This is such bullshit! Now what do I do? What do I fucking do!?' Rob's mind raced. It was true, all of it. He was gay, he found the dark haired Gloria attractive, he fantasized about pumping Ingerman right in the ass while the rich fucker screamed in pain. That, at least, he could feel somewhat fine about. After all, he didn't want a relationship with Ingerman, Rob just wanted to make him pay and be humiliated in revenge for what was done to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Tammy had other ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rob Bolstrum, I want you to tell me, right now, what can I do to fix this? How can I help you? Answer me one hundred percent truthfully\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that the words of command oozed into Rob's brain and began peeling back the levels of self control as the magic searched for the answers and forcing them to the fore-front of the bully's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I want...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: \"I want to be normal! I want to be into chicks, not dudes!\" Rob yells, and Tammy makes it so, changing Rob's sexual preferences completely to being heterosexual. Free from what he saw as his curse, Rob starts starts finding Willow and Tammy attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: \"I want you to give me a normal life where I can be happy being me! Someplace where I CAN be me!\" Rob sniffles, and Tammy makes it so, transporting Rob (and Gloira) several thousand miles away to Redford Hills California where they can enjoy being a happy, normal gay couple.</span></div></div>",

But then she thought back to everything that Rob had done to her, both as the woman she was now and the man she had been two lifetimes ago. And what he'd done to Bill. And all the others that had suffered under the bully's constant torment. And she was tired and just wanted to be done with the drama so she and Bill could just get on with their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, the ice hardened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"you know what, Rob? Fuck you. You deserve this.\" Tammy said, venom lacing her voice as she turned to Gloria, \"You BOTH do! So here's what's going to happen now. You and Gloria, who everyone else knows as Gene Vanapolous now, both already at school, in front of Ingerman and all the other bullies, and the two of you are going to be passionately making out. You love each other and you're not afraid to show it. In fact, you're both going to FLAUNT it. And you have to act like everything is normal, with no mention of me, my powers or the wishing stone\" Tammy commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on cue, the green shimmering ribbons appeared, dancing in a furious storm between Rob and Gloria, now Gene, seemed to disincorporate, vanishing from the Strasserman household and re-appearing in the hallways of Shermer High right as Jonathan Ingerman and the rest of the bully squad rounded the corner. The group of muscled meatheads stopped in their tracks as they witnessed hot and heavy man-kissing as Rob and Gloria, now Gene, pressed their bodies against each other, their lips locking repeatedly as Tammy's commands overrode their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, both Rob and Gene were screaming internally at what was now happening to them. They were both made for each other, physically, but their minds were still their own aside from Tammy's commands. For Rob, he wanted to hate the fact he was kissing a man, but he found it...nice. He'd kissed girls before (usually to keep up appearances) but it had all felt so wrong. This felt...right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in Gene's head, Gloria couldn't help but let loose a long, terrified mental scream. She didn't want to be a guy! She didn't want to be a gay guy! She didn't want to be with Rob!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the damage had been done as Jonathan Ingerman interrupted the make out session with a very sinister chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well, I always knew you were a faggot, Rob\" Ingerman said as he and the gang expanded out into a large semi-circle that blocked Rob's escape from the situation. \"You know what happens next, right? This is my town, and I don't want fags stinking it up. So now I'm gonna have to ask you to leave\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Rob and Gene end up fighting the entire bully squad of Shermer High.

Calls were made to Bill's parents Greg and Martha at their place of work, nobody knowing that Bill's actual parents(And sister Kimmy) had been lost in some bizarre parallel reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bill was being loaded up, a paramedic discovered Willow Strasserman rocking back and forth in the dining room as she struggled to catch her breath, her nails digging so deep into her palms that they were bleeding, her skin turning a ghastly pale. The horror of seeing her father turn little brother being thrown down the stairs like a ragdoll had triggered a severe panic attack in the young woman, and the discordant noises, flashing lights, and throng of strangers inside her family home had escalated intense fear into near outright hysteria. After being calmed down to a more manageable level by the paramedic, she too was transferred to Shermer General, just to be safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy herself had been in a crying fit over what had happened to the love of her life(And intense, white hot rage at the monstrous Neanderthal who did it), but she had managed to pull herself together enough to explain to the paramedics and the two pairs of police officers who had shown up what exactly had happened. Thankfully, she didn't have to lie. Omit certain details, maybe, but she more or less told the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So then Bill went to confront Rob, and the...and the asshole pushed him down the stairs!\" yelled Tammy, in tears again, herself being triggered by the horrible news. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you said that he claimed he had been hiding in the basement all morning?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy nodded her headed nervously. As she answered everyone's questions, she now realized how much smaller she was as a woman, as the collection of mostly male adults all towered over her. She didn't know what to make of the fact that she was always going to be one of the physically least imposing people in any given situation from now on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know how he got inside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Rob was in the house before I got here. I figure he must have entered through the root cellar or maybe an unlocked door, or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what happened after he pushed your boyfriend down the stairs?\" asked one of the officers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh shit. He's still in the bathroom</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, the teenage athlete turned girl next door seriously considered using her magical mind control on these adults just so she could get Rob to stop perpetually swirlying himself, as that looked incredibly weird and suspicious, but she wasn't sure if her newfound powers even <i>worked</i> on people that weren't Rob, Tammy, Bill, or Gloria. Her wish had only been for...what exactly had she said? For everyone to do what she says? Tammy's frazzled mind couldn't remember the exact words anymore, but she didn't want to risk failure on the chance that her powers were limited in scope. Not to mention, mind controlling strangers just felt so wrong to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tammy pondered what to do in a tense situation, she felt her heartbeat raise a tick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, what happened? Where did this Rob Bolstrum head off to after he assaulted your boyfriend?\" pressed the lead police officer. He was growing frustrated at how the witness had just drifted off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy turned on the frightened little girl act and whispered meekly: \"He's been in the bathroom hiding ever since we called you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe policemen surrounded the locked bathroom door. They ordered the teenage bully calmly but authoritatively to open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, they all heard the rhythmic sound of a toilet flushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ROB, GET YOUR BUTT OUT OF THERE SO THE COPS CAN ARREST YOU!\" Tammy shouted right behind the police as she leaned on top of the staircase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss, we told you to stay outside! It's not safe for you here!\" reprimanded a second officer, this one female, her gun steadily aimed at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SORRY!\" giggled Tammy as she ran downstairs. She just hoped that her soft distaff voice was loud enough to be within Bolstrum's earshot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning outside with a still stunned looking Gloria and a fourth policeman, the sweet blonde was caught in a rush of conflicted emotions as she ran her imagination through this most bizarre, utterly life changing morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she had woken up at 6:09 A.M as Tom Ackerton, life had seemed hopeless. Pointless. Empty. Dark. Depressing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, as Tammy Ackerton, life was full of seemingly limitless possibilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still worried sick about her poor Bill, and of course, her darling daughter Willow. It didn't matter that Willow wasn't hers anymore. She still possessed Old Tammy's memories. She still thought of herself as Willow's mom, and a mother never stops caring about her children. But still, with even all that considered, this was the best day of her short eighteen years on Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the worst day of my life\" muttered Gloria by contrast, glaring scornfully at her boyfriend turned enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that meeting of the loggerheads when Rob appeared on the doorstep of the Strasserman residence. His face was still positively soaked from the toilet water, and his ginger hair still drenched from the endless swirly that Tammy had wished upon the bully. He was now in handcuffs, his hands behind his back as the trio of police officers escorted him over to their squad car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he entered the vehicle, he craned his thick neck to gaze over atTammy, giving her a look of death that would scare even hardened criminals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy by contrast smiled sarcastically at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Take your best shot, you piece of dogshit.</i> she thought smugly to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n** <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everyone had left, all one could see was a quiet suburban neighborhood caught in the throes of a pleasant late morning spring, two teenage girls standing on the front lawn of one of the nicer homes on the block, both wondering what they should do now. Both were extremely late for school, and neither had any intention of attending today. Neither girl glanced at one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like aeons, one of them spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate what you did to me\" said Gloria cold and unemotional sounding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't have a choice, Gloria. And to be honest, you had it coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You took over my mind. You took my free will away from me. That's no better than rape. Yeah. Whether you're Tom or whether you're this little geekette you seem to think you are now, you raped me. I'm not forgiving you for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy's eyes filled with anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bitch. Don't even dare.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was Gloria <i>doing</i>? Even after all this, she was still trying to start drama. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you did. Deny it all you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BILL WAS FUCKING DYING AND YOU WERE JUST STANDING THERE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was in shock. Sue me for having a natural reaction to all the fucked up things I've seen today. A word of warning, Tammy. All couples fight. Since you're going steady with Strasserman now, it's just a matter of time before you two have a little lover's quarrel. And when you do, think for a minute. Think about what you're saying, or you'll end up hurting him worse than Rob ever could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you even talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria's head swiveled to face her former lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tammy, you do NOT force people to do things that they don't want to do! You crossed a line that can't be uncrossed! You're a bad person! You're a bitch! A bitch with evil magic powers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about all of the horrible things you did to <i>me</i> when I was Tom!?\" Tammy squealed with indignation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom... Tammy. Sorry, I keep forgetting. Tammy, you're a drama queen. Even as a guy. I never did anything bad to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, grow up. You put up with me for years, and <i>now</i> you crack? If you can't accept me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bitch! Just shut up and drive us to the hospital!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment those fateful words left Tammy's mouth, Gloria's eyes glazed over in a cloud of green fog as her limbs immediately stiffened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me\" she said robotically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy ran up the stairs to lock Bill's front door, and then followed Gloria to her house a few blocks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived at the Vanapoulous house, Both girls entered Gloria's expensive sportscar, a birthday present from her father who was once again absent on one of his business trips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gloria slammed her driver's side door shut, her sense of coordination robbed from her as a mind zombie, Tammy quietly closed her own passenger side door and buckled up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drive\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria buckled her own belt, put the keys in the ignition, pulled out of the driveway, and drove in the direction of Shermer General Hospital. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Gloria drove in complete silence, Tammy ruminated over Bill and Willow's fates, as well as Gloria's ominous warning.</span></div></div>",

I WISH YOU'D HAVE YOUR OWN STONES AND JUST LEAVE ME ALONE!\" Tammy screamed at the top of her lungs, and suddenly the miniature star in her hand exploded. Green light was everywhere and Tammy could feel the Stone shifting in her grip. And then as suddenly as it had appeared, the light vanished, save for three glowing orbs in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one was a brilliant purple amethyst with a white  pearl core. The second one was a deep, rich sapphire blue with a silvery inner gem, and the final new gemstone was a striking orange jasper with a rich pink central teardrop. They floated in the air in front of Tammy, just far enough in the open space between the first and second stories of the Strasserman home before they began to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sapphire gemstone floated across the gap towards Bill, while the orange jasper made a beeline for Rob. Meanwhile the amethyst gemstone floated down the stairs towards Gloria, both gems coming to a stop before their new owners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of quiet before Rob jolted the group into activity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES! FUCKING A RIGHT!\" The bully roared, grabbing his gemstone with a boulder-like fist and pulling it close to him greedily. \"First off, I wish that Jonathan Ingerman was a weak little pussy!\" Rob roared in triumph, but the bellowing bully was soon silenced as there was no flash of light. Instead the new gemstone lay quietly in the palm of the giant, twinkling only slightly as the light bounced off the inner gem's strange fluctuating surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Bill had taken the opportunity to grab the Stone that had chosen him and darted beneath Rob's upraised arms until he was back at Tammy's side. \"What did you do?\" He asked Tammy, \"What happened to the real Stone?\" The two teenagers stared at the lifeless green stone in Tammy's small hand. There was barely any light reflecting from it's much cloudier and smaller surface. Overall the Ahn'Ger Stone had shrunk significantly  to almost a third of it's original size with the wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy shrugged, something she did when she was at a loss for words. \"I...I don't know! I was just so angry and wanted to be left alone...Maybe...Maybe it split off parts of itself? Maybe it's like a battery and it's out of juice?\" She poked the malachite colored stone with a cautious finer, yet nothing happened. \"Maybe I need to get angry again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not right now\" Bill said as he looked to his own Stone \"Last thing we need is these Stone's all blowing up in our faces or something. I wonder what mine is...\" Bill stared at the incredible blue gemstone. It wasn't much different from the original Stone that he had found (or had it found him?) this morning, just a different color. The interior seemed to move around the central gemstone and light refracted off of it very easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, on the first floor of the Strasserman house, Gloria was busy inspecting her own stone, the purple Amethyst. She too had tried to make a wish much like Rob had, though to no effect. Not even a glimmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit! Why won't this stupid thing work!\" Gloria whined, fighting the childish urge to thrown her new Stone against the wall. No, much like the other one there had to be a secret to making it work...Maybe she just had to get angrier?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what the fuck is going on right now, but I am officially offended!\" Willow said from her spot on the carpet. \"I don't know what these things are but I didn't get one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the balcony, Bill and Tammy hared a look. Was it because she wasn't 'real'? That she herself was created out of the original magical construct? Maybe whatever magic governed these didn't think that Willow registered as a 'person', and the though of that happening to her once and future daughter made Tammy's blood boil. There was a small spark from the Stone that caught her attention, but there were no other glimmer. The Stone had to be very weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut both Tammy and Bill knew one thing for certain: All these new Stones reminded them both of Thanos and the Infinity Stones. It couldn't be like that, could it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, all we know for certain is that right now they ALL don't work\" Bill said as he turned his head back to Rob. \"What about you, Bolstrum? You got what you wanted, now get out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you Shitterman! These are some cheap Chinese knockoff shit!  They're supposed to grant wishes, so why are they not granting any wishes!\" Rob spat out bitterly as he continued to stare at the gemstone that was, in his eyes, completely useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill was tired of it though. It was bad enough how his morning had gone, he would not tolerate his second biggest nemesis in his home for one second longer. \"Get out or I'm calling the cops!\" Bill threatened as he pulled out his phone. \"Last thing the big, bad Rob Bolstrum needs is that he finally got caught red handed. Your move, asshole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob was at a loss for a moment before he snorted like a bull, \"FINE. Fuck your Shitterman, and AckerTONS!\" The bully said as he stomped back down the stairs and out the door, jasper gemstone still tight in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one seemed to notice the shimmer from Bill's hand as he ordered Rob out. Instead he and Tammy joined Gloria in downstairs, the group of two best friends now a couple, the evil ex, and the woman that was clearly out of time placed their Stones on the table, the glimmer disappearing from Bill's the moment he let go of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any ideas on how they work?\" Tammy said, looking at Gloria, Willow and Bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a very long, empty silence in which the only sound was the slow tick tocking of the grandfather clock, Willow leaned forward and picked up Bill's Stone, since Gloria still had her hands cupped over her Stone protectively. \"Well, if they're anything like actual gemstones, then they, like, represent something. Green, Malachite, represents change and transformation, so if we go by that then blue\" Willow paused and held out Bill's Stone, \"-Should be powered by wisdom?\" Willow truly had no idea how anyo f this weirdness worked, but it seemed all somehow...familiar. Almost as if something from a past life was calling to her. Plus she was always glad to put the expensive classes she was taking in college to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue the blue gemstone released a small blue glow as Willow seemed to put it all together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. That is so pretty!\" Willow said as she pulled the new Stone towards her. Bill, seeing where it was leading, reached over and snatched the gemstone out of his daughter-turned-sister's hand. \"Hey!\" Willow cried out, but the look on Bill's face kept her from the pressing the issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Willow\" Tammy said, hoping to keep the explanation moving, \"What does Gloria's represent?\" Tammy pointed a finger at Gloria's amethyst, which looked very pretty and almost matched Gloria's clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if green is change and blue is wisdom, then that means that purple represents...Well, I think it's supposed to represent getting rid of toxicity. The purging of negative emotions and attachments\" Willow said and Tammy couldn't help but giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you'll never get yours to work, Gloria!\" Tammy said with more than a little smugness. If this really was how the new Stones worked then unless Gloria really started changing her ways then she never get another wish again. And maybe that was a good thing, given the mess she had created so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about the other one!\" Bill said, seeing Gloria's face darken and, frankly, just wanting more information, however correct or false it could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I think it was a jasper. So if it's a jasper then that means the only way that Rob Bolstrum is ever going to get a wish out of that thing is if he starts being nice to others. Jasper is an empathic gemstone, so he's going to...Well, he's going to have to not be him\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Fucking rain\" grumbled Rob as he stamped across a large puddle of water straddling the sidewalk on his way to Shermer High, the weather having ominously turned gloomy while he was arguing with Strasserman. Bullets of freezing rainfall fell across the bully's pockmarked face stinging him a little bit, but he was too damn angry to care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I waited for a fucking hour to talk to those fucking nerds, and then that David Copperfield shit happens\" he muttered, staring with a contemptuous glare at the orange jasper he held in his grip. His skeptical mind was already beginning to rationalize away the supernatural event he had just witnessed as his imagination, or some weird shit he didn't care to know the details about. \"Why do I even bother trying to be nice when this is all I get? Guess I'll pawn it later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob slipped the gemstone inside his left pocket. He had stolen enough jewelry before to know that it would probably fetch him about thirty dollars at the most. Not enough to mean anything substantial, but he figured it'll keep him in beer and pizza for a couple of days. That is unless Strasserman whines to the principal to give it back later today. Pft. Whatever. Let the little punk try. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob was honestly going to give Strasserman a chance too. He knew that egghead could think of a plan to get rid of Ingercunt. He was going to tell Bill everything he knew about Big Jon's schedule, where he hangs out, ways to provoke him, and so on, but then the Ackerton broad had to have her little meltdown and ruined it all. Pft. Probably on her period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWomen. Can't live with them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, the same held true for men too, if Rob was being honest with himself. He just wasn't a fan of humanity in general. To Rob, most people's only contribution to this life was turning perfectly good food into shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few exceptions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrasserman's sister was alright. He didn't know why, but he kind of liked her. He tried to convince himself it was because she had a sweet ass and legs for days, but somehow that didn't feel right. Maybe it's because she just seemed nice. Someone who didn't judge him for being poor white trash. She was an artist too. Rob respected someone who had a passion and followed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother person he respected was a girl named Amber Reid. She was one of the few people Rob knew who could appreciate old school punk music, and she knew where to score good drugs. The two of them would sometimes hang out down at the creek behind the trailer court and get fucked up while listening to The Clash or Soundgarden together, but it never went much further than that. Big Jon and the other bullies egged Rob on for this, calling him names, besmirching his manhood.  None of them would have <i>dared</i> to have said the things they had until Big Jon showed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. What am I going to tell Big Jon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Jon had ordered Rob to torch Strasserman's house. The fucking lunatic and his wounded ego wanted to teach Bill a lesson for something that had happened over two years ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was all a setup to further humiliate Rob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he didn't burn down Bill's house, he'd become a social pariah. His fellow bullies would say that he had no heart. They'd treat him like shit. Ingerman would say that he had no loyalty, and no balls. He'd give Bolstrum a beating. One that would leave bruises and would hurt for days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Rob <i>had</i> actually done as he was told, the cops would find out right away who did it, and Rob would go to prison for ten years. He'd be branded as an arsonist for life. Not that he cared, but he'd be a felon once he got out. He wouldn't be able to vote. He wouldn't be able to hold down most jobs. He'd be relegated to a life at the Shermer Fields Trailer Park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Rob snitched on Big Jon and said that it was all his idea, Ingerman's fucking rich daddy would throw money at everyone until the problem went away. They'd make it look like it was the scary looking 6'4 poor kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's why Rob had no respect for Big Jon. Big Jon was loaded. There were no consequences for anything he did. Any problems could be solved with money. Meanwhile, people like Rob had to carefully consider every decision they made, tactfully deciding who to steal from and whatnot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven more offensive to Rob was how Jon didn't have to be this way. He didn't have to  be a bully. He easily could have been another rich pretty boy, busy peeling off bikinis by the poolside. He was a handsome guy. He could get any girl he wanted. But no. He'd rather sexually assault developing underclass girls just because he enjoys seeing them shudder in revulsion. He'd rather terrify kids weaker than him versus playing football or rugby with guys his own size because he <i>enjoys</i> seeing the fear he instills in little weak nerds like Bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob shook his head, partly to fan away the torrents of rainwater continuing to soak the hair on top of his red topped noggin, partly out of disgust with his \"boss\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing is, Rob knew he was an asshole. He couldnt deny that he took pleasure in being one, but he had a code. He was mostly an asshole because he <i>had</i> to be. Rob had to intimidate and steal and do petty crime because he was poor. He sure as hell didn't live in a mansion like Big Jon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was like the guy Jean Valjean in that faggoty play. What was it? Les Miserables? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr better yet, Scarface. Yeah. Rob liked to think that he was like Tony Montana, building an empire from the ground up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus he needed to take care of his deadbeat alcoholic of a mom. He hated her, but someone had to do it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob wondered sometimes if he was even cut out for this thug life at all. Maybe he'd be happier doing something else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRounding a corner, he saw an adult Doberman Pinscher aimlessly wandering around the street, seemingly without an owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Pooch!\" yelled Bolstrum through the cold rain. His rough, gravelly voice may have sounded terrifying to most people, but while Rob hated people, he absolutely loved animals, and animals seemed to love him. The dog's ears perked up, and he padded over to Rob, wading through the torrent of rainwater. The dog's face looked friendly and affable, so Rob bent over and began to rub his wet fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lost, big guy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog, naturally, didn't answer. Yet, he seemed to appreciate the question and began wagging his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No collar. No leash. You just another discarded piece of trash like me, huh? Aren't you, boy?\" chuckled Rob a little bit as he tickled behind the friendly canine's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob didn't notice the orange glow erupting from his jean pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish you were my dog. I'd take such good care of you and love you and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash of orange light as...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Rob finds himself back in his trailer home, his mother passed out on the couch watching TV. The Doberman is standing<b></b> right next to him, wagging his tail as he waits to be fed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Rob blinks as he notices a collar and tag that clearly had \"If lost return to 444 Shermer Fields Trailer Court, Shermer Illinois\" printed on it form around the Doberman's neck. That was Rob's address!! He was the dog's owner now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His left hand fished into a pocket on the shirt, Rob being only vaguely aware that he was no longer wearing pants but something thing and lacy that hugged his waist, and felt a wave of relief as strange new fingers slid around the gemstone. The bully pulled the stone out with the intention of inspecting it when he felt an new alien sensation, distinct from the weights that now hung off the front of his body like pendulums. There was a weird, itchy feeling at the back of his neck and despite his bewilderment Rob swatted instinctively at the back of his neck while he stared into his newly gained cleavage, not expecting his hand to brush through a wall of shoulder length hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sensation seemed to be enough to jerk Rob out of his stunned contemplation of his cleavage as suddenly his shot upwards with a loud, high pitched \"OH SHIT!\" before a very unfamiliar center of gravity caused him to tumble painfully onto the hard wood of the porch. And unknown to Rob, in his current predicament, the magic stone was freed from his grip and sailed through the air as his womanly body tumbling backwards. The Doberman was immediately in his face, a concerned sniffing and whine to make sure that it's owner wasn't hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off me!\" Rob growled as as he flailed on the porch like an attractive turtle before he managed to flip himself over, the weight of his breasts swinging like pendulums before be managed to sit back on his soft and well cushioned rear. Once again, the Doberman was in his face, giving it a concerned lick before the loyal animal finally seemed to get the message as Rob pushed it away with his arms and a womanly grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck happened!?\" Rob swore as the he looked down at himself again, pushing away the blonde curls that strangely only seemed to inhabit the right side of his new head. He was a woman! He was so much...smaller! The bully suddenly became aware that it took some effort to push the dog away, whereas moments earlier he would have been able to do it with a single hand and minimal effort. Where were his muscles! His dick! This had to have an explanation, something had to have-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when his brain flopped over itself once more. The gemstone! Rob stared at his empty hands for a moment in panic before scanning the porch, spying the amber stone laying under the large wooden swing that hung from the underside of the porch's roof. Rob pushed himself forward, wobbling in his new proportions as he crawled across the porch and grabbed the bottle cap sized stone in his slender new fingers and cradling it close to his enlarged chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, it worked! I WISH I WAS A GUY AGAIN!\" Rob screamed in his new voice and braced himself for the change...Only to be disappointed as nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE FUCK!?\" Rob screamed as he shook the gemstone furiously, somehow thinking that physical violence would solve his problem much like it had in the past, \"FUCKING WORK! DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE ONE AND DONE! YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME LIKE THIS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Rob noticed that someone else had joined him on the porch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: \"Amber, what are you doing out here? Get your ass inside right now!\" The handsome but intimidating man standing next to Rob said. Rob suddenly recognized who it was; Amber's possessive boyfriend! He was Amber Reid!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: \"What. The fuck. Is happening Rob!?\" Rob's old body growls, dripping wet as it towers over him, \"Give me back my body right now!\"</span></div></div>",

He'd acquired what he thought was a completely busted magic wishing rock from that mousy little Tammy Ackerton bitch, left Strasserman's house in triumph before discovering the stone didn't work. That's when things took a turn for the worse. One moment he had been stuck in the middle of the early morning thunderstorm, petting a dog that he had assumed had been a stray, a wandering loner much like himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd wished to be the dog's owner, partly out of his love for animals and partly out of his own deep-seated need to be loved in return. Rob had blinked and the next moment he was in a different part of town, the richer part, and he had TITS! Rob couldn't stand it and he struggled in vain to force the jasper gem in his hand to change him back to his old body, never noticing that he was soon joined on the strange porch by someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob turned his newly acquired blonde head and gasped as the stranger addressed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: A tall, older man with an impressive beard. Wait, it was Ragnar Ingerman! Jonathan Ingerman's father! But he was supposed to be out of town! And...why was he in underwear and a t-shirt? And calling him Amber? Wait...OH NO!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: A small, very frail looking old woman stood there in a faded pink bathrobe, shivering in the chilly air brought in by the storm. \"Amber, deary, come inside!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rob was busy shaking the inactive, jasper wishing rock, trying not to be weirded out by the strange and foreign jiggling his new body way doing. And as much as it felt alien, it almost felt...good? But Rob pushed that feeling asdie and started shaking the rock in his tiny hands even harder as if it would solve his problem. So focused we he on getting the stone to somehow cave to physical intimidation he never heard the heavy front door behind him swing open or the sound of two large feet stepping out onto the front porch. In fact, it was the dog, the stupid dog he had felt sorry for and had gotten him into this mess, giving a uncertain whine that made Rob look up. If he'd looked into a mirror, he'd see a pretty, round face making an almost comically furious face with squinted green eyes and bared teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when Rob followed the dog's gaze towards the door, his angry expression turned to surprise as he let loose a small gasp. There, staring at him with dark brown eyes that made him feel small and insignificant, was the bearded face of Ragnar Ingerman, Jonathan Ingerman's father and the richest man in Shermer, if not most of northern Illinois. There was a look of confused disapproval on the man's face as he stood there in little more than a pair of underwear and a t-shirt. Much like his son, Ragnar was tall and bulky, most of that bulk being powerful muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in his old body, Rob had felt physically intimidated the few times he had met Big Jon's old man. And now? Now a shiver of fear shot through Rob's much smaller body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahmbur? What is wrong? Why are you out here? Get inside, now!\" Ragnar's accent was heavy and his voice was like the thundering report of an artillery cannon. The businessman flung the heavy oak door open and pointed a finger towards the dark but clearly well furnished house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob, however, was simply paralyzed by fear. 'OhgoditsIngercunt'sdadohgodhe'ssotallwhyishealmostnakedshitwhattheF UCKISGOINGON!?' Rob's mind turned to slush in the face of his nemesis's father, whose own face turned frighteningly dark and ominous as Rob failed to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"INSIDE, NOW!\" Ragnar's voiced rumbled again and he took a threatening step forward and Rob could swear he felt the boards on the porch shake. The Doberman whimpered as it lowered to the floor in submission by the sheer willpower the titanic businessman exuded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just do it. He'll get mad if you don't!' Came a voice inside of Rob's blonde head, a voice that was certainly not his own. 'Do or he'll-'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the voice was going to say next, it was cut off as Ragnar moved with incredible swiftness, grabbed Rob by his skinny arm to which the dog let loose a scared yelp to match Rob's womanly squeal, and effortlessly lifted Rob up as if he weighed nothing at all. The former bully tried not to cry out as he hung from Ragnar's iron grip an inch off of the porch's surface, or the painful pressure that was slowly crushing his forearm. In his free hand, Rob held the magical gemstone tight and silently tried to make a wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wish I was back home!' He yelled into his head, but there was nothing that could save him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vhen I tell you to do something, you WILL DO IT!\" Ragnar growled into Rob's face, and Rob could smell the breath of a man who smoked far too much and hadn't brushed his teeth yet. Rob clenched his eyes closed as turned his face away as he said the only thing he could think of. something he'd never started saying to ANYONE except his mother until the Ingermans had moved to town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry!\" Rob cried out in his new voice, and suddenly he felt the pressure leave his arm as he dropped back onto his tiny feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just geet inside\" Ragnar growled, pointing his finger once again towards the dark interior of the house, and Rob quickly obeyed, shuffling his feet forward over the threshold of the doorway, his barefeet plodding silently across the hardwood floor as he rubbed his wrist where Ragnar had been holding it. It hurt. A LOT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind him, Ragnar simply whistled, and the Doberman came scampering in behind, claws clacking against the wood floor of the house as it darted up the stairs as Ragnar cast a suspicious look up and down the drenched street before slamming the heavy door shut. Rob watched the clearly terrified dog scamper up the stairs and stop at the landing, locking eyes that looked almost as if they were pleading with Rob to follow as Rob took a few more uncertain steps into the dark and clearly massive house. He felt compelled to follow the dog and reached out to grab the banister when he heard the elder Ingerman's voice behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahmbur, wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob froze again. Ahmbur? Who was...Did he mean Amber?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes...' The strange voice that was not his own said in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But the only Amber I know is...Oh shit! Am I Amber Reid!?' Rob's mental voice cried out in shock, 'But-' He didn't have time to finish his train of thought as he felt an enormous hand spin him around to face Ragnar's barreled chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahmbur, I am...sorry. But I pay guut money for this. For you. I buy this house, car, I buy your clothes, I buy your dog. I even give you money for drugs! All you heff to do is look preety and keep to yourself. What would heppen if a neighbor saw you? What if they saw me? Then Tara would find out. Then all this, POOF! Gone. And you be back in Shermer Field. Back in the dump. Is that what you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob struggled to make sense of everything Ragnar was saying. Tara clearly referred to Jonathan's stepmom, some trophy wife, but everything else? Amber had always shyed away from the subject the few times Rob had asked if she'd been in a relationship with anymore, or where she got the money for the drugs and he car when she never appeared to actually have a job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just from here and there\" Amber would say and then quickly change the subject. Being a petty criminal himself, Rob knew about discretion and had never pressed the issue. But..Was Amber really Ragnar's mistress? Was HE now Ragnar's mistress? Rob clenched his hand tighter around the gemstone and made another wish to escape, though predictably nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? Do you want to lose all this or not Ahmbur?\" Ragnar's voice took on another threatening growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He can make people disappear. You know he can' The little voice said, and Rob had to agree with it, whatever it was. If Ragnar could buy off the Shermer police every time Jonathan got caught in something, there was no telling what he could do to someone that threatened his privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no. I'm s-sorry. I just, I just got mad because the dog wasn't going to the bathroom! I didn't want him to...to piss all over this wonderful house!\" Rob did his best to imitate Amber's voice, and it seemed to work as Ragnar's face lightened and his tone turned from threatening to almost friendly. A enormous hand cupped Rob's small womanly chin and lifted it up to brown eyes that twinkled with false warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neext time, use the backdoor. That is why I had the ence built okay?\" Ragnar then bent down and planted a heavy, disgusting kiss onto Rob's new lips, and the former bully tried his best to play along and return the kiss as convincingly as he could before finally the giant released him, a mostly gentle pat on the chick that still managed to sting ever so slightly. The mostly undressed business man wandered past Rob, down the hallway and flicking on a light to what was revealed as a bathroom. The door swung closed as Rob heard Ragnar mutter something in...whatever was his native language, followed soon by the steady sound of piss streaming into a toilet bowel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his freedom, at least for the moment, secured, Rob tried not to let his bare legs shake as he rushed upstairs and darted into the first open door he saw, a free hand smacking blindly into the barely lit room until he felt a lightswitch. Flicking it on and rushing across the massive room that was filled with a huge sized bed, a dresser, a doorway to ANOTHER bathroom and a giant TV mounted on the wall, Rob got his first look at his new (and hopefully borrowed) face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was Amber Reid, alright. Her pretty face, the curly hair that was currently cut in a more womanly 'punk rock' look. Big green eyes that were shimmering with tears. clothes hanging off supple breasts and bare legs clothed only by a pair of black panties he was just now noticing. Rob looked at himself in the mirror and then down at his closed fist, opening the fingers to show the jasper gemstone laying lifelessly in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to me?\" Rob said softly, \"Why am I here? Why Amber? Why...him?\" Rob felt something...raw in his chest as he thought about what the only person in his life he could actually call friend was going through. It was anger, but a different kind of anger. Indignation? Whatever it was, it burned in his chest as he thought about all the times he'd seen Amber suddenly look sad or go running off into the woods whenever she'd hear Big Jon nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit, I just wish I knew what was going on!\" Rob cried out, his fingers curling around the gemstone again and blotting out the small glimmer of orange light that shone from it. He slammed his fist against the top of the long dresser and a hot, salty tear rolled down his soft cheek as...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: The Stone itself speaks to Rob, revealing it's purpose and why Rob is where he is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Rob Bolstrum doesn't exist anymore. He wanted to BE the dog's owner, so he became her, body and soul!</span></div></div>",

He cast a green-eyed look at the Doberman in the corner of the room, frozen in mid-startled leap as it's black and red fur was simply one giant coat of orange. It took the reduced former bully a moment to realize what was happening and when he did, his face lit up and he spread his arms wide, ready for a change, to get out of Amber's body and back into his own familiar one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that never happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, the orange glow enveloped the entire room and the magical jasper never fell to the surface of the dresser, instead floating in mid air where Rob has released his grip on it as it glowed like a miniature sun. After a moment of disappointed waiting Rob frowned and stood from the bed, carefully making his way back over to the Stone and reaching out a single, slender finger to poke it, but that was when a translucent orange hand appeared out of nowhere and pulled his borrowed forearm down, causing Rob the jerk backwards in surprise as his new eyes focused on a strange humanoid form coalescing from the light that had swallowed the world. A form that looked exceedingly familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-amber?\" Rob croaked as he watched the ghostly form of his friend looked around the room, sighed, and lifted itself up onto the dresser where it sat with the same killer legs that Rob was currently using.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Rob\" The specter said in the same voice that had been in Rob's head a few minutes ago, trying to warn him away from angering Ragnar, \"So I guess this is the part where I give you an explanation for, well, everything that's happening right now. It's a good thing you wished for that, because it was going to be, like, really hard to keep helping you out otherwise\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helping me?\" said Rob as he cautiously edged towards the ghost of his friend, currently standing apart from the rest of the unending wave of light that filled the room by a shimmering outline of bright pink, \"Wait, is this light everywhere? Shit, Ingercunt Senior is gonna see it! Quick, hide!\" Rob waved his, or rather, Amber's hands towards the floating stone as his eyes locked on the open bedroom door where the light had penetrated the rest of the massive house. But the ghost calling itself Amber simply let loose a tired giggle and waved her hand dismissively at Rob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, time is stopped right now. He can't see, hear or move until all this\" Amber gestured to herself and then all around the room, \"So, much as I would like to stare at myself, can I tell you what's up? Quicker you get the 4-1-1 quicker we can try fixing all this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob stared at Amber's incorporeal form, the floating wish rock and then down at himself, in that order before nodding slowly. This was SO weird! Like he would have rather taken the weirdness at Shitterman's house than deal with this! Rob made his way to the side of the bed and sat down, trying not to get turned on by the feeling of his newly smooth legs rubbing against each other. The ghost in front of him conjured what looked like a pink cigarette and took a drag of it before facing Rob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, this is fucked up. I'm literally looking at myself even though I know it's you in there Robby\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not too thrilled about this either, Amber. Why is this happening? Why are you shacked up with Ingerman's dad?\" Rob watched as his friend's magically formed face fell for a moment, a look of sadness as the real Amber's face was animated by the shimmering outline of pink on orange. Then finally she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rob, you remember what we talked about a couple of years ago? When you got held back and I graduated? I was scared, didn't know what to do. Wanted to get out of the trailer park but there was no way I'd ever have the money to do anymore than just...exist. And that's when you said 'we do what we have to, to get where we need to go'. And that was the craziest thing you'd ever said but it stuck with me. That's how I got out. This is how I got out. I fucked the biggest fish I could find and I got out of a life of having nothing, of being nothing. But Ragnar isn't like he was. He's getting meaner every time he swings by. My chance to get out safe was a long time ago. But maybe...\" Amber lifted her incorporeal body off the dresser and crossed the bedroom, her feet leaving no indentations in the thick carpet until she was standing next to Rob. She lifted a orange and pink finger and touched Rob's forehead, which felt like a gentle vibration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if there's two of us working together, with this Stone, you can save me. And then the Stone will let you go back to your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob stared into Amber's otherwordly pink eyes for a moment before he brought up his hand to swipe her's away, rolling his eyes and not noticing how his slender, soft hand simply caused hers to break apart in a cloud of wispy pink tendrils before reforming  as she pulled the limb away. \"Yeah, because I'm some kind of a fucking hero. We both know what I am, chica. I beat up people, hell, I HURT a girl like an hour ago to get what I wanted, and that ended up causing all of this fucking mess!\" Rob stood and moved away from his ghostly friend as the light from the Juu'Stas Stone flicked and dimmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rob, if you don't do this you'll never-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never what? Go back to my old body? Get stuck sucking off Ingercunt's old man for the rest of my life? No, that isn't going to happen. I won't be stuck like this, but I'm not going to play whatever stupid as shit game you or that rock has planned. I'll get us out of this Amber, but I'm going to do it my fucking way\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light from the Stone dimmed even further as Amber's body began break apart as she looked at Rob with an expression that he couldn't read, the pink shimmering outline of her body twisting and turning in on itself as it was drawn back towards the Juu'Stas Stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be riding shotgun with you Rob. I can talk whenever you hold the Stone. But I really hope you know what you're doing...\" Amber's voice trailed off as the last of the outline entered the Stone, and with a small flash the orange tint that had covered the world faded away. The Stone clacked to the surface of the dresser, the Doberman, Taco, finished it's terrified leap backwards, and Rob simply cast a long, hard glare at the orange gemstone that he'd been given. Or possibly cursed with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So what's your plan?' Came the little voice in his head that Rob now knew was Amber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over and grabbed the Stone with a small hand, feeling the burning warmth from all the magic energy it had just expended and fought the urge to simply smash it for what it had done. Instead Rob looked in the mirror at his borrowed face as it twisted into a determined grimace.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Confused, exhausted, indignant, and cripplingly frightened by what this new reality had brought about, Gloria made the only move that she thought made sense in the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish that we were all younger again, so suck on it Tom!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGloria, you idiot!\u201d screeched Tammy as the stone exploded like a supernova of green luminescence, blowing back Gloria's blackish-gray hair in gust of supernatural wind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill, panicking, noticed that reality itself was melting, shimmering, becoming vague. It reminded him a bit of Inception when the city in Ellen Page's dream started collapsing into an M.C Escher puzzle, but he didn't have a chance to notice any specific impressions he could make out before the Ahn'Ger Stone's magic had finished its course. The light faded away as quickly as it had erupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a moment for Bill to realize that he was now standing in a living room far removed from his own, let alone the guest room he had just been in a brief second ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was rectangular, with a shaggy tan rug covering the entirety of the floor and white walls making up the rest of the area. A comfortable looking black couch sat across from a large screen television, with a rather nice looking rectangular coffee table in between the two. Bill walked up to the coffee table, and he noticed that a board game was sitting on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSettlers of Catan! That was Bill's favorite board game, and it looked like the game was already in progress.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, he saw two little girls, wandering around confused. One looked a lot like Gloria might have looked as a toddler, no older than two, three at the most. She was wearing a pink t-shirt for babies, and a diaper could be visibly seen poking out from underneath it. Her hair was in pigtails, and she was holding something in her right hand, but Bill couldn't make it out. Her eyes were darting around the room, frightened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girl had curly blonde hair and was dressed in a shirt with The Flintstones on it and some black pants. She seemed more curious than the other girl was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGworia?\u201d asked Bill in a childish voice no older than two. He slapped his mouth and slowly looked down at himself. It was then when he looked down and noticed that he had transformed into a toddler too! He was wearing a black t-shirt with some cartoon character on it and he apparently was still in diapers as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh nooh!\u201d he said in surprised agitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was he?! What was this place?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe climbed on top of the couch and looked outside of a partially open window. Outside, Bill noticed that he wasn't in his hometown anymore. The first clue was that the traffic of both the automobile and pedestrian kind was a lot busier than Shermer, Illinois ever was. The second was that the buildings were a lot bigger and differently designed. The third were the palm trees. It was also a lot warmer than Illinois ever got. He crawled further on top of the windowsill and looked outside. In the distance he saw rolling hills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBilly, sweetie, get down from there!\u201d said a  familiar voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill turned around and saw Willow, his daughter from the future, frantically running across the strange living area and pick him up by the waist. She carefully placed him back on the floor and bent down to look at him face to face. She gently stroked his hair. She looked worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBilly, how many times do I have to tell you!? No climbing on the windowsill. I'm sorry, Billy. I know how curious you are, but you're still only two years old, and your coordination isn't good enough to go on any adventures yet. Someday though \u201d she said, winking at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt slowly dawned on him. That damn stone had changed reality again, and judging by what was going on, Bill would guess that it had turned Willow into his mother and himself into her son! Bill couldn't believe it. It was mind blowing enough to know that he'd have a daughter in the future, but now he was back in diapers, and Willow was the one pulling them up. He was scared as he thought about the seemingly unlimited power and capriciousness of that stone, now wondering deeply how it came to land on his porch in the first place. More importantly, what had happened to his real mom and dad? The fear showed in Bill's eyes, which Willow took to mean that he was upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, honey, I'm sorry\u201d said Willow in a very maternal voice. \u201cI know! How about we all go out for ice cream later after Mommy is done working?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust to keep up appearances, Bill nodded fervently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: In this new reality, Willow is the daughter of Kimberly Strasserman. When Willow moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in animation and ended up pregnant with triplets after a one night stand, Kimberly soon followed her to pursue her own interests, trying to restart her life in middle age. She and Willow currently live together in a decent apartment. Grandma Kimmy stops by after one of her classes to watch Bill, Tammy, and Gloria while Willow is working. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: The story briefly switches to Willow's point of view of a harried, ambitious young single mother as she simultaneously works on a project from home while also keeping an eye on the gang's attempts to figure out a way to activate the stone again. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

As Kimberly turned and smiled at the person who was entering, Bill turned his own smaller head to see what who was entering. And he audibly gasped as he saw who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Bill's younger sister, Kimberly! It was unmistakably her! Well, Bill's former younger sister Kimberly. Now, Kimberly was apparently much older, right around the age that Bill and Tammy had been seemingly moments ago, but it's already felt like a lifetime since that happened to Bill. Kimberly had a worn but warm face, slight grey hairs in her head, and was wearing a decent looking polka-dot dress. But this older woman, Bill could easily recognize the spunky, energetic, and slightly annoying but still lovable girl he grew up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom!\" Willow said, as she approached Kimberly, Bill still in hand. Behind her, Tammy and Gloria looked on. Gloria held back tears, trying to not draw attention to her childish form, but in her head knowing that she screwed the pooch this time. And Tammy continued to look around curiously, perhaps trying to figure out his she liked this reality as much as the one she just left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, sweetheart. How has your day been going?\" Kimberly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was going pretty good, until little Billy here tried to escape out the window again.\" Willow said, bouncing Bill up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you little rascal you! You have so much of your grandfather in you, I just wish you could have got to meet him...\" Kimberly said, the sound of loss emanating in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I wish the kids could have met him too. But Little Billy here will get to carry on his legacy!\" Willow said. \"Mom, how were your classes today?\" Willow was trying desperately to change the subject, hoping to cheer her mother up. Her mother loved the fact that she was able to go back to school at her age to make up for the lack of a college education, having become a mother early in life and a homemaker for the rest of it. What made it great was that when Willow wasn't at work, Kimberly could simply pop on a VR headset and been in class without acting having to leave the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, they were fine. You think you know everything about the history you grew up in, and suddenly your class goes over all the weird stuff that happened that 2021 and you suddenly realize how much you don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you'll have to tell me more!\" Willow responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later, sweetheart. Listen, I'm here now to watch the kids. Go do your work!\" Kimberly laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, mom, you don't have to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense! That's what Grandmothers are for! You have your animation dreams to accomplish! Go! Work!\" Kimberly said, taking Bill from Willow's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill was so utterly lost here. And he had to figure out something soon, or else he'd be growing up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Bill attempts to convince Kimberly that he is her brother. Meanwhile, Gloria can't stop thinking about why she keeps screwing up, and Tammy can't stop thinking about why she hated being Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Bill's thoughts about the stone are distracted as he messes his diaper. Willow and Kimberly work together to change him as Bill finds out more about the current reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Bill suddenly realizes that he, Gloria and Tammy are siblings. And that they look eerily similar to a certain bully from Shermer Illinois...</span></div></div>",

This was soon followed by Tammy, and then Gloria, but when Willow picked up Gloria, she noticed Gloria was holding onto something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gloria what do you have here?\" Willow said, as she took a look at the mysterious green stone. \"Where did a silly little girl like you get this? This isn't one of mine... is it? I haven't dated anyone long enough recently to earn something as nice as this....\" Willow trailed off, as she got lost in the stone's beautiful shine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to be brought back to reality by the tears of the daughter she held in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know you don't want this pretty thing taken away, but Mommy doesn't want little Gloria to get into trouble with this thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the other room, Bill heard this. He rolled his little baby eyes. This was trouble enough already. Maybe it was a good thing that Gloria had it taken away... but now it meant that someone who had no clue of its power had it in her hands... but hopefully Willow wasn't the angry type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Willow placed Gloria in the play room with the other kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, please be good for Mommy. I have to finish up this project for Mr. McGavin so that Mommy can pay the rent! So please! I know you probably don't understand a word I say, but please, let Mommy have work time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Willow walked off and sighed. Trying to live her dream without Greg there to help out with the kids was rough. Getting her first true assignment, animating for a show called \"Pirate Pete's Perilous Plight\" and getting to work at home for it was lucky enough. Willow still worked hard during the day to pay the bills and hard at night to keep her kids happy... but soon it would all be worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow sat at her desk, and fiddled with the stone in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know... I'm already getting some new ideas from this stone... I may have to have a storyboard session soon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Mr. McGavin calls Willow and informs her that funding was pulled from the show. Angry and upset, Willow makes a wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Willow tries her best to work, but discovers that Bill made his way out of the play area. Frustrated, Willow loses her temper and makes a wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Frustrated at her lack of progress, Willow makes an angry wish towards herself.</span></div></div>",

Except, no, this was his reality now. He was an adult man in the future with a mutant daughter, married to his best friend. This was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashes of the past now briefly entered Bill's mind. Mysteriously, in the past couple of years, many young men and women in their 20s have been discovering that they have certain powers that would have been unbelievable even 10 years ago. Cable News these days was basically full of conspiracy theories about how these mutants came to be. Some speculate it was a failed nuclear experiment, others claim it was an intentional act of the American Government, hoping to create an army in case their treaties with Mars fall through... god, there was life on Mars? Other just exclaim it's the next step in human evolution. And some even claim that they have internal documents that it was a test using magical gemstones that caused these powers to appear. Bill would have normally brushed this off... and yet here he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Bill saw how excited Willow... his daughter... was about all of this. And so he felt he should at least act the part of proud papa, at least until her could figure out a way to fix all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's amazing sweetie! I'm so happy you don't see this as a burden. If you don't mind me asking... what's your power?\" Bill asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow smirked and replied...</span></div></div>",

Willow... his daughter had run quite the gambit of transformations just now. Heck, maybe she could even be Gambit! He wondered if they did ever make that Gambit movie they announced like 20 times in his youth. Anyways, every moment he existed as a father seemed to get more and more insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the Willow Bloodhound seemingly caught a scent. Willow sniffed around towards Gloria, and shimmed back to her human form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that in your hand, Mrs. Vanopolis?\" Willow said, curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria snapped out of her trance of insanity to look at Willow. \"Oh... just a stone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I see it?\" Willow asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Gloria, still in shock from everything, simply gives the stone to Willow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Gloria, knowing the power of the stone, refuses to give up the stone.

They were happily married, with a nice house, a daughter who was clearly successful but apparently prone to dropping surprises on her parents. Gloria had wanted the two of them to be miserable! And SHE was not supposed to be this old hag! Gloria had always planned on becoming a model! Now she was in some hideous business suit and looked like a clone of her own mother! But despite the horror of her new body and the annoyance that her wish to make Bill and Tom miserable had failed, there simply wasn't enough anger to re-activate the magical gemstone that Gloria still had in her hand, or grant any of the numerous wishes to be young again, to go home, to make Bill and Tom miserable that she was making in her hand and under her breath. Maybe if she...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Gloria's scheming was interrupted as Willow spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay mom, dad, I know this is a lot to take in but I want you to meet them, okay? They've made my life out west so happy, I never would have made it as a storyboard artist or gotten my new show without them!\" Willow quickly walked out of the house and down to stone stairs to the sidewalk, where a wall of tall hedges blocked Bill, Tammy and Gloria's view of the stranger that was coming out from behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: It was a woman! Bill and Tammy share a look of surprise as Willow led, hand in hand, a gorgeous, curvy red-headed woman up to the house. \"Mom, dad, this is Roberta! Roberta Bolstrum!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: It was a man! Bill and Tammy share a look of surprise as Willow led, hand in hand a tall, red headed and musclebound man up the stairs to the house. \"Mom, dad, this is Robert! Robert Bolstrum!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bill could only stare wide-eyed in shock as he watched Willow, his daughter, bounce down the stairs in a red dress he never remembered her having and stop at the bottom of the concrete steps that led up to the house he and his family apparently lived in. He felt Tammy grab his dangling hand and he cast a sideways glance to his best friend turned wife who seemed to share his feelings of utter shock and surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria, on the other hand, simply stood off to the side of the large porch of the new Strasserman household and watched with mild interest as Willow quietly spoke with someone, her apparent fiancee, who was hiding behind the wall of trimmed hedges that blocked the house from the road. She felt the cold gemstone in her hand and she stared down at it for a moment in her hands, stretching out her wrinkling palm and once again being horrified at the how old she was now. And how much she looked like her mother. And Gloria's own artificial memories didn't help, sitting there, clawing for dominance over her teenage memories. Her TRUE memories, she had to remind herself. It just wasn't fair though, she had put in all that time, business school, spent the best years of her life clawing her way up the ladder only to watch Bill sail past her and become, more or less, her boss! That was why he had the perfect family, the massive, if somewhat old fashioned house in the expensive part of Shermer, and why Gloria never managed to get out of her parent's house (which was now hers as her parents were permanently snowbirding in Florida), much less Shermer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria felt like she was forgetting something important as well. These new memories, a lifetime lived, seemed to hit all the important things yet leave others out. Was she married in this new reality, or a spinster? The thought of being married to anyone but Tom (even if he was some dumpy fat housewife now) was intolerable. She always believed that she and the former sports superstar of Shermer High were destined to be together, even if he hadn't been rich like Jon Ingerman or impossibly muscled like Rob Bolstrum. Tom was hers...But the cruel wish that had somehow come true had thrown that all off track now. Gloria watched as 'Mr. and Mrs. Strasserman' stared warily at the retreating form of their daughter, and once again memories swelled up from the well of her new adult mind. She was definitely sure she didn't have any kids, though. The closest thing she did have was Willow Strasserman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria had become Willow's glorified babysitter, watching over the little brat for Tammy and Bill while they took vacations, went on dates...All part of her 'duties' as Bill's executive assistant as he rapidly ascended the rungs of Ingerman's company. At first she had hated it but over time she'd developed some form of attachment to the little girl, turning from 'Ms. Gloria' into 'Aunt Gloria'. Buying her candy or the odd toy, letting her stay up to play video games or watch TV, giving Willow her first (highly supervised) sip of alcohol when she grew into a teenager. And then being a confidant and giving the young woman advice on subjects Willow had clearly not felt comfortable talking to her parents about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria stifled a gasp as she realized that, while she had no idea who Willow was about to bring up the walk, but she KNEW the younger Strasserman was engaged before her parents even did! The thought of all of it, being someone that their daughter trusted just as much and in some ways more than Bill and Tammy made Gloria want to smile with smug satisfaction. A small, permanent victory for a lifetime of injustices and her career being nothing more than a glorified secretary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was when Gloria's original personality re-asserted itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut none of that was true, was it? Just like the young woman who was finishing her conversation by the street and turning, her hand clasped in the mystery fiancee's, it was all just a fake? With every passing second it seemed like the memories of being Gloria Vanapolous, queen of Shermer High seemed to fade the longer she remained here in this new reality. She wanted to make a wish, to escape and be young again, to change her life so that she didn't end up as Bill's glorified secretary, but the anger just seemed so...tempered by disappointment, regret and acceptance that the Ahn'Ger Stone only sparked to life for a brief moment before going dark once more. Instead Gloria's curiosity began to get the better of he as she stared intently at Bill and Tammy's daughter as she pulled her mystery lover out into plain view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the stranger was revealed she felt her thinning eyebrows arch in surprise as Bill and Tammy let loose a shared gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, following closely behind Willow, was a gorgeous red-headed woman with pale skin in a soft, very springy green top and white pants that ended in what looked like designer sandals. Her breasts seemed barely contained by the top and the woman's hips threatened to split the white pants that stretched over her wide hips and generous posterior before stretching down her long legs. Even with the height difference from the stairs giving Willow Strasserman several inches of height it was clear this new woman was tall. A mane of fiery red hair shook and bounced in time with the jiggling of the woman's almost impossible curves as they ascended the concrete stairs. The woman's heart soft, round face seemed happy but extremely nervous to Gloria, a heavily lipsticked smile on large full, pouty lips that revealed perfect teeth, with brilliant green eyes resting behind a small pair of glasses darting back and forth between the middle aged group at the top of the stairs, Willow's backside and her own feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Willow and her fiancee were on the porch of the Strasserman abode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She almost looks like that one chick from Aquaman' Bill thought, a hazy memory surfacing in the back of his 'dad mind' of a movie that had come out during his first semester in college. What was that actresses's name? If it hadn't been for Willow's voice Bill might have been momentarily concerned by this sudden development.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, dad, this is Roberta! Roberta Bolstrum!\" Willow said with what seemed to be all the excitement in the world about to burst out of her. Her face was full of joy that only seemed to falter for a moment as she realized the look of shock, confusion and...anger? on the faces of her parents. But then the love of her life seemed to break the awkward, tense silence that was forming by holding out a slender, feminine hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I, umm, I-I prefer Bobbi\" Roberta said, her voice shaking and her outstretched hand matching it as it hung in the early morning spring air. Her voice, nervous as it was, was pleasant and melodious. There was absolutely nothing about her that seemed to justify the warning bells going off in the heads of the three teens turned middle-aged adults, that this was simply a lovely young woman nervously trying to meet her fiancee's parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments passed in silence, with only the sounds of Shermer around the group of people. Tammy could see the smile start to falter on her beloved daughter that she had just actually met face and she gave Bill's hand a tight squeeze, which made the boy turned man jerk in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Uh, yes, it's, uh, very nice to meet you Ro...Bobbi\" Bill stammered as he enveloped the small, smooth and rose topped fingered hand in front of him a quick shake. \"I'm, uh, Bill and this is my wife Tammy\" He said releasing Bobbi's hand and motioning towards Tammy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's so nice to meet you!\" Tammy said with a sweetness that sent even more alarms going off in Bill's 'dad mind'. That was the 'angry Tammy' voice, and it was more than clear, to him at least, that his best friend turned wife was clearly not happy with the turn of events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill watched as his wife and Willow's fiancee shared a quick handshake before Willow seemed to remember that Gloria was there on the proch with them, and quickly ushered the terrified looking redhead over to the withered Vanapolous. He took this moment to lean over and whisper into Tammy's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...You don't really think that's Rob, do you? I mean why would he even be here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same way we're all old and blessed with a wonderful family, Bill\" Tammy whispered in return as the two of them watched Gloria fumble through the introduction. \"Listen, if we both can remember two full lives, be this old and have a full grown daughter, who knows what that magic rock can do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"you want us to just sit here and watch our daughter get married to the asshole that made you and me miserable? We can't let that happen Tammy!\" Bill hissed back, but Tammy released her ironclad grip on Bill's left hand and he felt a throb of pain from it from how hard Tammy had been clenching it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not passing judgement until I know this young woman better, honey.\" Tammy whispered back and planted a small kiss on Bill's cheek before she walked away to rescue Gloria from a very uncomfortable situation. Bill simply just shook his head.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bill hid his frustration as best as he could as he watched his best friend inexplicably turned wife of forty years sashay over to where Willow was excitedly introducing Rob...Bobbi Bolstrum to Gloria, whose aged face simply blanched under the unexpected attention, and couldn't help but find his gaze drawn to the large rear that dominated the back of the 'mom jeans' Tammy was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn\" Bill's newly deepened voice muttered as the former Tom Ackerton inserted herself into the conversation and placed a small hand on Willow's arm, giving their daughter a motherly smile as she turned Willow's attention from the terrified looking Gloria back to her. Meanwhile, the redheaded, busty beauty of Bobbi Bolstrum continued to smile nervously and shuffle her feet, one hand intertwined with Willow's while the other hand was rubbing it's thumb and index fingers together; something Bill knew Rob would do whenever the bully had momentarily been outsmarted. Bobbi...If she really was a Bobbi and not just Rob in different packaging, was clearly uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Willow, honey, let's take it inside. I'll get us all something to drink and your father and Gloria can join us in a few minutes, okay? They were talking about work just before you arrived\" Tammy said, casting a quick, knowing look at Bill and Gloria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Gloria and I work together?' Bill pondered, he and Gloria sharing a look of their own before suddenly his second set of memories clued him in. He worked for Big Jon's company (or rather the company he inherited from his father), he was a regional director, more or less his own boss and Gloria was...Oh jesus, Gloria was his secretary! Across the porch Gloria seemed to reach to same conclusion and her face paled even further as her eyes widened in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow's smile dropped for a moment before it reappeared, bright white teeth gleaming in the morning sunlight, \"Oh, okay! C'mon Bobbi, my mom makes the BEST lemonade you've ever tasted! And I can show you my old room! It's still my old room right mom? You and dad didn't turn it into an office or anything did you?\" Willow's  face suddenly contorted in concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, everything is just the way you left it! I didn't let your dad turn it into a man cave!\" Tammy chuckled, rubbing her daughter's back and softly guiding her towards the heavy oak door of the Strasserman family residence. She pushed the door open and, with a final look at Bill, headed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gosh, this is so exciting!\" Willow squealed as she pulled Bobbi along behind her as the trio entered the house, Bobbi's eyes going even wider, locking with Bill's for a brief moment before her shorter fiancee pulled her through the opening and the heavy door swung shut behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it was quiet once more on the porch, the only sounds were the ambient sounds of Shermer, the wind through the trees, birdsong, cars in the distance, a ringing of a school bell that had, before the strange twist of fate, the three teenagers turned middle-aged adults had been headed for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the dull clacking of Gloria's heels on the patio as she staggered backwards to lean on the porch railing. The two teenagers turned adults stood there for a moment as they gathered their bearings; Bill simply processing everything that had happened and his 'dad brain' sounding off all sorts of alarms about his little girl getting married to a complete stranger...Or a complete asshole, and Gloria simply coming to terms with her own rush of adult memories. The silence was finally broken however, when a synthetic chime called out near Gloria, causing them both to be startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, what the hell is that!?\" Gloria cried, spinning her head around as the sound seemed to be right in her ears, \"Oh god don't tell me it's some weird future robot or something!\" The slightly graying raven haired woman spun in her business suit, free hand pawing at the air in a panic before Bill realized what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gloria...I think that's your cellphone\" His gruff voice said as he took a step forward. Bill didn't see anything that resembled a phone on Gloria's person, nor did her retro-future business suit seem to have any pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't have my phone on me!\" She whined, patting herself down, \"And shouldn't I, like, at least have a purse if I'm an old lady!? God, I just want to go home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh just answer the damn thing so you'll both shut up!\" Bill hissed, casting a look at the windows of the home he now remembered a lifetime in. Hopefully Tammy was keeping Willow and...Bobbi distracted. Last thing he needed was daughter asking questions he was sure none of them were ready to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you! You can't talk to me like that!\" Gloria hissed back, her panic momentarily giving way and true anger pushing through the feeling of sheer exhaustion she had felt since landing in this messed up future world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her hand there was a brief glimmer of green-gold light and Bill tried to hide his alarm. Gloria had been pissed off when she'd wished them all here, clearly the gemstone required you to be angry before it granted wishes, and the last thing Bill needed was to be swept away into another fucked up version of reality. Even if he'd lost most of his life, this one...wasn't so bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay! I'm sorry, Gloria. We're all just a little stressed out right now. Just answer it and then hang up, I'm sure it isn't important and then we can just sit down and figure out what to do next\" Bill hoped the quick apology would work. IF nothing else, maybe he'd get a few seconds to just pry the Stone out of her hand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria gave Bill a smug look, apparently not noticing the faint glow in her hand fading away. \"Good, now how do I make this thing stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know! Maybe just say 'answer' or something?\" Bill shrugged, the actual answer lost on him. Apparently the memories were selective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we're in the future then you should know how this works! You're the geek Bill!\" Gloria groaned before looking upwards and letting out a meek \"Umm, answer?\" The synthetic chiming immediately stopped and Gloria let out a squeak of alarm as pictures appeared in front of her eyes! And not just a picture, but it was live video as some flabby looking man that looked like a frog was smiling at her! Off to the side there was a handful of words next to icons for signal strength and volume, and Gloria spied the name 'Ronny' at the top of the short list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Who the hell is Ronny?' She thought as the man, who clearly knew her, began speaking and a voice that sounded like a dying cow filled her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey baby, did you finish talking with Bill? Is he gonna give you that raise?\" 'Ronny' said, his beady eyes glistening as much as his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm...\" Was all Gloria could think to say. Who was this ugly ass clown, and why was he calling her 'baby'? She looked over at Bill and pointed to the video in front of her, but Bill simply gave her another shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Fucking useless nerd!' Gloria mentally hissed. Could Bill not see or hear this guy talking? Was this actual science fiction crap that she was using right now? Her eyes focused on the screen that apparently only she could see and read over the additional information, her eyes nearly popping out of her head when she saw 'Husband' tacked on under the words 'Relation'. 'OMG! OMGOMGOMGOMG!' Gloria screamed as the world started to spin around her. It was too much! It was just too much! She didn't want to be old, she didn't want to be in the future, she didn't want to be Bill's secretary, she didn't want to look like her mother and she definitely did not want to be married to some frog mutant guy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby, can you hear me?\" 'Ronny's' face went from a disturbingly wide grin to a unsure frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh, I'm gonna call you back! Bye!\" Gloria said, trying to not black out as the world swam around her. But the video remainined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gloria, honey are you-\" 'Ronny' said again, a pudgy, sweaty hand reaching out towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ohgodwhatifhecanactuallytouchmethisistooweirdomg!' Gloria internally screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, bye! So long! Uh, adios! C'mon you stupid phone, hang up!\" Gloria screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby, what is-\" Ronny began but finally the screen disappeared and the grotesque man's voice went away. Gloria began to sigh in relief but the ringing began again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! NONONO! I REFUSE! BLOCK CALL!\" Gloria screeched as she bashed her palms against her head. Thankfully the chiming immediately stopped and never returned. Gloria looked up, tears filling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god Bill, he was so ugly!\" She wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" Bill asked. The boy turned patriarch had no idea what was happening, to him Gloria had simply been talking to no one. If it really was a phone...Then only Gloria could see it! Actual sci-fi technology! Bill felt the inner geek in him get excited by that, but he tried to remain focused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MY HUSBAND!\" The raven haired woman bawled as the tears came flooding out. This wasn't fair! She was supposed to marry Tom! She was supposed to be famous and rich by now, not...not stuck as Bill's secretary and married to an ugly dude! She cast a blurry look around the porch and made her way to a nearby patio chair. \"Oh god this place is so fucked up Bill! I didn't want any of this! I didn't actually think the wish would come true and ruin my life! It was supposed to ruin YOUR lives!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, thanks for the heartfelt confession\" Bill snarked back, whatever pity he felt replaced as Gloria's egotistical bitchy nature re-surfaced. \"Here, just give me the gemstone and I'll make a wish. God knows I'm angry about all of this as well\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Gloria shouted back, \"YOU'LL JUST LEAVE ME HERE AND GO BACK HOME! I'm NOT GOING TO BE STUCK AS A OLD HAG, BILL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill was about to fire back when the front door creaked open and Tammy's blond head poked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be quiet!\" She hissed, \"Gloria, just stay here and we'll figure it out later! Now hush!\"</span></div></div>",

Bobbi and I have tried to make it out in our apartment in California but we just never get it to taste like yours!\" Willow said as she, her fiancee Bobbi and Tammy stood in the Strasserman's kitchen. The lanky woman took a deep drink of the near-golden liquid in her hand as Bobbi simply took a sip, tucking a stray strand of brilliant red hair behind her right ear as Tammy simply took a seat at the kitchen table, gesturing to the empty chairs positioned around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a seat girls. Bobbi, I'd love to get to know more about you! Willow hasn't said ANYTHING to me about you!\" Tammy said, smiling. Outwardly the transformed teenager looked pleasant and non-threatening, but her eyes betrayed her inner frustration. The bulk of her new soul wanted to be outraged, that her daughter, her perfect Willow, had gone behind her back and had rushed into a relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn awkward silence followed as the two girls followed Tammy's instructions, Willow giving her mom as wary look as she and her beloved Bobbi took a seat, trying not to stare as Bobbi's bust jiggled from the movement. She was so beautiful! Willow was really lucky to have met her, she just hoped that her parents wouldn't scare off the love of her life by being over-protective. She could already see that Bobbi's nerves were starting to fray, and she reached out an arm under the table and gave Bobbi's leg a soft squeeze for confidence, which the redhead returned with a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, um, I, uh, don't really know where to start...\" Bobbi said sheepishly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you from, sweetheart? Are you from California?\" Tammy offered, coaxing the attractive girl in front of her out of her shell while Willow looked on with trepidation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh god mom please don't ruin this!' Willow thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm actually from here I just...mom and I moved when I was really little. We didn't have much money so we just went wherever she could find a job\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Mom?' Tammy wondered, 'Maybe she's Rob's daughter and not him?'. But outwardly she nodded in response, \"What about your father? Does he still live around here? Or any other family? Would I know them?\" Tammy watched as a shadow briefly passed across Bobbi's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...He's not around anymore. He died in a car crash when I was still a baby, so I never got to know him. My mom's name is Julie though, Julie Bolstrum?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy felt the blood run out of her face. \"Oh honey, I'm sorry! I didn't mean\" Tammy she said, mortified at her own insensitive question. The Strasserman matriarch reached out to pat the younger girl's hand while she racked her memories, new and old for a 'Julie Bolstrum' and pulling up nothing. Was she someone who actually existed or had Gloria's wish simply conjured more new people into existence? \"What was your fath-\" Tammy began to ask but Bobbi interrupted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay. Like I said I don't really remember him. But anyway yeah mom didn't have any other family here so she and I moved all over the place, we moved to Fort Petersburg in Florida when I was thirteen and a little after that is when mom met my stepdad Alan. Then when I was sixteen we moved with him to California. After that I finished school out there and did some modelling for a while...\" Bobbi said, quickly moving past the rough memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's actually how we met!\" Willow chimed in, \"You know during art school they'd bring in those models for life drawing? Well one day I show up for class and Bobbi was the model! Best 'F' ever!\" Willow gushed, blushing while she grabbed one of Bobbi's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I remember seeing her and thinking 'oh god that nerd is checking me out!'\" The redhead said as she visibly relaxed, \"But yeah I'd never done anything like that before, and it was freezing in that classroom and I had to be naked so the whole thing was super awkward. I said I'd never do it again but rent is stupid expensive in California so I ended up back on the university campus again flashing my boobs at a bunch of art dorks\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't expect one of them to ask you out did you?\" Willow said as the two girls descended into a self-referential loop of memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I wasn't gonna talk to the skinny chick giving me hot cocoa after I froze my tits off! And then later turns out you had messed with the room's thermostat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curses, my master plan revealed!\" Willow snickered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy just sat there, listening to what was actually quite the romantic little love story, a mixture of emotions running through her. It was clear the girls loved each other, but Tammy couldn't shake the feeling that something was still off about the busty redhead. She racked her brain, trying to recall a specific car crash but they had been so common before self driving, networked traffic had come along that it was a fool's errand. And she was hurt that her daughter had lived a full life without saying a word of this girl to her on their nightly phone calls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the conversation was interrupted when a furious, feminine screech came from the front of the house. It was clearly Gloria, and she clearly wasn't happy about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But what else is new' The Tom part of Tammy snarked, and Tammy could feel her eyes roll in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that Ms. Gloria?\" Willow asked, moving to stand up from the table, but Tammy beat her daughter to it, practically leaping out of her chair, trying not to swoon from the light headedness that swooped down upon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No honey, I'll, oooh, I'll go check on your father and Gloria. They've been a little cagey at each other lately, your father's job has been pretty demanding this quarter. Why don't you give Bobbi a tour of the house?\" Tammy gave the two girls a smile and took a few wobbly steps out of the kitchen towards the front door. Her immediate concern was another wish unleashing more chaos on this unexpected, but happy life Tammy had found herself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gloria is chaos enough\" Tammy muttered darkly as she reached the front door.Behind it she could hear Gloria whining. Another trademark of the Vanapolous girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMY HUSBAND! Oh god this place is so fucked up Bill! I didn't want any of this! I didn't actually think the wish would come true and ruin my life! It was supposed to ruin YOUR lives!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, thanks for the heartfelt confession\" Bill deeper and slightly muffled voice barked back \"Here, just give me the gemstone and I'll make a wish. God knows I'm angry about all of this as well\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy couldn't help but feel a twinge of hurt at her husband's statement. Was he not happy with how their lives had panned out? But Gloria screeched once more, her voice reaching another octave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! YOU'LL JUST LEAVE ME HERE AND GO BACK HOME! I'M NOT GOING TO BE STUCK AS A OLD HAG, BILL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh goddamnit Gloria!' Tammy sighed and pulled the door open a crack. There's was no way the girls in the kitchen (or the neighbors) hadn't heard that.  \"Be quiet!\" Tammy hissed. She noticed that Gloria was still clutching the gemstone in one hand, at some point having collapsed into one of the porch chairs, but it wasn't glowing like it had right before they'd all ended up middle-aged. Maybe it only granted one wish? Or maybe it needed something else to work?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, is everything okay?\" Tammy heard Willow ask from the kitchen. And the last thing they needed was for her daughter and Bobbi to find out about any of the events that led up to now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gloria, just stay here and we'll figure it out later! Now hush!\" Tammy hissed again before sliding the door closed once more, turning back to her daughter who was now standing in the entryway to the kitchen, a look of concern on her face. Tammy put on her best smile and hustled over to her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes honey, it's fine! Just another work argument\" Tammy bluffed, but she could see in Willow's eyes that the girl didn't believe it. The shrinking of the pupils, the loss of color in her face, rapid increase in breathing. Willow was about to have one of her panic attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounded like dad was firing Ms. Gloria! Oh mom, don't let him do that! Please not today! Or ever! Oh god it's all my fault isn't it! Dad's mad and this just made it worse I know I should have-\" Willow's voice began to waver and Tammy did the only thing she knew to do. She grabbed the lanky girl and pulled her close, stroking the curly hair of her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay honey, no one is getting fired. Dad knows how much you like Gloria, he wouldn't do that to you. It's just an argument okay? It''s all gonna be good, nothing is your fault, okay? Just breathe with me honey, in and out, iiiiinnn and ooooout...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMother and daughter stood in the entryway to the kitchen as Willow's ragged breath began to slow and normalize, a emotional sniffle coming from her as the panic left her, even if the anxiety was still just beneath the surface. She knew she should have taken her medication before pulling this off! Now Bobbi probably thought she was a loser!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women parted and Willow turned back towards the kitchen table...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The moment Willow had turned her attention from him, the moment she'd gone after Tammy, Rob knew it was his only chance for freedom. He'd pulled himself up from the table as quietly as he could (which given he had a the body of a knockout supermodel with tits the size watermelons and hips to match was no easy feat), pulled off the pair of heels he was wearing, and he'd made a barefoot beeline for the only other exit from the kitchen: The basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob opened the basement door as quietly as he could and bit his plump lower lip in pain as he squeezed his giant new assets through the aperture, wincing at the sensitivity of his nipples as they pressed against the fabric of the low cut green dress and the hard door. But then he was through, and he slid the door closed behind him, the light from the kitchen fading away to a faint darkness as LED lights lit up each step of a staircase leading down into the NEW Strasserman basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe irony wasn't lost on the bully turned bombshell. His morning had started in the basement of the OLD Strasserman house, there on orders from Jonathan Ingerman to wait until Bill's family was out of the house and then burn the entire place down as 'revenge', but Rob knew it was just a trap to get Big Jon's only competition out of the way permanently. And Rob had complied, as Big Jon expected of his 'loyal' lackey, the cowed, tamed beast of Shermer. But Rob was smarter than most people gave him credit for; The big man hadn't just kept control over a gang of bullies simply out of brute force, or had gotten away with the no small amount of petty thievery over the years. Rob was smarter than most people gave him credit for, and he wasn't going to waltz right into the trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Rob had waited until Shitterman's parents had left, creeping upstairs to get Bill alone and propose some kind of alliance to take Big Jon down for good...Only to see the little nerd and that failure Tom Ackteron arguing with the hot but bitchy Gloria Vanapolous across the street! Gloria had been holding some kind of rock and the three of them were fighting over it... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was that flash of light and suddenly he was a woman! A incredibly hot woman! Sitting in a car that looked like it was out of some sci fi flick! He'd had just enough time to look himself over and mutter a obscenity before the girl, Willow, round the corner. Then it was like he'd been thrown in some kind of twisted prison, nothing more than a passenger in his own mind as this 'Bobbi' acted like a little demure doe in the headlights, allowing the shorter girl to pull her up the stairs and submit her to a humiliating meet and greet with her 'parents'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, you've got to be fucking kidding me with this bullshit!' Rob had groaned to no one but himself when he'd seen just who those parents were. The old man was clearly Bill Strasserman and the Meryl Streep knockoff in the business suit was Gloria Vanapolous (given she looked almost identical to her mother). The little blonde he had trouble placing until he realized it was Tom Ackerton, the sports star acting like some perfect little housewife. And he was getting engaged to their crotch goblin! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what was with that sob story at the table?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Fucking embarassing' Rob muttered in his new breathy voice as he descended the stairs, praying to whatever deity that was clearly messing with him to not let the wood structure squeak. But the bully turned bombshell reached the concrete floor of the basement without incident and blinked into the darkness with eyelashes that were so long they were slowly driving him crazy. Unlike the original Strasserman basement, this one was fairly generic. Before Bill's new house has a full carpet floor, a bathroom plus the whole area that Bill had claimed as his own, filled with Marvel and Star Wars and other geek shit. This basement just had a handful of shelves filled with what looked like junk and some old furniture...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Bingo!' Rob thought as he spied another door. Faint light spilled in from a gap in the heavy curtains, obviously leading outside. Above him he heard the sounds of whatever was happening to Willow begin to subside and just to be on the safe side of...whatever, he cupped two tiny hands over his earring bejeweled ears and made his way as fast as he could through the dark confines of the basement, stubbing a painted toe once on some un-seen object and fighting back the instinctive urge to swear at the top of his lungs. But then he was at the door, quickly flipping the two locks open and turning the knob, the door swinging wide to reveal the Strasserman's backyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove him he could hear Willow's voice calling out to him. Or rather, to Bobbi and he quickly covered his ears once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shitshitshit!\" He whispered, his green eyes wide, afraid that this new body he was in would come like a dog and he'd be trapped as Bobbi for who knew how long again. But as he heard the muffled sound of Willow and then Tammy calling out to him...nothing happened. Or well, nothing save for a nagging feeling, more of an itch, for him to march back up those stairs and into the arms of her Willow. Maybe it was visual contact? Willow WAS pretty easy on the eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck that!\" Rob snarled, giving his pretty new head a hard smack, turning his attention back to escaping. The backyard of Bill and Tammy's new house was wide and long, typical of the more wealthy area of Shermer and definitely larger than Bill's old backyard had been. And instead of a fence there was a row of hedges that were as tall as Rob used to be. Now they simply towered over his much smaller, prettier frame. Rob poked his long-haired head out of the doorway and angrily held the waterfall of red locks off to the side as he looked side to side, finally spying a path that led back up to the ground level of the large house, possibly to the front yard or a garage or something.  He chanced a glance upwards, noting the that there were more than a few windows. And if Shitterman and Titsapolous were still on the front porch...All in all, there was a high chance that he could be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't ideal, but if worse came to worse Rob could just go through the bushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Bolstrum, here you go...\" Rob said as he readied himself for the escape of his lifetime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Then what are you gonna do Robbie? You'll still be a chick! And still stuck...Wherever the hell you are!' A condescending voice in his head said. And it was right. Everything had come from Vanapolous and that weird rock she was holding! Maybe she was still on the front porch...If he could surprise her, maybe grab the gemstone and make a wish to be back to normal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob glanced at his hairless arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...But overpowering Gloria, and definitely Bill was out of the question. The girl he'd been transformed into clearly only had enough muscle tone to help with her looks, she was no fighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if Rob got caught, he'd end up trapped in his own body again. And who knew if him getting away was just a fluke of whatever had changed everything or not! Or maybe if he played the part...Maybe he'd have a better opportunity to get away? One with less risk?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, the sound of the basement door opening forced him to take action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Rob makes a break for it. Deciding on the riskier course of action, Rob bolts out of the basement and attempts to wrestle the Ahn'Ger Stone from Gloria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Rob allows himself to be 'captured' and fall back into the role of 'Bobbi Bolstrum', spending the day trapped in her body. But that night after everyone falls asleep...</span></div></div>",

Sweetheart, it's OK to come back upstairs now!\u201d said an older but sugary soprano voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrickets. Rob wasn't saying a damn thing. He listened stealthily as the two voices seemed defeated for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute, Willow. I forgot, your father and I put cameras in the basement since you moved away!\u201d squealed the older voice.  \u201cLet me pull up the footage on my iPhone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod Mom, you still have one of those old retro tech things?\u201d giggled the younger voice. \u201cWhat's next, are you going to do math with a slide rule? If I start up the fireplace, are you and Dad going to start hooting and hollering like a couple of cavepeople?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSays the kid who has a vinyl record and VHS collection. God, even I didn't have VHS when I was your age.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I just love the old Disney clam shell cases, OK?  And those tape are worth a lot of money nowadays, for your information!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne man's trash...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, you've got like a dozen different feeds on that thing. Why do you even have all these cameras, anyway? Are you and Dad filming a reality show down here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it's where we have our kinky sex livesteams.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, honey, but you walked right into that one. It's just security. You know how paranoid your father gets about home invaders.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Heh, not paranoid enough</i> thought Rob as he eavesdropped on their banal little conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLe sigh. I get enough of big brother out in California. Just last week, we had some pervy drone that was spying on us just outside our bedroom window. Bobbi shot it down with a sling shot of all things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh. And you call us cavemen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Cavepeople</i>, and you are! Why aren't you using the noosphere instead of that old thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, to be honest, the noosphere kind of freaks me out. I don't like the idea of being connected to a giant hive mind that can read my thoughts and always knows what I'm doing. Call me old fashioned if you want, but I prefer a little privacy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFair enough, and it figures. Wasn't Dad part of Anonymous back in the day? I guess he rubbed off on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe rubbed off on me all right. It's why you were born.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGross, Mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least I won't get turned into a battery someday, if I can help it\u201d chuckled the older voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretentious much? All your generation did was share memes about cats and troll people into committing suicide while you let all sorts of horrible things happen around you. My generation fixed the polar ice caps and stopped climate change. So nyah nyah to you old fogies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith help from aliens! A deus ex machina!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt still counts!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo it doesn't, but I love ya anyway. And, little whippersnapper, it turns out \u201cretro\u201d tech isn't so useless after all. Look at the feed of camera six. There's your Bobbi standing right behind the cellar door...which she opened. Oh no, I think she's trying to ditch us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you serious? Lemme see that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy lemonade wasn't <i>that</i> bad, was it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Mom, your lemonade is like liquid crack. It's definitely not that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what is it then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I had to guess, she must have been scared by all the yelling on the porch. She's very sensitive. Bobbi!\u201d yelled Willow. \u201cYou don't have to hide anymore! Come back upstairs and I'll show you my old room!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrickets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease answer me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy suddenly let go of Willow's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what? Meeting the in laws is never fun. I think I should go down to talk to her myself. Get to have a little one on one time with your fiancee so she can learn to trust me. Just go upstairs and watch some TV, hun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow re-clasped her hand into her mother's gentle but firm grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. Lets go together. After all, we're all going to be one big happy family soon, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe part of Tammy that used to be Tom, the one who went to bed exhausted because she had felt so alone, suddenly found her tank of gas being filled up again. Despite all of the bickering and the backtalk from her daughter, and the weirdness of having an entire lifetime's worth of memories and emotions &amp; opinions associated with those memories dumped into her head, this was the first time she felt happy. Here, she wasn't being treated like a piece of shit, much less being gaslit into believing that she deserved it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I ever say how much I love you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike a hundred times every single day. I love you too, Mom. It's wonderful being back home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit!\u201d whispered the bully turned beauty as he saw two female shadows hug one another and then amble their way down the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe need for Rob to answer Willow and let his \u201cfiancee\u201d know where he was had grown more intense than it had been a minute ago. A minute ago it had been a casual itch, like wanting a taco at three in the morning. Now, without the safety of floorboards, insulation, and distance to protect him, it took Rob a moderate amount of stubbornness to resist this strange new compulsion. An invasive part of his brain, the mental virus known as Bobbi, was urging him to run into Willow's arms because she was weak and insecure and needed her strong and confident girlfriend to protect her. To Rob, this was enough proof that the farther away he was from Bill and Tammy's vagina turd, the more freedom he had.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he ever wanted to escape from this weird gender bending future-drama horseshit, he had to get that kryptonite looking rock and wish things back to normal. There was only one way that he knew how to do that, the only way that a meathead like him knew how to do anything: the direct approach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat old hag Titsapoulous is probably stronger than me now, but fuck it, I'll take my chances\u201d muttered the bully turned model as looked toward the open cellar door and ran out into the sunlight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOww oww oww!\u201d he yelped daintily as Bobbi's tender bare feet stepped on a series of pebbles laying around in the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bill could clearly see that he wasn't getting anywhere with Gloria, who was all curled in the corner of his porch silently freaking out about her husband, whoever <i>that</i> was supposed to be. Honestly, he would prefer it to be a mystery best left unsolved. What was important was that he had to calm Gloria down, and then think of a way to persuade her into handing the magic gemstone over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen turned middle aged businessman knew that it wasn't going to be easy. Gloria, while not as academically inclined or clever as himself, was far from stupid. He couldn't trick her into letting go of the magic bauble as easily as he could with Big Jon or Rob Bolstrum, who both had exploitable tempers. She didn't have any psychological weaknesses he could take advantage of. Her personality was intractable and stubborn, so negotiating with her or making attractive sounding rationalizations were out. He had no choice but to sweet talk Tom's ex girlfriend. Get on her good side. Flatter her ego. The problem is that he absolutely hated Gloria's guts, and the real question for Bill wasn't whether Gloria was prepared to swallow her pride for once and do the right thing, the question was: is <i>he</i>?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thought, comparing his bizarre situation to Marty McFly in Back To The Future Part II popped came up randomly, which made Bill chuckle. But he was distracting himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>OK, lets get down to brass tacks...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bill was pensively attempting to figure out an angle, a car pulled up in front of the Strasserman home, heralded by the sound of a sputtering engine being turned off. A slamming of a door was heard behind the thick wall of hedgerow surround the entrance, followed by the sound of a wheezing out of shape man struggling to open the front gate. The bearded nerd turned away from Gloria to face the new disturbance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh boy, what now?\u201d he whispered to himself with no small amount of dread. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGloria! Gloria, honey! Are you OK?!\u201d croaked out an enigmatic gray skinned frog like creature as he stumbled gracelessly across Bill and Tammy's front lawn and towards their porch. On any other day but today, he would have been the oddest sight any of the kids had ever seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the strange man got close, Bill commanded him to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, that's about far enough!\u201d Bill yelled. His older, heavier voice sounded authoritative in a way that it hadn't sounded as an eighteen year old, even more so than his own father sounded, and the strange man instantly stopped dead in his tracks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took him a second to catch his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name's Ronny Vanapoulous, I'm Gloria's husband. We, uh, we've actually met several times before, Mr. Strasserman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill paused as \u201cold\u201d memories began to form in his mind. In them, he recalled Gloria being married in this future timeline, although from what he could tell her spouse looked normal and even handsome in them. Nothing at all like this weird ambiguously human creature. Then he recalled who Ronny really was and visibly blanched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes, that's right. Gloria's husband. I remember us having dinner together. We also went golfing that one time, and you almost killed a caddy with your terrible swing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonny gave a small, self deprecating laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's right, sir. Tell Karen I'm sorry again, it was my first time out on a professional course and I got nervous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh...sure. I'll do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd tell your lovely wife that I said hi too. Anyway, I'm just looking for Gloria. She told me earlier this morning that she was taking a swing, excuse the pun, she said that she was stopping by your home because...well, it's none of my business why! The point is, she told me that she'd be here. I promised Gloria that I'd call her when she was finished doing what she was doing. When I did, she began acting <i>very</i> strange, like she had never even seen me before and then hung up in a panic. I called her up a second time, and found out that she blocked my number. You wouldn't happen to know anything about as to why, would you, Bill?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill hesitated as he struggled for what he should say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, actually, Gloria's right here. Gloria, why don't you...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen turned grown man turned his gaze over to where Gloria had been having her little panic attack and discovered that she had vanished!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously, Bill turned back to Ronny and chuckled nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, she WAS here just a second ago...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gloria silently thanked God that Bill had been distracted <i>just</i> long enough for her to sneak past him into the house. She blew an exasperated sigh of relief as she closed and locked the Strasserman's front door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was madness! Not only had the cursed gemstone she was holding tightly in her hand forced her to sacrifice her youth, her body, her dream life, and her self respect, but the future Gloria Vanapoulous was apparently married to an alien! A goddamned alien! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the 2040s, when the Earth's climate had reached a point of irreversible catastrophe, literal fucking Martians had made first contact with humanity, where they revealed themselves to have been watching over us for generations, only deciding to intervene when we were on the razor's edge of killing ourselves. Apparently, Earthlings were on the same track the Venusians had been before perishing eons ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer husband Ronny, real name unpronounceable to humans, was one of these aliens. Gloria wanted to vomit at the thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't care how powerful it was, the second that she returned back her normal, beautiful eighteen year old self and her <i>real</i> life(As opposed to the artificial life that she was currently trapped in), she was smashing the damned stone in her hand into little tiny pieces with a fucking jackhammer if she had to. But first, she needed a safe space, a place where she could calm down for just one lousy second! Then she'd make her escape from this future hell.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheerleader turned secretary's graying hair whipped back and forth as she searched frantically for a safe space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink! Think, bitch, think!\u201d she muttered to herself as she impatiently tapped at her temples in a vain attempt at inspiration, but no ideas came to her. So instead, she wandered in search of a good hiding spot, hoping to possibly jog her addled brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria silently seethed with envy as she stalked through each room of the Strasserman home, realizing just now how well off Bill and Tammy actually were and how much her initial wish had backfired on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis place is lit as fuck!\u201d she moaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Strasserman's living room was spacious, immaculate, and beautiful, like something you might see in a TV show about rich people.  So was the kitchen and the dining room. There was a state of the art game room that Gloria vaguely recalled Willow spending a lot of time in when she was made to babysit the girl. A guest bedroom on the first floor was large enough to have an expensive looking piano and a minibar inside of it. There was a locked off room connected to the garage that Gloria couldn't get into, but her memories told her was a workshop where the older Bill tinkered on different projects whenever he had free time. She recalled that the future version of Tammy's husband fancied himself something of an inventor, the nerdiness in him never having faded away. Gloria rolled her eyes at the entrance with its pretentious biometric locks and wandered around some more until she heard someone opening the front door in the foyer, prompting her to sneak upstairs in a hurry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, Gloria settled on doing the deed in Willow's bedroom. Not for any particular strategic reason, but she felt uncomfortable being inside the master bedroom where Bill and Tammy had very likely had sex at some point, shivering at the thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously, she stepped inside the bright and cheery childhood abode of a person who thought of Gloria like an aunt, virtually untouched since she had left for college. Wordlessly, she sat on her bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria was simply mad at the irony of it all, the reversal of fortune. In the real world of 2018, <i>she</i> was the one everyone was jealous of. In Shermer High, she was the queen whose ring you had to kiss. She was popular beyond compare, good looking, with the surface level charm, Machiavellian wit to know how to manipulate <i>almost</i> everyone to her benefit, and not to mention doing pretty damn well for herself. With the obvious exception of Jonathan Ingerman who existed on another strata of wealth, not to mention in an entirely different social scene than her, she was probably the richest kid in school. Bill and Tom's families weren't hurting by any means, but it was only Gloria who could afford to have the nicest clothes, the nicest car, the latest smart phone, etc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing at the top of the rat race had always been something she had prided herself on. Come to think of it, so did her parents, which is where she must have gotten her behaviors from. She could only imagine what her mother Ariadne would think of this home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, now the haughty Gloria was the glorified servant of someone that she had once thought of as her inferior, and it sucked. It really, really fucking sucked to be humbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was more than that. She could live with Bill's grass being greener than hers. It was Tom being content for once in his life that really bugged her. Frankly, it pissed her off seeing how well Tom was doing when not trapped underneath her thumb, cowed by her bitchy...domineering...Type A personality. The fact that he was happy here, that he would rather be in a relationship with Bill stuck as a pint sized housewife with an ass you could sit a soda can on as opposed to the chiseled Adonis that he had been this morning and in a relationship with her was just...it was unfathomable to her bloated ego. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been holding in a good, long rage against the heavens for about an hour now. The gemstone in her hand was glowing emerald fire and primed for its next wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**</span></div></div>",

He'd love to <i>fuck</i> the woman who looked like this, a woman who put Scarlett Johansson to shame, but <i>being</i> her? That was no picnic. Besides the restricted movement caused as a result of Bobbi's exaggerated hourglass figure, his dogs were barking, the double dee boobs were absolutely killing his back, and his clothes were so goddamned tight! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob did feel a little bad about his hypocrisy deep down, <b>really</b> deep down. He'd never want to dress in clothing this constricting again, not even if it was a fucking wetsuit or whatever scuba divers wear, but he wouldn't exactly say no to a girl, a real girl, who had a killer body and wanted to show it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, the former giant was optimistic about his situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this inner turmoil meant that good old Rob Bolstrum, white trash thug who was barely graduating high school this semester and definitely not bound for college, was still in the driver's seat of this body, not the unwanted invisible passenger he had along with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't hearing those nagging thoughts in his head anymore. The ones from Bobbi's subconscious that told him that Willow needed her, that Willow was her little sugar bear wifey to be, that she actually gave a shit about Willow's stupid drawings or her faggoty animation career, what kind of wedding dress she was planning to wear a year from now, and all that mushy girly romantic bullshit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell was that rock the nerds were fighting over, anyway? Was it actually a wishing rock like in <i>Aladdin</i>? A part of Rob was still skeptical. Magic was for babies and fantasy loving pussies. Which admittedly fit Bill Strasserman perfectly, but still. Here he was forty years in the future, staring at the camel toe that poked through Bobbi's white pants. What else could that green hunk of junk be but a magic lamp? He couldn't wait to get his hands on it. Not just to escape this body, but to punish Big Jon for what he did to him. He would, to borrow a famous phrase, get medieval on Jon's ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly,the hardest part of all this was playing the waiting game. He had spent all morning waiting, and his bully mindset wasn't built for that. He was built for <i>acting</i>, and <i>re</i>acting when necessary. Again, he had to remind himself that the girl he was stuck as was weak and dainty, and could probably only fight off an eight year old with Down's Syndrome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he waited, as silent and patient as a predator on the savanna. All he could do was watch and reflect on his situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Rob made good his escape from the basement, the bully turned knockout had sneaked around the perimeter of Bill's new house as quiet as a ghost until he found a decent blind spot, a place where he could observe Bill and the girls while remaining unnoticed. He was hoping that while Tammy and her brat were distracted in the the backyard, Bill at some point would walk inside his quasi palatial estate for a minute. Maybe to take a piss because old guys peed a lot, right? Or maybe to calm down his curly haired geekette that had once been cum inside his nutsack. Or maybe to have a quickie with the naggy wife that Tom Ackerton had turned into. The wife who likely kept Bill on a leash like the pussywhipped cuck Rob imagined that he had grown up to be. It didn't matter what the excuse was, just that Bill left. While the Addams Family were occupied, then Rob could ambush the aged Gloria when she was alone and vulnerable on the porch. He would bum rush her with the small amount of strength that Bobbi had, and Gloria would almost immediately fold under the pressure like the weak bimbo that Rob always knew that she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, that was the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNope. No such luck. Man plans, God laughs. The creature from the black lagoon had decided to stop by out of the blue, and the second Bill was distracted by the ugliness of it, the wily old broad that had once been the hottie of Shermer High stealthily crept past the dweeb's turned back and straight into the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell was Rob going to do now? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**</span></div></div>",

My worst nightmare has come true\u201d said Willow tonelessly, defeatedly, none of her trademark ebullience apparent in her voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMother and daughter had searched the entire backyard and discovered no evidence of Willow's fiancee. No footprints, no telltale clumps of dirt or displaced hedges. It was as if the gorgeous redhead had vanished into vapor as quickly as she had arrived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't worry monkey, I'm sure Bobbi still loves you\u201d consoled Tammy, once again hugging her daughter tightly and stroking her hair, a tried and true tonic that her older memories recalled having done hundreds if not thousands of times over the years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut why?\u201d sniffed Willow as she wiped a trail of casual tears from her face. \u201cWhy would she run away? Things were going so well! We...w-we were going to get married. We, w-we had a date set and everything, and for the honeymoon I-I was going to take her to that cool underwater hotel they built near Calabasas. It was going to be a surprise. I had enough money stashed away and everything!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMonkey, don't beat yourself up. You said it yourself that she's sensitive. It didn't exactly take Sherlock Holmes to see how jittery Bobbi was when meeting your father and I. Maybe she's just exploring the neighborhood until she calms down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Maybe?\u201d squeaked out sad Willow. \u201cShe does like to take lots of long walks, especially when I'm in one of my crabby moods.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee!? There you go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut she would have called or texted me by now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy hated that she couldn't answer her daughter honestly. The jock turned diminutive blonde worried that her husband's suspicions might be right, that somehow that nervous little girl Willow was over the moon for was really Rob Bolstrum, their high school bully transformed just as they had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hypotheses ran through her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more positive scenario was that if Bobbi really was Rob, he had no idea what was going on. He panicked at being altered against his will and ran away in terror/confusion at his first opportunity. Bullies were ultimately cowards, right? It would undoubtedly be deleterious to Willow to lose the love of her life, especially on the verge of getting married, but Tammy knew that her daughter had been in shitty relationships in the past and would learn to deal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other, more disconcerting option for Tammy was that Rob had a double set of memories just as she and Bill did, and in his vindictiveness at being transformed was deliberately fucking with their daughter by agitating her into having a panic attack. Only someone like Rob was cruel enough to break the heart of an innocent soul just to spite her parents. Or maybe he had some other plan in mind to ruin her and Bill's new lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought made the mama bear side of Tammy white hot with anger, a side that she showed almost no one except her Bill. Elaborate thoughts of revenge crisscrossed her bifurcated mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If Rob hurts either one of them, I'm going to chop his fingers off and make him eat them.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy didn't play when it came to protecting her family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGradually, anger gave way to the absurdity of all of this, over how drastically her life had been turned upside down in a short couple of hours, to be forty years older in the future in wedded bliss to her best friend who was now her soulmate. It was actually a perfect plot line for one of the cartoons that Willow storyboarded. Who else was going to show up into her life next, Vanessa Chandler?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpontaneously, the teen turned middle aged mom let go of Willow and burst into a fit of giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, why are you laughing?\u201d asked Willow in a perplexed tone of voice, and after a few more hiccups of mirth, Tammy caught her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Tammy could answer, the two Strasserman women heard a blood curdling scream coming from Willow's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**</span></div></div>",

Maybe Tammy can fix you some of her lemonade. You drink lemonade, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course! Lemonade is like drinking the blood of Issus herself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, if you say so. My wife will like hearing that endorsement.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill's plans for returning home were being delayed yet again by outside factors beyond his control, but what could he do? His memories told him that Ronny was a good dude, literally just an Average Joe who happened to look like a frog man, at least when cloaking technology couldn't make him pass for a human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis good conscious couldn't allow him turn the man away. Still, if just one more thing interrupted Bill's day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment he opened the front door to let Ronny inside, the young man turned middle aged man saw Willow's fiancee Bobbi sprint around the corner of his house with lightning speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d he asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi there! My name's Ron...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPiss off freak!\u201d Bobbi yelled cruelly, pushing Ronny to the ground with a loud thud before running up the stairs past Bill and into his living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank God that Shitterman still sucks\u201d wheezed Rob as he raced through a swanky if somewhat old fashioned living room. He had gambled on the hunch that despite Bill being a fully grown man now that he was still a clumsy, uncoordinated nerd at heart, and that gamble had paid off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Guess I'm not as dumb as everyone thinks.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother hunch of Rob's was that when Gloria had gone inside that she ran upstairs, away from Shitterman and the small fry that Ackertard had turned himself into. Titsapoulous was obviously not happy being an old lady now, just like he wasn't happy being a chick, so she probably wanted to be as far away from the sickening sweethearts as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that he blamed her one bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Rob had landed the second flight of stairs, he searched around room by room, his long hair swinging wildly, his large breasts hurting from the lack of a support bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when the bully turned bombshell got his next lucky break, or so he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he saw the emerald light emanating from the farthest room on the left hand side, Rob knew that he had finally found his mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime to end this bullshit\u201d he whispered, desperately trying to sound intimidating with Bobbi's angelic voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria stared in awe at the magical bauble she had in her withered, wrinkled hand. She was plenty angry already, but wanted to word things just right so she <i>never</i> ended up in a place like this again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf things went right, she would momentarily be back to her old self, with Tom back in her loving arms, ready for their return as Shermer High's power couple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the aged queen bee could make her wish, she saw Bobbi Bolstrum rush in through the door and felt the girl grab her throat. Gloria made a blood curdling scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Gloria and Rob/Bobbi fight viciously over the stone. During the struggle, Gloria makes a desperate wish to return back to 2018. The wish is successful.

Hated that her dreams of being rich and powerful and beautiful all amounted to nothing. Her boyfriend was now some dotting housewife, she looked like her mom, she had no power, and as best as her new memories could surmise she and the...the alien that she'd somehow wound up marrying were simply middle class nobodies, not even as well off as she'd been before making the first wish! But now she could change all of it, she could get her happy ending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I've got to do is go home\" Gloria thought as she closed her fist tightly around the gemstone and held it in the air. She closed her eyes, took a deep breath and fought the urge to simply wish something vindictive on the Strasserman family here in the future. She had to get back to 2018. She had to stop herself from making the original wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as soon as the words \"I wish\" left Gloria's mouth, there was a high pitched, blood curdling scream from behind her that caused Gloria's eyes to snap open as a large blur of green, red and flailing breasts smacked into her. Gloria's knees flared with pain as they buckled beneath her from the sudden assault, her legs no longer fit and toned like they had been in her teenage years and with a cry of pain Gloria collapsed to the carpeted floor of Willow Strasserman's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GIVE IT TO ME YOU FUCKING BITCH!\" Rob screeched in his new voice as he scrambled on top of Gloria's body, the older woman groaning in pain from his tackle. He spread his slender new legs and planted his ample rear on the center of Gloria's back, pressing down on the graying hairs of the secretary's head with his massive new tits, using the few advantages of his current body to make up for his new lack of strength. He dug his long fingernails into Gloria's closed fist, leaving long bloody scratches in the wrinkled flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ROB, STOP!\" He heard the booming voice of Bill Strasserman say from somewhere outside the room, and that just made the bully turned bombshell fight even harder. If Bill got there he'd just pick his new body up like it was nothing more than a fucking Barbie doll! And the sound of Bill's voice seemed to have an effect on Gloria as well, as the old woman suddenly surged with newfound energy beneath his voluptous form, actually starting to RISE off the floor even with Rob sitting on her! Rob swung his legs around Gloria's abdomen and squeezed as the former cheerleader used Willow's nearby bed as leverage, hoisting herself upwards despite the full grown woman on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GOD-FUCKING-DAMNIT!\" Rob screeched again, angry that his new body was so weak he couldn't even beat an old woman in a fight. He tucked a slender arm around Gloria's neck and squeezed as he fought against being bucked off, Gloria rasping beneath him her oxygen source was cut off, but the old broad was still fighting...And winning! Rob felt Gloria's free hand dig into the soft skin of his forearm and begin to pull it away, Rob's pretty green eyes going wide with fear as he began to lose the fight, and he did the only thing he could think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY, GET OFF MY WIFE!\" Came another male voice from somewhere close behind Rob. He was running out of time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaring his perfectly white and sparkling teeth, he lunged towards Gloria's exposed right ear, his teeth digging into the cartilage protrusion as Gloria let out one final pain-filled scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I WISH I WAS BACK IN 2018 SO I COULD STOP MYSELF FROM MAKING THAT WISH!\" Gloria screeched, and Rob's eyes bulged out of his head as the world was filled with a verdant light...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then they were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill groaned as he smacked into Willow's bed, his momentum carrying him forward as the bright after-image blinded him. He toppled over onto the soft mattress that smelled like his daughter and lay there for a moment. He'd been so close! If he'd had just a couple more seconds he would have been able to reach Rob and pry him off of Gloria! But even with his more powerful body he was still human, and age had simply slowed him down just enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where...What happened?\" Ronny croaked from the doorway as the alien's natural Amphibian form swam back into focus for Bill. The alien was rubbing his own bulging, off-center eyes with a clammy partially webbed hand. Meanwhile Bill could hear the sounds of the rest of his family ascending the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BILL! HONEY! ARE YOU ALL RIGHT!?\" Tammy said as she pushed her short, slightly tubby body as fast as it could up the stairs, huffing with effort as Willow tromped up behind her. An idle thought crossed Tammy's mind as she cursed her decision to not buy a gravity lift to replace the staircase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No no, you WANTED the exercise!' She huffed to herself as the upper landing came into view. For the first time since becoming Tammy, she regretted not having Tom's athleticism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, mom what's happening!?\" Willow squeaked behind her and as Tammy pulled herself off the stairs and leaned against the upper hallway wall, the boy turned housewife simply didn't have an answer, despite ALWAYS having some kind of an answer for her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know h-honey\" Tammy said as she regained her composure, giving her beautiful daughter a smile she hoped was re-assuring and placing a slightly sweaty palm on Willow's cheek. \"I-I'm sure your father's gotten to the bottom of it though\". Tammy looked down the hall as Bill staggered out of Willow's bedroom, rudely pushing a still dazed looking Ronny to the side. She expected her knight in shining armor to have that re-assuring look of triumph on his face...But then Bill slowly shook his head, his mustached face wide-eyed and pale. Tammy's blood turned to ice water as she realized what had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Oh god. OH MY GOD!\" Tammy cried out in terror before promptly fainting in the trembling arms of her daughter.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All Gloria knew was pain. She had been about to make her wish when suddenly she had been attacked! Tackled to the floor with someone that was both heavy yet soft screaming at her. It had taken every last once of strength that Gloria had in her withered body to keep from lashing out with a wish, to keep her fist closed despite the fact it felt like it was being stabbed and sliced with a entire cupboard full of knives. But her outrage at what had happened to her life, the fact that the stranger was trying to take the wishing stone away from her, had given her enough adrenaline to fight back...And to everyone's surprise, actually start winning! But then her attack had started strangling her, and even bit her, and Gloria felt her legs start to buckle again, her decrepit body threatening to collapse back to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had wanted to wish her attacker away, to wish something terrible upon them, transform them into something that wouldn't hurt her...But Gloria resisted the urge to waste the wish. Even half-blinded by pain she knew the only way out was to go back in time. Back to when she was young. She could stop all of it if she stopped herself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I WISH I WAS BACK IN 2018 SO I COULD STOP MYSELF FROM MAKING THAT WISH!\" Gloria had screamed as her legs buckled beneath er, and despite her eyes clenched shut in pain, the green-gold light was still as bright as staring into the sun. She felt a surge of victory, she was going to be young again! She could fix that horrible nightmare of a future from ever happening!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite expecting to hit the carpeted floor of Willow's bedroom, instead the ground simply vanished beneath her and the sound of rushing wind caused her eyes to snap open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck!\" Gloria gasped as a large branch and a row of blurry green bushes rose up to meet her. And then there was more pain, the sound of twigs and branches breaking as Gloria felt something heavy roll of her back and her clothing rip in several places. She felt her gemstone hand bash painfully against the hard bark of a tree. And then there was silence and stillness. And pain. There was a lot of pain as Gloria's entire body throbbed and she could taste blood in her mouth pouring in from a split lip. She tried to move, to rise up out of the wet grass she now found herself laying in, but that only caused more pain. So instead she opted to simply lay there for a moment and collect herself, staring upwards at the partly cloudy sky that she definitely recognized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it!\" She croaked, turning her head and spitting out a stream of syrupy blood onto the grass, \"I'm back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed she was. It happened a bit differently than Gloria had been expecting, but she recognized that sky, and the house that rose up above the bushes she found herself surround by. That was Bill's house! His OLD house! The wishing stone must have dropped her in Bill's backyard! She was back in 2018! And just as soon as her body stopped feeling like she was dying she'd get up and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nearby cough disrupted her train of thought, her head snapping painfully towards the sound and her eyes widening as she saw who had made the sound. There, laying next to Gloria in the bushes, was the incredibly attractive form of Bobbi Bolstrum, her breasts attempting to smother the pretty girl as she lay in a crumpled ball of broken branches, leaves and a bright green dress that was now in tatters. Small streaks of blood crisscrossed the woman's legs and arms from her own impact into the foliage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was her! That girl that Willow was engaged to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bobbi?\" Gloria croaked out as she pushed herself up into a sitting position, wincing in pain but fairly sure that, save for a few cuts and what would certainly be bruises later, she hadn't actually broken anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not my fucking name!\" The girl in front of her growled. Or at least purred, given how airy and soft it was. The breast-heavy redhead flipped herself over off of her stomach and onto her large rear, nearly flopping over again as her massive tits threw her off balance. \"Call me that again and I swear I'll rip your fucking throat out!\" The girl hissed as she flailed about, her hands planting themselves firmly on the ground behind her to stabilize the human form of a tectonic shift as her breasts finally stopped moving. The wide green eyes fixed Gloria with a look of hatred that she swore looked familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then who are you then!?\" Gloria groaned as she pulled herself to her feet, brushing the collected twigs and leaves off her business suit as...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH GOD I'M STILL OLD!\" Gloria gasped as she realized her body hadn't changed back to it's youthful form. She had expected the wish to just rewind time, that's what she had wanted, what she had planned on doing but then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fucking bitch! You made me mess up my wish!\" Gloria said, pointing a bony finger towards Bobbi's sitting form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to get that fucking rock somehow, Titsapolous! Not like you were gonna fucking share it! You were gonna fucking leave me there weren't you!? YOU WERE GONNA LEAVE ME LIKE THIS!\" Rob screamed back as he pulled himself to his feet, the tattered remnants of his dress tearing more and slipping off one of his massive boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...Rob!?\" Gloria stumbled backwards at the small but stacked beauty in front of her. Admittingly she may have been a bit slow on the realization that the girl in front of her had shared the same last name as 2018 Shermer's disgraced bully, but then again she'd been having a low key freak out over, well, everything that had happened to her in the future. But there was only ONE person that called her Titsapoloous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, I'm the fucking Tit Fairy. Give me the rock before I have to kick your ass again!\" Rob said as he took a stick forward, wincing at the sharp sticks that were poking the soft skin on the bottom of her tiny feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you! I wouldn't give this rock to you even if my life depended on it!\" Gloria spat as she took another step backwards, nearly tripping over one of the exposed roots of the tree they had found themselves under. Rob shouldn't have even been here! Gloria had specifically wished for HER and HER alone to be back in 2018, so what had happened!? Gloria looked at her closed fist and expected it to be glowing with anger and frustration, but there was no light coming from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe...Maybe when she bit me it changed something?' Gloria, even after experiencing the future, was still entirely unprepared for creative thinking. At least when it came to not trying to creatively tear down a rival or some innocent that she had deemed unworthy. 'Maybe if a part of me was...in her, it made us count as one?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria felt a headache coming on and she wasn't entirely convinced it was the fierce physical beating she had just taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that can be arranged\" Rob growled again as he took a deceptively menacing step towards Gloria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was when they both heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY BILL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Gloria's voice ringing out over the otherwise quiet neighborhood, but not the old, mature voice that Gloria was surprisingly (and worryingly) becoming used to. Instead of was the youthful voice of Gloria as she had been. The Gloria that Gloria should have been returned to being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit!\" Gloria hissed, pushing Rob's top-heavy form away as the bully advanced on her. Gloria's hand pushed deep into Rob's exposed, pillow soft breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WooOOAaah!\" Rob squealed in alarm as the much stronger older woman simply stopped his advance. He waved his muscle-less arms around in wide circles as he took a couple of un-even steps backwards, struggling to keep his balance. \"Fucking Christ I HATE THIS BODY!\" Rob pouted as he finally succeeded in not collapsing back on his big booty. But Gloria wasn't listening, instead the gray-haired girl turned woman was staring intently towards the back of the Strasserman house, which Rob was only now recognizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" He whispered to himself as he suddenly realized where they both were. He pushed himself out of the bushes and joined Gloria by the tree, staring at the back of Bill's old house. But where Gloria was fixated on the strip of lawn that led to the front of the vintage Strasserman abode, Rob's eyes were locked on the small windows that lay near the ground, visible between the rose bushes that lined the base of the two story home. Namely, his large, green eyes were focused on the one that was ajar. The one he'd used in what felt like a lifetime ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Am I down there?' Rob wondered. When all the madness had started this morning he had been down in the basement, on orders from Big Jon but devising his own plan. And then he'd ended up in the future, stuck as a pathetic fuck-toy for a nerd girl that had crawled out of his two worst enemies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Rob's introspection ended when Gloria spun around and grabbed him, painfully, by one of his bare shoulders, the bony ringers digging into his soft flesh. He fought the urge to squirm under the grip and intense stare that the former queen of Shermer High was giving him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen. I can't really explain it, but I'm on the other side of the house. If you help me, right now, I'll make a special wish for you with the gemstone. We just have to go make sure that the...other me doesn't make a wish, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Rob wanted to do was fight back. He hated being this small, he hated being this weak, he hated the fact that no matter what he seemed to have to fucking take orders from people he hated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what choice did he have?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Fine\" Rob said, nodding in agreement, his mane of redhair bobbing in the morning light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance, from under the darkening morning clouds, there was a clap of thunder.</span></div></div>",

The very first attractive woman to ever kiss him was his own daughter. He felt simultaneously disgusted, confused, and embarrassed. He wasn't anywhere near emotionally ready to be a parent, and yet, here she was, bursting with energy and gusto. He heard her speak, saw her mouth moving a mile a second, but the entire time Bill was lost in thought at this strange new reality. Suddenly he saw Willow childishly snapping her fingers in his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad! Didn't you hear a word I said!?\u201d giggled Willow. \u201cI'm pregnant!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill felt the fatherly part of his mind start blaring alarms. Some random guy had touched his little girl! Had deflowered her and put his seed into her! She was too young for this, her life was going to change! The moment he found out who the bastard was that did this to Willow he was going to-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill's teenage mind, however, pushed those thoughts away as he let loose a mildly shocked \"What?\" while Tammy simply began squealing in joy and enveloping her daughter in an immense hug and bouncing up and down in the middle of the living of their home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria, Ahn'Ger Stone still in hand, however, simply stared at the scene in shock and annoyance. This had totally not been what she had had in mind when she had wished for Bill and Tom to be a married couple. They were supposed to be old and decrepit, not middle aged, well off and a happy family with a successful daughter! And Gloria herself was NOT supposed to be some ancient looking clone of her mother. But whatever anger she had possessed had been spent and the Stone wasn't responding to her multitude of silent wishes to be young again, to be back home, or to make Bill and...'Tammy' miserable in some way or form. Maybe if she tried thinking about the last fight she and Tom had it would...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Gloria was interrupted as Bill's internal conflict between his teenage mind and fatherly mind seemed to reach some kind of truce as Willow gave his body a huge hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, honey...Who is the father? Do we know him?\" Bill asked, and Willow looked up at Bill and said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: \"It's Jonathan Ingerman! You know, the guy that owns your company? He bought the animation studio and came in for a tour and we just fell in love!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: \"Um...I may have gone to a party and had a, um, really good time with some guy? Please don't be mad, dad!\" Willow says as her face blushes with shame at getting pregnant from a one night stand.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a fraction of a second, Bill had seen a worried look cross Willow's otherwise radiant face, as if she were afraid to answer the question. Maybe she was concerned with what his response would be? That didn't make much sense to Bill. He was a protective father, sure, but his lifetime of new memories implied that he wasn't the smothering, oppressive kind of protective, not the kind to threaten lovers. He just wanted her to be safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever it was that had bothered his newly acquired daughter, her demeanor had immediately snapped back to her current state of excited jubilance. She smiled a smile so gleeful that it would make Helen of Troy look uglier than a demonically possessed Regan MacNeil, though that may have just been the proud papa in him speaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost nobody else had noticed the momentary lapse in cheer from Willow, least of all the teenage version of Bill. The transition had occurred so fast that it could hardly be said to have occurred at all. The middle aged, world-weary version of Bill, however, <b>had</b> noticed, and his fatherly memories had told him that look was something to be concerned about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor example, it was the same look that Willow had given when she got caught experimenting with drugs for the first time when she was thirteen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was also the same look she had given when Bill had walked in on her making out with her then girlfriend Kylie Perkins when she was fourteen. The pretty, dark haired Kylie had actually sneaked in through Willow's bedroom window late at night like in all of those goofy romantic comedies. Kylie's parents had to be called, and a big to do was made about it, utterly embarrassing both girls, which a part of Bill's new set of memories still chuckled over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his shame, it was also the same look Willow had given Bill when she was seventeen and he had said no to her dream of moving out west to California so she could attend CalArts, one of the best animation schools in the country. Bill had told Willow that he didn't believe that she old enough to know what she really wanted to do with her life, or to live on her own, and that she had grown up too spoiled and had it too easy to really know how to take care of herself. Secretly, he hadn't wanted to admit that the primary reason he said no was how damned expensive it would be for Bill to pay for. After debating with her father for close to an hour about it, where voices were raised and things were said that were not meant, Willow had finally admitted defeat, giving Bill that same glimpse of concern in her eyes as her dreams turned to dust. She held back the tears in her eyes, and returned quietly to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Bill recalled the absolutely vicious tongue lashing that Tammy had given him, one of their only major arguments in nearly twenty years of marriage, and how she had made him sleep on the couch. The next morning, the middle aged Bill Strasserman had reluctantly changed his mind and agreed to pay for Willow's tuition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat strange trip down memory lane had made the former teenage boy temporarily forget where he was. His mind zoned back to where he was now, in the foyer of his and Tammy's beautiful, old fashioned home as Willow hugged her dad tightly across his broad shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The father\" Bill repeated. \"Who's the father?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow grinned as she slowly let go of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Jonathan Ingerman!\" she squealed in her reedy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jo-Jonathan Ingerman?\" he stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! The guy who owns your company! You said that you and mom used to go to high school with him back in the day? He bought the animation studio I work at last month. He came in for a tour of the facility, and once he realized who I was, we just fell in love!\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill immediately went quiet. A chill rippled across his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Jon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bully who had made his <i>and</i> Tom's life absolute hell for years was now the father of their grandchild. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Jon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat. Piece of shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face went red. His body began to tremble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy looked on in concern, dread crossing her own face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...honey, isn't Jon a little old for you?\" she asked Willow as diplomatically as possible, enveloping her beautiful daughter's hand with her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought that at first too, mom, but he's so sweet! He's just like a big, soft huggy teddy bear. Really nice guy, and don't tell Dad, but he looks really hot for his age\" she giggled in a stage whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby, he's <i>our</i> age. Doesn't that bother you at least a little bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not really. Age is just a number. Oh, by the way! I guess you want to know how it all happened, right? Well get this: a couple of days after meeting Jon, he took me to Switzerland for the weekend! Just like out of the blue. I woke up with a text message asking me  \"Hey, want to go to Zurich with me?\". Who was I to say no to that!? Naturally, one thing led to another. We had dinner after we got off thr plane, and he promised me that any ideas I had for any shows would immediately get greenlit, and I sure have a few! Then later on after some clubbing, we rented a hotel room, ordered some champagne, and voila! Now I'm going to be a mom. Isn't it exciting!?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy gulped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're just moving a little fast. Your father and I knew each other for years before we decided to get married, let alone decide to have you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I thought you'd be excited! I mean, I thought that YOU of all people would approve. Grandbabies! I mean, you're going to get to spoil him rotten! Or Her. Obviously we don't know the gender yet since I'm only a few weeks along, not that we'll push them into anything! Oh, by the way, we've decided that we're not taking doing any genetic enhancement procedures. We're old fashioned that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I am excited and happy for you, honey, I just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe middle aged blonde took a deep breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite having adapted to this reality far more comfortably than her husband Bill, the former Tom Ackerton possessing a second set of memories that were nothing short of blissful, Tammy still recalled the intense fear she had of Big Jon. He was bad news, practically her husband's arch enemy, the Lex Luthor to his Superman, and she certainly would never approve of him as a potential son in law if Willow ever decided to marry him, let alone the father to her grandchild. She could see the anger on Bill's face. He was practically about to burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just worried about how your father is taking it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow swiveled around. She saw her father's eyes about to pop out of his skull. He shut them in an attempt to calm down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I was so worried about this! Daddy, please don't get angry! Jonathan and I are in love! He's not the guy you remember from high school, he's a nice guy now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow touched her father's shoulder, which was usually a surefire way to calm him down, but she could still feel him struggling to control his furious tremble.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>OK, at least finally there's some drama happening</i> thought Gloria to herself as she watched the family drama occur around her, thrilled that Bill and Tom's perfect little storybook marriage wasn't so perfect after all. A wicked smile flashed across her face as she saw that her former arm candy's geeky friend turned husband was finally about to go apeshit at their daughter for getting knocked up. She stared at the magic stone in her hand, in awe of its power, wondering how she was going to escape from this once things got too heady. For now, she enjoyed being a spectator at this suburban meltdown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of all this tension, a cold, disembodied female voice erupted out of nowhere and spoke. It was the same robotic voice that had announced Willow's visit minutes earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bill, are you OK?\" the voice asked. \"My sensors tell me that your blood pressure has spiked, and unusual activity in your amygdala suggests that you are under extreme emotional distress. Should I call an ambulance? Schedule a therapist appointment or perhaps a massage?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteadily, Bill's body began to calm down. He stopped quaking in anger, and Willow let go of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, he opened his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no, none of that will be necessary, A.M.Y. I'd just like to be left alone for now. I'm implementing deactivation code 599245792WJKXL3359.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deactivation code recognized. I will resume normal functions in: One hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robotic voice slowly faded away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill was so glad that his older memories remembered that code, because he did NOT to be bothered right now, especially not from some futuristic Amazon Alexa. He was too worried about how much his two sets of experiences were slowly beginning to converge, and how much was starting to mix up his actual teenage life with this ephemeral grown up one. He and Tom(And reluctantly, he admitted to himself, Gloria) needed to escape this reality before they forgot who they really were...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Before Bill can gather Tom/Tammy and Gloria and try and wish themselves back to normal, the middle aged Jonathan Ingerman arrives at the Strasserman family home, causing tension to escalate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Something else. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bill had always been a fan of science fiction, and besides been forty years older, this was pretty much a dream for him. He walked around the house and noticed the subtle differences between 2018 and 2058 with geeky interest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Gloria turned on the television. One of the local TV stations was the first station that appeared. A mild mannered looking news reporter was explaining something, so Gloria turned up the volume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRepresentatives of the Lowell Corporation are still in talks with the native Martian inhabitants to begin constructing a human colony near the planet's southern equator. This will require the use of controversial terraforming technology which might disrupt the planet's native ecosystem...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoring!\u201d said Gloria. She changed the channel to CBS. Somehow, The Price Is Right was STILL airing in 2058.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, I wonder if Bob Barker is still alive\u201d she mused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey wait, turn that back!\u201d yelled Bill in his deeper, manlier voice, running from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard something about Mars, turn that back\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Plinko!\u201d said Gloria, smiling at giving Bill a hard time. Gloria turned the channel back to the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe news program had ended. Now some insipid talk show was airing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it\u201d said Bill, pulling out his cell phone to look for answers. The Android that his parents had bought for him last year had been replaced by a newer, sleeker type phone that looked more like a piece of glass than a phone. Bill struggled to understand how 2058 phones worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, I'm Sophie Wagner, and is this is The Pulse. Mutants. They used to be fantasy characters in comic books and film. Now that they exist in reality, and people are frightened of what they can do. On today's show, we're going to explore the question of whether those with superhuman abilities are a threat to civil society, or if we are witnessing the birth of an a brand new social demographic that must be protected and cherished. After the tragic events at O'Hare airport, we...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria flipped through the channels again, yawning, and found a station airing old episodes of Breaking Bad. She had never watched a single superhero movie and had no idea what the hell mutant was, just that she didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill finally figured out how to work the new phone and had gotten online. He looked for the first news source he could find, and he was now watching a video apparently about colonizing Mars. The thumbnail had featured some men and some large green beings who looked VERY much like aliens shaking hands in front of a weird looking building. He clicked on it and began the video: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuman colonization is a civil right\u201d began one of the talking heads. \u201cThis is not a 21st century update of Manifest Destiny.

Opening it up, she discovered it was the diary of Tammy, and it was her best shot at figuring out what had happened to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this timeline, Tammy, had met Bill Strasserman in high school. Both were casual acquaintances with Gloria Vanapolous, Bill's neighbor, though neither of them were as close to her as Tom and Bill had been in the old timeline. Bill and Tammy were good friends in high school, but went their separate ways as they went to college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy skipped over the college years, since they didn't seem to involve Bill or Gloria directly, but it seemed Tammy was a bit of a party girl and bit of an... explorer in her college days. Tammy skipped over a few \"chapters.\" Then finally saw another mention of Bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell it seemed that Tammy had no thoughough plans after college, and decided to return home in 2024. It was here that she reunited with Bill and from there, the good friends went off into a whirlwind romance. They eventually reunited with Gloria, who still happened to be neighbors with Bill, and she actually became a good friend to them. It seemed Gloria had matured a bit until the young Gloria's mindset took over the older body she now had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill and Tammy eventually had a beautiful wedding in 2028, and gave birth to a beautiful child, Willow, in 2032, making Willow 26 now. Tammy couldn't believe it. They had a daughter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy continued to skip over chapters. She could deep dive into all the specifics of Bill and Tammy's life later. Right now, she wanted to figure out if there was anything important to the present moment. And when read the last entry, she let out a gasp. Bill and Gloria had to know this right away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscovery #1: Tom Ackerton still exists in this reality, and is now married to Gloria! Bill and Tammy's daughter, Willow, and Gloria and Tom's daughter, Marcia, are engaged to be married... and the wedding is tomorrow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscovery #2 Tammy is a local celebrity chef, and Bill is the business manager of her restaurants .

Of all times, you pick this one? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust give him back his toy, Gloria!\u201d said Tom, trying to defend his good friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up, Tom!\u201d shouted Gloria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, Gloria <i>had</i> been trying to avoid a situation like this when she approached Bill's house, and the fact that she wasn't prepared to deal with when things turned bad or at least just not turned out the way she wanted it to was stressing her the hell out. She was used to laying down the law with her friends and her friends spinelessly just going along with what Gloria wanted out of fear or self interest.  Subconsciously, Gloria suspected that she probably got this trait from her mother, but right now she wasn't interested in soul searching. She was hurt, and she couldn't understand why Tom and Bill were teaming up against her. So she exploded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just wish you and Bill could just feel the pain I feel!\u201d she screamed with indignant umbrage. As she did, the Ahn'Ger stone exploded into action. It suddenly felt deathly cold, causing  Gloria to drop it. The entire block glowed in its brilliant green light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was afraid of this\u201d said Bill quietly to himself before the three of them were immediately transported...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...to Gloria's own home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell just happened!?\u201d yelled Tom, but somehow he heard Gloria's voice instead of his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria herself now realized that she was sitting in her living room on the large, comfy red couch she passed by every morning. She looked around. Yeah, this was definitely her living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d she said, repeating Tom's own refrain. \u201cHow did I get back here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting next to her on either side were identical copies of herself. Both girls had the same black hair, the same green eyes, the same facial structure as her own. Hell, they were wearing the same exact clothing as she was. They both were wearing same sandals she was wearing, and each had the same silver toe nail polish she did. They were twins...no, triplets. Identical triplets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho the hell are you two!?\u201d yelled Gloria as the two impostors were staring at their hands in disbelief. One had even pulled a mirror out of their purse and stared slack-jawed at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god\u201d said Bill. \u201cI've turned into Gloria Vanapoulos\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the three teenagers were interrupted by an older female voice coming from the top of the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGloria, Natasha, Ursula...what are you all still doing here?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Gloria's mother Ariadne comes downstairs and see her three daughters.

Natasha knew through the magically implanted memories of being Gloria's sister and Ariadne's daughter, memories that were laid like a fine mesh on top of the part of her that was still Bill Strasserman. And those memories were of a looming, angry, highly controlling mother that could fly off the handle at the slightest provocation, especially towards Natasha who was the most rebellious of the three girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the clueless, slightly disgusted look on Natasha's face did not deter the matriarch of the Vanapolous house from continuing on with her hateful tirade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jonathan is the SON of your father's BOSS, Natasha! Don't you realize what kind of position it puts your father in!? A single word from that boy and our biggest paycheck goes POOF and then we'll all wind up living in the trailer park! And speaking of, don't think I don't know about who you were seeing behind my back before the Ingerman boy, that Bolstrum ogre from the trailer park! Well if nothing else, I can say that at least my whore of a daughter at least tried to sleep her way upwards upwards!\" Ariadne's words cut like a knife into the Natasha side of Bill's new mind, a crippling cascade of anger, anxiety and a desire to burst into tears and run for the bedroom the three girls shared. The Bill side, however, was simply disgusted by the prospect of having relations with BOTH of the people he hated more than anyone else on the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-mom I-I...\" Natasha said as her eyes went watery and her voice seemed to catch in her throat, but the Vanapolous matriarch was too far on the warpath to be swayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T YOU MOM ME YOUNG LADY! YOUR FATHER AND I GAVE UP TOO MUCH FOR THE THREE OF YOU!\" The older woman's face was contorted in fury, a long ring-clad finger leaping forward and pushing itself, almost painfully, into Natasha's breasts while the hand that contained the gemstone was resting on her hip,light pushing itself through the cracks of Ariadne's fingers, though she still hadn't noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, she's sorry!\" Ursula shouted, but the girl formerly known as Tom was cowed by a glare, and her own implanted personality telling her to shut up and let Natasha take the heat, lest her own secret relationship with...Well, several boys at school be found out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Ursula and Gloria do what they're told! They follow my rules! And they don't-\" Ariadne pulled curled her free hand around the single backpack strap that hung off the now openly crying Natasha's should and in a flash proceeded to dump it's contents of clothes out upon the floor of the Vanapolous's home. Ariadne tossed the empty canvas bag aside and smiled cruelly as she picked up a torn black sleeveless top that was emblazoned with a heart-shaped skull and clearly a size too small for Natasha's figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't even wear the clothes that your father and I work so hard to put on your back! Instead you wear this...this FILTH! Like you WANT to send me to an early grave by looking like some trailer court slut! Think of all the money your father and I could have saved! Think of the HOUSE we could have had! Instead he works two jobs and I had to QUIT mine and settle for something that allowed me to take care of you three! I as on the fast track to being a corporate executive, Natasha! But now, because of you, I had to tank that awful bank job and count money for OTHER people instead! AND HOW DO YOU EVEN AFFORD THIS GARBAGE!? ARE YOU STEALING MONEY FROM ME, NATASHA!? OR ARE YOU REALLY A WHORE!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-mommy I j-j-just\" Natasha tried to speak, but her mother railed on. Bill, or whatever was left of him, was so overcome by the crushing emotions of his new female half that he couldn't even devise some way of getting the furiously glowing gemstone out of Ariadne's hand. Instead her mind was overcome with fear, guilt, a crushing sadness that one of her darkest secrets had been exposed and was afraid that her mother would say she didn't love her. Maybe if Natasha's mind hadn't so clearly dominated Bill's own, he'd see that the house was far too small, the furniture faded well beyond what it should have been. Even the TV was old, a bulky flatscreen that had clearly seen better days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill would have also seen that the money of the Vanapolous household was put towards Ariadne and the three girls' wardrobes, making them appear much more well off than they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-the b-b-boys buy m-me s-stuff!\" Was all Natasha could blubber out as she sank to her knees bawling. It was true, outside of the normal clothes that her mother bought for her, Ursula and Gloria, they'd never been Natasha's style. Unlike her sisters, she had reveled in exerting her free will at the one place her mother couldn't control her; school. And Big Jon, utside of his temper, was easy to manipulate into helping her fill out her secret wardrobe with clothes she'd change into once the twins had reached the high school, slipping out of her 'preppy' skin and into her 'punk' skin that felt so much more right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I KNEW IT! YOU'RE A WHORE! THAT INGERMAN BOY BOUGHT YOU THIS JEWELRY FOR SLEEPING WITH HIM, DIDN'T HE!? DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT US, ABOUT ME BEHIND OUR BACKS, NATASHA!? I JUST...I JUST WISH I'D NEVER HAD YOU!\" Ariadne screamed out, and with a crack of thunder, the Ahn'Ger Stone activated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOM NO-\" Was all Natasha had time to scream before the green-gold light engulfed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: When the light fades, Natasha is no longer there, and the Vanapolous Twins are all that remains and utterly oblivious to the fact that they had, moments ago, had a sister. The new reality shows a little bit nicer house, and Ariadne is suddenly very tired and concerned as to where Natasha went, despite her daughters not having a clue of who she was talking about. Meanwhile, somewhere else in the world, Natasha/Bill awakens somewhere VERY different...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: The the light fades, Natasha is simply gone, and Ariadne gently urges her twin daughters out the door and towards school. Natasha never existed, Bill never existed, and theo nly people that seem to remember him are now reluctant twins who have a lot to figure out, including on how to get the magical gemstone away from Ariadne.</span></div></div>",

It was a magical Mexican standoff, for the right to reality. The girls shifted their eyes, studying one another\u2019s movements. Then Gloria kicked herself forwards, Ursula leapt onto Natasha, and the stone fell into one of their hands.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I wish I could me and my sisters apart!\" Ursula screamed in frustration and the anger and raw emotion that had channeled into the Stone exploded with glittering gold light that drowned out the world and leaving only Ursula, Natasha and Gloria in green silhouettes. The three girls looked at each other before grabbing their heads in unison and screaming out in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Ursula the pain only lasted for a moment, her skull throbbing and throbbing seemingly in time with the pressure building in her chest as her breasts swelled outwards, doubling in size while her hips cracked and swelled along with her rear. She felt something tugging at the back of her skull and and a tickle as her head extended further down her back and brief chill as her outfit reconfigured itself on her changed form. And suddenly the pain in her head didn't feel so bad. In fact everything felt, like, kinda light and fuzzy! A smile crossed her fuller lips as the light faded and she let go of her head, looking around as the pushed through the golden haze and back into view as if all that had happened was a moment of sun blindness. And then Ursula saw the two people standing in front of her and she blinked in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, like, who are you?\" She said as she pushed long strands of obviously dyed brown-blonde hair out of her eyes, her voice light and sing-songy, an octave higher than it had been moments before. And then the answer popped in her head and she giggled, sliding the pretty rock she had been holding into her white purse. Like, duh! It was her sisters! they might have looked a little skinny and a little fat, but their faces totally looked just like hers! But they were totally NOT her sisters, right? Weren't they all different people a moment ago? Or...were they the same person? Ursula, frankly, couldn't remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha was the short, kinda fat geeky one, but she was the sister Ursula liked the most. She was always nice and helped Ursula with her homework whenever she needed help (which was every night). Natasha had, like, the WORST fashion sense though. She wore some silly t-shit with a weird looking A on it and covered her flabby arms with a green flannel over shirt. Her belly pushed against the fabric but she wasn't, like, really fat. It was a 'cute' fatness, and there were more than a few of the nerdy boys at school already chasing after her. It was less than the legion of guys that constantly drooled whenever Ursula walked past but she was still proud of her sis! Her glasses were pretty thick but they looked totes cute on her short-stacked frame, especially with the way her she always cut her hair; that cute bob with the longer bangs in the front, and Ursula always helped Natasha find the pants that were big enough to fit her. And even if she didn't really understand why Natasha liked all those superhero movies, at least she got to drool over all those hot hunks like Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria, on the other hand, looked sullen as always. The girl was tall and lean and TOTALLY didn't have any curves to speak of. She always refused Ursula's attempts to, like, be nice and tell her about hair styles and fashion, Gloria's dark hair was shaved on one side and hung limply off the other side of her head. her green eyes were a harsh, cold green and they glared out at the world, full of anger and hatred. Her bare arms were marked by tattoos, and the rest of her was covered in dark, shaggy clothing that was purposefully torn or burnt, and she wore, like, the ugliest bracelet Ursula had ever seen! She was always hanging out with the REALLY mean girls, the ones that hung out with Robbie Bolstrum and his boys. Maybe that was why Gloria was SUCH a bitch, no one liked her, not even her sisters. She was always saying the meanest things, especially to Ursula and she and Natasha were pretty sure she was jealous cause Ursula was the prettiest of the tri...tri...Ursula was TOTES the prettiest of the three sisters. But Natasha had her back, especially hen Gloria would say things that sounded mean that Ursula didn't understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, Ursula shook the rest of the fuzziness away, made sure her hair was still styled (it took her, like, FOREVS to fix it every morning) and brushed what must have been icky dirt off her perfect wardrobe. Her cute pink cardigan was just TO DIE for, and while she wasn't big on skirts outside of cheerleading, she couldn't help but like how it helped make her look even sexier for the guys. And girls, Ursula was pretty sure she was mainly into guys but sometimes...But no way, that was way too grody a thought, and besides their mom was absolutely against the three of them having boyfriends right now. Not that it, like, stopped Gloria from being a total hussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, you're such a fucking bimbo, Ursula\" Gloria sneered, pushing her hair back behind her ears and pulling a pack of cigarettes and a lighter out of her back pocket and lighting up one of the cancer sticks. She cast a sideways glance at the small house they lived in, almost daring her BITCH of a mother to come out and say something. Gloria WANTED her mother to say or do something, but Ariadne Vanapolous had disappeared back inside the house, clearly getting ready for her own busy day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, leave her alone Gloria!\" Natasha said, her voice was slightly nasally and she glared at her sullen sister, chubby cheeks growing red with indignation. Just because Gloria chose to ruin her life and health didn't mean she always had to make herself feel better by picking on Ursula! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or what, you'll quote some stupid superhero thing at me? Oh no, don't shoot me with your raygun Natasha!\" Gloria said mockingly as she turned away from her sisters. \"Get real, porky! Or wait, you just want your anime alien prince to show up and PORK you with his laser sword, don't you? Fuckin' nerd!\" Gloria stuck her studded tongue out and flipped her shorter sister the bird, taking off walking in the opposite direction of their usual path to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha's face went even redder and she tugged at the corners of her flannel over-shirt, trying to hide the love handles and bulges her tubby frame sported, her head ducking low in shame. She pushed her glasses back up on her nose as they slid loose and fought the urge not to start crying. She knew Gloria was mean...But this morning she was being super mean. She usually didn't make cracks about Natasha's weight because of how self-conscious the short girl was about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Gloria, arn't you, like, coming?\" Ursula said, scratching her head in confusion. that was TOTALLY not the way to get to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Ursula, maybe I, like, have better things to do?\" Gloria shouted back, mimicking her prettier sister's voice, \"Fuck that, I'm gonna go have some real fun with some REAL people, not spend all my time in that glorified daycare for sheeple! Maybe you could come too Ursula! Not like it's done you any real favors. Fatty McBrainiac over there is the only one who gets any thing out of it!\" Gloria couldn't wait to meet up with her REAL friends. They were all skipping school today to go party outside of town. She could always taste the beer and weed. Maybe she'd even stop stringing Jules along, all just depended on how drunk and high she got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well...F YOU GLORIA!\" Natasha screamed back at Gloria's retreating form, who simply laughed and waved goodbye with another offensive hand gesture. As their bitchy sister crossed the street Ursula threw a arm around Natasha's shoulders and pulled her close. She felt her 'little' sister (which was, like, not really true cuz they were all born at the same time) body begin to shake and the tell-tale sniffs and whimpers as Natasha began to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wuh-why does she h-have to be like that!?\" Natasha sobbed, her forehead pressing into one of Ursula's massive breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, she's just a jealous witch with a total B, Nat! C'mon, let's get to school. You'll totally feel better once we're in class!\" Ursula said as cheerfully as she could, pushing Natasha away before the nerdy Vanapolous slobbered all over her ense...over her pretty clothes. While Natasha blubbered Ursula opened her purse and dug around, pushing the pretty rock from before out of the way in search of a hanky to clean her sister's face off with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh\" She said quietly as the sun made the gold within the gemstone glitter, reflecting in her impossibly wide, if somewhat blank, eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Natasha pulls herself together long enough to catch a glimpse of the Stone, and suddenly has vague, dream-like memories of being Bill, not Natasha, and Ursula being Tom, not Ursula! They were boys! And they weren't sisters! But...Tom always seemed sad and Bill seemed to have no purpose...But she had to fix things...Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Ursula finds the handkerchief and hands it to Natasha, who composes herself. The impossibly hot cheerleader and the cutely chubby geek girl head to school, while the sullen and stick-like Gloria finds her way to darker corners of Shermer as the memories of being anyone other than the Vanapolous sisters fade away to barely remembered dreams. But then, at cheerleading practice, Ursula shows the Ahn'Ger Stone off to her fellow cheerleaders, and a angry wish is made...</span></div></div>",

But her triumph didn't last long as Ursula and Natasha stopped slapping at each other and turned to stare at Gloria before they dogpiled the original Vanapolous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GIVE IT TO ME GLORIA ITS MINE!\" Screeched Natasha, formerly Bill Strasserman, who desperately wanted to be be anyone else but a clone of Gloria in this moment. She had been such a fool to simply hand over the gemstone earlier, in the different reality where she had still been a boy! And why? Why had she, then Bill, let someone who he largely hated look at his treasure? She had to get the Stone back, she had to wish for something, anything other than this reality!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GLORIA YOU BITCH!\" Squealed Ursula, formerly Tom Ackerton, who desperately wanted to use the Stone to end all the problems that had befallen him since he and Gloria had officially begun dating. He could use it to simply wind back the clock, to have never met Gloria,or to make her be a good girlfriend, or just...Well, he'd wish for something to make his life better! But he had to get it from his ex turned sister before she used it to further punish him and Bill for, well, simply existing. Gloria was a bitch like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe two former boys piled onto Gloria and began clawing at her identical tanned skin with their new longer nails, leaving bloody gouges in formerly flawless flesh that caused Gloria to shriek in pain as she failed under the combined weight of her new sisters as they fought to wrestle the magical gemstone out of her hand. She wanted to use the anger inside of her to make a wish, but the pain from multiple slashes with long nails, the weight on her thin frame, the concrete sidewalk digging and scraping into her flesh, the pain over-rode her anger. All the Stone could do in this start was flicker weakly as Gloria's anger punched through the pain, but it wasn't enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Gloria's mind the Flight part of her Fight or Flight instinct kicked in, the pain telling her to get as far away from her psycho sisters as she could, and she began flailing wildly, arms and legs kicking randomly as she tried to get Natasha and Ursula off her. She couldn't even truly see what she was doing, the breasts of one of the other girls pressed up against her face as they used their entire body weight to pin Gloria to the ground while they clawed at her hand, all Gloria could do was just swing and kick into the fashionable void. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a shoe connect with something pliable yet firm as the weight on her legs shifted suddenly, the girlish 'oof!' in a voice that sounded like her own as the weight suddenly shifted. Her fist connected with something hard that was followed by a high pitched scream of pain and something warm and hot pouring through the cracks in her fingers. Her other hand pounded against the concrete  as it struggled to stay free of the pointed claws that were trying to dig their way to the magical gemstone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she felt something give way within her clenched fist as it slammed hard against the sidewalk, and then green-gold light pushed through the flesh and fabric pressing against her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'OH NO!' Was all Gloria had time to think as the shattered Ahn'Ger Stone released a blast of magical energy as it broke beyond all repair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: The flash subsides, and the three girls untangle from each other. Gloria, Natasha and Ursula see the world has turned slightly green, and all three of the girls has a golden glow around them. What had happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: The flash subsides and Gloria, Ursula and Natasha find themselves the same, moments before the brutal fight that caused the Stone to break. Ursula and Natasha act as if nothing was wrong, and only Gloria seems to remember the old realities. But with no magical stone to change back, it appears as if she's stuck with her ex and his best friend as her new sisters. For life.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was a brief moment of silence as the Ahn'Ger Stone impacted with the hard concrete sidewalk, as if the entire world had been put on mute. And then with a flash of the verdant light and a gust of wind, sound returned to the world as the gemstone shattered into dozens of green shards, the inner gold teardrop blowing away in the gust of wind and covering the Vanapolous sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GLORIA, WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO!?\" Natasha screamed, nailed hands flying up to her eyes as the gold dust flew into them, her long nailed hands carefully trying to dig the irritant out as she rolled off of Gloria. This was just perfect! The Stone was gone, and with it, any chance that she had at turning back into Bill!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I didn't even get to use it!' She mentally pouted. The power to re-write reality and she'd stupidly handed it over to one of the worst people in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I COULDN'T SEE! YOU BITCHES WERE KILLING ME!\" Gloria screeched in return as she scrambled to her feet as she pointed a long, gold-flecked finger at her momentarily blinded sister, fighting the urge to continue the brawl by taking advantage of that fact. It only briefly occurred to her that she wasn't supposed to have sisters, and that, due to her actions, she was now stuck with her bitter ex and his best friend who hated her for the rest of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave her alone! You just should have let us have the damn thing Gloria!\" Ursula said as she herself stood up, brushing the gold dust off of her shirt and trying to shake it out of her previously styled mane of raven black hair. She gave Natasha a shove, having not seen her roll off of Gloria. \"Why do you always have to make things more difficult! Now we're stuck like this, Gloria!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Natasha you bimbo!\" The shoved sister said as she flailed blindly to keep herself from falling over before pointing a finger outward towards a nearby tree, completely opposite of her intended target, \"She's Gloria!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sure this is your fault also\" Ursula said, her face tightening into a fierce pout as she struggled to tell her new, and likely permanent, sisters apart once again. \"Why is it so hard for me to tell you both apart? Why couldn't your would have made us look different, Gloria! I wish I could tell us all apart!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the word 'I wish' came out of Ursula's mouth, something strange happened. A familiar glow surrounded her body, her hair re-styling itself as the black was burned away by a brilliant glowing gold as is floated in the wind (despite there being no wind). Ursula herself squealed in alarm as her vision took on a green-gold tint and her body seemed to feel...lighter? The reluctant triplet looked down to see that she was, indeed, floating almost an inch off the pavement!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD!\" She screamed. Gloria simply gasped, ignoring the pain from a split lip, as her sister apparently developed superpowers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What's happening!? I can't see!\" Natasha cried from the ground, one arm outstretch in front of her while another one still carefully rubbed her eyes. \"Gloria? Ursula? I wish I knew what was going on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd much like her sister, Natasha's body suddenly exploded with otherwordly light, her eyes snapping wide open to reveal two pools of swirling golden light instead of the green eyes that she had been cursed with as a clone of Gloria. She gasped in surprise (and more than a little relief) as her vision returned, even if it was like watching a poorly developed film. And she, much like the former Tom Ackerton, was now floating half an inch off the sidewalk. It was actually a bit more, but the body she had been given had a substantial rear, and whatever was powering this event seemed to take...proportions into account.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Gloria, the cause of everything and one that was definitely not about to be left out of something, especially if her former ex turned sister was involved, simply muttered \"I wish that was happening to me!\". And without fail, her body began to glow as well, her fingernails turning into bright pinpricks of light as she began to float as well, as her flesh was mended in her newfound aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three sisters looked at each other in shock before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: The sisters are now living incarnations of the Ahn'Ger Stone, forced to grant one angry, twisted, irreversible wish to any individual that makes one. As if on cue, Ariadne rushes out of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: The Vanapolous triplets suddenly begin turning into a replacement gemstone.</span></div></div>",

Look at your hair Ursula!\" Natasha said, finally breaking the silence as she, somehow, stood up while never touching the sidewalk. \"It's glowing! What happened to me? Everything is all gold and green so I can't tell if mine changed color or not!\" The girl, formerly Bill Strasserman, grabbed her own mane of previously styled hair and held it in front of her squinted glowing eyes, which suddenly went wide as an answer popped into her brain. \"Oh wait, it's my eyes, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're really shiny and gold like my hair!\" Ursula ran her hands through her hair, sending out a flurry of golden sparks that lazily drifted to the ground. \"This is so cool! And now we can tell each other apart!\" The former Tom Ackerton was immensely relieved to have that particular problem taken care of. Despite having glowing gold hair and floating under some unknown power, the new girl was simply relieved that for once in her life as a Vanapolous, she'd be able to tell who was Natasha (the sister she liked) and Gloria (the sister she hated because she was, like, a total bitch). The fact that only a few minutes ago she hadn't even BEEN a Vanapolous seemed like a fading memory. It was still there but it just seemed..unimportant, especially right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hello?  You just look like a bimbo now, Ursula! And Natasha just looks some pretentious wannabe with golden contacts in!\" Gloria sneered at the two before placing both her hands out in front of her, \"Look at these nails!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsula and Natasha shared a look before rolling their eyes. \"Whatever Gloria\" They said in a very Twinly way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you bitches are just jealous because whatever happened, I look the best\" The original Vanapolous said, sticking her tongue out  before realizing her sisters (who she remembered not being her sisters, but still did) seemed to be ignoring her. Like always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder...\" Natasha looked down at her tiny feet in designer sandals and took a cautious, small step before squealing in girlish delight as she FLOATED forward, almost like one of the superheroes in those Marvel movies that everyone liked! The fact that she used to be a Marvel super-fan seemed to have slipped her mind at the moment as she took another step, and another, larger one as she seemed to be going higher into the air! \"CHECK ME OUT! THIS IS SO COOL!\" She screamed in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you doing that!?\" Her currently golden haired sister said before trying it out for herself, putting her acrobatic cheerleading skills to use as she launched herself into the air, putting the cheerleading skills that had replaced Tom's athletic abilities to good use. Before long she was almost eye level with Natasha, some ten feet off the ground. She and Natasha giggled as they literally walked on air while below them, Gloria struggled with the concept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! This is SO NOT FAIR\" Gloria pouted as she only moved upwards a few centimeters at a time. She was just the captain of the cheerleading team, the one that came up with the cheers and kept all the other girls in line, and she wouldn't be caught dead watching those superhero movies, so the concept of having superpowers or how to propel herself was simply not in her wheelhouse. At least, not with reality changing her ex-boyfriend into a clone of her and deeply burying, if not flat out erasing the handful of dates where she actually saw some of those movies and was more than just 'cheer captain Vanapolous'. \"Why is this even happening anyway? She whined as Ursula and Natasha pranced around above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the gemstone, or whatever was in it!\" Natasha said, finally stopping her upwards climb and somehow...just willing herself to float down until she was only a few inches above Gloria, \"When you broke it, all the magic power flew into us! And then when we made the wishes it turned all of it on! And before you ask, I know because that was my wish, to know what was happening!\" Natasha stuck her tongue out at Gloria before floating upwards again and throwing a slender arm around her fellow magical girl sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about my wish, Nat?\" Ursula said, her face scrunched in confusion while she continued to float and play with her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your wish, sis, was to tell us apart! So wherever the gold dust landed on us, that is where all the magic is channeled! So You have really pretty hair, I've got gold eyes and Gloria just has a bad nail job. She just wished what was happening to us would happen to her, so her wish didn't come with anything more than lightbulb fingers\" The girl formerly known as Bill and her favorite sister both started giggling as they stared down at Gloria, who was now only a few more inches higher than she was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least you'll save mom and dad a few pennies on the electric bill now, Gloria!\" Ursula taunted as she freed herself from Natasha's grip and cartwheeled through the air, \"Now you won't have to turn all the lights on when you go to the bathroom in the middle of the night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP!\" Gloria fumed. It just wasn't fair! SHE had been born first, so that made HER the leader of the triplets! She should be the one with all the power and gloating over her sisters, not the other way around! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You're also the only REAL Vanapolous' The quietest part of her whispered before being swept away by jealousy. 'Maybe...If we all have the gemstone's magic, maybe we can make our own wishes? Then they'll HAVE to respect me and treat me like they should!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I WISH THAT\" Gloria began, finger pointed at Natasha who was wearing a shit eating grin beneath the creepy gold eyes, but stopped as the smug face above her turned to fear with a terrified gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, we're-\" Was all Natasha could say before she, along with Gloria and Ursula, were surrounded by dark green mist. The mist began to swirl around them, faster and faster before in an instant, faster than Natasha could finish what she was saying, each girl was covered in a dense green cloud. So dense that only the glowing parts of their forms could be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We're gonna become the new gemstone!' Natasha thought to herself as she felt a great pressure pushing on her from all sides, crushing her pretty female form until she was just a pair of eyes staring out of the emerald fog. She knew the same was happening to Gloria and Ursula. Ursula was simply being consumed by her hair, the former Tom simply disappearing into the golden mane until it was all that remained. And Gloria, she simply melted away until all that was left of her body were the ten golden fingernails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green clouds grew smaller around what remained of their victims, shrinking in size until each cloud was no larger than a human hand as they began to drift closer and closer together until they began to merge. As their prisons became one and each remnant of Gloria, Ursula and Natasha Vanapolous began to touch, their could once again hear each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH GOD WHATS HAPPENING!?\" Ursula's mind screeched in fear and confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOMMY!\" Gloria's mind sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WE'RE BECOMING THE NEW GEMSTONE WE'RE GONNA-\" Was all Natasha's mind could get out before all three souls collided in a mental cacophony of screams and emotions that swirled around each other in anguish. The ability to form coherent thoughts vanished from their minds as they were consumed by the pain of this new, unknown transformation. If they could have processed what was happening beyond the pain of the transformation, it might have felt as though they were being drawn towards something as their presences within the swirling golden vortex faded away from the mortal plane and traveled...somewhere else. Before long all that remained of them within was a shade, the last fleeting emotions, thoughts and fragments of personality as the Vanapolous sisters vanished from the mortal plane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, outside of the mental hell, the green clouds had merged into one, taking on a teardrop shape as it's opacity began to clear, revealing the inner golden teardrop and all that remained of the bodies of the former sisters, a shaped golden core comprised of golden particles that seemed to catch the last rays of the morning sun as it slipped behind the dark clouds of a spring thunderstorm. The transformation complete, the newly reformed Ahn'Ger Stone simply blinked from existence as all trace of the previous owners was erased from reality. The Vanapolous sisters never existed and never would exist again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that existed of them now were the remnants that served as the core of a new vessel that allowed humans, mortal creatures full of impulsive, cruel and petty emotions, to make their wildest and angriest dreams real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn time, perhaps only an hour, perhaps a century, the reborn Ahn'Ger Stone would find a new owner, a foolish mortal that would unleash it's power onto an unsuspecting world, but for now it simply floated in the spaces between realities, waiting for just the right person to say those two fateful words in anger;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b><div align=\"center\">THE END</div></b></font></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The last thing Natasha felt before the mortal world vanished was a sharp, painful pinch and then her incorporeal ears filled with the sound of rushing wind. And high pitched screams as Ursula and Gloria tumbled through the off-green tunnel that the trio now found themselves in, falling (for lack of a better term) towards a golden portal at the far end that grew larger with each passing moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Are we dead? Where are we?' Natasha thought to herself, and heard her voice echoing around her as though she'd said the words out loud. And then, as they had before, the answers came to her. They weren't dead, and they were in some sort of transit tunnel to...somewhere else! She mentally breathed a sigh of relief, since she currently lacked a body and the lungs needed for an actual sigh, and somehow 'reached out' towards the sources of the other feminine screams; Ursula and Gloria. Her sisters lacked bodies just as Natasha did, but their minds were still there, and still their own despite what the magic had done to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Girls!' She called out, but her sisters were still too traumatized by their transformation to hear her. So Natasha went for the solution that suddenly popped into her mind and willed a slap across their mental 'faces', stunning both of the girls into a momentary silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Listen to me! We're not dead! We're just...somewhere else now! Just hang on, the moment we hit the gold portal we'll have bodies again, okay!?' She hissed, and she felt confusion, doubt, and more than a little fear fill the tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I...I don't wanna go into the light! I want my mommy!' Gloria sniffled before bursting out into mental sobs. Waves of regret washed over Natasha and she felt the urge to cry as well. For all of her deep seated issues, Gloria had still loved their mother...Who now lived a life where the triplets had never existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't understand, Nat! And where are you? All I see is green!' Came Ursula's voice, accompanied by just wave of confusion. Natasha would have rolled her eyes if she had possessed any. Ursula had the misfortune of being the 'dumb' Vanapolous, or at least, the Legally Blonde version of clueless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just...We're fine, okay? We're not dead! Just trust me!' Natasha did her best to clam her sisters down but it was hard for her to put into words what was happening to them, even if she knew in her...mind? Soul? Or whatever amounted to it now was about to happen. A tense silence descended upon the three, broken only by Gloria's muted sobbing as they soared closer and closer to the golden light. In mere moments it now dominated Natasha's view and the light blocked out everything else. what could have been called her throat as a sharp ringing filled the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached out mentally and grabbed the 'hands' of her sisters. Just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then they hit...something. It was not unlike a wall but it seemed to give way as the three consciousnesses impacted on it's surface and 'sank' into the golden depths. To Natasha it felt like the moment coming out of a water slide and hitting the pool below, a rush of air before the rough impact and then the cloying wetness as you swam to get out of the way of the person behind you. She felt the 'fingers' of her sisters tear away from her own as she began scrambling to grab hold of something, anything in the blinding brightness. Her mind started to go blank as she sank deeper into the golden light and the sudden crushing pressure around made her feel like she was on the verge of drowning. A panicked thought entered her mind; She was wrong! She really was going to die!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then with an audible POP, Natasha found herself collapsing unceremoniously onto a hard, cold surface, pain shooting through her shoulder as she gasped for air and wincing as the sharp coldness filled her lungs as she rolled to her knees, hacking up globs of gold that pooled on the hard and impossibly deep green floor beneath her, reflecting an off-color but instantly familiar face up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait...Holy shit!' With a final hack Natasha flopped backwards onto her rear and stared down at her re-constituted form. Or at least, a version of it. Instead of flesh and bone, her arms and the rest of her body were made out of shifting, prismatic crystal that reflected the bright, pale green light that sat far, far above her. Natasha clambered to her feet, finding that she was completely naked, and that her entire body was now comprised of the crystals. She wore no clothes, and she felt something expanding from her back. She whipped her head around and sent her equally crystallized hair flailing and gasped in surprised as a pair of butterfly wings expanded outwards from her shoulders and lower back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then her attention was drawn to a noise next to her, and she looked to see two other crystal versions of herself suddenly appear in the air and fall the deep green ground. The crystal twins hacked and groaned as they went through the same process as Natasha had just moments ago. She rushed over to what she immediately knew was her sisters, equally reconstituted as she had been, and helped them to their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha was just about to fill her sisters in when a sharp cough interrupted her, and she looked up to see...Another version of her fluttering down from out of the light?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it seems you FINALLY got here. I was wondering what was taking so long. Writer's block, I suppose\" The...other her said, with a casual dismissive wave towards the ball of light, which flickered as if it was annoyed. \"Anyway, welcome to the Index, and my name is Sandy. Don't bother telling me yours, I already know, thanks. And no, Ms. Exposition, you don't need to explain things. Just let me talk, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha was taken aback for a moment before simply nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you three made an oopsie. You broke the Ahn'Ger Stone, that's the gemstone you were using to make the wishes, and ended up giving your magically created forms so that another Stone could be made and go on and further the story in other ways. Since The Author-\" Sandy said, pointing a finger upwards at the ball of light, \"Felt sorry for you and had an idea, you get to continue existing as individuals...but you'll be Editors now. I guess you could call yourselves Moderators or DMs of the story, I suppose\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...the new Stone...When we fell into the tunnel I could tell that it was copying parts of us!\" Natasha said as she and her sisters looked at each other in confusion. Sandy let loose an annoyed sigh and tapped her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, we only get so much time to say, and you already wasted it with your dramatic entrance, okay? Each Stone in the Multiverse is sentient to a degree. Because it is powered by anger and malice, it copies off of the beings that use it so that it can mess with any future wishes. That's why it never gives a user what they want, it's always got to have a downside. And also why it sometimes manages to escape and find new people to torture\" Sandy said, explaining it loudly and slowly as if she was speaking to a group of small children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, make ME be the jerk\" Sandy said, turning to the orb of light and giving it the finger before turning back to the three VERY confused sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what's a Multiverse?\" Ursula asked, timidly raising a hand as if she was trying to ask a stupid question in a classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh\" Sandy groaned before reaching out and grabbing Natasha's wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW! Hey!\" She yelped, swiping at Sandy with a shimmering hand, but stopped when she saw what the strange entity had done. There, on Natasha's new wing...Was a screen that was showing multiple different versions of herself, and even different people! She actually recognized the boy that was showing up a lot more than she was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because you WERE the boy!\" Sandy said, somehow knowing what Natasha was thinking. \"The Multiverse is infinite dimensions and planes of existence. Everything that CAN happen DOES happen, though thankfully WE make sure things stay interesting and PG-13, R at best. That's what we do, and that's now your job as well. That's the condensed version since we're running out of time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?\" Ursula said, scratching her head. She looked at her own wing, which was blank, in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"there's no time to explain further. You're each going to act as 'life preservers' for the Multiverse. When things get boring, you go in and mix things up a little and give the audience a hint of something bigger at play, okay? Good!\" Sandy said, and waved a hand as three portals opened up beneath their feet..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natasha, you get to go offer Bill options to bring back 'classic' universes. Don't worry, you'll know what to say. Gloria, you get to go invoke Godzilla-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-And Ursula, well, we haven't found a way to work you in yet so you get to sit in the break room until figure out something for you. Bye girls! Have fun, and remember, be creative!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a SCHLOOP and three identical shrieks of terror, the three new arrivals were sucked into the golden portals and whisked away to other adventures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy looked upwards at the orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Learn to condense next time, would you? We already had to modify and get rid of the whole 'giant pyramid of desks' where all the other Editors work on the story' bit. And then all the dramatic 'oh noes, we're going to die!' sisterly stuff that you wanted. Just like that dumb '666' chapter you wrote and had to delete over and over. Yeesh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orb of light flickered and shuddered as if in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah. We've already talked about chapter length and how it contributes to less views. But I know you won't change so whatever. Hopefully the ones paying attention will get something out of this weirdo chapter anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy floated towards the light and took her place at a rather unimaginative desk with a keyboard and computer. She arranged her minimal things and looked straight ahead, as if at someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hope you enjoyed this. You'll see more of us in the future, maybe. But for now, this storyline is now at\"</span></div></div>",

Warn me the next time you're gonna retro-actively change things? Now my head is all woozy from causality. Not that, uh, anyone that hadn't seen this before is going to be able to tell the difference\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun-like sphere flickered, and Sandy suddenly found herself far away from it, standing outside of a small square box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Guess we DID find a use for you...\" She said, as new information filled her brain. She shrugged and walked forward, an opening appearing as she approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsula tapped her foot while she sat in the rather plain looking 'waiting room' that she had unceremoniously been deposited into. There was no clock to watch, no magazines to look at...There wasn't even a door! The only thing that was in the short green couch that was about as comfortable as something seemingly hewn out of green crystal could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsula brought up the long strands of hair that twinkled in the source-less light that filled the room, watching as it glimmered and refracted and shone through her new body. This was so totally weird, one minute she was fighting with her sisters, then enxt minute they had superpowers and the next minute they were being sucked through some kind of inter-dimensional tunnel, coming out the far end looking like one of those expensive little jewel models! And then that bossy little 'Sandy' version of her said they were basically dead! The really confusing conversation about the 'Multiverse' (whatever that was) sounded like 'Sandy' was putting them all to work for a giant glowing ball for the rest of eternity...Until Sandy had rushed through saying there was no way to 'slot her in' and promptly split the trio up, which Natasha and Gloria being whisked away on 'jobs' immediately while Ursula was stuck with nothing to do because 'they hadn't found a way to fit her in yet'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing the former Vanapolous knew, she was dropped in this dull little room with nothing to do but play with her hair (which despite it's current appearance, Ursula still was absolutely thrilled about having) and the big wings that had sprouted from her back. She'd always liked long hair on girls, though she wasn't really sure why. How long had she been in here? She was really starting to miss her sisters, especially Natasha and even (just a little bit) Gloria! And after she'd quickly mastered the ability to float and fly (which wasn't all that different from cheerleading) she had quickly grown bored, and that boredom had eventually begun to manifest into nervousness, and then full blown anxiety. With no stimulation or distraction, things were starting to get to her. What if she had been forgotten? What if this was just her life now for the rest of time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as her crystal hair began to curl and frizzle from anxiety, there was a chiming sound as a door opened on one of the walls as Sandy floated in, looking as bored as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, toots\" She began, \"So it looks like we may have an opening for you I can't promise anything long-term, but if you pull off your audition you could start climbing ladders. And no, don't ask me any questions, the fourth wall is properly secured against meta commentary and humor. The most I can tell you is that this is largely a contract job, and your supervisor is an Editor we've been really impressed by\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsula couldn't think of anything to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, that's a great way to extend the chapter length\" Sandy said, rolling her eyes, \"Listen, just come with me. It's better if you don't talk, since we're not really sure if you're just supposed to be a bit dumb or full on bimbo yet, okay?\" Sandy slung an arm around Ursula's winged shoulders and guided her through the door which slammed shut behind them. Ursula turned to look back at her prison but there was nothing there, simply more green-black void.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" She started, only to be interrupted by a groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is basically a realm of pure creation and imagination. Anything is possible here. Once you've done this job it should, more or less, start making a bit more sense. Consider it on the job training\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" It reminded Ursula of the very short lived job she'd had after school, working as a cashier for a local car wash. The manager had showed her the basic ropes for the cash register and then left her to deal with a horde of old ladies and ladies her mother's age and then a couple of pretty horny boys that were clearly just there to hit on her. She'd quit the next day when the manager needed her to wash his son's car, despite the fact the car wash was self-serve and automated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, spoiler alert, didn't really happen. But that's neither here or there. I mean what IS reality, or memory, if just the perception of events filtered through a mixture of chemical and electrical signals in your brain? I mean, if I told you now that you were originally a eighteen year old All American athlete who was dating your sister? In a fictional story made up by multiple individuals as a recreation of an older life you never lived that was originally written by a fascimile of me? Or the fact that you've never lived at ALL, would you believe me?\" Sandy waved her hand as the two walked through the emptiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" Ursula suddenly felt a rather intense and crushing feeling of existential terror at what the (other) strange green woman was saying and stopped in her tracks. Sandy floated her way out of a stumble and turned to stare at Ursula with a look of what might have been taken as sympathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. Sorry, don't mean to get all 'Morpheus' on you. Maybe I just should have led with 'You think that's air you're breathing now' and left it at that but the Big Guy likes to make his references\" Sandy pointed upwards, where a small light source shimmered. \"And yes, that WAS were you were when you arrived. Don't think about it too much, everything here only makes as much sense as how each person interprets it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh\" Suddenly Ursula just wanted her sisters. And her mom. But now she wasn't sure if any of those were real...What if her mom wasn't her mom? What if...What if...Ursula sniffled a bit as the crushing implications of, well, everything began to settle down upon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey don't be so glum! This was supposed to be a FUNNY chapter! But clearly it got away from us. So much for the meta-proofing on the fourth wall. Anyway, we're here!\" Sandy patted the distraught teen on the back and pointed off to the side, where a small desk was waiting. There was an older looking computer, possibly from the 90s or early 2000s sitting on it, as well as an older rotary phone. None of the devices had any visible power cords, but somehow Ursula knew they both worked perfectly. Two small file trays that had the word 'OUT' and 'IN' taped to the side sat on the edge of the desk. Ursula blinked away the tears and walked towards it, touching the surface. It felt the same as the couch in the 'waiting room' had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, we're either all made out of crystal here or energy given a defined shape. This isn't a Hilton\" Sandy rolled her eyes, glaring up at the small, distant green-gold sun above them, which blinked once in what felt like the equivalent of a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...What do I do?\" Ursula asked as she tried to keep her composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple. There's a new project starting up and since it's a little vague in origin, we got an offer by one of the Editors there to possibly elaborate on giving the new cast of unfortunates. They heard we were looking for something to do with you so...You get a shot at the Big Time, even more than your sisters are getting\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...You're not telling me WHAT I have to do!\" Ursula was getting fed up with this Sandy character and her casual cruelness. Though she wasn't sure now if that was just who Sandy was or if it was just being stuck in this...place for who knew how long, of if that was just how...how she was being written. Was being unsure and clueless how Ursula was supposed to be 'written'? Did any of this mean ANYTHING at all?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, enough with the existential shit. Here's the job. Right now, all you need to do is sit here at this desk, and when the phone rings you write down whatever it is you're told to write down on this notecard\" Sandy waved her hand and a rather generic looking notecard appeared on the desk with a flash of glitter, \"When you're done, you place it into the 'Outbox'. Then whenever something shows up in the 'Inbox', you type it into the computer. The Inbox will clean itself out. Don't worry about not knowing anything about programming, the computer will do most of the work for you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. So I've gone through all of this...Just to be an Intern?\" Ursula said incredulously, feeling suddenly extremely insulted on top of anxious and afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it. Good luck with the plug, Toots!\" Sandy said with a smirk and suddenly blinked away, leaving Ursula stranded and alone. After a long moment of conflicting feelings, she sighed and reluctantly sat down at the desk, a chair materializing out of the green floor almost on command and she lowered her crystalline rear into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she had gotten comfortable, the phone rang. She looked at it with trepidation and slowly reached out, picking it up with two shimmering fingers and brought it to her ear, afraid of whatever new nightmare may or may not leap out at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Ursula\" the voice on the other end said, \"Please write down the following. Feel free to give it some friendly personality but do NOT divulge any details as to what you may or may not currently know, or where you are now. Are you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes?\" She squeaked, pushing a strand of her hair behind her free ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.

My mom always taught me to never take no for an answer, and I'm not taking one today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe that's why you're such a spoiled brat.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow DARE you!? God, if only you knew how rough I had it. If only you knew what I've had to go through, how hard I've had to work to get where I am. All of this, Bill? The clothes, the money. My mom never gave me any of it! I've been working my ass off ever since I was twelve, saving up every last penny. I don't even have a car! My mom doesn't even know about Tom! She won't allow me to date anyone, so I've had to sneak behind her back to do it! Didn't you ever wonder why it's always me going to Tom's house and not the other way around? Because if she ever saw Tom, I'd be grounded for life! I'd never be allowed to leave my room!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm...I'm sorry\u201d said Bill. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria relaxed and relented a little bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's OK, Bill. You didn't know. You don't have a crazy control freak for a parent. You don't know what it's like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill had felt bad about this entire situation to the point where he had momentarily forgotten about his gemstone, still glowing in Gloria's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSometimes...I just wish I had somebody that I had somebody. A brother, a sister...anybody who knew what it feels like!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Gloria finished her dramatic soliloquy, the Ahn'Ger stone flared its cold, emerald light. Gloria noticed the stone had grown very cold and dropped it to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she picked it up, Bill was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his place stood a six year old girl. The girl bore a strong resemblance to Gloria. Her long black hair was covered by a pink headband and her green eyes were sparkling, suggesting some sort of mischief that she was planning to unleash very soon. She was clearly a fan of Disney, as her long pink skirt was covered in the various Disney princesses, and her backpack carried the icons of Anna and Elsa on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat just happened?\u201d she said in her high pitched, little girl voice. When she heard it, she was immediately mortified. She looked up and saw Gloria, standing there with the Ahn'Ger stone in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Natasha\u201d said Gloria with an impatient air in her voice, albeit one that sounded much more benevolent tone that she had spoken to with Bill a moment ago. \u201cMom couldn't take you to school today, so I'm walking you and I don't want to be late.\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

On the one hand, he remembered being Bill Strasserman, brother of Kimberly, Daughter of Martha, best friend of Tom, and at most casual acquaintance to Gloria by means of her being his best friend's Girlfriend. Fleeting memories of trying out for the baseball team and competitive Mario Kart against Tom filtered through his mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut also popping up were memories of being Natasha Vanapolous, Younger sister of Gloria, daughter of Ariadne, best friends with someone named Becky. Random memories of him begging his mom... Ariadne to go to Disney World this summer, and getting her hair done with Gloria now popped up alongside his baseball and Mario Kart ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill/Natasha was all disjointed in the head. Competeing versions of his life wrestled around in his head, and he had to do something to fix this before he went crazy... or possibly forgot the Bill part of him. But what could have done this? How could he possibly have two lives in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother memory popped up. One that was common in both of his mental realities... The Green Flash... the stone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill/Natasha looked over to Gloria. In one hand, she held her now younger sister's. The other held the stone that Bill had found this morning. It had to be that stone! And that Stone had to be the way to fix all this, to get her mind straight before it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green eyes of Natasha flaired with thought as Bill and Gloria approached JFK Elementary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, kiddo.

Somehow, that stone he found on his porch had warped reality in this bizarre fashion to where he was now Gloria's adorable little sister Natasha...a sister that hadn't even existed until just moments ago! Bill didn't know Gloria very well, but he knew enough to know that she was an only child. He didn't know how the Ahn'Ger stone had done this, he just knew that he needed it back if he ever wanted to return to his own body. He knew that if he didn't get it out of Gloria's hands and like soon, he would be trapped as Natasha, possibly for the rest of his life. He didn't even LIKE Gloria, much less wanting to be related to her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGloria\u201d he said in Natasha's cute lisp, looking up to her big sister. \u201cCan I see that pretty gemstone in your hand?\u201d. She pointed at Gloria's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh this?\u201d said Gloria, half forgetting she had it or even remembering where it had come from. \u201cSure. Just make sure nobody steals it from you, Nat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria bent down and casually gave Bill/Natasha the Ahn'Ger stone. She then grabbed Bill/Natasha by her little shoulders and kissed her gently on the forehead. \u201cStay safe. I love you, and Mom loves you too. I'll pick you up at 3:00 P.M\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the entire time Bill had been acquainted with Gloria, he had never seen her act so selflessly towards another person. He remembered the fights with Tom, the mean girl bullshit with her little clique, the constant playing of the victim card when she couldn't accept responsibility for screwing up. He had to admit that in this reality, for all of her faults, Gloria was at least a good sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow go run along. See, there's Becky!\u201d said Gloria, pointing towards another little girl that apparently was Natasha's friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill smiled and said \u201cBye Gloria, see you later!\u201d and walked off with the stone, putting it in Natasha's backpack.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Bill spends the morning in classes, enjoying being a little kid again. During lunchtime, he heads to the bathroom to try and change back into his original body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: At some point, Bill loses the Ahn'Ger Stone and it's found by someone else.

For all the issues that had just come up in his life, he had to admit that he was in a new reality ,and for now he had to play by the rules of this reality, lest he get himself in more trouble. If he just started wishing for something and then a teacher took the stone away? Or a kid tries to bully it out of him? He couldn't risk losing it, so for now, he was gonna wait, and he was gonna be Natasha for a bit, until he could get some alone time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd admittedly, that time as Natasha was a blast. Bill found he could put himself on a sort of auto-pilot thing, where he would just naturally be Natasha. So he did so at points, letting Natasha get some spelling questions wrong, since no first grader would be perfect just yet. But he took control to color just a little bit outside the lines, and during a break-time where the kids played that old classic Heads Up, 7-Up. Bill found himself laughing more than a few times, and genuinely, it was nice to be a kid again, even if he was a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut soon, it was lunch, and after a nice meal of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and some milk. Bill decided it was time to get serious. So, he made his way to the bathroom, took the Frozen backpack he had now, and took out that stone. Starring at it for a moment, in a sort of wonder about its power, he decided to make a wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I were myself again!\" Bill said, his little girl voice echoing in the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill looked to the stone again. Maybe he worded it wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I was Bill Strasserman again!\" Bill said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little frustrated now, Bill tried to take things one at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I were a boy again!\" Bill said. The stone glowed for a slight second, then extinquished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill was getting really mad now. He couldn't be stuck like this! As much fun as he had as a kid, Bill didn't want to be Gloria's sister! He wanted to be Bill! As his anger grew, the stone glowed again, This time, Bill didn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Bill blurts out \"I Wish I were an Adult!\" making him an adult version of Natasha, now a teacher at the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: At the peak of his anger, the Natasha Auto-Pilot takes over, and Natasha wishes her deepest desire: To be a Disney character.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bill still hadn't quite grasped how the Ahn'Ger stone worked. He thought that it worked like the magic lamp from Aladdin. He thought that all he needed to do was make a wish, and said wish would be granted. He didn't yet notice that only anger, blind fury, was the key towards unlocking its power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made a couple of more attempts at wishing to be himself again, forcefully stating \u201cI wish to be Bill Strasserman!\u201d like an incantation before eventually realizing the futility of what he was doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he was getting mad. Mad enough to not entirely understand what he was saying. As he stared in the mirror at his little six year old self, Bill screamed \u201cI WISH WERE AN ADULT!\u201d, and at last the gemstone in his hand started to glow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally!\u201d he said in Natasha's lispy six year old vocalization as the mysterious artifact held openly in her hand turned deathly cold and scanned its vibrant luster all over her body. When the glow faded back into the gemstone, Bill stared at his new form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo put it short, it was not what he had expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! How!\u201d he said in a voice that was still female but now of a slightly deeper adult tenor. He glared at his new body. It still wasn't his own! If anything, it looked like how Gloria would look if she were a few years older. A purse had materialized from nowhere on top of the counter. Reluctantly, Bill searched it, hoping to find a driver's license. Thankfully he found one:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNATASHA VANAPOULOS. DOB: 5/8/1995. Sex: F. Hair: Blk. Eyes: Green. Height: 5'8. Weight: 115lbs. Address: 568 Beaumont Avenue<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the wallet and the gemstone back in her purse, Bill pondered with trepidation over what had just happened. He had just altered reality even farther away from its origin point. Now, instead of being Bill or being Gloria's little sister...apparently now he was her older sister, a grown adult. This rock...this magic rock...it seemed to work on anger. That was weird. How  would Bill be able to control it if he couldn't think straight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as he was worried about how to return to normal, Bill also realized that he was in the little girl's room, and lunchtime was going to be over in a few minutes. What should he do!? Where should he go now? Did he work here? He stared in the mirror again, hopelessly lost.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit\u201d he said in his soft new voice as if noticing for the first time. \u201cI'm hot, aren't I?\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, she was. The grown up Natasha was a total knockout, both the youngest and easily the most physically attractive teacher at JFK Elementary School, and she was the object of lust for many of the older fifth and sixth grade students(And no doubt some of the other teachers). She had thick, pouty lips, vibrant green eyes, a youthful yet intelligent looking face, and a killer body that appeared like she took good care of herself. Natasha was wearing a pretty white sweater and some black slacks, as well as some sensible ballet flats on her feet, but in Bill's mind, this woman whose body he was now inhabiting could have been wearing a burlap sack while covered in mud and she still would have taken his breath away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill wanted to stare at his new reflection forever, but he realized that it was now one minute until the end of lunchtime. Instinctively, he grabbed the adult Natasha's purse, slung it over her shoulder, and walked outside the bathroom. As Bill passed by the classroom he had been in all morning, Ms Wick's class, he noticed that the panel next to the door which described her job had changed. Instead of saying \u201cMs. Wick- 1st Grade\u201d, it now said \u201cMs. Vanapoulos- Kindergarten\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill, wondering what this was all about, stepped inside. The room and its ornaments had changed a little bit from when he was in here an hour ago, seemingly fit for an even younger audience than the first graders Bill had hung out with all morning. \u201cNot good\u201d thought Bill to himself. The students were already in their seats, anxious to finish their lessons so they could go back home. Bill hesitantly walked to the front of the room, not knowing what else to do, and found a lesson plan sitting on Ms. Wick's desk. It was all written in his handwriting. He turned around and saw a squadron of five year olds staring intently at him. Or rather, her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood afternoon Miss Vanapoulos!\u201d shouted the students in a boisterous sing-song chant, mostly in unison, with a couple of them mispronouncing Natasha's last name and the more socially awkward ones singing slightly off key with the rest of the group or simply not joining along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite this morning being the single weirdest day of his young life, with his entire sense of what was possible in this world being thrown out the window, sweet little kids always needed tending to, and Bill wasn't going to deny them an education. He had already spent the morning as a student. Why not spend the rest of the day as a teacher? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys!\u201d he said with a smile in Natasha's surprisingly maternal voice. \u201cSo today we're going to start learning about Roman numerals and writing in cursive letters...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Bill/Natasha spends the rest of the day as a Kindergarten teacher while dealing with all of the typical problems: Kids picking on each other, kids not paying attention, and one student who has a crush on her. After school ends, Bill receives a text on Natasha's cell phone from her boyfriend, who wants to take her out on a date tonight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Something else<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Like with his little girl form, Bill let the Natasha auto-pilot take over occasionally, mostly for the actual teaching stuff. Bill was able to handle a lot more as the adult Natasha though, so when his former BFF Becky Summers and Caroline Reed were chatting with each other, Bill was the one who got them to pay attention. It seemed as if Natasha had talked to them about this before, so they focused pretty soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring a coloring break, Bill had to deal more troubles that Teacher Natasha was probably mored than used to. Xavier Deval was stealing Francis Young's crayons, so Bill had to step in. And of course there was Trevor Windham, who liked to tell Natasha that she was really pretty, and that he wanted to take her on a date like his big brother does with his girlfriend. Natasha's memories popped into Bill's head, telling him that this was a recurring problem. Bill went to Natasha mode, and Natasha reponded with the usual \"I'm a little too old for you, plus I'm spoken for.\" Bit, and Bill wondered if this was something to bring up with Mr. and Mrs. Windham at Parent Teacher conferences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the Natasha side collected up the colored drawings to put up around the room, the Bill side paused for a moment. Wait... did the Natasha side of him say that she was \"spoken for?\" As in... she was actually dating someone? Bill somehow couldn't process this information. Bill had never been on a date in his life. He was the type of guy that girls were friendly towards but never really found attractive. And Bill was cool with that, at least for now. Suddenly, he was a beuatiful woman with a probably beautiful boyfriend? How the heck was he gonna handle this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he knew it, the class was over. The students excitedly ran out of the classroom, ready to meet their waiting parents. Bill grabbed Natasha's purse, and started to head out, when he felt the buzz of a cell phone go off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill took Natasha's perfectly manicured hands and picked up the phone. It was a text from Frank Andrews. \"Date tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill found himself in such a shock that the Natasha personality instantly took over. She smiled, and dialed Frank's number in her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey babe.\" A male voice answered on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sweetie. Got your text.\" Natasha responded. At this point, Bill was just along for the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I didn't want to interrupt story time with the kids.\" Frank said, a jovial kidding in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Tuesday. You know Tuesday is coloring day.\" Natasha responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. Story Time is just a funnier line.\" Frank said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm down. What are you thinking?\" Natasha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner and a movie? I know you have all those intense 20 page papers to grade, but...\" Frank started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, It was coloring day. All I got to do tonight is feed Marcy and I'm free. Dinner and a movie sounds lovely. What are we seeing?\" Natasha bit her lip and smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Bill could think right now was Who Was Marcy? Probably a pet of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's that movie Blockers. With your favorite guy in the world.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I've already told you, if John Cena comes busting down my door and wants to take me away on an Alaskan Cruise, there's at least some debate! But I'd probabl choose you anyways.\" Natasha teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that is a very specific circumstance... but he's single now, so I can't take any chances.\" Frank retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's a date then. Pick me up at 7?\" Natasha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan. Bye babe.\" Frank said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you tonight!\" Natasha said, hanging up, and headed to her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell... It seemed like Bill was going on a date tonight. What a strange day this had turned out to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Natasha/Bill returns to Natasha's home to feed Marcy, get ready for their date, and to discovery more about the life of Natasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Natasha gets another phone call.

He was now an adult, a woman, Gloria's older sister, and was employed as a Kindergarten teacher. What madness would happen next? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill stared at his purse, which held the gemstone which did this to him. When he first found the damn thing, he had wanted it appraised, hoping he could sell it and raise some money, but knowing now how powerful it was, Bill wasn't planning to part ways with it anytime soon. He turned on the radio, and unfortunately Taylor Swift was playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind on autopilot, Bill allowed Natasha's memories to decide how to drive home. Bill winced a little as his new body passed by his own house on the way, already growing a little homesick. However, said homesickness didn't last long once Natasha turned a corner and drove down Beaumont Avenue. She reached her home, a modest but cute one story affair, and she parked her car into the domicile's driveway. Bill got out, remembering the lock the doors. He reached the house, found Natasha's house key in her purse and walked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe home was cute! It was fairly Spartan in nature, not being decorated very much, but it was functional. Bill turned his head around, looking at everything when he found a wall of framed pictures situated near the home phone. One was of Natasha as a little six year old girl standing next to a woman, presumably her mother, who was holding a baby in her arms. It didn't take Bill long to realize that said baby was probably Gloria as an infant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother photo showed Natasha as a teenager acting in a play, and another as a cheerleader. Another showed her graduating from college in cap and gown, and yet another showed her first day on the job teaching school. This one was taken fairly recently, in September of last year. It seems like this was Natasha's introductory year as an educator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u201d said Bill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill walked into the kitchen and saw a cute puppy, a corgi, sleeping on the black and white checked linoleum floor.

She was wagging her tail, and Bill knelt down to pet her and hug her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod, I love you\u201d said Natasha as Marcy licked her face, Bill allowing her to resume control once again. He let Natasha play with Marcy for a few minutes, and then after enough play time, she went off to go find the doggy food, which was in a pantry near the basement stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Bill wanders around the rest of the house and discovers some secrets about Natasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Bill gets dressed and made up in preparation for date night and then heads to Frank's house . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Bill decided that since Frank was taking him out to dinner later, that he didn't need to have anything big right now. Bill just grabbed a granola bar from the cabinet and started to snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Bill thought about how crazy that was. He had an attractive man taking him out! Bill smirked as he considered what meant. It was really weird and impossible... and yet he sort of liked it? He didn't know if Natasha's love for Frank was seeping into him, or if this was just a nice change of pace from his sad sack life as Bill. As much as he knew he should return reality to its normal... reality, he sort of wanted to explore this life a little more. It certainly was better and more interesting than what was happening to him before this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bill finished his snack, he decided to actually explore a bit more. Why not? He was Natasha now, might as well figure out more about this woman's life. He exited the kitchen and back to the main living room. As he observed before, the apartment wasn't too fancy, other than the pictures on the wall. Natasha had a decent sized TV, with plenty of interesting movie choices and a nice little record collection. Again nothing too fancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill decided to head into Natasha's bedroom, which is where he would find a real surprise...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bill walked into Natasha's bedroom. Like the rest of her home, it was cute and simple. Nothing too fancy, but decidedly girlish. Her walls were a ethereal white, almost glowing, not a single imperfection being noticed by Bill's eye. Her bedspread was pink, with a couple of teddy bears keeping guard on top of her large fluffy pillows, and the bed itself was nice and bouncy as Bill sat down to examine the tactile experience of it. The bedroom television was quite nice. Everything was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill laid Natasha's head on the pillows and stared at the ceiling for a few minutes, pondering what to do. He had been given a once in a lifetime opportunity to live someone else's life. He had just been given definitive proof that the supernatural exists. Somehow, he felt like he didn't truly appreciate the magnitude of these discoveries. Not that he'd be able to prove that he had discovered a magic wishing rock that warped reality when you were angry, that would never hold under scrutiny in a laboratory environment, but still...once he got tired of being Natasha, he should do something with this knowledge, right? Was it his responsibility to share it with the world, or to be a Good Samaritan and perform altruistic deeds with it? When Bill momentarily got lost in his own ruminations, the \u201cautopilot\u201d function took over. Natasha rose from the bed and began to search her closet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh\u201d thought Bill. \u201cShe must be looking for an outfit for her date with Frank tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Bill's massive surprise, behind the designer red polka dot dress was something he never would have thought a Kindergarten teacher to have: A Heckler &amp; Koch  MP5 submachine gun. Natasha pulled it out. She examined it briefly, as if already familiar with it, and set it aside on the floor. She then pulled out a small metal box with a thumbprint scanner. She also set that aside and began to get dressed for her date. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck is going on here?\u201d thought Bill, now on the edge of his mental seat. Once she was fully dressed in that cute polka dot dress and a pair of Jimmy Choo heels, Natasha  pressed her thumb to the biometric scanner, and like magic, the metal box clicked open. Inside was a device that looked like something Q would develop for 007. It was a small, circular oddity, no larger than perhaps a poker chip, and Bill had no idea what it could possibly be used for. She took it out and put it in a hidden compartment of her purse. She then took the submachine gun and hid it behind a secret panel in the closet. She shut the closet door and secured it with a small, almost imperceptible hidden lock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, a maelstrom of Natasha's memories suddenly poured into Bill's mind, causing him to experience a severe headache. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were memories of Natasha as a little kid, but they were of a little kid doing things that no little kid should be doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemories of heavy weapons training in some godforsaken desert in 100 degree weather. Memories of stalking various criminals and political targets for days at a time to get a rhythm of their day to day routines. Countless hours of rotely memorizing different languages, accents, postures, and behaviors. Memories of all the injuries she acquired learning dozens of martial arts styles, and not just the kind used for self defense, the kinds that maim and kill. Memories where a dark haired woman- her mother(!)- and countless agents who would abuse and condition her in all manner of ways until she was molded into the perfect little soldier. Fierce when she needs to be. A seductress when she needs to be. Sweet when she needs to be. A walking encyclopedia of the U.S government's every extra-legal action to impose its empire on unwilling participants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill recalled the first time Natasha murdered in cold blood for her country, and the look of shock on the man's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe recalled Natasha's memories of the Red Room, which were too painful for even her to consider, and therefore were quite cloudy and hazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then when Bill came upon a terrifying realization. Natasha Vanapoulos wasn't a Kindergarten teacher. That was just a front. Natasha Vanapoulos was actually a living weapon. A spook. A spy and an assassin. A hired killer for her country. Up until recently, she was essentially Hit-Girl or Natalie Portman in Leon The Professional. Now she was all grown up and earning a reputation as a real life Black Widow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was on a mission. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Natasha is actually after Frank's father, who unbeknownst to Frank is involved in organized crime like drug and human trafficking. Natasha is using Frank to get to him, and using him to get to a very big deal terrorist that he does business with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Frank was the son of a man named Zachary Andrews, a local big business man, pretty successful and pretty well respected amongst his peers. But Frank didn't know, and what Natasha did, was that Zachary's big business was just a front, a means to make even more money on the other side of the law, the side of the law that ran drugs and trafficked humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Natasha's intel had informed her that Zachary's latest business was selling arms to a notorious terror organization known simply as the Dark Oval. Natasha's agency had been looking for its leader for quite sometime now, and Natasha felt like she had the perfect in now: Through Frank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the years, Natasha learned that men will give up anything and anyone in the name of love. No matter where in the world they were from, or what type of person they were, Natasha could make them melt on a dime, and from there it was all lollypops and pancakes. Frank seemed like a genuinely nice dude, but Natasha had a job to complete, and Frank was her key in. Her hope here was to get Frank to invite her to meet the parents, at which point she hoped to get a closer look at Frank's operation, and maybe find an entry point later to sneak in and grab a few filles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all mindblowing for Bill. He had been a casual James Bond fan, enjoying the classics like Goldfinger and Goldeneye, and of course, he knew of Black Widow and Mission Impossible and all of that ilk. But now, he was in a real life version of that. He was in the body of a badass, coldhearted killing machine. This was insane. And Bill couldn't help to admit that he sort of liked being along for the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Suddenly, agents of the Dark Oval storm Natasha's apartment. Bill is amazed as Natasha takes them all out, as the Natasha part of him begins to suspect that Frank may know more than he lets on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Natasha goes on her date, and successfully seduces Frank into letting her meet his parents. Bill gets more and more into the spy life, feeling the same addiction Natasha feels for it.</span></div></div>",

Despite reality being changed to where he WAS Natasha now, he wasn't merely inhabiting someone else's body, Bill still didn't feel 100% comfortable being a grown woman. He liked it so far, but he was pretty sure that the novelty would wear off sooner than later. Then again, maybe he would grow into loving being Natasha, and  it would just take him a little more time for him get used to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, other than his small fear of losing his real identity, Bill was impressed otherwise by this weird new turn in his life. Natasha had a very cute looking bedroom. It was slightly more furnished than the living room was, with posters for  Heathers: The Musical and Welcome To Night Vale adorning the wall, a bookshelf with a lot of interesting books, and a cute Heathcliff alarm clock on her dresser. Bill smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe afternoon daylight imbued the room with a golden glow, making everything seem brighter and friendlier, and Bill imagined that Natasha struggled to get out of bed sometimes because it was just so NICE being in here. It was like all the troubles of the world- war, strife, hate- didn't exist here. It was an oasis of tranquility, Natasha's inner sanctum of peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill moved on and began to search Natasha's closet. It was filled with a fine array of clothing, a mixture of comfy, practical, work, and flirty. Bill picked out a cute polka dot dress for tonight's date with Frank, which he assumed was partially influenced by Natasha's personality. He laid it on the pink bedspread. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill imagined how he would look in the dress when suddenly, his memories...Natasha's memories forced him to recall something else. Allowing her body to go on autopilot, Bill turned around and walked inside the closet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is she looking for?\u201d Bill wondered to himself, laughing that he essentially had a split personality now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha bent down and slid a hidden panel in the closet to the right, and turned on a hidden light from within the cavity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill saw what was inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA helmet. A mask. A pair of gloves. A pair of boots. A cape. A symbol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashes of memories past appeared before Bill like a movie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Natasha recalls her late father, who unbelievably was an alien from another planet who came to Earth and eventually fell in love with Ariadne, Natasha's mother. When he died, he passed his costume onto Natasha. The costume gives her many powers like superhuman strength, superhuman speed, the ability to fly, and other strange powers. She tries to use it to make the world a better place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Natasha is a street level vigilante superhero like Batman or Daredevil. She dresses in this costume at night and busts corrupt cops, organized crime, etc using her almost superhumanly acute fighting skills, weapons, and homemade gadgets. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bill made his way to the bedroom, seeking to find out more information about his new life, be it permanent or temporary. Natasha's bedroom was just as clean as the rest of the apartment was, a queen sized bed dominating the room and decorated in large, poofy purple pillows and comforters. It actually looked pretty comfortable, which Bill confirmed the moment he laid his new body down on the mattress for a moment, sinking down into a soft canyon of fabric. He laid there for a moment, a feeling of exhaustion from the long work day and the stress of having been so utterly changed. His new eyes fluttered for a moment and the embrace of sleep stretched out to welcome him...But the loud scratching at the door caused Bill's eyelids to flash back open as Natasha's personality re-asserted itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Marcy! You want in to see mommy?\" Natasha said, and she quickly pulled herself up off the bed and crossed the short distance to the door, opening it and letting the adorable mass of Corgi waddle itself in and take up residence on the bed where Natasha had been moments ago. Natasha herself followed her dog and gave it a swift kiss on the head before Bill resumed control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, ok. Now what?\" Bill said as he looked around the bedroom. Marcy, the dog, simply grunted and rolled over on the bed. \"Suppose I should start with trying to find out some more information if I'm really following through with this date...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of rifling through Natasha's personal items, phone numbers, doctor's appointments for routine check ups, a schedule, even a lesson plan, Bill finally stumbled upon a locked drawer at the bottom of the bedside table. After a few moments of struggling against the lock, Bill sighed and stood up, taking full notice of how Natasha's large breasts jiggled. It felt...normal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god\" Bill whispered, \"I really hope we're not...assimilating? Is that the right word?\" Indeed, Bill was afraid that the longer he stayed as Natasha, the more he'd start becoming her. Already he couldn't remember what he'd actually been in charge of today and what he'd let occur on autopilot. The thought of mentally fusing with this woman, truly becoming a Vanapolous, horrified the teenage boy. And then, unbidden, or perhaps caused by these fears, a memory, clearly Natasha's, floated to the surface of Bill's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the image of a key, stuck magnetically to the underside of the bedframe. It was what opened the locked drawer on the bedside table. Bill blinked and then crouched, a slender hand sliding up along the bottom of the queen bed's frame until manicured nails bumped across something long, flat and jagged. A simple clasp and tug of feminine muscle caused the key to slide loose from it's hidden location and Bill wasted no time in sticking it in the drawer's lock and turning it, the drawer sliding open just a tiny bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill left the key in the lock and the, despite the flair of strange emotions, anger, sadness, shame, suddenly rising in his throat, he pulled open the drawer and blinked at the handful of contents within. The top was a large, faded envelope, wrinkles at the neck where it had been opened many times. Beneath it was a small wooden box, featureless save for the claps and joints. Cautiously, Bill reached in and pulled out the envelope first, rising from his kneeling position and slowly, carefully undoing the seal-tie at the top and sliding the contents out on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, now in a jumble, were legal documents, work applications, four birth certificates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Bill whispered, despite something at the back of his mind screaming to put it all away. There were several copies of each document, one that looked like the original, and several others that had dates changed around, names removed or omitted. Bill carefully shuffled them back into a neat pile, and set them aside, reaching for the birth certificates. The first one, the older ones, were clearly for Natasha...But the information didn't make sense! One had Natasha's birthdate just a few years before Bill's, Gloria's, Tom's, but another one, an older one that looked far more official, had it thirteen years before any of them had been born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this was to be believed, Natasha wasn't twenty-three. She was actually thirty-one<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill dropped the papers back on the bed as if they had burned his hands, and after a moment, slowly reached for the second set. There, in official ink, was Gloria Vanapolous's name...But underneath them made a cold ball of dread form in Bill's stomach. On one set of papers was Natasha Vanapolous under 'Mother', and on the other, was one with the name \"Ariadne Vanapolous\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god\" Bill whispered and suddenly flashes of memories, vague and indistinct but full of emotion swept over him, causing the trapped teenage boy to let out something that sounded like a gasp of surprise and a sob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill dropped the second set of papers and reached down for the box, flipping the clasp and opening it. Inside was a faded, pink beanie, and a stack of polaroids, images of a much, much, much younger Natasha in a hospital gown, cradling a small newborn. Bill set the box down and, with no small amount of dread, held the beanie between two fingers while he flipped through the images, tears welling unbidden in his eyes. Pictures of a very pregnant, barely a teenager Natasha being wheeled into the hospital by Roman Vanapolous, Natasha's father, pictures of Ariadne sitting beside a frightened Natasha in a hospital bed, pictures of a group of doctors surrounding Natasha, and finally, pictures of a wailing newborn in various stages of post-delivery before settling back on Natasha cradling it, a look of fear, sadness, and joy on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill slowly set the photos down in the box before unrolling the small beanie in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, in a thin line of white fabric, was the name \"Gloria\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god\" Bill whispered, as memories from Natasha's life came flashing back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Natasha had been born to Roman and Ariadne Vanapolous, an only child. She had developed early, and three days after turning thirteen, had successfully romanced a classmate one day after school, not really knowing what she was doing. This had been a long time ago, halfway across the country. And then when she had gone to Ariadne, terrified of the changes happening to her body, the anger in her mother's eyes, the shame she felt, the need to pull Natasha out of public school out of embarassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you!\" Ariadne had screamed in her face, \"Do you know what this will do to us!?\" Ever the nurturing mother, Ariadne had been more concerned with image than the feelings of her daughter. Soon after Natasha was pulled from school, Ariadne and Roman had begun the process of looking for new positions, new jobs, new homes elsewhere before finally landing on Illinois. The secret meetings and bribes that Natasha's father, Roman, had to do to change Natasha's information, and the information for the baby, once she came. Ariadne would be the mother, of course, there was no way she would bear the shame of her thirteen year old daughter being a mother. Instead, it was arranged so that Ariadne and Roman had simply been trying for another child, and after years of failures, finally decided for a donor. That would explain any drastic visual differences in appearance. It had to. And Ariadne, of course, would acquire a new job, giving up her downtown NYC manger job to support her husband, as he moved across the country to Illinois to take a high paying corporate job, stepping down from his mid-upper level political office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll sacrifice for this family\" Ariadne had hissed at Natasha, the night she had been told of the plan, \"Someone has to\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then in just a few months, she was here, and Natasha had been rushed to the hospital, enduring hours and hours of labor and a looming C-Section before her little girl, Gloria, had popped out into the world. And no sooner had the Vanapolous family arrived home, they were moving, from New York to Illinois. The legal documents were all in place, the lie was ready to be spun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Natasha gave up her baby Gloria, becoming her big sister. It broke her heart every moment, seeing Gloria grow up thinking, calling Ariadne mom, calling her 'sis', and being strictly forbidden by Ariadne and Roman to ever acknowledge that Gloria was hers. Terrified of Ariadne's wrath, of being disowned and left in the wilderness, Natasha had complied. Over the years the pain dulled somewhat, learning how to play the role of the big sister, of graduating from home school and being funneled into this apartment as soon as possible, distance helping to maintain the lie, to hide the hurt. And thankfully, Natasha had aged exceedingly gracefully, whatever signs of aging she had, she had learned to hide with careful, skillful application of make-up.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the flood of memories slowed to a trickle, Bill tried his best not to collapse on the bed as he wiped the free flowing tears from his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is insane!\" He said with a sniffle, \"I'm Gloria's mom!\"</span></div></div>",

He thought that all he needed to do was make a wish, and said wish would be granted. He didn't yet notice that only anger, blind fury, was the key towards unlocking its power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made a couple of more attempts at wishing to be himself again, forcefully stating \u201cI wish to be Bill Strasserman!\u201d like an incantation before eventually realizing the futility of what he was doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that juncture when Bill was beside himself. He wasn't even angry. He was stressed out more than anything, confused by the seemingly capricious rules. He imagined the \u201cTime Is Collapsing\u201d music from Inception playing in his head, and Bill zoned out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...So Natasha zoned in. The six year old girl part of Bill's duel personality was now in control, and because he was growing more distraught, so was she. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha was overall a happy, well adjusted little girl, but the Vanapoulos household was inherently dysfunctional, and try as they might, Gloria and Ariadne could not hide that fact from Natasha's piercing observations. Natasha knew that her big sister Gloria and her mom weren't getting along. They were always fighting in the next room or downstairs, away from where they thought Natasha couldn't hear them. One night, after Gloria called her mom some bad words...well, Natasha had never heard anyone so angry as her mother. There was no physical abuse, but the sheer ugliness of the emotional manipulation that resulted from Gloria's one slip up was beginning to wear on the souls of both of Ariadne's daughters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at her backpack. Natasha loved Disney. She was a little girl, so of course she did, but Natasha truly identified with those movies. The magic and the gorgeous animation and the wonderful songs were what drew her in, but the stuff that spoke to her young soul was the emotional resonance. Natasha wished that she and Gloria could be as close of sisters as Elsa and Anna were. She wished that her mother was less like Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty and more like Eudora from The Princess &amp; The Frog. She wished that life could be more like a Disney movie. She was mad, wanting to be free instead of trapped in the Vanapoulos family home, which may as well have been the Evil Queen's castle from Snow White.</span></div></div>",

Natasha's beautiful green eyes at once became in perfect unison with the glow of the Ahn'Ger Stone, merging and disappearing from her reflection. Natasha noticed this beautiful and bizarre visual effect in the mirror as the magic changed her...changed Bill...changed both of them into something more, something greater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gemstone's magic slowly faded, and as both Bill and Natasha stood there, amazed at the light show...they were finally introduced to their new identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was unmistakable. The glittering blue dress. The blonde hair styled in an elaborate french braid. The soulful eyes betraying years of insecurity and crushing loneliness. Bill gasped at his reflection.  Bill was now Elsa from Frozen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, what did this damn thing do now?\u201d said Bill in Elsa's voice, sounding identical to Idina Menzel, as he put the gemstone on the bathroom counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs freaky as turning into Natasha had been, at least she was human. Elsa was a fictional character. Did...did Bill now have magical powers over ice and snow too? Could he create sentient snowman and snow monsters from nothing? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill stared at Elsa's pale hand and briefly concentrated. A burst of cool wind and snowflakes erupted from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Elsa is still a fictional character in this world, and when students and teachers see her roaming the hallways, they respond with a mixture of fan enthusiasm from the kids and adults that liked Frozen and confusion from everyone else over what she is doing here. Overwhelmed by all of this attention, Bill gets stressed out and accidentally causes a city-wide blizzard with Elsa's powers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Elsa, Arendelle, and everything we saw in Frozen all exist as real things in this new reality. Queen Elsa is currently on a whirlwind tour of the United States, briefly stopping by JFK elementary school to speak to and entertain the children there.</span></div></div>",

Somehow, this day had started with him finding a stone that led him to briefly become the sister of his friend's jerk ex-girlfriend, and now he was a fictional character from one of the most popular films ever made. How much crazier could this get?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elsa? Are you ready?\" A voice that sounded earily similar to Kristen Bell called to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill turned around, and starring straight at him was Anna, Elsa's sister! In his old reality, Bill's younger sister Kimberly had seen the film numerous times, so obviously Bill was familiar. So when he say the smile and bright eyes of Anna staring at him, he knew what this meant. It seemed now that the world of Arendelle, the world of Frozen, was part of this reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The kids are almost done with lunch, and they are so excited to see you!\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill legitimately didn't know how to respond. This was all so much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna took notice of this, and walked towards her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, everything OK? You're not gonna create an eternal winter on us again, are ya?\" Anna laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill just looked back in the mirror, looking at his golden hair and his stoic demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. Too soon?\" Anna said, putting her hand on Elsa's shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill didn't want to worry Anna any longer. Obviously this took place after the events of the movie, so he had a little insight into what his mindset should be. But part of him reached into the new Elsa side of him, and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna... This is all so crazy, you know? All these kids look up to me... and I don't want to.. let them down.\" Elsa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elsa... you're an amazing person, an amazing leader, and an amazing sister. Just go out there and be yourself! These kids love you, Elsa, they're not gonna be disappointed in you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna paused and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, if they are disappointed, you can always make a bunch of cool snowmen come alive to dance and also tackle them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill as Elsa couldn't help but to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna....\" He said, giving a light punch to her. Like with Natasha, it seemed easy to fall into the Elsa roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the bell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sis, that means we're up! Let's go!\" Anna said, nearly dragging her sister out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill made sure that Elsa grabbed the stone and held onto it. He didn't want someone else finding it and accidentally changing reality even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Elsa gives a presentation to the class about her life and her story, the kids want to see a demonstration of the snow powers, and Elsa grants their wish, as Bill more easily slips into Elsa's personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: During the presentation, one kid asks if Elsa has been Rapunzel or Ariel yet, making Bill realize that more Disney kingdoms exist in this universe.</span></div></div>",

Once they reached the gymnasium, the two  suddenly both saw a lot of people...staff workers, parents, and even Arendelle's Royal Guard, all waiting for them outside, a couple of them gasping at their mere presence. One of the guardsman saw Queen Elsa and Princess Anna and smiled. He and another guard opened the double doors for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill looked inside the gymnasium and saw hundreds of kids, most of them very noisy. At the top of the platform was the principal of JFK Elementary, Jenna Negrotti, standing near a podium. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe's finally here!\u201d announced Negrotti, herself sounding just as excited as the kids were. \u201cHere for the first time, I am proud to present to you all, Queen Elsa of Arendelle.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill looked to Anna, who let go of her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShowtime!\u201d she said excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill nodded and nervously walked through the doorway into the gym. His mind raced back to went he graduated from this school in the sixth grade. His parents, Martha and Greg, were so proud of Bill as he was adorned in his finest cloths and his cap as he went on stage to receive his diploma. Now he saw hundreds of people, mostly children, none of whom he knew at all. Virtually all of them were transfixed as they watched Elsa, a living Disney princess, regally climb the stage to give her speech. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey everyone\u201d said Bill tapping the podium, still not used to sounding like Idina Menzel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe love you Elsa!\u201d screamed a little girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you! So, I'm here. Finally!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill's mind went on autopilot as Elsa's personality started to take over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to say that as long as I have been Queen, I have dined with Presidents, danced with generals, been kissed by celebrities, and hobnobbed fellow royalty. I've spoken in front of hundreds of crowds just like this one, and not one of them was as wonderful to be with as you kids are!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small smattering of applause was made at that statement, although others found it to be pandering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn the four and half years since Disney decided to adapt my autobiography to the big screen, I have had plenty of time to reflect on what happened to me that one horrible day when I broke down and ran away from home. That one bad day when my anxiety and fear overwhelmed me, where I nearly lost my sister and my seat on the throne to Hans of the Southern Isles. That one bad day of Arendelle's unnatural winter that seemed eternal and everlasting. That one bad day,when I was in the darkest place I've ever been in. On that one bad day, my worst day, I discovered just how special I really, and how much I was loved. I almost gave up on everything that day, and if I had, I wouldn't be here speaking to any of you now. Lest you think I'm bragging, this applies just as much to all of you as it did to me. You are all special, you are all loved, and you are all capable of creating magic in this world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill sat back and listened to Elsa speak, bearing her heart and soul to the audience as she gave her inspirational speech. He could have interrupted Elsa at any time, but he didn't. Truth be told, as much as Kimberly teased him about making him watch Frozen for the thousandth time, he actually really liked the movie, and he got emotional at most of the songs, particularly \u201cDo You Want To Build A Snowman?\u201d. He was getting just as emotional now, listening to her. When she was done, the entire audience clapped this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow it's time for the Q&amp;A session\u201d said Principal Negrotti, speaking from a microphone off to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn entire forest of hands suddenly erupted from the seats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincipal Negrotti laughed a little. \u201cUnfortunately we won't be able to get to everyone, which is why during her majesty's speech, we periodically selected certain students from the audience to field their own questions\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, Bill saw a line forming in one of the rows in the middle of her presentation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little boy went up to the standing microphone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi\u201d he said shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi there young man. What's your name?\u201d asked Bill in Elsa's kind voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm Rod Walker. I-I love Frozen. It's my favorite movie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you! You have good taste, Rod!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm...I wanted to know if you know Ariel and Queen Rapunzel?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill hid his laughter at the question. The Little Mermaid and Tangled couldn't possibly be real too, could they? It was then when Bill noticed a map of the world hand on the wall in the front of the gym.  The map showed various countries that Bill didn't recognize, and the geography seemed little off. The map was too far away to really see, but he was pretty sure he saw the name \u201cArendelle\u201d located near Norway, and the name \u201cCorona\u201d near Denmark. The named \u201cAtlantica\u201d could clearly be seen near Denmark, but the country wasn't shaded in. It appeared to be submerged in water. He even noticed the name \u201cAgrabah\u201d located where Iraq was supposed to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo...\u201d he whispered slowly. In the back, Bill saw Anna start to get a little nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-sorry?\u201d asked Rod. \u201cI didn't hear you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world couldn't be THIS different now, could it? Did Natasha's wish just transform the Earth into a planetary wide Disneyland? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Bill bluffs his way through the question and says that he knows Ariel and Rapunzel well. They were even at her coronation! Different kids start asking other questions about Disney characters like Aladdin and others, leading Bill to realize just how different the Earth was now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Something else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

In the theater it had been Coco, but Zootopia had been playing on the Disney Channel last week, so that movie was fresher in her young memory. She and Mommy had sat down to watch it together, and Natasha was overjoyed. She loved this movie. She loved the sheer immersiveness and breadth of the titular city, and truth be told, she related to Judy Hopps more than she wanted to admit to her mother. You see, Judy's own parents in the movie had no faith in her dreams of becoming a police officer in the big city. She was a bunny, and bunnies simply didn't last long in a cutthroat metropolis populated by lions and tigers and bears...and scheming sheep. Sometimes, the precocious Natasha felt that she was underestimated by Ariadne too, and by her big sister Gloria...and by practically every adult she knew. Only Ms. Wick, her first grade teacher, seemed to see the potential in Natasha. Or at least that's how Natasha felt. Sometimes she wished that she could just escape into Zootopia for a while. Gee...she has a magic wishing rock, that doesn't sound like too bad of an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI WISH I WAS JUDY!\u201d screamed Natasha into the mirror, all of her repressed anger and insecurity bursting to the surface. The Ahn'Ger stone heard her wish, and immediately granted it. The gemstone exploded into being and washed over Natasha's body, covering her in magical energy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the light subsided, Bill woke up from his trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d he squeaked out, his voice sounding funny. His voice still sounded feminine, but feminine in a different way than Natasha's high pitched little girl voice. This voice sounded like someone closer to an adult, and yet not quite that either. He also felt much smaller than he had a moment ago. He looked around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAm I...standing ON TOP of the BATHROOM COUNTER!!?\u201d he wailed histrionically. Quickly looking around him, he noticed that the paper towel dispenser and the automatic hand dryer were much bigger than they had been a moment ago. To this right, the tiles on the wall that connected the communal sinks to the toilets seemed far more imposing than they had a moment ago, reminding Bill of the nearly impenetrable medieval walls of Constantinople that he had been learning about in history class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after realizing that something was now very, very wrong, he turned to face his new identity in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill saw a bunny. HE was the bunny. He was an adult female bunny dressed in a police officer's uniform fit for her little bunny body. She had large floppy ears and wide, expressive purple eyes. Bill recalled her from somewhere. Some Disney movie that he had been forced to watch when it was Kimberly's turn to choose the movie for family night. Damn it...somehow he just remembered. Judy! This cute bunny's name was Judy Hopps! And now Bill was now her. Bill was Judy Hopps! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting right next to him was the Ahn'Ger stone, which had cryptically shrunken down to fit Judy's now much more diminutive hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: The world of Zootopia exists in this new reality. Judy(Bill) and her partner Nick Wilde have tracked down a shapeshifting criminal from the famous animal metropolis to this very elementary school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Judy Hopps is just a fictional character in this reality, and Bill realizes quickly that he has to hide and find a safe place to return things to normal, otherwise he become the object of unethical scientific experiments...or worse. </span></div></div>",

I know you enjoy looking at yourself as much as I enjoy looking at myself, but we got a job to do.\" The male voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice rang through Judy's large, bunny ears as he tried to place it... it was Jason Bateman's voice. Bill had been an Arrested Development fan, so the voice was unmistakeable... but why would...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course! The fox in the movie... Nick! He was voiced by Jason Bateman! And of course if there was a real Nick he would share a voice... Bill tried to remember everything about the movie... it ended with the Fox becoming a police officer and Judy's partner. So... Judy and Nick must be here on an investigation. Bill took a bit of a breath, grabbed the stone, and hopped from the countertop. He had to play it cool, lest he freak Nick out and find himself in animal jail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy/Bill pushed open the giant door.open, and on the other side stood an orange fox, in an officer's uniform, smirking at Judy, his tail swishing behind him. Bill didn't know what to say... so he said the first thing that popped into mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not like looking at myself! I like to take my time. We have a big case ahead of us.\" Judy said. Wow. That did come really natural. Was there a little of Judy in his head?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or... you didn't want to admit you rushed into the big animals bathroom instead of the tiny animals bathroom.\" Nick smirked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not have this conversation. Let's just pretend this never happened.\" Judy/Bill found himself saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say.\" Nick said, slyly, as he started to move down the hallway. \"We gotta an apparent shapeshifter to find anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShapeshifter? What the hell was going on here? What the hell has this stone brought onto Bill's life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But shapeshifting... how could that be possible?\" Bill asked, He couldn't get used to his Judy Voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it isn't that much crazier than the ferrel juice thing right? OK, maybe it is, but we have tracked some suspicious activity here either way. So let's talk to some teachers, if this turns out to be true, great! If not, well, we're the laughing stock of the station and we're probably back on parking duty, or another case, whatever comes first.\" Nick said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill just nodded, once again feeling his large ears move back and forth. This was getting nuts. And Bill didn't know how to keep this up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Nick and Bill interview a hippo teacher. Bill gets more into Judy's agressive personality as the Hippo has some strange flaws in her story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Bill decides to show Nick the stone, and tells a half truth that he's a monkey named Bill who somehow ended up in Judy's body.

Her hair vanished, replaced by clumps of moss and leaves while her face flattened and lost nearly all detail save for large, emotive eyes and a mouth. Her now dense wooden head bonked against the bathroom ceiling and Natasha blinked. She expected that yucky boy part of her to take over again but everything was quiet.

Green light pulsed from the gaps in Natasha's fingers and slide over the small girl, who squealed in delight as the magic reminded her of how the Fairy Godmother changed everything in Cinderella.

The gemstone clattered to the floor as the small grabby arms and hands seemed to explode into a huge mass of limbs that turned gray and metallic before folding in on themselves and merging with Natasha's bloated, spherical form. The small rounded  Natasha's hair disappeared in a flash of black, and finally her eyesight went from binocular to cyclopean as pressure built around her head, molding it into the small dome shape and pushing her pretty blue eyes together into a large, dark orb. The world around her went grainy and red tinted, and her brain filled with all sorts of numbers that Natasha couldn't understand, but suddenly she didn't feel quite as happy about her choice. There was a sudden maturity about her thoughts as the changes finalized and Natasha realized that she couldn't sense the boy personality anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad he been erased, or merely merged with her?

Surely she would help her get out of this, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to Natasha's horror, Rebecca simply giggled and gave Natasha a squeeze.

It's almost naptime, I was afraid that I lost you! C'mon, lets get back to our cot!\" Rebecca said, but then her enormous eyes darted downwards. \"Oh, this is so pretty!\" She cried out, holding Natasha by her half-dome head while another small hand picked up the Ahn'Ger Stone. Natasha screamed in silence at her friend, but it was clear that she was no longer able to communicate or interact with the world at all. She was just a toy, a napping buddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to break out in tears at the unfair turn of events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca turned the stone around, marveling at how cool it looked in the bathroom light, how the florescent light seemed to curve around the golden core, how warm the stone felt. She had to protect it, just like she had to protect her BB-8 plushy! Otherwise those yucky boys would take it from her! Especially that gross Jake Anselm boy, he was all the time pulling her ponytails and saying she had cooties! Rebecca curled her tiny fingers around the Ahn'Ger Stone, oblivious to what it really was, as the petty annoyances of her classmates made her feel upset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe never noticed the soft green-gold glow from her tiny fingers as tears started to fill her eyes. Natasha could do nothing but watch helpless like the toy she was as her new owner. She had to do something to keep Rebecca from ending up like her, she had to...had to...something!

Her hair grew out, her rear expanded, her clothing changed from the My Little Pony shirt to a red cardigan and blue jeans. Her body puffed up slightly as her formerly stick-like frame gained a slight amount of weight. Conservative make-up and jewelry twinkled into existence on the now adult Rebecca's face. Two earrings poked their way into her ears with a slight pinch, a bracelet dangled off her left wrist, and a necklace slid around her neck. Nails that were once finely trimmed were now slightly longer and coated in glossy paint as low heeled shoes replaced the pink sneakers she once wore. The unfamiliar weight of her new assets threw her off balance for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha felt herself changing as well as the jewelry appeared, her plushy form hardening as it shrunk even more. The world seemed to grow even larger than she could have imagined it, and she felt herself falling for a moment before it mostly vanished. Something massive and warm was behind her now, and she felt something holding her at the top of her head. Natasha knew that this was not an improvement. Not at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the changes finished, Rebecca looked around while Natasha did her best with her locked field of vision. And then they both noticed the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca looked very much an adult. Her body was tall, her clothing looked good and while there was definitely muscle, there was a small layer of fat and flab that coated what was clearly an athletic body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha, on the other hand, let loose another wail of horror. She was a small, metallic BB-8 necklace dangling from Rebecca's neck and just a few inches from the little girl turned adult's not unsubstantial cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut where were they?</span></div></div>",

With a wave under the faucet, lukewarm water began spewing out and Rebecca went to wash her hands, pausing as she felt something in her hand. Opening it, it was a dull, lifeless gemstone, though it was clearly expensive. Rebecca had found it on the way to work this morning, and after work she was going to take it over to the jewelry shop to see if she could get it appraised, maybe sell it. Anything to get a little bit more money was nice, especially with her student loans constantly looming over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, much like the BB-8 necklace she wore, it was rather cute. Maybe if it wasn't worth much she'd just use it for decoration back at her dorm room. Or maybe put it in her room back at home. She didn't fully trust her roommate. But those were problems for after work, and Rebecca reached down and picked up her previously non-existent purse and slid the stone inside before quickly finishing up in the bathroom and heading back out to the retail counter, where he friend Jake Anselm was standing with a bored look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoredom. That about summed up both their lives. There was also disappointment, disillusionment and regret, but that seemed to be par for the course with being an adult. Oh, and brutal, crushing exams.

Or live on Mars, and have it yooooooooooour way! You hate your boss at your job, but in your dreams you can blow his head off. In your dreams, show no meeeeeeeeeercy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prophetic song played over the intercom of Sandy's, a local retail store in the Twin Pines Mall as Rebecca Armitage and Jake Anselm manned the two front registers. Not a lot of people were in the store today, as it as a Wednesday morning. A middle aged woman and a girl of about nine, probably mother and daughter, were checking out shoes while a nondescript man wearing a brown jacket browsed Blu-Rays. Outside the store, an elderly looking man in a fedora was reading the newspaper on a wooden bench as he usually did every day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca yawned loudly as she made inventory of her life. She was 21, going to graduate from college next semester. Her father, for there was no Mrs. Armitage in the picture, had insisted that she take something STEM related, particularly since he was a mechanical engineer himself. Rebecca eventually acquiesced to Mr. Armitage's terms, and was aiming to get a degree in Statistics, though she honestly had very little interest in the subject. The course was intense and work load heavy, which left very little time for her to make any new friends. She half-heartedly tried to pledge for a sorority in her first year, but she dropped out when she realized that she just didn't have the room in her schedule(She didn't want to admit that it was the bitch who made fun of her for gaining the freshman fifteen). Rebecca thought wistfully back to high school. She had plenty of friends there. She was popular. She didn't even have time to go swimming anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWasn't that song in Batman Forever?\u201d heard Rebecca all of a sudden, breaking her out of her daydream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked tiredly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat song that's playing. Wasn't that in Batman Forever, you know, the one with Jim Carrey?\u201d asked Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't know\u201d answered Rebecca, resting her face on her elbow, her elbow itself resting on the counter like a freestanding column. \u201cI never saw that movie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore your time, maybe\u201d said Jake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe. I'm not big on the superheroes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake Anselm was Rebecca's co-worker. He had just turned thirty years old and was going through what psychologists called a quarter-life crisis. Jake was beginning to realize that he wasn't a kid anymore, having wasted his twenties in a state of arrested adolescence and immaturity, working minimum wage jobs just to scrap by, and his relationship with Rebecca was friendly but strained as a result of his insecurities. He wanted to start fresh and go back to college himself, but his low self confidence told him that he was perhaps just a bit too old for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you ever wish that you could just start over, Jake?\u201d asked Rebecca in a pensive voice as she was watching one of the customers walk up to her register to purchase something. She suddenly composed herself, forming a perfectly happy smile that hid her soul crushing ennui. <br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Natasha, still a necklace, and still alive, if only in the vague 'does consciousness determine life' sort of way, could only mentally roll her eyes at the two. She really, really hoped that, if she was stuck as a necklace for the rest of her 'life', that it wasn't going to be like this all the time.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Natasha lamented her new existence, and her new owner and her co-worker both seemed to be in the process of rueing theirs, the fog of existential angst seemed to boil away as a cacophony of mean laughter and rude language passed through the shop's doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca jerked her head up, sending Natasha tumbling around inches above her owner's cleavage as the employee observed the newcomers, and so did Natasha when her vision ceased spinning. There, making their way down the aisle, was Rob Bolstrum and several of his cronies. Outside, across the gallery of the mall, stood Big Jon Ingerman and three other bullies that Natasha recognized from her collection of Bill memories, all three of them watching the scene unfold in the shop and whispering among themselves. One of them, Jeff something or other was standing just off to the side of the store's display windows, a wary look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is a girl shop, what are they doing in here?' The boy turned girl turned necklace wondered to nobody but herself. She felt Rebecca's head turn to look at Jake and then back towards the approaching squad of testosterone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, welcome to Sandy's, can I help you gentlemen?\" Rebecca asked with her best employee voice. Even though the group of boys if front of her were clearly still in high school, their sheer bulk and attitude made her feel more than a little nervous. Dangling unknowingly from her neck, Natasha simply glared in permanent silence at the group as Rob slammed a muscled arm down on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was wondering if you were having a sale on blowjobs? I can show you my 'gift card'...\" Rob said, fixing Rebecca with a leer as the group of lackies burst into new roars of laughter and lewd, inappropriate comments towards Rebecca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok assholes, time for you to leave before I call mall security!\" Jake said as forcefully as he could, which only made Rob and his group laugh even harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, faggot, we'll leave...But not before we get a free sample\" Rob said, pointing a finger towards the jar of cheap scrunchies for toddlers that sat next to Rebecca's cash register. As Jake and Rebecca's attention shifted to the jar, Rob's hand darted forward like a snake and gave one of Rebecca's breasts a quick squeeze before hooking a finger around Natasha and pulling her free from Rebecca's neck in one fluid motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief moment of silence before Rebecca screamed and swatted away Rob's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU ASSHOLE!\" She screamed, staggering backwards as Jake lunged over the counter. Natasha simply screamed to herself, terrified at the giant hand that blocked out the world and almost felt like it was bending her thin metal body, and at the prospect of being Rob's property.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unknown to everyone, Rebecca had still been holding the strange gemstone, and as her rage of being violated surged beyond her fear and disgust, she made a wish...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I wish you and your friends would act like proper customers!\" Rebecca screamed in anger, and a flash of green-gold light flared from her clenched fist, and with it, a surge of magic and cascaded across the entire fabric of reality, washing past Rebecca's co-worker Jake as he chased Rob Bolstrum and his other friends down the main aisle of the clothing store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the light cruised over them, right in front of Rebecca's eyes the ruined displays and toppled clothing racks once again resumed their previously undisturbed positions and her co-worker Jake went from a full, angry run to a completely different position, a box of women's socks in his hands as he restocked a nearby display. But what shocked Rebecca even more were the changes to her assaulter and his friends. As the light passed over them, the bulky, muscled forms of Rob Bolstrum and his cohorts shrunk and shifted into new forms as the magic gemstone granted Rebecca's wish of transforming them in 'proper customers' of Sandy's. And although all the bullies within the store (and several outside, unbeknownst to Rebecca) underwent their own changes, the 21 year old's eyes were locked on her assaulter, watching his change in horror and fascination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob's muscles shrunk as they lost mass, his large arms and trunk like legs shrinking dramatically as the bones within became shorter and the muscles within shed their bulky raw strength in exchange for small, toned muscles. Gnarled hands shrunk and became slender, blunt fingernails (and at least one in-grown nail) becoming manicured and decorated in a splash of pink nail polish, one hand still clutching the dangling silver chain of Rebecca's necklace. The almost embarassing amount of hair covering the boy's body vanished like steam as the mottled, tattooed skin became almost a shade lighter as the impurities were cleansed from it, a lifetime of hard living replaced by smooth, well maintained skin. A muscled trunk seemed to shrink and bend, a flat buttocks swelling to life and if Rebecca had not been transfixed and incapable of thought, she would have guessed that the former boy's chest was now swelling to similar proportions. And although Rebecca couldn't see the boy's face from this angle, she watched as luxurious curly red hair exploded from his scalp as it erased the former short buzzcut from existence, falling like a crimson waterfall down past the bully's shoulders. Even Rob's clothing wasn't spared as the poorly maintained jeans and black, skull adorned shirt transformed, the individual threads becoming lighter and smaller as the boy's jeans shrank until they were tight against his...her skin, framing the newly minted posterior in tight fitting denim. The Skull tee rippled as it turned from pitch black to pink as a cardigan replaced the t-shirt, with a flowery white shirt sliding out from underneath the cardigan's upper layer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the former boy's entire body re-positioned itself, much like Jake's had only moments before. Instead of running madly down the aisle in a wild dash for the door, instead the bully was standing calmly, her changed friends all in the same designer wear that was sold at the store, clustered around her as she held the Star Wars themed necklace out of one dainty hand for her girlfriends to see. The wave of light passed out into the mall, but Rebecca, so focused on the changes happening in front of her, failed to see several other boys become gorgeous girls in designer clothing in various displays of shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha, now dangling in front of a gaggle of new girls instead of clutched in the hands of her previous life's second worst enemy, could only hold back the sickening feeling of mental queasiness as she slowly spun in a circle, the massive human world that she had once belonged to a blur of color and sound that overwhelmed her for a brief moment. Finally, as the laws of physics slowed her metallic form to a slowly panning field of vision, Natasha the necklace was able to stop mentally barfing all over herself and observe what had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurrounding her on all sides were the colossal faces of the bullies turned preppy girls. All of them dolled up in make-up and expensive clothing, all of them looking like cheerleaders. And through the forest of gawking faces, all of them staring directly at her, she could see that Jeff was no longer lurking by the store's windows, instead there was a incredibly attractive girl in corked heels modelling to herself in the window, her massive chest garnering jealous looks from another girl that had just appeared behind her. Across the gallery, another small group of girls, including a impossibly pretty knockout blonde, were gathered, all of them on their phones as they chatted back and forth to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rebecca must have used the gemstone\" Natasha thought to herself, but before she could think anything else once again her vision blurred as her small, inanimate body swirled in the air as Rob's newly changed body began walking back towards the sales counter, and Natasha's owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca blinked as the newly minted redhead returned to the counter and handed her BB-8 necklace back. Now able to see the changed boy's face, Rebecca couldn't help but drawn comparisons to a younger Scarlett Johansson before she was a massively popular actress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, thanks for letting me and the squad look at your necklace! I'm totally not a nerd but I really liked that Trek wars movie and think this would look totally cute on me! Do you sell them here?\" Rob's voice, once deep and reeking of unchecked attitude was now high and sing-songy, almost stereotypically so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca cautiously held out the hand that contained the gemstone out and took possession of the necklace that had been stolen from her in a different version of reality moments ago. Natasha herself felt the alien feeling of being handled like the object she now was and with a barely audible clink, was suddenly pressed directly against the gemstone that had caused this entire mess, her 'face' pressed directly against it's smooth, warm surface. From this distance Natasha could see the golden core of the gemstone almost fluctuating, almost as if it was wet and flowing as an untold number of gold particles seemed to flow downward and curve back onto themselves like a slow, micro-sized waterfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you?\" She thought to no one but herself, but had no further time to inspect the artifact before resuming her place as a cleavage ornament hanging from around Rebecca's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least I'm back where I started. But why do I remember everything how it was?\" Was all Natasha had to say. Waas it because she was now just an object, too small and unimportant to rate altering along with rest of reality? With a lack of ability to do anything else (and trying to keep the previous thought from sending her spiraling into another bout of existential angst), she simply stared and marveled at the changes before her, and how in one moment the entire squad of bullies that had plagued the school and Natasha's previous life as Bill had vanished, replaced with what was clearly the high school's cheerleading squad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca stared at the girl in front of her for a moment after putting her necklace back on, quickly sliding the gemstone into her pocket before she asked to see that as well. \"Um, no. No we don't, sorry. I bought this off Amazon, you might try there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new girl's face fell for a moment before perking up once again. \"Like, that's totally fine! Thanks anyway!\" And with that, the girls that had been towering, crude male bullies exited the shop and joined up with the rest of their friends, an attractive herd resuming it's migration through the mall and it's many stores, turning heads as they went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs relative silence descended upon Sandy's once more, Rebecca slowly pulled out the gemstone and held it up to the ceiling, where the light from the florescent bulbs seemed to curve around it in a way that, much like the changes it had just wrought upon her assaulters, seemed absolutely impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you?\" Rebecca whispered.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"What are you?\" Rebecca whispered as she started at the stone in her hand. It clearly wasn't just a fancy piece of jewelry, it had, somehow, changed the group of boys that had just assaulted her into a group of almost stereotypical cheerleaders. But that had to be impossible, magic wasn't...it wasn't real, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Rebecca, whatever questions she wanted to ask and whatever answers she needed to hear, they would have to wait. Only a few minutes after the group of newly changed girls had left, the after-work shopping crowd had surged in, forcing Rebecca to put the stone in her pocket and her nose to the grind. Hours of retail drudgery passed as she and Jake, who clearly had no memory that anything had happened earlier, dealt with wave after wave of customers coming in and buying various items of clothing. It should have been easy for Rebecca to fall back into 'work mode' but after everything that had happened, she found herself distracted at the cash register, the brief pauses between transactions stretched out because of her mind drifting towards the strange stone in her pocket. It had gotten especially worse when one of the changed girls from before had shown up again. It hadn't been the one that assaulted her, but it had certainly been on of the group. She had bought a shirt, paid for it, and walked out with her bags of cloths and other items from different stores in her hand as if nothing had ever been any different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha, ever the piece of jewelry hanging unwillingly dutifully from Rebecca's neck, simply found herself torn between absolutely boredom and the need to break down into mental tears over what had happened to her as the hours passed and day slid into night until finally, the last customer, some overweight woman in her fifties, had finally paid for her items and waddled out into the mall, where the last customers of the many other stores were doing the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, finally!\" Jake said, once the woman was sufficiently out of range of the store's entryway, \"I thought that rush would never end! What, did they move Black Friday up a few months and didn't bother to tell us?\" He looked towards Rebecca with a grin, but it quickly dissolved into a frown as his co-worker wasn't paying attention to him. Rolling his eyes, Jake used his employee key and turned on the outer security gate, walking back towards the counter as the metal bars rolled down from the ceiling and securing the store from the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, uh, Jake? Do you...mind if you finish up closing tonight? I really want to get home. I'm...not feeling well? Rebecca said, glancing up from the cash register and the gemstone that she had placed on it's surface to study. She really didn't have patience for restocking and counting up the small amount of physical cash in the register, not when there was a greater mystery to solve. And technically she had to ask the manager, but the old man never stayed until closing, instead letting Jake take over the shop as he was assistant manager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake fixed her with an odd look and shook his head, \"What you want me to take care of restocking and all the backroom shit alone? That's like two hours of work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please?\" Rebecca pleaded, and in the back of her mind she hated for playing up the stereotype, but she leaned forward over the counter a little bit and gave Jake a full view of her cleavage she put some sexy into her voice, \"I'll buy you dinner sometime...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Rebecca was walking out the employee entrance, purse and gemstone in hand and a small grin on her face as Jake stood awkwardly in the stockroom, trying to hide the small tent in his khaki pants as the door swung shut behind her. She hated doing that to her friend, but the stone and whatever powers it had were too important to be left any longer. Rebecca hustled out of the mall's employee exit and across the dark parking lot, making sure the check before she left the safety of the lit, self locking door. Even with a stone of unknown power, she wasn't taking any chances. But the quick trip across the pavement to her car was uneventful, and so was he drive across town to the college campus and her dorm. She parked and raced into the building, taking the stairs two at a time before reaching her dorm room on the third floor and sliding in. The interior was dark, and Rebecca gave a silent cheer as she flicked on the lights that tonight was one of Emily, her dorm-mate, night classes. Rebecca quickly pulled off her work uniform and switched into her pajamas before dimming the lights and rolling onto her bed and taking a moment to just relax and let the stress of the workday roll away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha, apparently defined as part of Rebecca's work wardrobe, simply took in her new surroundings and possibly future home as she hung limply from a necklace stand, her metallic body clinking against other necklaces, some generic, some similar memorabilia as she currently found herself as. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder who else is trapped here\" A dark part of Natasha's mind, the part that was desperately clawing to be released in a wave of crippling terror and anger muttered in the quiet of the dorm room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of laying flat on her bed, Rebecca pulled herself upright and sat criss-cross on the mattress, leaning against the the thin headboard as she placed the gemstone in front of her and started at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gemstone offered no answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you...well, you're clearly magical. But what made you work? HOW do you work?\" Rebecca muttered as she picked up the stone and brought it close to her eyes. She could have sworn that the inner gemstone was moving, but it could have just been the weird lensing effect that it did with the light. \"I wish I had a million dollars!\" Rebecca cried out suddenly, and from her distant vantage point, Natasha rolled her non-existent eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Here we go. She'll probably mess it up just like I did\"</i> The necklace muttered mentally as Rebecca stared at the dormant artifact before grabbing her phone. Natasha could only see the logo for one of America's largest bank firms pop up on the phone's screen, but she was too far away and Natasha's field of vision too low to see anything other than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca furrowed her brow as she stared at ther bank account. Nothing had changed, she still had the precious little cash that she had this morning. She let her phone drop to the mattress as she stared at the stone again. \"Okay, so that didn't work...What about...I wish I had a better roommate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca didn't particular dislike Emily, but the girl had a tendency to use Rebecca's stuff without permission. She was a bit of an airhead, not a bimbo, but just had no common sense or respect for other people's things. Maybe if it worked, some of the stuff she had taken from Rebecca (in this case, the panties that Emily had worn without thinking the other night and now Rebecca no longer wanted) would return? The stone seemed to cause retroactive changes, as it had changed Jake's reaction entirely to something he'd normally be doing from chasing the vandals since the vandals had changed into polite female customers. So by that logic, that would mean that the panties would vanish and return to Rebecca's underwear drawer, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after three minutes and no flash of light or warmth from the stone, Rebecca was once again disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it doesn't work now. It was probably just one wish anyway, probably wasted it on those stupid girls...\" She muttered, frowning as she felt anger start to rise in her gut. And even if it had, why did she make such a stupid wish to get a pair of dumb panties back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Stupid bimbo Becky' Rebecca muttered to herself, recalling, for some reason, the cruel words of the sorority girls from some campus party last semester. The thought of those stupid trust fund bitches pushing her out, her stupid classes making her get fat, her stupid life for being so boring that she had to get her kicks by ditching work and playing pretend with a stupid little gemstone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes, now full of anger over events old and new, glared at the gemstone before she curled her fingers around it and reared back her enclosed fist, unaware that the artifact was now glowing in her grasp. \"Stupid thing! I wish I just knew what you did today!\" Rebecca hissed and right as she prepared to throw the stone against the far wall of the dorm room, there was the flash of green-gold light.  Suddenly Rebecca froze as the light washed over her form, a pulsating ripple that flashed faster and faster as a unknwon wind began to rip through the dorm room from an unknown source, lifting Rebecca up as her arms and legs went limp, dangling beneath her as she rose towards the ceiling. The light pulsed faster and faster, changing direction and pooling into Rebecca's eyes as green-gold tinted visions of EVERYTHING the stone had done in the last twenty-four hours flashing before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A vast, infinite darkness where the emotions of the universe swirled around each other in an endless storm. Waves of empathy, eddies of lust, currents of joy, the frothing peaks of greed, and the deep, crushing whirlpools of anger, hate, depression. And at the core of the whirlpool of anger, something formed in the realm of the formless, falling through the realm of emotions like a stone through water before it crashed through the veil of reality and landed softly on the porch of a Bill Strasserman. And then the events of Bill's life, the discovery, the anger he felt towards some girl named Gloria, Gloria's anger and the wish that had turned Bill into Natasha. Rebecca saw herself as a small child, playing in a classroom, Natasha making a wish to be BB-8 before becoming a plush toy, to Rebecca discovering the toy and making a wish to be an adult, changing her and Jake into adults with no memory, while Natasha became her necklace. And then her wish that changed the bullies into polite girls.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the light was gone, and Rebecca floated slowly downwards to her bed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It only took a moment for Rebecca to recover after the transcendental event. So much knowledge, everything so fast. The knowledge that her entire existence was a lie, that she had been WEARING SOMEONE all day. That she was actually a child, not an adult, that the person she had been wearing was two people merged into one and had become a piece of jewelry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was...it was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, all Rebecca felt the need to do was get completely naked and curl into the smallest, tightest ball on the floor and cry. And she did, clawing off clothes that she clearly remembered buying yet never had and throwing them as far across the room as she could. Of feeling the weight of breasts that she wasn't supposed to have yet on her chest, knowledge of things she shouldn't know in her head, that her life, her ENTIRE LIFE for the past seventeen years had never existed before 12:00PM. The accomplishments she had in high school, fabricated, her body issues now, fabricated, all those long hours at the store? Implanted. Her money? The crippling student debt? All of it materialized out of nothing. Even the sex she'd had with the few men she'd been with, nothing but visions conjured up from nonexistence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god...\" Was all Rebecca could sob, over and over again as she rocked on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha, the necklace, had nothing to add at the moment, simply too taken aback at the recent events to form anything other than a silent \"Holy shit\" as the event and it's subsequent aftermath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Rebecca simply cried and sobbed until she simply couldn't anymore from the exhaustion wracking her body and mind. And three hours after her accidental wish for knowledge, the woman simply lay in a loose fetal position before a noise at the door caused her to look up with a red, tear stained face as a key turned in a lock and the metallic doorknob turned. And in walked her roommate Emily, who simply froze upon seeing Rebecca on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd suddenly, whatever was holding Rebecca back snapped, and gone was the crippling sadness and fear, replaced only with pure anger and rage at all the lives that hadd been ruined by a tiny gemstone, seemingly created out of nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET OUT!\" She screamed at Emily, and she clawed her way off the flor, \"GET OUT GET OUT GETOU!\" Her screams were almost feral sounding as she stormed across the tiny room and grabbed Emily by her pseudo-goth attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit! Rebecca, what happened!?\" Was all Emily could say before her adrenaline fueled roommate shoved her back out into the dorm hall and slamming the door behind her. Doors all around her opened up and various heads leaned out of the entryways to stare at her in various emotional states, to which Emily simply shrugged. Something was very wrong and she carefully pulled herself up, crossed over to the dorm room's door, and knocked softly on it's exterior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Rebecca? Are you okay?\" She asked, timidly. She and Rebecca were not close friends, but Emily couldn't help but feel concerned. What if Rebecca had been raped or something? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">I wish you were gone!</font>\" Emily heard Rebecca hiss something angrily through the door and saw a flash of light from beneath the door frame before suddenly, Emily was simply gone. She didn't reappear anywhere else in the universe, and in fact, she had never existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you to get out...\" Rebecca sniffled, staring at the door and the girl that she had just wished out of existence behind it. She was along in the dorm, and as far as anyone else was concerned, she had ALWAYS been alone in the dorm. Gone were Emily's belongings on the other side of the small living area, all that was there was an empty bed and an empty wall that had once been covered in music posters. The stone burned a bright and furious gold-green through the cracks in her fingers and fresh, hot tears streamed down Rebecca's face before the enormity of what she had done hit her, and the anger began to quickly turn to fear. Rebecca noticed the light faded from a miniature star to a dyling flashlight in seconds and quickly made another wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish that Emily Mortimer was at her mom's!\" She cried out, and with a last puff of warmth and light, the artifact granted Rebecca's last second wish. All of the belongings that had vanished only a moment ago popped back into existence in the exact same positions they had been removed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, oh god\" The college girl whispered as she realized how badly she was shaking before collapsing nakedly back onto her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...You're evil!\" She said to the stone, which simply sat in the palm of her hand, dormant, lifeless, and for the moment, powerless. She rolled her hand over and the stone dropped to the carpeted floor with a muted thud, and Rebecca crawled as far back on her bed away from it as she could manage, sliding onder the covers and pulling them up over her head as if the stone was some sort of childhood night terror that could be hidden from. And there Rebecca stayed, her mind racing over what to do before almost an hour later pulling the bedding away and gingerly creeping over to the edge of the bed to see if the stone was still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was, laying peacefully on the carpet where it had fallen, undamaged, inert, and absolutely no threat until someone picked it up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like those SCP stories...\" Rebecca muttered, recalling the now false memory of when Jake told her about those scary stories people wrote on the Internet. And then another memory, this time one she knew was true, flashed in her mind. Natasha's terrfiying transformations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god!\" Rebecca screamed and crawled off the bed, stumbling over to her desk and the small necklace stand that rest above it. Getting down on her knees, she stared at the outermost one, the BB-8 necklace. It hung there, passively, as all inanimate objects are meant to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Natasha was screaming at the top of her non-existent lungs. \"OH MY GOD! REBECCA! RIGHT HERE YES IT'S ME I'M A PERSON HELP ME OW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca poked the necklace once to see if it was capable of doing anything, causing it to clatter gently against the other necklaces on the stand, before finally, and carefully, pulling it off and laying it neatly on the floor in the middle of the dorm room. It looked so tiny, and even though it was a fake memory, Rebecca distinctly recalled the night she had logged into Amazon and bought it...her. Natasha. It was a person, not a thing, even if three years of false memories told her otherwise. It wasn't a piece of overpriced memorabilia that had 'Made in Taiwan' stamped on the back. It was someone that had been placed there by the cruel machinations of whatever powered the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha screamed in joy at the look of realization on Rebecca's face. \"YES! YES! I'm IN HERE! I'M ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes moments, Rebecca turned and carefully, as if she was touching a dangerous bug or reptile, gingerly picked up the stone in two fingers and stared into it, then back at the necklace laying on the floor. She could fix everything, right here, right now. She was still plenty angry enough, she could restore Natasha, she could become her young self again and live a real life, do everything over again as it was meant to be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where's the fun in that?\" A whisper from the dark recesses of Rebecca's mind whispered, \"You have the power of a god now, you can do anything you want...\"</span></div></div>",

All of this isn't right.\" Rebecca said, closing her eyes and fighting off the urge to abuse the sheer power she had over reality. Fake life or not, she hadn't been raised to be a cruel, petty person. If she took this stone and used it to keep Natasha trapped, to remove her enemies from existence and to remove all challenge to her from existence, that wasn't who she was. A calm feeling washed over her ragged emotions as she closed her eyes and took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was still plenty angry after the knowledge her entire life was a lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca opened her eyes and glanced down at her fist, and the dim light that glowed within it. It was strange how weak it was now, when an hour ago it had been like a miniature sun in the palm of her hand. Still so many questions, especially about that strange realm that hse had 'felt' more than actually seen. Was it another plane of existence? Maybe even the afterlife?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca shook her head. She could delve into those later, right now she had a duty to fufill. \"First things first\" She whispered, and bringing her gem-hand up to her face said with a clear, but horse voice\"I wish that Natasha Vanapolous was a human again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stone flashed weakly, almost reluctantly, and the almost invisible shimmer of light, Rebecca watched in awe as the necklace that she remembered wearing for years grew in size, it's shape expanding outward from a stylized metal circle to the smooth, metallic shape that resembled a human body. Slowly the featureless prone form began to take on details, silver hair growing from the top of the head while a nose, mouth, eyes and ears pushed their way out from the the flat surface. Breasts grew on the being's chest while a slit appeared between the legs. A bellybutton caved into existence as the slivers of fingernails appeared at the end of small silver hands. And then as the detailing completed itself, lips and eyelashes, individual hair follicles, pores and other skin imperfections swelling into existence before the metallic body began it's final push to become human. Skin seemed to spread out in a radial pattern from the belly button, rippling outwards as if it was being hit with high winds until it covered the entirety of Natasha's metallic body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then with a gasp that made Rebecca scream, Natasha sat up, chest heaving as she gulped down mouthfuls of air before rolling onto her side, coughing as her whole body buckled under the feeling of renewed organic existence. Rebecca scrambled towards the door and stood, naked, with the light grip of her free hand resting on the doorknob. She had no idea if Natasha would be hostile or not, or if years, fake or not, of being worn had simply rendered her insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, as the last of the rebirthing pains faded away, Natasha tuned and stared at Rebecca with wild eyes.</span></div></div>",

But just the feeling, the freedom of being human again was all that mattered, and it brought tears to her eyes as she practically fell on top of Rebecca in a fleshy, teary hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohgodthankyousomuchyouhavenoideawhatitwaslikethatyou\" Natasha sobbed over and over again, before Rebecca finally, and gently pushed her off<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Yes. No problem. My pleasure.\" Rebecca said, as she stood there, staring at the other naked woman in front of her. \"But...We're not done, right? I still need to make another wish to make it all the way done, right?\" She asked, uncertain if Natasha was fully back to how she wanted to be. After all, Natasha's creation itself was a mistake, a creation from the wish of the Gloria girl that Rebecca had seen in the vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Natasha asked, looking over her naked form in confusion before looking back at Rebecca, \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Bill? I need to wish him back to normal...right?\" Rebecca wasn't sure if that was the right thing to say. After all, if the stone worked by logic, then Rebecca was more or less going to destroy Natasha in order to bring back the stone's original owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Right. Bill.\" Natasha said, looking down at herself. She had almost forgotten that Bill had existed, despite her mental (and apparently physical) maturity were clearly all due in large part of the forgotten boy's body and memories creating her own. It must have been that strange personality switch that the original wish had caused, the independence of two personalities within one body, fighting for control. But now they were merged...And what would happen if they unmerged?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't know...\" She muttered, taking a seat at the table and staring at the necklace stand that had, until moments ago, been her almost permanent home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because to get him back I have to undo the wish that made you...\" Rebecca said gently as she sat down on the bed across from Natasha,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'll die.\" Natasha said glumly. Now that she was reminded of Bill, she couldn't help but feel more than a little fake..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know that. This...thing, it's insane. It might be better to just lock it up somewhere before I or you or anyone else makes a horrible wish that ruins everything for everyone ever.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. He...he was here first. I'm a mistake, like everything else caused by that thing. No, wish me and Bill apart. Make it right\" Natasha said softly, and looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca looked at the girl sitting at the desk, her newly re-minted body naked, long black hair hiding a face that was tearing up once more. But she was right, Rebecca had to make things right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again drawing on the pit of existential anger, REbecca closed her eyes and said...</span></div></div>",

That had been the whole reason Rob and his crew had gone in the store, on a dare to prove that Rob still had a spine. Maybe now he'd get to have some say in how things were done again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Rob's moment of private triumph faded as he felt the his body and the world shift underneath him as his vision blurred. He felt his body become lighter as a tingling feeling, like if his entire body had been numb and was waking up, covered him from head to toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Did that fucking bitch taze me?\" Rob thought as the world swirled around him, and then suddenly he felt himself hitting a wall, the ceramic tiling cold on his bare shoulders and thighs. His purse dangling from his arm and impacted against his bare knees where his skirt ended. A flicker in the back of his mind said that he really shouldn't have worn heels, a skirt and cut-off shirt today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait, what?' Rob said, but he had little time to inspect himself or his surroundings as a massive form filled his vision, a titan of bulging muscle beneath a cruel nordic visage that seemed carved right from ice. IT was Jon Ingerman, the ringleader of the bullies and, for the time being, Rob's 'boss'. But yet a memory of him slapping Ingerman in front of all the guys rose to the surface in front of the older memories of getting his ass kicked by the behemoth in front of him. But then how Jon wouldn't leave him alone at school, constantly cat-calling, constantly asking him out...But that never happened, right? Why did those memories feel so real?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big Jon?\" Rob said in his strange yet somehow perfectly normal high pitched voice. Suddenly Rob felt very, very small. And wherever they were, they were completely alone. A shiver of pure terror ran down Rob's spine to his exposed low back where a tattoo now laced itself around the slightly exposed waistband of a pair of black panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, Bolstrum. And you're gonna see why they call me Big, even if you turn me down in front of all of my friends. No one, not even some floozy bitch like yourself does that to me. No one.\" Ingerman growled, lashing out and effortless knocking Rob against the tiled wall, causing his huge breasts to swing painfully within the bra he now wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ingerman, Jon, I, please don't! PLEASE SOMEONE HELMMMPH\" Rob cried out, but was silenced as a massive hand clamped down tight over Rob's pretty, puffy, red painted lips. He struggled, his now non-existent muscles pushing in vain against the mountain that was Big Jon Ingerman, ruby red nails trying to claw his leather jacket covered arms to no avail. Rob tried to kick, swinging out a heeled foot but Ingerman batted it away like it was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it. Struggle. Only makes this more fun for me...\" Big Jon growled and with a shrug, slammed Rob's tiny body against the wall, and the impact seemed to knock what little fight Rob left in his clearly female body away. He could only whimper as his captive loomed even closer, his other large hand gripping one of Rob's large breasts and giving it a painful squeeze before traveling south, across Rob's smooth exposed mid-rift and beyond the boundary of his skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one is coming. And no one is going to believe you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Rob could do was issue a muffled cry as tears flowed freely down his pretty face as his attacker began to well and truly violate him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back at Sandy's...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca blinked as suddenly everything was back to the way it had been moments before the group of boys had charged in. She was leaning against the counter while some old song her co-worker recognized played on the overhead speakers, her BB-8 necklace dangling over her cleavage while a slight warmth exuded from the hand that held the gemstone. She straightened up and unfolded her hand, staring at the strange gemstone and for a moment, she could have sworn it was glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad...had this thing just done something? Had it granted her wish?</span></div></div>",

She felt tears forming as the thought of having been so horribly violated and her vision went blurry for a moment as she blinked away the salty, hot water as a flash of light blinded her for a moment. Her fingers slid across the button's smooth surface and she looked up for just a moment to see how Jake was doing, maybe he'd made it to the door and locked the assholes in for security. She felt her necklace dangle down in front of her and she subconciously stuffed it back beneath the collar of her shirt where-wait, what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Rebecca whispered as she jerked upright, her eyes going wide. Her necklace had just been stolen, it should have been back around her neck! She felt a warmth in the hand that held the gemstone and glanced at it before suddenly realized that something had changed. Instead of a group of bullies and her friend chasing after them, now there was simply a group of young girls browsing the racks of designer clothing, gossiping quietly among themselves. And where Jake Anselm had once been, now there was just a slightly older tall lanky blonde that was restocking the women's sock display, a bored look on her slightly made-up, glasses donned face. The name tag that now hung off a average breast read \"Jacqueline\" where it had once simply said \"Jake\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca glanced once more at the stone and then out across the store and farther still into the mall, where her jaw dropped even more than she thought possible. She couldn't believe what she was seeing, and without a word Rebecca rushed outside of the store, ignoring the reedy voice of her formerly male co-worker, and stood in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the men were gone. Not a single person that walked through the mall was male. Everyone was a woman of every shape and size, from attractive to unattractive, thin to overweight, and every color of the human rainbow. Here and there women would walk by on their phone, holding hands, kissing, talking together about things that couples would talk about. Many of them with shared rings on their fingers as they leaned against each other romantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the stores had changed. Sandy's had been on the 'female' side of the gallery hall, while on the opposite had been more 'male' themed stores, like the athletic shoe store, the men's outdoor wear store, the video game store. Now any trace that they had sold anything to men was gone, offering products and displays that catered exclusively to women, as Rebecca could see by the myriad of female shoppers and staff within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like if the male sex had ceased to, or rather never existed, at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\" Rebecca whispered as she stared at the stone in her open hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then...</span></div></div>",

HEY WAIT NO GIVE IT BACK!\" Rebecca screamed as she raced after the small, clearly athletic form of a girl in blue-purple hair and way too many layers of clothing with sales tags trailing behind her. She had to get it back, she had to fix this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finders keepers, bitch!\" The punk laughed back and before Rebecca's eyes, vanished through the mall's main doors and into a waiting vehicle. And just like that, the girl, and more importantly the stone, was gone, vanishing into traffic and beyond Rebecca's reach forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca fell to her knees and felt white hot tears filling her eyes. She had been bored with her life, yes, but when she wanted some excitement, something to make her life exciting and wonderful again, she never wanted this!

Similar praise came from two women that sat in the driver and front passenger seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm just awesome like that.\" The blue haired girl replied with a grin before giving the pink haired girl a light kiss on her pierced lips. \"I also got something else right at the end. And I'm claiming it before any of you get to!\" The blue-haired girl held out her hand and peeled back her blue-tipped fingers, revealing the Ahn'Ger Stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink haired girl's eyes became huge as she picked the stone up with two slender fingers. \"Woah...Cameron, how'd you get this? No way you could have swiped it from the jewelry store...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue-haired punk, Cameron Knowles, plucked the stone back from the hands of her friend. \"It was easy!

He chatted it up with the girl who apparently was his BFF, who indeed was named Becky. \u201cNatasha\u201d and Becky hit it off immediately. Truth by told, all of Becky's points of references were lost on Bill. The blonde girl talked in a mile a minute, high-energy cadence, covering all sorts of various ground in less time than Bill had to understand them, although Bill made out something about Natasha having won a dodgeball game in gym class the other day against the boys of their homeroom, and Becky he supposed was in her girl power phase. Regardless, Bill could tell that Becky really liked her, and that's all he really needed to know for now. Bill just needed to play the patience game. He would wait until lunchtime, go into the bathroom, and wish himself back to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill also was introduced to several other students, boys and girls alike, who acted like they knew Natasha well. For the most part, everyone was friendly and kind to Natasha, which relieved Bill, who from middle school on had only had negative school experiences. Sooner than he Bill had liked, the doors finally opened, with teachers and other school staff shepherding their charges inside. Bill was one of these charges, as he couldn't wait to look inside a building that he hadn't been inside in at least six years. He found himself in awe at the old fashioned design and architecture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the short amount of time where Bill and Becky were separated from each other, Becky noticed out of the corner of her eye the gemstone that had fallen through Natasha's worn backpack. She slowly walked up to the glittering rock and picked it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so pretty\u201d she said to herself, in awe of the stone's crystalline beauty. Subconsciously, she could also feel the magical energy coursing through the ancient artifact despite the gemstone itself being cold to the touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the chime of an old fashioned electric interrupter bell, the first summons of the day that warned that class was beginning in less than one minute, Becky pocketed the stone and ran inside the storied school building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe First Grade classes had naturally gone easily for Bill, who still possessed an eighteen year old mind, although he consciously made the effort to not be TOO good at his work. He deliberately colored outside the lines during a coloring break, misspelled a couple of words on Natasha's spelling test, and occasionally answered Ms. Wick's questions incorrectly as to not draw attention to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to work, as he got along swimmingly in class. Since the classwork was easy for him, he had time to gossip with Becky, who he learned whose last name was Summers during Ms. Wick's attendance taking. Despite himself, Bill had to hold back childish giggles at Becky's silly jokes and teasing. She was a charming and funny girl, and Bill was going to miss her when he inevitably had to return to his real life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen lunchtime arrived, Bill and Becky stood in line for what turned out to be spaghetti and meatballs. They sat together with the other first, second, and third graders of JFK Elementary, but the two girls mostly conversed with themselves, their bond rock solid. Bill took two bites of the food and decided that he didn't like the taste of it and pushed it aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Becky, I've got to go use the bathroom. Watch my food and get me a Drumstick when the lunch lady starts giving out ice cream\u201d he said in Natasha's little girl voice. He handed her two quarters from Natasha's backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky nodded and watched her best friend walk through one of the two exits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Becky waited, she grew bored and pulled out the glittering rock that she found this morning. She stared at it, at the smaller gem embedded inside, the gold oddity almost daring her to make a wish. She turned the stone around in her palm several times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: While she waits for Natasha to come back, Becky pulls out a storybook and begins to read it. She begins to wish that she and Natasha could live in the fantasy world of the story for a while instead of being at school, and when Natasha doesn't return after ten minutes, she starts becoming angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Something else </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bill waved goodbye to his temporary sister Gloria and joined the small army of schoolchildren congregating around the front door of JFK Elementary, all waiting to be let inside so they could get this day over with. The murmurs among the children was largely talk about summer vacation and how eager they all were to begin it, which Bill couldn't blame them for. He found Natasha's best friend, a girl named Becky Summers, and another girl she was friends with, a brunette named Caroline Reed, and the three of them began to gossip about this topic and that topic, everything from cartoons to cute boys, all of it being interspersed with an abundance of mirthful laughter.  Bill was enjoying the conversation so much, lost in the sheer novelty of what he was experiencing, being trapped in the body of a little girl who up until ten minutes ago didn't exist, that he didn't notice that the reason behind his curious fate was sitting very abruptly less than five feet away, soaking in the morning sun's rays. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, Bill didn't have a chance to notice the stone as the front doors opened, teachers and school staff beckoning the kids to enter the school and find their classrooms before the bell rang, which they all did, with some stragglers, but there's always stragglers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill followed Becky and Caroline to a room marked by a bordered blue sign containing stenciled in white letters indicating whose teaching domain this was:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>MS. WICK- FIRST GRADE </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill didn't remember having a Ms. Wick. His first grade teacher had been a woman named Mrs. Kimmel. He considered the possibility that Ms. Wick must be a new teacher, but he nixed that idea. He easily could have just never had a chance to meet her before today. Bill found that the class had a seating arrangement, with himself, Becky, and Caroline situated off the left hand side of the room. They all sat down next to each other, still laughing over a silly preadolescent meme they had been giggling over outside. The other pupils were having their own side conversations. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nLess than a minute later, an adult woman entered the room, her presence preceded by the click-clacking of her blue heels, and most of the students instinctively sat up straight from their slouches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning Ms. Wick!\u201d they all shouted, some out of tune despite themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning class\u201d smiled the brown haired woman of about forty years of age. Bill noticed that she was putting up a very pleasant looking demeanor, but she was likely hiding something painful, as she looked like she had recently been crying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you would, please pull out your textbook to page 520. Today we're going to learn about units of measurement , and after that, we're going to finish off the basics of geometry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill reached under Natasha's desk and found a large blue textbook and turned to the appropriate page. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class went by pretty easily for Bill, and he found himself enjoying the class. He had acquired two new friends, even if he'd never see them again, and Ms. Wick was a pleasant teacher who was good at her job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the kids went off to lunch, Kathleen sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had put up a good front. She had to, and more pertinently, she wanted to. Kathleen Wick wasn't even close to that sad point in her education career where she had given up on her students, or became wantonly cynical about her job. She loved these kids. It's just...where to begin?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dating life was the pits. She was self-conscious about getting older, and though she arguably had become ever cuter as the years wore on, aging like a fine wine, more and more doors were closing off to her every day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHell, it wasn't even just the crippling loneliness. Kathy had a severe wanderlust and a thirst for adventure inside of her, but despite her four decades, she had hardly traveled the world at all. She had never jumped out of an airplane. Never ran with the bulls in Spain. Never went scuba diving. Never even been to Vegas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKathy looked at the gemstone she had found laying outside the front double doors earlier this morning, taking it out of her burlap purse. She wondered where it had come from, surmising that it belonged to perhaps some student's parent. Maybe Natasha Vanapoulos or Trevor Windham had taken it out of their mother's jewelry box and brought it in for Show and Tell, dropping it by mistake. At least, that was the closest reasonable explanation that the teacher could think of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gripped it tightly and made a silent prayer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cI wish I were somewhere relaxing and exotic right now\u201d</i> she whispered to herself, gripping the stone in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stone began to glow below Kathy's desk, and in an instant, she found herself elsewhere...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: The Stone transports Kathleen to an exotic location somewhere in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: The stone transports Kathleen to a faraway beach in the South of France. The stone still in Ms. Wick's hand, Bill remains trapped as Natasha for the foreseeable future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: The Stone transports Kathleen somewhere...else.</span></div></div>",

That somehow it was magical and all powerful. Bill didn't know why he thought this, he just knew. He also felt like he DESERVED to own it. Somehow, Bill felt intimately connected to the Ahn'Ger stone, as if all his of his short life had been destined to lead up to him finding it this morning. Something deep inside Bill told him that that Ahn'Ger stone was his Excalibur, his Mjolnir...his Golden Spatula from that Spongebob Squarepants episode he saw as a kid. Why else would it just randomly appear on the porch? He was coming up with plans to get it out of Gloria's hands without attracting her attention or resistance. After all, in this little girl body, even Gloria could overpower him now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Natasha side of her personality, however, had other plans. She really looked up to and admired her big sister, and wanted to do everything to please her. She also had zero interest in the stone aside from it looking really pretty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill attempted to talk Gloria into giving him the stone, but instead Natasha's own wishes came out of his mouth:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGloria, can we go to the beach after school? You know, before Mom gets home?\u201d added Natasha in her adorable lisp. She had recently lost one of her baby teeth, and her tongue couldn't stop stroking the empty gap in mouth which was still a little sensitive to the touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d yelled a psychic Bill to his other personality, trying to assume dominance over his six year old alter ego to no avail. She was ignoring him, if she had noticed Bill's pleas at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria's annoyed demeanor softened a little into a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course we can. Anything for my little sis! Now come on, I can't be late. See, there's Becky!

History had just been rewritten, and now things would never be the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill himself had hardly been paying attention to his mother's histrionic rants. He was used to them by now, and so whenever she yelled at him, it went inside one ear and out the other like so much empty noise. This was a day he should have been paying attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne moment he had seen Tom finally approaching the house to go to school with him, but now? Now, after seeing how the Ahn'Ger stone had irrevocably changed him, Bill was stuttering nonsensically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-w-w-w-w\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha stared happily at the gorgeous spring morning going on all around her while she sipped her chai  tea casually. A neighbor boy, Tom Ackerman, waved at Martha and approached the front steps in a casual jogging stroll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs Bill ready yet?\u201d asked Tom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha rolled her eyes sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf he's not, he will be. I'll go fetch him\u201d she said. \u201cWould you like any breakfast while you're here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom grinned. \u201cActually, I wouldn't mind that at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha nodded, and then turned to her stuttering former son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWillow, could you go fetch Tom some eggs and bacon for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-s-sure\u201d said Bill, shocked at his current predicament. He shuffled inside the front door, walking past the foyer, briefly passing by a mirror where he saw his new self. He looked exactly like Mom. An exact double. A twin. He was even wearing her exact clothing choices. He couldn't look at himself  anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy can't anyone recognize how crazy this all  is?\u201d thought Bill as he robotically gathered eggs and bacon from the stove top skillet onto a plate. \u201cWhy did Mom call me Willow? That's not my name!\u201d. Across from him, Bill's father Greg and his little sister Kimmy were busy drinking orange juice, Kimmy slurping it down nosily, while eating their own breakfast. Neither had asked even once who this stranger was and what  had happened to Bill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food all ready, Bill  began to walk out of the kitchen when he saw his mother in the foyer and approached her. Even walking felt different with these wider hips and different center of gravity. Martha took the  plate of eggs and bacon and began to walk outside to give it to Tom when they were both interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Mom. Hey Aunt Willow\u201d said the doppelganger Bill casually as he rapidly descended the stairs, leaving in a hurry to head to school. \u201cMmm eggs, can I have some?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Bill, eggs are for closers and sons who wake up on time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww man\u201d said Other Bill as he  put on his backpack...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Tom can share his own eggs with you. You two  have got five minutes\u201d said Martha as she smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Mom\u201d smiled back. They hugged each other, and the real Bill blanched. He hadn't been that affectionate towards his mother in months. All three joined Tom on the front porch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Bill is now Martha's twin sister. Martha still has the stone on her because she made the last wish with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Bill is now Martha's twin sister. Bill is still the owner of the stone because he's the one who found it first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: As the Bill that found the Stone no longer exists, the Ahn'Ger Stone is nowhere to be found!</span></div></div>",

Or her now, rather. Bill tried to calm down by breathing slowly, but every time he took a breath, he felt his new breasts jiggle up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill looked over himself, noticing his perfectly manicured hands, a purple coat of nail polish on them, and the wide hips he noted earlier. He had to admit that he looked rahter fashionable, all things considered, as he wore a nice blouse and pants combo, with a white jacket to put it all together. He brushed his now longer hair behind his ears, and put a hand to his face. His skin felt rougher, older, with wrinkles and make-up surrounding it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill just couldn't believe it. Just moments ago, he was just Bill, living what he thought was a perfectly normal reality. Now, he apparently was a woman named Willow, the twin sister to his mother Martha, if the information he had just pieced together was right. But how? Why? What could have...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Bill's eyes glanced down to Martha's hand. More specifically, the green glow coming from Martha's hand. That stone! It had to be that stone! As crazy as it sounded, as crazy as it WAS, that stone wasn't there yesterday, and now that it was, things had somehow gone berserk. Whatever was happening, that stone was the key, and now Bill's goal was to get it back in his hands and figured out how it worked, to figure out how to make things normal again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye, Aunt Willow!\" Other Bill suddenly shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill had been so lost in thought that he hadn't noticed that Bill, Tom, and Kimberly were now on their way to school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye Bill. Bye Kimberly. Nice to see you, Tom.\" Bill/Willow said. As weird as that sounded to him. He had to play along for now.

He didn't know exactly what was bothering her right now, but it  had to be something big. His mom had always had a lot on her plate, what with her high pressure job, with bills piling up, with her husband having a drinking problem, with her own parents being both elderly and quite ill, and with the uncertain fate of the futures of her two children, among other things. She tried to hide it, but Martha was two steps away from a nervous breakdown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom\u201d said Bill calmly, trying to reassure her. Bill wanted to let  her know that everything was going to be alright. He approached her slowly, laying a loving hand on her shoulder. Despite his good intentions, Martha ignored her son's affectionate gesture in a fit of self destructive anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDAMN IT!\u201d she  yelled with a hint of oncoming tears, her face contorting into a caricature of frustration. \u201cSOMETIMES I WISH THAT I WERE A KID AGAIN!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the gemstone that Martha was holding in her hand suddenly erupted in an explosion of emerald light. Bill noticed the light trying to escape her grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom! Look at your hand!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my g...\u201d was all that Martha could say before being cut off, as the mysterious light rapidly washed over the both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, the front porch was empty. Martha and Bill were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Bill and Martha re-materialized, it was Bill who was the first to notice that something was wrong. His hand had been affectionately grasping his mother's shoulder, but now he was embracing some girl he didn't recognize. This girl looked about sixteen years old, just a year younger than Bill himself, but everything about her screamed that she was from the past. Her hairstyle, her clothing,  her shoes. It's like she stepped right out a 1980s John Hughes movie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d he asked inquisitively, and suddenly covered his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl whom he didn't recognize briefly glared at Bill. Then her jaw silently dropped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bill looked around, he realized that he was no  longer outside. He was in a bedroom meant for a teenage girl. However, everything about it was retro as well, from the bedspread, to the posters adorning the wall, to the carpeting, just like the girl herself. Bill assumed that it was this girl's room, but who was she, and how did they get here? Where was mom? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore  importantly, why did Bill's voice sound so feminine all of a sudden?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill looked down and received his answer. He was now a woman, a much older woman, perhaps in her forties judging by the conservative nature of her clothing. His nails were long and coated in red polish.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA handsome looking middle aged man suddenly walked into the open bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWillow? Martha? Are you ladies ready to go out to dinner?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: The year is now 1986. Martha has de-aged to her teenage self, and Bill has transformed into a younger version of his own grandmother Willow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Something else</span></div></div>",

His classes had ended for the day and he was left with a few hours to kill before the love of his life Sharon was done with hers. The small apartment was quiet, with only the noise of normal campus traffic filtering through the walls. It had been a challenging semester, his advanced classes in engineering had demanded a lot of work from him and it was rare for him to have more than an hour or two free, most of which were spent driving around the city and the nearby towns looking for jobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd not just engineering jobs, but any jobs at all. Mark's resume was severely lacking in actual work experience, he had spent most of his high school experience playing basketball and baseball. His grand total of work experience could be summed up with \"Worked a summer at Wal Mart\". And even though he was now highly educated, in this economy not many companies were looking to hire engineers that had no work experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had stressed Mark out and he hadn't even been able to find much comfort from his parents, who used every time they spoke to bad mouth Sharon or talk him out of marrying her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're both too young\" or \"She's an atheist, you can't marry an athiest\" or \"I know this sweet girl that already has a fast track job to a corporate executive position, you should get to know her, I'm sure you two will have so much in common!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNor could Mark bring himself to talk about his problems in front of his friends or even Sharon. He felt that it just wasn't their problem or business to deal with, and even though he did love Sharon, he didn't want to give her cause to leave him if he appeared weak or that he wouldn't be able to provide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with all these worries weighing down on him, Mark did the only thing a stressed out guy could do: Play some video games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was sitting down on the couch in front of their modestly sized TV, the Xbox powering on when suddenly a flash of light and a loud pop killed the power. Mark looked around for the source of disruption and was startled to see and hunched form of what appeared to be a naked woman  on the floor in behind him, a small circle of singed carpet surrounding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...who the fuck are you!?\" Mark yelled, jumping up from the couch, the Xbox controller raised threateningly. \"Tell me who you are right now or I'll call the cops!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gasp the woman shot up, her long dark hair swinging wildly and her exposed breasts bouncing. As she rose, Mark caught the sight of what looked to be a purse, or a holster of some sort. Something metallic gleamed in the late afternoon light. She turned to face Mark, her eyes wide and full of adrenaline, and she tore around the side of the couch faster than Mark expected grabbing him by the shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have much time, you have to listen to me! I'm from the future and the world is ending! I've come back in time to give you this!\" She almost screamed in his face, Mark so taken aback that he could only blink before shoving her backwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get the fuck off me and get the fuck out of my house!\" Mark yelled as the woman stumbled backwards, giving a slight grunt but recovering quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no time!\" The woman said, quickly pulling the metallic object. Mark tensed up, waiting for it to be a gun or a knife or some other weapon. Instead, she held it out to him and he could see it in it's entirety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a remote. It wasn't any brand or design that he recognized, but it was clearly a remote. It had a screen at the top, which set it apart, but other than a few strange dials and knobs the rest of the buttons looked pretty similar to the remote to the TV next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on, take it! Take it!\" The woman hissed with urgency, taking a few steps forward and shoving it upwards into Mark's face. Mark, however was hesitant to touch anything. Clearly this woman was on drug and that remote could be stolen property! It just wasn't worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way. I don't know you, and I don't know how the hell you got in here but you need to leave. Now.\" Mark said, backing away towards the phone behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Oh. Right.\" The woman looked puzzled for a moment, \"This is all new to you. I don't have much time though. I'm from the future, I'm here because the time machine can only send two inanimate articles back with someone. You my ancestor, and the world is literally coming to an end in my time as we speak. It may have already ended. I don't know. You have to take this device, you are the only person in the world that can prevent my timeline from happening. You can't marry Sharon. That's the key! But you can't just break up with her! You've got to-ARGH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss, I...Are you high? Am I? I just...what are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark never got his answer as the woman began to scream, the remote tumbling from her hands and dropping harmlessly on the couch cushions. Her entire body turned...fuzzy. That was the only word Mark could find for it. She seemed to suddenly look like she was part of an old VHS tape, and pieces of her began to break apart and vanish into nothingness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god it hurts!\" She screamed, falling backwards as her legs began to fragment away into nothing. \"Please, Mark, you have to listen to me! I've changed things just by coming back, I'm being erased! But so long as the remote exists, the end of the world is still going to happen! You have to stop it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Mark was speechless, and with a blood curdling scream that faded into distortion, the woman was gone and only sign that she had ever been there was the remote, sitting on the couch. Even the burn marks behind the couch were gone, and the power to the TV and the Xbox were restored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit...\" Mark whispered to himself, \"Did that just happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his caution Mark found himself reaching towards the remote, picking it up and moving his hands across it. It was cool and metallic to the touch, the button and knobs easily pliable. He pressed the large red button at the top of the remote, assuming it was the power button and his guess was proven correct; the screen came to life though only with a slight blue glow<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWELCOME it said, PLEASE SELECT MODE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Mark, in his curiosity, pressed a button.</span></div></div>",

Holding it up close, he was able to see the pixels of the display. It all felt too solid to be his imagination. But, with what had just happened... or rather what he'd just dreamed? imagined? he wasn't sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned it over and over in his hands. The buttons feeling real too, he looked at the back of the remote. He wanted to see a company logo, or something that meant he could identify who was behind this prank, even if he couldn't work out how he'd been pranked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe back of the controller, seemed to split the light, a vague rainbow shimmer running across the metal, but it didn't look cheap, or fake. An expensive joke, he hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fingers shook with anger, as a thought occurred. Had he been dosed with something, was this a hallucination. But, even as that thought struck him, he glared around the empty room. Nothing looked or felt wrong. Everything was sharp, in focus, he didn't have any sense of disorientation, or distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling one button shift beneath his touch, Mark tightened his grip to avoid dropping the thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did, that was when he was hit by a dizzying sensation, as if his knees were weakening. His eyeline dropped by a foot, and he tried to steady himself to stop crashing to the floor. However, another factor was leaping to the top of Mark's priorities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down, seeing a canyon of cleavage instead of his feet, his legs spreading wide bracing against his disturbed centre of balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/983289e15c67b06d7bae948c46932617/tumblr_osv5teX7fz1w2lwkto1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/983289e15c67...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis grip tightened around the remote, as he shifted to holding it with one hand. The other shifting to his new rippling, rolling bust. It too felt real, the embroidery on the cups as his fingers brushed over them worrying. Also his fingers looked slimmer, more feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gasp spilled from her lips, as another thought occurred. His hands dropping to his crotch, there to find, matching underwear.... panties!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse still, they fitted, and Mark confirmed he was fully female. A last desperate hope that he was <i>tucked away</i>, instead finding a full, round rear that also made her quail in fear. The whole room felt bigger, more intimidating, and <i>his?... her!</i> grip tightened. Afraid both of the remote, and of losing it, and any hope of returning to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remote issued two sharp beeps, and Mark, felt odd. She looked for other changes, for <i>her... his</i> restoration. But her eyeline remained at the same low level, perhaps a foot or more lower than she liked. The bra remaining steadfastly real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hit her. Her bust was growing. Between one breath and the next it surged forward, gaining a full cup size. The weight on her shoulders a reminder increasing too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/f7be710a3caa9da251cfb437f5b9d91d/tumblr_osv5teX7fz1w2lwkto2_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/f7be710a3caa...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mark watched, scowling at her expanded bust, she tried to glare it back into shrinking to it's former dimensions. She quickly shook her head 'no', as she recalled the two beeps.... two! Even as she dreaded it, she felt the same nervousness in the pit of her soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain the girls grew. Mark wasn't familiar with this view of cleavage, but was damned sure that she was now amongst the most 'blessed' girls, especially with her shorter height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/371d47332f51ea369d94812bcfcdeb45/tumblr_osv5teX7fz1w2lwkto3_r1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/371d47332f51...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ache in her shoulders being accompanied by a twinge from the base of her spine. Rolling her shoulders, and flexing, Mark eased her straining muscles. Darting to the bathroom, Mark needed to examine things. Well, his darting was only a pace or two, as she felt her bust shift, the girls' inertia threatening to throw her off balance. But she made it to the mirror in the bathroom. Her shaving mirror!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to find the humiliations mounting. It was too high, she was able to see her eyes and hairline. Her bust not visible in the reflection. Mark had to take a step backwards. The chill porcelain pressing against her bust was making her nipples stiffen. It was more than Mark could deal with...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was an early June morning in the suburban outskirts of Boise, Idaho.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandy Veltman didn't try to hide his annoyance as he loaded the suitcases into the back of his black SUV, grunting in annoyance rather than exertion as he listened to his wife, Norma, fritter about behind him. He must have been either bored or particularly weak to have agreed to her idiotic and expensive plan for a 'second honeymoon'. Randy was content with his life, work hard during the week and come home to a full meal and later a beer to nurse until sleep, with the weekends reserved for ballgames, fishing trips and more beer. It was just a waste of time doing all this packing and money going somewhere he didn't even like! The only saving grace was that his friend Carl and his wife were coming along, and Randy hoped the women would entertain themselves while he and Carl slipped off to a strip club or three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Randy, it's just going to be wonderful! I know we'll have a great time on this trip! Don't you think so?\" Norma's voice was shrill and echoed off the walls of the two car garage as she brought out the last of the travel cases, setting them beside Randy's trunk-like legs before stepping back and staring at the broad, flannel wearing giant that quickly loaded them on top of the other three suitcases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Norma, right now the only thing I can think about is the giant gaping hole in our bank account where money used to be. I don't see why you chose Las Vegas. We could have saved a ton of money if you'd just let me pick the place\" Randy turned to face Norma, staring down at her much smaller form as he closed the SUV's back hatch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't want to smell like fish or get bitten by bugs. Las Vegas is fun! I promise, we'll have a great time!\" Norma's voice was almost too happy, as if she was trying to convince herself of what she had said, but Randy paid this no mind. He simply rolled his eyes and walked past her, out of the garage and into the kitchen, the door slamming shut behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want you to give it a chance...\" Norma whispered to herself, hearing the telltale sounds of Randy pulling a beer out of the fridge, his heavy footfalls fading away deeper into the modest two story house that her family had lived in for fourteen years. She just wanted to keep it that way, Norma was grasping at any straws she could find to keep her from leaving Randy, and this was the very last thing she could think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Maybe' she thought 'He'll have so much fun he'll forget himself'</i> The long suffering housewife though to herself as she followed through the door shrotly after. One downside, outside of Randy's negative attitude that it, was inviting Carl and Jennifer along for the ride. While Norma like Jennifer somewhat, the younger woman's mannerisms and abrasive attitude towards his wife long a foul taste in her mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, with a slam of a door acrss the street, Norma heard the distinct sound of a door slamming. Walking over to one of the window slats in the garage door, she was greeting by the greatly mismatched pair of the Fischels leaving their house across the street and headed for hers. Carl, as usual, was lugging more than his fair share of the baggage on his small frame while Jennifer clipped across the pavement in the latest fashions that upper middle class fashion allowed her to buy. And both of them looked unhappy, though Norma wasn't quite sure if that was just the almost comical amount of bags Carl was carrying or just a general look of unhappiness. As their husbands were best friends (or, Norma sometimes wondered, boss and minion) Norma knew about the stresses that Jennifer found herself under. During couples night or seemingly endless fishing vacations or cleaning up dinner while their husbands drank beer in front of a football game, both wives had confided in each other. Jennifer feeling trapped in a marriage of convenience more than a marriage of love, and Norma desperately trying to keep hers from fading away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women were friends, more or less, though Norma did resent Jennifer being so self-centered and general unwillingness to talk about Norma's problems. But Norma didn't have anyone else that understood what she was going through. Just the PTA momsquad and her old, now distant friends through Facebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least we'll be able to distract each other if this goes wrong...\" Norma said as she hit the hit, causing the garage door to start it's slow, noisy crawl open and giving a forcibly cheerful wave hello.<br>\r\n_<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, on the otherwise empty second story of the Veltman home, Laura Veltman was busy checking all of the window locks, lightbulbs and everything else the sixteen year old girl was being expected to take care of while her mom and dad were in Las Vegas. It was summer, so at least she didn't have to worry about having to get both of them ready for school in the mornings, but still, Laura had a lot on her mind, as did her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eight year old brother Jonah sat on the top step of the stairs and tapped listlessly away on his tablet, waiting for the inevitable parade of goodbyes before he was left alone with his sister for a week. Jonah loved his sister and wasn't afraid or angry he had to spend a week following her rules, but it was the reason why his parents were going on the trip that made him feel uneasy. And the fact that Laura clearly knew but wasn't telling him made him frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Squirt\" Laura said, finally finished with her preparatory chores and taking a seat on the stairs beside him, \"I was thinking pizza and Iron Man tonight? I bet if we start at the beginning we can watch ALL of the superhero movies by the time mom and dad get home!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care\" Jonah pouted, sticking his head further into his tablet, tapping away at some mindless game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, it'll be fun! Maybe, if you keep it a secret, we'll invite Lindsey and Brandon over and we can play video games on dad's big TV~\" Laura said, her voice playful and singsongy as she tried to lift her little brother's spirits, even if she was hiding the same general feeling of helplessness and fear on the inside. She was rewarded with Jonah's face lighting up with a hushed \"Really!?\" as she lifted him out of his mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah little bro, mom and dad arent't the only ones who get to have fun this week! But you gotta keep it all a secret!\" Laura said as she brought him in for a big sisterly hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't blind to her parent's dissolving marriage and the way her dad more or less ignored the three of them. Sure she knew that on some level her dad loved her and Jonah, but it had been a very long time since Laura had last heard him say \"I love you\" to any extent to any of them. And she'd seen mom trying not to cry when Laura had asked about the possibility of a divorce last month. Unless Jonah directly asked, she wasn't going to say anything about the looming divorce, and she was determined to make this week a fun one for him. If things didn't go the way mom wanted them to go in Vegas, it could be the last enjoyable one that Jonah would have for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura tussled Jonah's hair and gave him a quick big sister tickle as he ran off to his room, a huge smile on his face. As soon as he was out of earshot Laura's own smile faded and she rested her head in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wish that something would happen this week to fix this mess!\" She whispered, and wiped back a stray tear as she heard the garage door opening and Mrs. Fischel call out to her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Laura know that her words would set loose a chain of events that would change everyone's lives, for better or for worse. Something flickered on the back porch of reality and the screen door that divided the realm of the impossible from the possible was flung open as a nameless force that some would call 'magic' filled the Veltman house and everyone in it. Laura had extended an invitation of sorts, the right combination of words and emotion that made the veil thin enough for 'magic' to make it's way into our world. And although it wasn't 'intelligent' like Laura or any human, it was not mindless. It was brought into this reality to serve a purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt spread itself through every inch of the Veltman house, feeling the emotion and the history within it's walls, experiencing decades within the span of a few seconds and feeling completely sympathetic to the families within. With a flash of light visible only to those able to see 'magic', it decided to grant the young human's wish by bonding itself to her, the younger human, and all four of the older humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd although the intentions of 'Magic' were very well meaning, it's actions had an adverse affect on reality that would change all of their lives forever.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Randy was bringing one last bag out to the garage when the force closest identified as 'Magic' decided to make it's changes. It's purpose, as defined by Laura Veltman's wish, was to \"Make something happen to fix this mess\". It had scanned the Veltman house and everyone in it, including the newly arrived Fischels, all the way down to their emotional cores, and the empathic history of the house. And what it saw in it's all knowing yet rather clueless interpretation of events was that clearly the male and female humans had very little appreciation for each other and their struggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Magic decided that clearly the only real resolution was to switch the genders and roles of everyone in the house at the time of the change for one week. If no resolution was reached that would make the original reality better, then clearly this reality was superior. So in the time that it took a hummingbird's heart to beat once, Magic altered the very fabric of reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandall 'Randy' Veltman was now Miranda 'Randi' Johnson, short and very feminine in clothing and make-up that accented her mature female body and made her look several years younger and more attractive. Her auburn hair was shoulder length and styled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorma Veltman was now Norman Johnson. Gone was the sundress and sandals and housewife body, replaced with a dark red polo shirt that seemed strained by the muscles of his new physique. A pair of worn but respectable jeans stretched down to a pair of sneakers. Her former blonde curls was now little more than a buzzcut hidden by a ballcap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura Veltman was now Lucas Johnson. Gone was her female form, her long straight hair and girl next door looks, instead replaced by a curly haired teenage boy in a pair of beat up jeans and a dark blue t-shirt. Splotches of acne dotted his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonah Veltman was now Joanna Johnson. Where there had been an normal eight year old boy was now an eight year old girl in sweat pants and a Miraculous Ladybug t-shirt, her formerly short hair now hanging in a ponytail down the length of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the Fischels, Magic included them even if they had not been the intended targets of the wish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl Fischel became Carly Morrison. Her formerly early balding, slightly hunched pale body was straightened and smoothed, rejuvenated blonde hair hanging down past her shoulders and impressive breasts almost bursting out of a blue sundress. Her glasses shifted from being a requirement for driving to stylish black shades and her full lips were painted red with lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer Fischel became Jeffery Morrison, and her former elegant female body seemed to shrivel as it lost it's glory. Breasts shrank to barely muscled pecs, her glorious black hair whisped away to a barely managable combover, and her clothes went from stylish to bland, her dress segmenting into a pair of black slacks and a featureless maroon button down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as the people within the house changed, so did the house. All photos changed to represent the new identities, rooms changed to reflect new style preferences, even the vehicles changed, the large SUV becoming a large cab truck with a covered, lockable bed cover, Norma's former white economy car shifting to a small Volkswagon. Across the road, the former Fischel house endured similar changes to fit the new reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied that it's work was done, the force of 'Magic', had it been a visible, tangible object, did the equivalent of curling up and going to sleep, waiting for this exact moment next week to awaken and assess if the wish criteria had been met or not. If it was, then Magic would simply revert the changes. If it hadn't, then Magic would not force that obviously inferior, sad reality back into existence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the time it took for a hummingbird's heart to beat twice, the new reality solidified into place.</span></div></div>",

It had entered this new reality on the basis of a heartfelt wish that had created a doorway through which 'Magic' could enter the human world. Magic, had it the capacity to realize itself and assign to it such corporeal and crude labels and identifiers, would have called itself a 'emotional' being. It had been called by the sheer heartbreak and sadness behind the younger female human's wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was why when Magic entered this reality it had immediately expanded across the entire Veltman property, analyzing the humans and the home itself down to their emotional and empathic cores. It knew the Veltmans and Fischels even better than they knew themselves and it sympathized and loved all of them, even to the point where it outright ignored emotional concepts such as hate, rage, bitterness, jealousy and so many others. All Magic saw was six umans in deep emotional turmoil, and all of which just wanted to be happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was why Magic was determined to give them a great and wonderful gift that they would certainly use to fix their lives for the better. Though it both knew and had no idea what a 'wish' was, Magic knew that it was the key to solving the unhappiness of these two families. After all, what better way to make them happy again by allowing their greatest wishes to come true?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the time it took a hummingbird's heart to beat once, Magic selfless bonded itself to the individuals. It would be a part of them until they died, if they died, and although it did seem a bit unwise, Magic decided that it would fully give itself to them. No interference on part of it's own reasoning, it would be completely bound to the will and whims of the individuals from this moment until the end of their moments.

It's logic, alien as it was, was influenced by the emotional wellspring of the Veltman house, and it had determined that the female humans were far more in touch with their own emotions, less guarded like the human males were. And Magic was an emotional being, and it was the emotion that had called it into this reality to begin with. There were no doubt that some out there would, if they could see or even comprehend what Magic was that they'd call it's logic sexist, but Magic didn't care. With a flash of light not visible on this plane of existence, it sacrificed it's freedom to give Norma, Jennifer and Laura the ability to grant their own wishes. This change was not noticed by the Veltmans or Fischels, nor did they feel any different. The three women had no idea of the sheer power they now possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the last of your crap, Norma.\" Randy said, shoving the small nylon bag into his wife's hands as he headed to help Carl. The smaller man was trying his best not to look overloaded, but one of the suitcases was already close to slipping out of the SUV and clattering to the garage's concrete floor. Eager to avoid another incident like the last time the two couples had gone on vacation ,Randy quickly grabbed the suitcase and almost effortless slid in back into the Tetris-like stack of luggage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Randy\" carl said, wiping his expansive forehead the comb-over did little to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep\" The larger man said, doing nothing while Norma slid between the two men and placed the small nylon bag on top of the stack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, nice and tidy like a bow!\" She exclaimed with a smile, glancing upwards at her husband. All she wanted was some kind of response just to show he was going to try...but her hopes were once against dashed as he simply removed her bag and shoved it in a smaller gap between the suitcases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to actually stack luggage so it doesn't roll around\" Was all Randy said before closing the SUV's hatch. The four adults stood in an awkward silence for a moment before Norma spoke up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if we're all packed, let's go say bye to the kids and get this show on the road!\" She reached for Randy's hand but he was already moving towards the driver side door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the car door and pulled himself in, \"I already said mine while I was getting your crap.\" He said as he slammed the door shut and started the ignition, the SUV's motor loud within the small space of the garage. \"Make it quick, will you? We're already running late\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...okay then...\" Norma responded weakly, \"Jen, Carl, you go ahead and get in, I won't be a minute\". The already emotionally exhausted woman quickly left the garage and made her way through the interior of the house, looking over everything to make sure the house was in a safe, secure state. After her quick check of all the doors and the windows, she crossed into the living room, where here two children sat on the bottom step of the stairs; Laura giving her a worried look while Jonah's head was buried in his tablet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well guys, guess I'm out!\" Norma said, opening her arms wide and giving her children a large smile. Laura was, predictably, the first one to act. Norma's only daughter embraced her mother with a large hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I hope...I just want you guys to have a great time, okay? I wish dad was more open to your ideas and so you two could...\" Laura's voice was a choked whisper, raw emotion through. \"Oh mom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh, honey. It's okay. I'll make it work! I bet you won't even recognize your father when we get back!\" Norma reassured her daughter, wiping a stray tear from the teenager's face before turning to face her son \"Jonah, can you come say bye to mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\" Jonah said and he paused his game and scampered over to his mother, giving her a huge hug around her waist. The boy was a little sad, but all the promises his sister had made him had him more excited and almost eager for his mom to leave. Norma bent down and returned the hug, giving him a large kiss the cheek. \"I call you later before bed, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay mom\" The boy said, wiggling out of the hug and pulling the tablet back up to his face. Norma turned to face Laura once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I'm off, then. Remember, emergency numbers are-\" She started, but was silenced as Laura finished her sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the fridge, leftovers in the fridge, pizza money on your dresser, no boys and bed by 8 and eleven. I got his, mom\" Laura said with smirk, \"Now go...just have fun okay? Even if he doesn't want you to\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that her daughter knew so much about the failures of the marriage made Norma's heartbreak, but she put on a brave face, gave one final hug, and left the house. A few moments later there was just the slow, loud roar of the garage door closing and the rev of an engine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vacation had finally begun.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was another early June morning in the suburban outskirts of Boise Idaho.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl Fischel was trying his best not to grunt as the suitcases full of his wife's clothing threatened to slip from his grip. Jen was beside him, chittering off a list of all the things she expected to do, and for Carl to pay for, while they were in Vegas. She carried only a small purse and her smartphone, flicking through her DVR app and making sure her almost countless reality TV shows were set to record over the next week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you made sure to check our reservations this morning at the Belagio, right? If we get there and there's no reservation I absolutely REFUSE to stay in a Motel 8! And there's several shows I want to see so I hope you were listening when I told you to order those tickets! And would it kill you to have as much fun as me on this trip, sweetie? I don't want to spend the whole thing dealing with Norma while you and Carl sneak off to the casinos!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did, dear. That won't happen, dear.  I will, dear.\" Came his canned and memorized responses. Carl loved Jennifer, or at least he was pretty sure he did. She was demanding, controlling, but when was the last time that a math nerd like him ended up with a girl that had been prom queen, cheerleading captain and a sorority babe? Not outside of Hollywood, he guessed. And he did enjoy making Jennifer happy, but there were times when she just drove him up a wall. Not that he'd ever say that, of course. That's where all the fishing trips with Randy came in, when Carl could just hang out, drink beer and just enjoy the company of his friend that honestly did not care about domestic problems at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always say that! Why can't you-\" Jennifer started as they cleared the pavement and stepped up onto the sidewalk in front of the Veltman residence. Carl was such a twerp sometimes. Sure, he was good at what he did and kept her very well pampered, but sometimes she just could not stand the amount of useless he was. She had to remind him to do everything, including to have fun! She was fond of him though, much in the way a animal is fond of the hand that feeds it, and stopped herself short of saying something truly hurtful. She was trying to get better about lashing out after she had made a bit of a scene the last time that they and the Veltmans had gone out on a double date and EVERYONE discovered just how poorly she handled her drinks. But sometimes...she just wished she could get a do-over and marry someone with money AND a spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I'm sor-\" Jennifer's apology cut short as the garage door began groaning open, revealing a waving Norma and a overly cheerful smile on her face. Jennifer fought the urge to roll her eyes, she could already tell the day was off to a great start with her neighbor. She took a quick breath and pushed the annoyance she felt towards her useless husband away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girl!\" Jennifer called out, opening her arms and giving her neighbor a quick hug. \"Thanks again for letting me and Carl tag along, we're just so excited to finally be going back to Vegas! Right babe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes dear\"  Came Carl's response as began the slow process of setting the four suitcases down, wiping the sweat that was beading on his forehead away before once more lifting a suitcase and moving towards the back of the Veltman's SUV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Carl, do you want me to get Randy to load those for you?\" Norma's voice called out, full of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I can manage\" Carl replied as he pulled the SUV's back hatch open, peering through his glasses at the best place to stack his wife's three suitcases and his own small one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure you're gentle, Carl. I don't want to end up with another bunch of broken cosmetics because you didn't stack them right! Otherwise we'll have to restock when we get to Vegas!\" Jennifer called out before turning back to Norma \"Now tell me ALL about the room you guys picked out! We're staying in one of the Belagio suites, you know, close to where all the high rollers in the casino stay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl let loose a low grunt as he loaded the luggage, just trying to keep his mind off how much money he had shelled out for this trip, that maybe he could have married someone a little less high maintenance, or that maybe it'd be nice to be the one in the driver seat of the relationship, giving out orders for once. And then it happened, the entire world changed around him as a unheard wish made by his best friend's daughter invited in a powerful force that would change his life forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Magic', insomuch as the force could be called, filled the entirety of the Veltman property, leeching into the very essence of the home as it absorbed every moment that had taken place within it's walls. During it's relentless exploration of the Veltman home it surged into the garage and across every individual within it, including Jennifer and Carl Fischel. The wish that had brought it into this reality had been intended for everyone with the last name of 'Veltman' but it had not been specifically stated that 'Magic' couldn't help out another struggling couple whose emotional turmoil it sampled as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, 'Magic' knew what to do.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carl's grip on Jennifer's make-up bag slipped the moment the entity most closely identified as 'Magic' made it's decision. 'Magic', you see, had been called into this reality by a wish to \"that something would happen this week to fix this mess!\". Who made it, Magic wasn't sure, it all happened in a bit of a rush to be honest. All it knew was that it was in this reality now and it was being drawn towards some sort of emotional circus somewhere nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Magic took a pretty quick look around the place. While it had no real sense of aesthetics, Magic thought the house looked pretty nice, cozy, it supposed. But then it felt the emotional trauma happening pretty much...everywhere within the structure. It wasn't a pleasant feeling and magic simply did not have time to deal with it, even though the concept of time didn't really apply to Magic, even in it's original reality. The whirlwind of emotions, at the strained glance Magic was willing to give it was that the two human females liked each other, but harbored far more resentment towards the human males. The human males were fond of each other's company, and found the females to tiresome. There was also a younger human female and a younger human male also on the property but Magic, frankly, was harboring a bit of a grudge since the younger female was the one that dragged it into this mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, two human males that preferred each other to the females, two females that preferred each other to the males and forget the younger two humans. Clearly this was what it was supposed to solve before it would be allowed to be released back to it's own reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Because this is what I am, apparently. I'm a marriage councilor</i> Is what Magic would have said to itself, had it any real grasp of the concept of snark, or knew what a marriage councilor was. It very quickly decided what to do, feeling a tremor ripple through it's untangible mass as it's equivalent of a headache began. With a pulse of energy that altered the entirety of the human reality, it curled up and began to go to sleep, hoping to head off the metaphysical migraine before it hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl Fischel was now Carly Veltman, young and attractive. Her formerly early balding, slightly hunched pale body was straightened and smoothed, rejuvenated blonde hair hanging down past her shoulders and impressive breasts almost bursting out of a blue sundress. Her glasses shifted from being a requirement for driving to stylish black shades and her full lips were painted red with lipstick. And she had gone from loading luggage into an SUV to having her slender, tanned arms wrapped around the bulky trunk of Randy Veltman, her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Norma Veltman instantly became Norman Johnson, her slender, aging female form immediately bulking to an appearance not unlike Hugh Jackman. Her hair vanished to a buzzcut hidden under a ballcap, her muscles strained against a polo shirt instead of breasts against a sundress, and instead of women's sandals there were instead two slightly worn sneakers. Suddenly luggage appeared in his hands as Jennifer's arms slipped around one of his muscled limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>There. You all get to be with the people you like.Try it for one week. If it gets fixed, everything goes back to normal. If it doesn't, then I can't fix it and I'll send you a bill.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Magic was 'gone', at least for a week.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While the adults of both families were undergoing their own major changes in the garage, Laura and Jonah Veltman were undergoing changes of their own. 'Magic', however much of an impatient, inconsiderate entity it had been, did not leave the younger humans out of it's changes. It was, after all, against the 'rules', or whatever passed as limitations for impossibly powerful entities not native to this reality, to simply erase beings from existence in totality. It could only alter the fabric of the human reality, not outright remove parts of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo as the older, questionably mature humans had their lives and identities altered, so did the younger humans, though Magic left these changes entirely up to it's own subconscious logic rather than controlling the changes, as it had with the older humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was the oldest at sixteen, but in the new reality, both of the women were far too young to have a child that old without drastically altering their pasts and thus, altering their relationships to be wholly unsuitable for their current mates. In an instant the years melted off of her, changing her from a teenage girl next door to a young four year old boy as her her name changed from Laura Veltman to Elijah Johnson. She had, in the original reality largely taken after her mother in the looks department and now that her mother was now a man, it was logical that such a strong genetic resemblance would simply be carried over. Though now there were traces of Jennifer within his appearance as the former hoodie and jeans of Laura became a pair of boy's overalls and an Avengers t-shirt with Star Wars light up shows covering his small feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonah underwent a similar change, his age cutting in half from eight to four as well, as his gender shifted from male to female. Carly was a younger woman, and her genes were, in a way, slightly more robust than Randy's, his age playing just the slightest factor. Jonah's name became Haley newly blond hair ran down the length of her back as his previous shorts and Transformers shirt morphed into a frilly pink dress with a heart studded My Little Pony top with white sandals studded with plastic pink flowers slid between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the same amount of time that it took to change the adults, the children were changed as well. Though in order to keep the events of the new timeline in logical order, both children were now sitting on the couch in the Veltman living room, an episode of Teen Titans Go playing mindlessly on the television while a babysitter materialized on the recliner nearby. She was twenty, dirty blonde hair and big green eyes that framed a pretty face, while the rest of her body was clearly that of a cheerleader, a smartphone appearing in her slender hands witth several textbooks, a purse and a backpack appearing next to the recliner. After all, two four years olds would never be expected to take care of themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes shimmered away as 'Magic' finished with the adults and curled up into hibernation.</span></div></div>",

This...this isn't right.\" The babysitter said, and then immediately shot a hand to her mouth while the noise of the Teen Titans Go theme song blared over the television's speakers. \"Did I just...say that? And this? And this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two four year olds turned to look at her strangely, Elijah's eyes squinting in suspicion. \"Are you okay, Ms. Vanessa?\" His voice was unsure, as if he seemed to be speaking to someone he knew and trusted very well, but at the same time someone he had never seen before in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Vanessa', on the other hand, was suddenly realizing that something had gone wrong. Very wrong. She wasn't supposed to be here! But before anyone could fully panic, there was a influx of people into the Veltman living room as the changed adults entered to say goodbye to their new children. Or at least half of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my precious little angel, mommy is gonna miss you so much!\" Jennifer cooed as she scooped a rather bewildered Elijah off the sofa and gave him a large hug and several kisses on the cheek, \"You bee good for Ms. Vanessa okay? Mommy will call you tonight when we get to the hotel! I'll bring you presents!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O...okay mommy! I'll be good. I...love you!\" Elijah's voice was slightly wavering though he seemed more sure of himself now, and his face lit up at the idea of getting presents. As his mother set him down and gave a few sniffles as she fixed his hair, Elijah squirmed and turned to look at his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye, daddy?\" Elijah said as Jennifer finished her primping and and returned to the side of her husband, Norman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...yeah. Bye, uh, sport\" Norman's voice was a deep manly rumble where only moments before it had been a willowly soprano. Both father and son, newly minted, seemed to share a look before their attention was pulled away by the second set of goodbyes as Randy scooped Hayley up in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be a good girl, okay rugrat?\" Randy's voice was full of a half-hearted fatherly concern as he gave the newly minted girl a deep bear hug, to which she only giggled and returned with a big kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay daddy! I will! Can I have a present too?\" Her voice was strong and happy, there was no doubt that this was Randy's daughter as the large man turned his head to look at his freshly made wife, who was standing uncertainly in the doorway of the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy and I will make sure to get you something. Mommy's gonna come say goodbye now and then we and Elijah's mommy and daddy have to go, okay?\" Randy signalled that it was time to leave with a subtle jerk of his head, and Carly took several unsteady steps forward until she was at the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" She started, apparently unsure of what to say, \"Be a good girl for mommy and listen to the babysitter? I...love you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley through her tiny arms around Carly's long blonde locks and gave her a kiss on the cheek, \"Love you too mommy!\" As soon as the tiny arms released her neck Carly stood and began to move away, only to be grabbed by Jennifer as the other mother headed towards 'Vanessa'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now remember the numbers are on the fridge, Elijah is to be in bed NO LATER than 8pm, and he is to brush his teeth after every meal, is that understood? And the meals MUST be healthy! Fruits and vegetables for snacks only! And I want him to have milk, apple juice or water only, no soda or fruit punch! I want a text and picture of the meal before you give it to him so I can make sure you're not giving him any cheats! And always remember that he is to have a bath every night before bed! And make sure that ANY book that you read to him is not scary. If I come home and find him having nightmares, there will be consequences! You come VERY highly recommended so I better not see you ruining my precious little man with cheats! Is that understood?\" Jennifer's voice was stern and uncompromising, her eyes drilling into 'Vanessa'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of...of course. Whatever you say!\" 'Vanessa' replied, the fear that was filling her body very apparent on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carly, do you have anything to add?\" Jennifer turned, facing the new woman, her eyes narrowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly gulped and cast a look between Jennifer and 'Vanessa', \"Yeah, uh, what she said!\" was all she could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more drawn out goodbyes from Jennifer to Elijah, the Veltmans and the Johnsons were gone, the sound of the SUV starting up and the grind of the garage door closing as the two couples sped off towards Las Vegas. The living room returned to normal as the ambient noise of Teen Titans Go returned to the forefront, quickly recapturing the attention of the children, though Elijah continued to cast glances at 'Vanessa'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd 'Vanessa' continued to stare down at herself in a mixture of shock and horror. This was not good, not good at all.</span></div></div>",

Everything was so overwhelming, so new! And so slow! Before this...whatever this was happened she was able to do millions of things in the span of seconds! But now every though was processed only by the rate of her organic, squishy brain! And to make matter worse, she could feel the power of what she had been, but there was no way for her to access it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Vanessa' was so caught up in experiencing her new form that she didn't see, didn't even register as Elijah got up from his seat on the couch and the sea of carpet to her, appearing by her barely covered legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Vanessa, are you okay?\" The boy asked again, and 'Vanessa's' head shot up, her eyes wide with fear before something strange overcame her. Instead of sheer panic, the entity that had once been called 'Magic' was filled with a need to re-assure the child in front of her, despite the fact that she had no real clue about human interaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah Eli, I'm good!\" She said, despite knowing that she really wasn't, \"I just, uh, didn't want to make your mom worry about leaving you here all week!\" Again the answer seemed to placate the boy as he returned to his seat, but the sidelong glances kept coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'All week? Oh holy crap I have to be like this all week?'</i> She thought to herself, and this time she kept herself from saying what she was thinking, thanks to these new found 'human' traits that had somehow been bestowed upon her. Magic, or rather, Vanessa, slowly came to the realization that just like the changes it-she had done moments ago had imparted some sort of normalization effect onto the adults that the same normalization process now applied to her. In fact, while not connected to the memories as a whole, Vanessa realized that she now did indeed have memories. Memories of a childhood never lived, the now seemingly vast history of a world she did not belong in, the popular sayings of her age group, mannerisms befitting a woman and a babysitter, and a need to care for the young children before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt terrified her to the very core, but with normalization all it made her do was turn to stare at the animated cartoon show that she was somehow very familiar with. After all, it was what she had the kids watch at all of her jobs.As the somewhat clever, though mostly bad jokes came rolling in her limited, electrochemical brain began to think of formerly alien things such as college, fashion, boys...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'No. NO. I will not let this personality consume me! I just need to focus on trying to access the power again so I can get back to being me, and I'll make sure to pick something to take my place instead of just winging it. Damnit!

It was the wrong color and it was too poofy and it didn't smell like his house...either forms of them. And he was pretty sure that he'd never seen Ms. Vanessa before this very moment. Half formed memories said that he had, but older, deeper memories argued otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Magic left Laura and Jonah's changes up to the internal, self-driven logic of the 'spell', the spell had simply reduced Laura and implanted the new memories in her head that would make her fit in this new reality where she was the only child of Norman, her former mother turned male, and Mrs. Fischel, now his biological (and quite fussy) mother Jennifer. But somewhere, beneath the layers of half-formed thoughts and excruciating amount of little kid instincts, Laura Veltman still existed. Her memories were far sharper, clearer, and there were simply more of them, which was the primary reason why she had not simply been winked out of existence and replaced entirely with the personality of Elijah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two personalities were simply merged into one new personality that made Elijah Johnson seem far more intelligent and older than he physically was. That was why, despite the fact that he was clearly entertained by the antics of the Teen Titans, he was also annoyed by them. They were childish, comparable to just being brightly colored noise designed to keep kids glued to the TV (and his deeper memories suggested they were an insult to the original show and it's fans), so he pulled himself out of the soft cushion canyon of the the new Veltman couch and began to wander around the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this new reality, Elijah was a guest here. He knew that this was Hayley's house, and that the reason they were not staying at his house was because Hayley got homesick easily and literally. But that was fine with him, he had his video games to keep him company, plus he really liked Hayley. She was fun. But a deeper part of him was disgusted by the thought. He couldn't remember why, he just knew that it was...wrong. So he busied himself exploring all the new things that hadn't been there when this had been his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was certainly geared towards a younger, more energetic couple. Pictures of Hayley's mom and dad doing exciting things like riding a motorcycle, dancing, boat trips and other activities dotted the walls. A LOT of pictures of Hayley dressed up in extravagant dresses, apparently from the moment she was old enough to wear them. A large family portrait of her dad Randy, her mom Carly and Hayley hung above the fireplace. Elijah felt angry looking at it, Randy looked so happy, he was actually smiling! And Carly, whoever this Carly was, clearly wasn't the same woman that had just left. This Carly was clearly confident of her body and loved to show it off with a smile. The blue dress was eye popping, and it hugged her form just right; her breasts dominating the photo. Hayley simply sat in the middle with a happy, girlish smile on her face in an impossibly frilly white dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't seem fair to Elijah. In fact it made him angry enough that he felt the impulse to yell about and go on a destructive rampage through the house. But his older 'self' stopped him, and instead pushed him to continue exploring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually he made his way through the living room and stood at the threshold to the front door, the hallway to the rest of the house and the stairs (which had a larger baby gate on them, clearly to keep Hayley from playing on them). He cast a backwards glance at Ms. Vanessa and Hayley. His best friend was still enraptured by Teen Titans Go, and their babysitter was busy probing her body in a way that no babysitter should, at least in front of children. A slender, manicured finger was poking her large breasts and staring aghast at the movement it caused, pulling at long golden hair in disbelief, slowly moving her hands around in front of her eyes before they began to creep downward across her stomach and examining the button of her jeans, a stray finger sliding behind the fabric...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'NOPE. Nope.' Elijah thought and he called out to Vanessa, \"Ms. Vanessa, can you come get me a drink, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis boyish voice seemed to jerk 'Vanessa' from her exploratory revelry and she spun around in the recliner, clearly lost before her blue eyes locked on him standing in the doorway. \"Uh...Yeah. A drink. Right.\" She said and after a moment of confusion, pulled herself out of the chair and took several unsteady steps over to him, pausing in the doorway and looking down the hall, her brow furrowing with thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This way, Ms. Vanessa!\" Elijah said, and he took off down the short hall, pausing at the end and pointing towards the kitchen doorway, and he watched, curious, as this buxom pneumatic blonde stumbled her way to him, almost tripping over her feet at the last moment and catching herself in the doorway with a cute willowy \"oomph!\".The kitchen while structurally the same as his older self remembered, was aesthetically different like the rest of the house., gone was the old fashioned style, the dated wallpaper, the rustic wooden cabinets and old kitchen table. Instead everything was so...monochromatic. White cabinets, dark black marble counters, stainless steel appliances...It was a very modern kitchen for what was an apparently very modern family. Elijah took a breathe and walked over to the angular table and carefully climbed up the tall wooden mountain of a chair, his head barely clearing the the top of the table as he stared at Vanessa, still propping herself up in the doorway, her eyes still wide and confused as she processed where she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'There's no way this is our real babysitter', Elijah surmised. 'Even a real bimbo would know what to do!'. He coughed and her head whipped towards him, her long locks washing across her face in a wave. The boy pointed towards the sink, \"Can I have a glass of water, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Water. Right. you need that.\" Vanessa said, and with a little more confidence and stability, she made her way slowly through the kitchen, looking only once at Elijah's outstretched finger to make sure she was headed in the right direction. When she finally arrived at the sink, she glanced back at the little boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to get a glass from the cabinet and fill it with water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands reached upwards and to Elijah's surprise, quickly opened and shut several of the cabinets before coming across the one that held the drinking glasses. But then she pulled out a wine glass and held it towards him, a nervous smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's too big. I need a small one\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Because you're small. Have to scale.\" The blonde whispered to herself as she set the wine glass back and in a few moments pulled out a much smaller, orange plastic cup that had a dinosaur on it. It was actually too small, but Elijah said nothing, simply nodding when she held it, almost playfully towards him. Her face lit up with achievement and she held the cup in the sink, fumlbing only once before figuring out how to turn the water on. The cup filled up in an instant and Vanessa slowly, with one hand on top of the cup, made her way to the table, setting it down in front of Elijah with the utmost care as to not spill a drop. Elijah's smaller finger curled around the cup and he took a quick sip. The water was warm, almost hot, clearly she didn't know which handle controlled water temperature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat, when it came to bath time later, was a red flag in Elijah's mind. This woman, whoever she was, could easily hurt him or Hayley just out of ignorance! It was time to get to the bottom of this insanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not our real babysitter, are you?\"</span></div></div>",

In your dreams, show no meeeeeeeeeercy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prophetic song played over the intercom of Sandy's, a local retail store in the Twin Pines Mall as Rebecca Armitage and Jake Anselm manned the two front registers. Not a lot of people were in the store today, as it as a Wednesday morning. A middle aged woman and a girl of about nine, probably mother and daughter, were checking out shoes while a nondescript man wearing a brown jacket browsed Blu-Rays. Outside the store, an elderly looking man in a fedora was reading the newspaper on a wooden bench as he usually did every day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca yawned loudly as she made inventory of her life. She was 21, going to graduate from college next semester. Her father, for there was no Mrs. Armitage in the picture, had insisted that she take something STEM related, particularly since he was a mechanical engineer himself. Rebecca eventually acquiesced to Mr. Armitage's terms, and was aiming to get a degree in Statistics, though she honestly had very little interest in the subject. The course was intense and work load heavy, which left very little time for her to make any new friends. She half-heartedly tried to pledge for a sorority in her first year, but she dropped out when she realized that she just didn't have the room in her schedule(She didn't want to admit that it was the bitch who made fun of her for gaining the freshman fifteen). Rebecca  thought wistfully back to high school. She had plenty of friends there. She was popular. She didn't even have time to go swimming anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWasn't that song in Batman Forever?\u201d heard Rebecca all of a sudden, breaking her out of her daydream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked tiredly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat song that's playing. Wasn't that in Batman Forever, you know, the one with Jim Carrey?\u201d asked Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't know\u201d answered Rebecca, resting her face on her elbow, her elbow itself resting on the counter like a freestanding column. \u201cI never saw that movie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore your time, maybe\u201d said Jake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe. I'm not big on the superheroes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake Anselm was Rebecca's co-worker. He had just turned thirty years old and was going through what psychologists called a quarter-life crisis. Jake was beginning to realize that he wasn't a kid anymore, having wasted his twenties in a state of arrested adolescence and immaturity, working minimum wage jobs just to scrap by, and his relationship with Rebecca was friendly but strained as a result of his insecurities. He wanted to start fresh and go back to college himself, but his low self confidence told him that he was perhaps just a bit too old for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you ever wish that you could just start over, Jake?\u201d asked Rebecca in a pensive voice as she was watching one of the customers walk up to her register to purchase something. She suddenly composed herself, forming a perfectly happy smile that hid her soul crushing ennui. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

These story prompts are not related to the SandySeeker re-imaginings and instead are entirely reliant on your imagination to tell! Pick one below or create your own!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toolbox: One average day at home is ruined by a moderate earthquake. There's no real serious damage and no one is hurt, but one of your shelves was dislodged from it's sport on the wall. Not wanting to foot the bill from opportunistic repairmen, you decide to fix it yourself. You retrieve your toolbox from the basement, but it soon becomes very clear that these are no longer ordinary tools, and find yourself caught up in a whirlwind of strange adventures. Who knew it would be this exciting fixing a shelf?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConversion: A group of military scientist are called in to explore and assess a strange phenomenon that has appeared in a remote area of the country, a place called the Northern Range. Whatever goes in has never come out, until now. Seeking answers, the military scientists enter the phenomenon and find their lives, their very reality, twisted and reshaped in ways no one had ever thought possible. Can you manage to find the source of the phenomenon without being changed, or will you become another victim of Conversion?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wackerknobs of Hollison County: It's a local legend, the Wackerknob. Mostly told by non-trustworthy sources. Stories about men and women wandering too deep into the woods at night and getting chased by beings made of leather and wire. They say no one else remembers, sometimes not even the victims themselves...but men and women can't spontaneously change gender...can they? Logan and his friend Keanu have been dared to spend the night in the forests of Hollison County and are determined to prove the legends wrong...But may just end up proving them right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmall Town Mythology: You've just moved across the country for a new job. You were lucky enough to have the money to afford buying a house in a nice small town about thirty minutes away from the city where your new job is. It's quiet and you enjoy the almost too perfect scenery, but there's something off about your neighbors. Sometimes you feel as though you've stepped into an old movie where gods and goddesses are real! Are you just imagining things, or is there something really off in this small town called Ovid?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There had just been an earthquake and several aftershocks here in the sunny bay area of Redford Hills California, and while you'd been used to them since you were very young, this one had decided to be a jerk and cause some actual property damage to the home you shared with your best friend Kyle Eubanks. A shelf in the kitchen has been rattled off of it's mooring, sending food and tupperware everywhere, and after the quakes had ceased and the mess cleaned up, the two of you had stood and stared at the completely dislodged box of wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is anything broken down there, Sidney?\" Your roommate Kyle calls from the top of the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just a couple of boxes are on the floor!\" You say back from the bottom of the aged staircase as you survey the basement of your shared home. After a few moments you turn to head back upstairs and deal with the true mess that the earthquake had caused when you see it, sitting on the shelf near the small rectangular window that let natural light into the dark confines of the basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small, red toolbox, covered in a light layer of dust, the light bouncing dully off of it. That's when you got the idea that would go on to change your entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kyle! There's a toolbox down here! I bet we could fix the cabinet ourselves and not have to call your dad!\" You say excitedly as you quickly cross the basement floor and grab the box off the shelf, surprised by the weight of such a small container as you lug it back over to the stairs and show it to Kyle, who had decided to come down.Sitting inside and playing video games during your free time from school didn't exactly help your already less than stellar athleticism. You shift your grip to hold the toolbox by the silver metal handle and motion to it with your other hand dramatically as if you were on a game show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, the last time we actually tried building something was Shop class two years ago\" Kyle said, referencing the small disaster that had been the exposure to power tools for the both of you. But hey, at least they'd been able to re-attach that one boy's finger and as far as you knew he was living a normal life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, that's why I want to fixing this thing! To prove that we can!\" You said, ignoring the fact that the both of you had otherwise been banned from using the tools in Shop class after The Incident. But luckily you had both been able to take the class Senior year, not that it expanded your knowledge base any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't learn shit in that class.\" Kyle said, crossing his arms and fixing you with a look that said he was never going to buy any of the bullshit that you had planned to say. It was true, though, everyone spent that particular class goofing off because it had been the teacher's last semester before retirement and all he did was give everyone As for showing up to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least let me try first! If it's still broke we can just call your dad or something\" You plead with your best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because that's a good idea...Fine, whatever.\" He responded, rolling his eyes. Kyle's dad was a bit of a hard-ass. The man owned a contractor company and did not deal with having to pay for things. He was sort of like a modern day Scrooge in that respect. But it was either fix it yourself or call him. With a shrug you stepped past your friend and made your way up the stairs that led back into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly reached the top of the short flight of stairs and crossed the small space to put the dust covered toolbox that you'd discovered. You figured one of your parents must have put it down there as a housewarming gift or it had been left by a former owner, but either way it was time to make use of it. Before you flip the lid open you blow on the toolbox and immediately regret your decision as a cloud of dusts flies into your face. Not expecting it, you inhale more than a little and begin coughing as you wave the dust out of your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow when was the last time you touched that thing, bro?\" Kyle chuckled as he leaned in behind you as you open the toolbox's lid. Inside were dozens of tools; a tape measure, a woodworking compass, a hammer, screwdrivers, socket wrenches, the works. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think maybe when we moved in? It was already here when we got here so...\" You reply, gently pushing him aside as you reach in to grab the hammer and a box of nails. Kyle's hands snatched in towards the tape measure and pulled it out with a loud \"AHA!\" as you started pooling the tools you believed you needed for the job on the table beside the toolbox. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude.\" Kyle's voice was full of excitement as you saw him grab a circular object with a tiny metallic lip on one end and you try not to groan too much. Kyle being excited about something meant that there was very little chance he'd actually help you get this done. He was pretty notorious for being a flake. His older sister Haylee was the same, and more than once you'd quietly wondered if they were just that clueless or if it was something they'd gotten from their mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What.\" You say in a practiced, neutral voice, not acknowledging him beyond that singular word. Maybe if you played dis-interested enough he'd lose interest and actually help you. It had worked before, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Measure me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed and turned to face him, despite having just tried to ignore him. There he was, with his 'Jonah Hill meets Freddie Prinze Jr.' face lit up with child like excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Measure me! It's been forever since the last time they told me how tall I was! What if I've grown?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle\" You sighed, \"Can you just help me fix the damn shelf?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C;mon, just do this for me, ok? I promise I'll help you\" He begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, fine. Give it here\" You said, reaching out for the tape measure which he promptly slammed into your hand. You lift the tape measure up and look it over, it had been a REALLY long time since you'd messed with any kind of tool and you wanted to make sure you didn't break the thing by not pulling it out right. Finding the lip of the tape roll, you grasp hold and give a short tuck, the yellow metallic ribbon of numbers sliding out easily. You fix Kyle with a half bored, half annoyed stare, \"I can't believe I'm doing this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be fun!\" He says, standing up against the kitchen wall. You rolled your and took a couple of steps towards him, holding the lip of the tape measure's tongue by the top of his head and dragging the main body down to his feet. This WAS the right way, wasn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, what the hell are you doing? You're supposed to put the little metal hook thing under my show!\" Kyle cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another roll of your eyes, you let go of the metallic lip and prepare for the measure to snap back into it's casing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt does, but something strange happens as the tape measure curls into itself. Kyle begins to rapidly shrink! His entire body, clothing and all rapidly decrease in size in the split second it takes the tape measure to close back into ti's housing, leaving him stranded at six inches tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a moment of silence before the panic sets if for both of you.</span></div></div>",

But here you both were.  Meekly you said down to him, \"Kyle?\"  You didn't want to freak out, because there was no reason to freak out, after all this wasn't freaking possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sid?\"  A tiny voice said to you.  You knew this had to be serious and maybe even real if Kyle wasn't calling you 'dude' and 'bro' like he usually did.  \"WHAT!  THE!  F-\"  The tiny young man shouted but he was drowned out by the situation sinking in and you began to scream.  You backed off from your tiny friend tripping over some parts the shelf door and falling to the ground tipping the contents of the toolbox on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WATCH IT DUDE!\"  Kyle cried out dodging out of the way of a bunch of nails that were not more like dodging javelins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't real, this can't be real Kyle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I know it can't be but it totally is.  Please dude, you've got to fix me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fix you?  How do I do that?  I was just measuring you and then...\"  You looked at the measuring tape that was still in hand, \"No way.\"  It wasn't possible, magic wasn't real, but here you were, and there was Kyle now the same size a 6 in long level from the toolbox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What dude, what is it?  Do you have an idea?\"  Kyle was freaking out, you hadn't seen him this messed up since he took a particularly strong pot brownie that he'd 'borrowed' from his older sister.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got on your hand and knees and crawled up to Kyle paranoid that if you stood up you'd accidentally step on him, \"Let's try something, stand on this.\"  You pulled the yellow metallic tape end out of the tape measure and put it at his feet to stand on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, are you nuts, that's what I did before I shank.  Are you trying to make me germ sized or something?  Are you trying to take my stuff for yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle, shut up, this measuring shrunk you, I think.  So maybe it will make you bigger.  And if I wanted your crummy stuff I'd have taken it already and put you in a shoebox.  Now just stand on the tape would you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle approached the tape apprehensively, it reminded him of being a kid and going to the doctor's office with that weird stretching scale that also measured hight, although of course he was about 8 times smaller than the last time he was at the doctor's office.  When Kyle stood at the end of the tape, you slowly started to raise the tape up hoping it would make Kyle grow along with it, but no luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think of what you did with the tape last time and just do the opposite.\"  Kyle said with a surprisingly clear headed idea.  You remembered that before he shrank you just let go of the end of the tape before it zipped back into it's container.  You looked at the tape measure and noticed a little sliding lever.  You vaguely remember seeing tape measures with these and they were supposed to hold the tape measure to a certain length.  This gave you an idea.  When you got the measurement up to 5 feet, you pushed in the lever and sure enough Kyle began to grow and grow until he was 5 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude,\"  Kyle said feeling himself and looking around the room as though looking at the room for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude.\"  You said back to him.  The two of you looked at each other and embraced in a super manly hug, but being teenage guys the emotional hug didn't last long before Kyle stepped back and said, \"What the heck dude, I'm even shorter than before.  I'm almost a foot shorter than I'm supposed to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a break, it's my first time shrinking and unshrinking someone.\"  You said as you carefully undid the lever and the tape measure went back to it's home.  Kyle looked anxiously at the tape measure and after a few seconds of not shrinking back down said, \"Well, use it again on me and make me taller, hell make me 7 feet tall this time.  I can became a basketball player.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way dude, this thing is magic and we need to be careful about it, and who knows, maybe some of the other tools in the box and powers too.  We should try to check them out, carefully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shorter and annoyed looked at you and the tape measure before making his own call.</span></div></div>",

That's cool, glad we agree on this.  First help me pick up everything and put it back in the toolbox, after all, it's kinda your fault for freaking me out when you shrank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude!  You're the one who shrank me!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\"  You said dismisivly as you began to pick up all the assorted tools off the ground.  Half of these things you didn't even know the names off, you'd have to do some internet research as you did this.  You almost wished you had your dad around to help but then this would be a little less...exciting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you thought you had everything you began to peer into the box and wondered what you'd try to test out first, but before you could decide you heard Kyle call out, \"Wait man, you missed one.  Think fast!\"  You turned your head just in time to see a tool you surprisingly recognized as a socket wrench come flying at you but before you could react, the wrench hit you square in the junk.  You instantly wince and grab your crotch out of instinct, but after a few seconds you realize something was off.  You weren't in pain.  \"That's weird, I could have sworn you hit me in the...the heck?\"  You looked down and see that the socket wrench was attached to the outside of the crotch of your jeans.  \"Well that's weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you gotta mess with it!  Turn it or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle, I don't want to mess with something that looks like it's attached to my dick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no, you're the one who wants the test all this stuff before I get my height back.  If this thing is a dick scrambler you gotta test it, because it's probably able to be undone like the tape measure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dick scrambler?\"  You said shivering at the thought of such a device.  But Kyle was right, the measuring tape didn't actually hurt Kyle, would the socket wrench actually hurt him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, don't chicken out, just do it,\"  Kyle said reaching out for the handle of the tool, but you backed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get your hands away from my manhood man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then do it yourself, what are you?  Chicken?  Bawk!  Bawkbawkbawk Bawk!\"  Kyle started indeed clucking like a chicken around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine I'll do it.\"  And slowly but surly you put your hand around the wrench and with your eyes closed you gave it a hearty tug.  Your eyes open wide as you realize that the socket wrench was indeed doing something to you,  You pull your pants around and look down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\"  Kyle said curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's bigger.\"  You simply said in awe.  You gave the socket wrench another pull and sure enough, you could tell you were indeed bigger down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's freaking sweet.\"  Kyle said nodding his head in approval, and then after a few seconds of silence he asked, \"What happens if you twist it the other way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably make it smaller,\"  You gave it a quick tug in the other direction and sure enough you shrunk down a little bit.  \"Yup, that's what it does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guessed that part, but what if you go all the way.  Do you have a minimum smallness?  Do you turn into a Ken doll?  Or do you even turn into a girl down there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I don't know!  Why are you asking me that man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're the one with the idea to test stuff, I tested the tape measure, so you have to test that thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't want to.\"  You wined.  You really didn't want to use your manhood as a test subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I didn't want to be shrunk down to doll size but you did that to me, now test it.  This is cool to watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah because you aren't the test subject.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh.\"  Kyle said giving a thumbs up encouraging you to go on.  You looked down at the socket wrench and take a deep breath.  \"Goodbye boys, I promise I'll get you back soon.\"  And twisting the socket wrench quickly so you couldn't give yourself a chance to back out you soon felt your manhood shrink away inch at a time into nothingness.  Then giving the wrench another twist to see how far it could go, you felt something open up down there.  You reached your hand down into your pants and confirmed that Kyle's hypothesis was actually right.  \"I'm a girl.\"  After you said it, you put your other hand up to your mouth, your voice had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can tell.\"  Kyle said with a shit eating grin and a nod as he looked you up and down.  You looked down at yourself.  You could see that your body was in slightly a different shape with your body being much more dainty and smooth than it was before.  You even had a pair of breasts, although you were pretty flat, barely even an A cup, but they were bigger boobs than you'd ever had in your entire life so that was something.  \"It's a Gender Switching Socket Wrench.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a socket wrench?\"  Kyle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, \"It's this thing you idiot.\"  You said pointing to the tool still attached to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, cool cool.  So what happens if you mess with it more?  Do you get a bigger vagina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, vaginas don't work that way!\"  You said, <i>'I think,'</i> you thought to yourself.  In order to prove it, and since you'd already gone this far you twisted the wrench a few more times and instead of your genitals changing size like your penis did, your boobs actually puffed out a little bit.  You definitely had an C cup now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it again!  Do it again!\"  Kyle said sounding like a kid in a candy store.  You looked at Kyle and considered your options.</span></div></div>",

You didn't make me the right size when I changed back, so I don't think you should turn all the way back until I do.  It's only fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about just telling Kyle to screw off, but you looked down at the still shorter than you Kyle and decided that he might have a point.  \"Fine, but only for a little while and I'm not getting bigger boobs for you to stare at, what you see if what you get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal.\"  Kyle said smiling.  You felt like he had just gotten the better of you but pushed that thought from your mind, you didn't like thinking about your idiot friend beating your slightly less of an idiot self at a game of wits.  Kyle started digging in the toolbox and pulled out a what looked like a ruler with some weird tubes in it with air bubbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck is this thing?  I haven't seen a ruler like this before.\"  Kyle asked, you wracked your brain thinking of what this thing is.  You know you'd seen one before.  Finally you remember, \"That's a Level.  You use it to make sure things are flat.  You put it surface and if the air bubble is in the middle you know it's flat, if not it's off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\"  Kyle said and with a smile he looked at you and to your surprise held the level close to your chest.  \"Yup, flat as a board it's level all right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha, very funny ass.\"  You said to Kyle who was loosing it laughing at his little joke.  He held the level up to you again and said, \"See, it's because your a girl now, and your boobs are so small they're flat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it the first time.  Now do you think that does anything or are you going to try something else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle shrugged and still looking at your through the hole of the level he flipped the level in the air and caught it.  All of the sudden your world was upside down.  Literally.  Gravity completely reversed and you found yourself falling onto the ceiling.  \"What the hell!\"  You screamed as you tried to get your barring.  You stood up on your knees and when you straighten up you could feel your shirt threatening to fall to the ground over your head leaving your belly and chest exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, I guess you're not as flat as I thought, my bad.\"  You could hear Kyle laughing from below you.  You thought first things first and put your shirt back down and tucked it in so it wouldn't fly out.  Somehow the level had reversed your gravity when Kyle aimed it at you.  \"Well, I'm glad we used this inside instead of out.  We should really be careful with that one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe there are settings on it or something?\"  Kyle said examine the Gravity Altering Level closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do that later!  Just get me down, blood is rushing to my head!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right, sorry dude.  I mean, dudette.\"  Kyle laughed at his own very bad joke and pointing the level at you he flipped it again and sure enough you fell back down to Earth.</span></div></div>",

Kyle laughed to himself, \"Sorry <i>my lady</i>,\"  Kyle said tipping an imaginary fedora.  \"Yeah yeah, just be careful with that.  I think you were supposed to test that on yourself and not me, but whatever.\"  You said grumpily heading to the toolbox for your next experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked in the box and saw a lot of tools, some of which you'd seen before, but decided to go with a tool you definitely recognized.  A good old fashion hammer and nails.  You picked them both up hoping for an instruction manual to pop up in your head, but nothing else worked that way so why should the hammer?  So you looked around to figure out what to test it on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you waiting for, just use it on yourself, we've done it with everything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not hitting myself with a hammer unless I'm pretty sure it's safe.\"  You said not really believing such a sentence came out of your mouth.  You look around the room and see your old gaming laptop that got wrecked in the earthquake.   You decided since it was busted might as well test it, and you also picked up a diary that Kyle's sister had gotten for him but he'd never used.  \"Let's do something weird.\"  You said as you put the book on the laptop, you held a nail with your feminine nails that still weirded you out a little, and struck.  There was a flash of green light and in place of the laptop and book was...a computer book?  You opened up the book and sure enough each page had a different computer function, some pages had games, others had web browsing, it was like nothing you'd ever seen before in your life except in cartoons.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\"  You simply said before Kyle took the book from you.  \"Hey, that's my diary so it's my super cool computer book.\"  When he did, you happened to notice the nail in the back of the book.  All of the sudden you knew what you needed to test next, \"Yeah it's your book alright,\"  And with a quick stroke before Kyle could realize what you were doing, you took the claw end of the hammer, and pulled out the nail.  Instantly the green light flashed and the diary and broken laptop were separated again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle protested but you didn't care, you now kind of understood how this Fusion Hammer worked.</span></div></div>",

You roll your eyes and hold out your free palm, unknowingly kicking a hip out to the side in a very girly manner as Kyle gives you a huge grin, shoving the book into you smaller hand. He sets the once again busted laptop on the counter and you repeat your earlier experiment, once again fusing the two items together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet!\" Kyle grabs the computerized book off the counter and grabs a seat at the table without even saying thanks, his nose pressed deep into the digitized pages. It was, honestly, the first time you'd seen your friend be so interested in a book that wasn't 90% pictures. You roll your eyes and turn your attention back to the hammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was crazy what it could do, and if it hadn't been for the fact that in the last fifteen minutes you had gone from a man to a woman and had literally defied gravity, you wouldn't have believed it was possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What else could I do?' You ponder and aimlessly wander through the house after grabbing the box of nails from the Toolbox, almost in a daze, at what you could fuse together. It was sort of similar to how you felt about sandbox games like GTA Online, there was just so much stuff to do but no actual purpose so you had always felt, well, lost when trying to play it. The same thing was true now, you could create new technology unknown to man, improve your life with a nail and a hammer, but there was just so much stuff that you could use it on and you had no idea what the result would be. It left you feeling, again, lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" You say as you enter the living room, \"I need to try this on something...I wonder what would happen if I tried fusing myself with something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Kyle asks from the kitchen, and you ignore him. You could tell from the distracted tone of voice that he wasn't really listening, focusing on your imminent experiment. You could try something here, within visual sight of Kyle, the safe option in case something went terribly wrong, or you could retreat to your bedroom and try the hammer on yourself with one of your personal items there. Or maybe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe try it on something outside?</span></div></div>",

Yeah, staying downstairs where your friend was within earshot and sight seemed the best course of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, furniture wise there's not too much, just the couch and the recliner, the coffee table, a couple of lamps and the little end table that is covered in yours and Kyle's random stuff like batteries, loose change, paperclips and other knick knacks.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You take a long look at the TV and the assorted electronics piled under and around it. As much as it might be cool to try it on those, they were actually some of the more expensive items that you ad Kyle owned. Given you had no idea the extents to what the fusion hammer actually did, you decide that maybe it might be better if you try it on something that might not be so expensive to replace, if things went wrong. Plus just having the hammer next to your valuable entertainment devices made you un-easy, so you wander back into the kitchen, where Kyle's head is still stuck in the laptop/book hybrid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude!\" He says as you enter, glancing up for just a moment longer than you think he should have, \"Check it out!\" Kyle turns the laptop-book towards you and you can see a the two of you, as kids, playing in the backyard of Kyle's old house. You were running around waving cardboard swords at each other and firing pretend lasers while you were making some awkward noises that sort of sounded like Darth Vader. \"Dude this thing is so cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch your younger selves run around in joyful ignorance for a few moments before you remember what you came back in here to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's pretty cool, dude. Hey You got any ideas what I could test this thing out on? Kind of drawing a blank on what to do\" You ask as you take a seat across from your roommate. Kyle stares at you and then at the hammer for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, are you gonna fuse yourself with something? That's awesome!\" His eyes go wide in excitement as he puts the pieces together. He closes the lapto-book (the two of you needed to come up with a proper name for it later) and he looks around the kitchen, his gaze resting on the not insignificant mess of the cabinet before roaming once more. You follow suit, and while there's plenty of stuff in here that you could fuse with, your first thought is to try some kind of food product. Your eyes land on the butter dish sitting next to the kitchen sink and the full stick of butter that was laying motionless under the clear lid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink. \"Kyle, why is there a stick of butter out?\" You ask in confusion. Neither of you baked or could really cook at all, so having a stick of butter in the first place seemed a little weird, but to have it sitting out seemed really out of character for the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh.\" Kyle says as he follows your outstretched finger to the sink. \"Oh, uh, Haylee said she was gonna come over later and, uh, make some of her brownies since she can't at home without getting yelled at. You need butter to bake stuff, right? So I ran down to the store while you were in the shower this morning and grabbed it. And dude the cashier chick there is a total MILF. Like super fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you're so weird\" You say, rolling your eyes but you knew in your mind he was right. 'Hmm, there's an idea...' You think to yourself as you ponder trying the hammer out of her, but you shake your head and send your short mane of blonde hair flying. No, better test it out here in the confines of your home first where you had a controlled environment. Besides, who knew what might happen if you fused with another person?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're weird, chicka!\" Kyle says, sticking a tongue out at you, and then suddenly he gets a weird look in his eye as he realizes you're still female. \"You know...\" He begins, but you cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, not gonna happen. Let's just get something here in the kitchen, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh fiiiiine\" He whines as you shoot him down before the two of you go back to looking. Outside of fusing with a food product, you could fuse with the fridge, maybe another household kitchen appliance like the stove or microwave? You wonder what would happen if you just fused with the broken cabinet that started this crazy adventure in the first place. Or maybe a piece of silverware?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while you decide to...</span></div></div>",

Not cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget about that man,\"  Kyle said brushing past the accusation meaning it was probably true.  \"You keep looking around the kitchen like you're trying to find the perfect cereal or something.

I needed to hear that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No prob, want to reward me with a kiss?  OUCH!

You got this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got this!\"  You shouted out in a primal amazonian like scream and without thinking for a moment you grabbed the first thing you saw, the butter in butter dish.  You grabbed the room temperature butter from the trey and felt it melt a little in your hand.  '<i>Who the hell doesn't keep their butter in the fridge?'</i>  Was the last thing you thought before there was a flash of green light and a little prick of pain in your hand.  When the flash cleared you could already feel the changes.  You felt like you weighed maybe twice what you were before.  Looking down you could feel a clump of flesh in your neck that must be a double chin.  Looking down you could see that your formerly A cup breasts were now massive and fatty, although the same could be said for the rest of your body.  You could see a nice round belly bellow your boobs and you couldn't see your legs but could guess they looked the same.  You held your arms up with more effort than you'd like to admit and you stared at the saggy fat that was hanging below your arm.  Curiously you poked at it with your sausage like fingers and saw your arm ripple a little to the touch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa dude, you are like so massive now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I feel better.\"  You said, even your voice sounded heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but it's not too bad, you carry it...ok.  Let me put it like this.  You could look a lot worse being that big.  You still have a cute face.  It's just kinda chubby now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks I guess.\"  You said as you pulled out your phone to get a look at your new face.  It was weird to see, but you could see parts of yourself in their with eyes and nose shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle suddenly got wide eyes as he pointed at you and said, \"Dude dude!  You know what you are now!  You're just like that name we'd call some of the girls in high school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  Don't say it!\"  You said but it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are totally a...<i>butter face</i>\"  Dead silence filled the room.  But if that magic toolbox had the ability it would be doing a rimshot at that very moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate you so much Kyle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah you know you love me bro.  Give me a high 5 for that one!\"  And held up his hand so it was just above your head, deciding as much as you wanted to, you couldn't leave your bro hanging and slapped his hand.  \"Wouldn't it be more like low 5 shorty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle smile wavered a little, \"Hey, not cool Sid, but now that you've done your fusing, how about you give me my foot of hight back, and maybe a few inches while you're at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After the butter face line I'm gonna go with a big no on that for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you're not going to bring me back to my normal size, what are we gonna do now?\"  Kyle asked as you thought.  </span></div></div>",

But remember, no hesitation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No hesitation!\"  Kyle said like it was a war cry and opened the fridge.  And then he started going through the items one by one.  \"Dude, no hesitation means just grab something and fuse with it.\"  You said with an air of disappointment to your voice.  \"I'll fuse just hold your horses.  You walked around the house looking for something for like 20 minutes, I can have a few.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\"  You said as you sat in a wooden chair.  You heard the chair give a significant creeping noise it had never made before as your quite large form put it's full weight on the poor old wood.  You decided to take advantage of Kyle being a slow poke and looked a little bit more at yourself.  Looking down at your massive chest you began playing a game and see how many tools could fit in your new cleavage.  You were up to about 5 when Kyle asked, \"Is this all the food we've got?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you check the freezer or vegetable drawer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a vegetable drawer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's that thing at the bottom of the refridgerator...wait a second what did you think that was down there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A foot tub.\"  You weren't sure if Kyle was kidding...ok you knew he probably wasn't so you went back to your own little game of 'hide the tools' when you felt the chill coming from Kyle opening the freezer.  You gave a quick shudder almost dropping the tools through your cleavage and down your shirt.  You could actually feel your nipples get hard and rub uncomfortably against your shirt with the sudden small burst of cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Am I going to need to get a bra?  Can one of the tools do that?\"</i>  You began to put the tools away, you think you got them all out of your fatty body flaps, when Kyle called out, \"Oysters are supposed to be frozen right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\"  You say honestly, \"Wait, why do we have oysters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Sid, I figured I could microwave some up if I had a lady friend over, they're supposed to be an aphrodisiac or something.\"  You shrugged and continued to root around the toolbox for something that could help you out again when something happened.</span></div></div>",

Maybe I'll be able to shoot lasers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were going to make fun of Kyle and say that was absolutely insane, but here you were as an obese woman after messing with the toolbox, maybe carrots giving Kyle laser vision wasn't out of the question.  \"Well dude, what are you waiting for.

You looked down at the table thinking one of the carrots on the table might actually be Kyle and the fusion was somehow to much for him.  But a second later you heard something that you were not expecting.  The cries of a baby rang in your ears and sure enough you got up from your chair, took a few long steps around the table before looking down.  And sure enough where Kyle was standing was a baby wearing cute looking version of the clothes he'd been wearing including a small rip in his tiny jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, well I guess they were <i>baby</i> carrots.\"  You say more to yourself.  Baby Kyle was not amused, he tried to use his hands to grab the green nail that was sticking out of the back of his hand.  You shook your head in bemusement at the incredibly adorable sight, \"Dude, no way that will work, you've got to use the hammer to unfuse.  Speaking of that, where'd the hammer go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guh huh,\"  Kyle said sounding only slightly less intelligible than normal as he flailed his little arms towards the refrigerator.  Looked around and upon not seeing anything at first, you grunted and got down on your belly.  You flattened your fat as much as you could and you could see the vague shape of the Fusion Hammer well underneath the big metal fridge.  \"Fantastic.\"  You said you tried to reach under the household appliance to get to your goal, but it was too far back and your arm was much to big thanks to your fusion with the butter.  \"Double fantastic.\"  You said as you sighed and stood up.  You wrapped your massive arms around the fridge/freezer combo.  It was an older model and was made of some sturdy metal.  You were only able to nudge it out an inch at a time, and only after a few inches you were working up a sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the crying baby on the floor behind you wasn't helping.  This entire time Kyle had been on the floor rolling around and crying.  \"DUDE!  Keep it down or else I'll...\"  And as if on cue a metal clang hit the ground as the Gender Switching Socket Wrench fell out of your cleavage from when you were bored and messing around stuffing tools in there.  \"...or else I'll take away your dick, although at that size I doubt you'd notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe threat didn't work.  Kyle still cried away.  Getting annoyed after hearing crying for the last 10 minutes you said, \"Don't say I didn't warn you.\"  And followed through with your threat and attached the wrench to Kyle's chest and after only one twist Kyle's hair became much longer.  You guessed since he was only a baby it only took one twist to change him.  \"There!  Will you stop crying now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle shook his, or her head.  The look in Kyle's eye's said, '<i>There's a real reason I'm crying Sid you dummy'</i> as her mouth said, \"Faa ooo!\"  You looking confused for a second before your eyes went wide, \"Oh!  Are you hungry?\"  Kyle nodded, \"Well why didn't you say so!\"  You said going to the fridge and getting the only food you knew babies ate, the old milk.  \"I think you can have this...although you can't really drink it out of a cup can you.  How the heck am I supposed to feed you?\"</span></div></div>",

After a moment you realize what's wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Oh man!\" You say and you hurriedly waddle to the back door and toss the carton of expired milk outside, watching with disgust plastered across your chubby face as the carton explodes on the grass and chunks of old milk go flying across the back yard. You stick a tongue out as you look at your hand, waving it as if that will somehow rid it of the residual stink of expired dairy and watching the layers of flab rock back and forth in what seems to be slow motion You look down into your cleavage as it slowly jiggles, the motion in your arm had made it's way through the soft layers to the rest of your body and your flab was now shaking in a almost hypnotic fashion. You keep shaking your arm and watching in an almost hypnotic fashion as your body sways back and forth in a comforting motion and you find your mind drifting. It was almost like watching...like watching...like watching a lava...lamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAAAAAAAAAH\" Come the siren scream of a very agitated infant behind you, and you're suddenly jerked out of the reverie. You turn in surprise and stare at the baby on the floor, who was now visibly shivering. You waddle back and with some effort, lower yourself to the floor once more as a sheen of sweat appears on your brow. You wipe it away with a flabby arm and stare at Kyle, trying not to be overwhelmed by the screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude it was bad! I can't give you bad milk! You couldn't even drink it anyway! Just...Be quiet already!\" You say and you clap two hands over your head and are momentarily relieved as the fat dulls Kyle's cries of hunger.  You sit there and stare at him for a few minutes, your brain trying to think up a plan but you're thinking more slowly for some reason. 'Man he's really shivering' You think to yourself, and eventually you realize that the tile on the kitchen floor is cold. You were insulated but now that you've been down here with your folds of flesh presed against it for a while, you can tell that it must be almost painful for Kyle in his tiny, barely insulated body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I, uh, um...\" You start, but you realize he can't hear you. Instead you reach down and awkwardly scoop Kyle up in your arms. Even as a guy you didn't like holding babies, they were so small and fragile you were afraid you'd somehow break them. But you had to get Kyle off the floor. How were you supposed to hold them again? Cradle them in your arms and support the...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle head suddenly slides backwards as his tiny neck fails to support the heavy weight of his head, and you quickly slide a flabby hand under his soft skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The neck! Oh man, gotta support the neck\" You say to yourself, wincing as you bring the source of the screams even closer to your ears. You can feel the chill in Kyle's body from where his body heat was sucked out by the floor tile, and you bring him in close and snuggle him against your massive breasts. After a few moments his cries seem lees shrill as your body heat begins to warm him back up, and while he's still crying you can see he's far more comfortable now, nestled against you boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when the idea finally pulls itself together. Kyle is a hungry baby girl and you're a young adult woman. There's no baby-safe food in the house and you have no way of safely transporting Kyle down the rode to the convenience store with the hot Latina MILF cashier. There's only one thing you could possibly do, and you're both desperate and horrified by what you might have to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Kyle? KYLE?\" You say twice, finally the proximity forcing your voice over his shrill song, and he stops long enough to blink at you with big enormous eyes that twinkle with the hint of more than just infant intelligence. Your friend was still in there, but right now you had to just do what you were planning otherwise you'd just be stuck with a screaming baby for who knows how long it would take for your to move the fridge. \"Dude, I've got an idea but we're both not going to like it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle blinks and and babbles something unintelligible but with a very serious tone of voice. Or at least as serious as a baby can manage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea what you just said. But yeah, I think...uh...IthinkI'mgonnahavetobreastfeedyouifyouwanttoeat!\" You say really fast, and you can tell Kyle didn't catch it. Not wanting to put it off any longer, you set Kyle gently into your lap and use your free hands to lift your circus tent of a shirt up, giving tiny Kyle a perfect eyeful of the massive orbs that don your chest. He giggles for a moment and babbles something else, but you're not stopping. You reach down, scoop him up again...and raise him to your breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only takes Kyle a moment before he realizes what is happening and he starts screaming once more, tiny arms flailing as best as they can as you try not to puke as you bring Kyle's head closer and closer to your left nibble.</span></div></div>",

Kyle kept trying to complain but gibberish was all the was coming out.  He even tried to bite you to get you to stop, but his gumless mouth actually tickled more than anything.  Kyle kept trying to fight you off for about a minute before you pursed your lips together and gave him a long and soft, \"Shhhhhh.\"  Until Kyle finally stopped babbling.  \"Dude, I don't like the idea of you sucking on my nip either.  But you're a hungry baby who's not going to stop crying until you've got something in your belly.  And I can't think straight with a crying baby around.  So just...just drink up and we'll pretend this never happened.  Cool?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo noise came from Kyle for a little while, but finally you could feel his mouth cover your nipple and he began to suck.  It was a very weird feeling.  It was like a tiny weak vacuum was attached to your body...not that you'd ever done anything with a vacuum trying to make it look like you had a hickie on your neck in middle school, that totally wasn't something that happened.  And what's more you could actually feel something coming out of your boob.  \"Ew.\"  You said as you looked down at Kyle who seemed to completely zoned in on his target now that he was latched on.  With your free hand you examined some of the excess milk that was dripping down the side of Kyle's mouth.  Feeling like it was a milk you'd never seen before you rubbed the weirdly greedy substance between your fingers before you realized what was off.  \"Heh, I hope babies are ok with drinking buttermilk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Kyle didn't seem to mind, he kept sucking and sucking as you held him close.  Looking down you had the thought that maybe babies aren't as bad as you thought.  For a second you almost let yourself forget the cute baby girl in your arm was really your best friend and roommate sucking on your tit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after what felt like forever Kyle seemed to have his fill.  \"I think I know what to do next, I saw this on tv.\"  You lifted Kyle up and put him on your shoulder and pat him on the back to burp him.  And it worked, although he burped up some of the buttermilk he just drank along with the excess air.  \"Ugh!  That part wasn't on tv!\"  Kyle smiled at his handywork and giggled, \"Yeah yeah, very funny.  Well, we're even for the time I threw up on the couch last week.\"  You held Kyle on your breasts and saw that the little girl was yawning.  \"No no no, don't you fall asleep.  You're a freaking baby and I don't have a crib or somewhere to safely put you!\"  You tried to keep Kyle awake, but the full stomach was too much for him as his eyes closed and he drifted off in the comfort of your body fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic.\"  You groaned.  There was no way you could just leave a baby on the floor or a table or couch or something.  You were pretty sure that was parenting no no, or at least you guessed.  \"Fine, take your stupid nap, it just means you're stuck as a baby longer.\"  You moved yourself and Kyle to the living room to sit in a more comfortable chair.  You sat back in the recliner with baby Kyle and just rocked back and for as you turned on the tv and put it on mute to not wake the baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could almost feel yourself drifting off yourself, after all it was a mentally exhausting day.  But before you could let sleep embrace you, something happened that woke you back up.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you sat in the recliner with baby Kyle resting comfortably on your gigantic breasts you let out a yawn.  Maybe you could take a nap before you got the hammer from under the fridge and changed back.  Kyle cutely wiggled around getting himself comfortable even sticking a baby girl fist into your cleavage.  You never thought of yourself as a baby liking kind of guy, but this might be making you change your mind.  You actually began to imagine what it'd be like to be a dad and raising a little girl, or maybe if you didn't feel like raising a girl you'd use the Gender Switching Socket Wrench and raise a boy.  Who knew what the future held.  Random parental images floated through your sleepy mind.  Images of teddy bears danced in your mind as they escaped giant cribs and dove head first into the sewer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait the sewer?  Why were you thinking of that of all things?  One good sniff later and you had your answer.  You were now awake and alert as a foul smell was going right into your face and it didn't take long to figure out what it was.  Kyle had crawled around your chest and had aimed his cute little tush and you and ripped a big one.  Or at least it smelled like a rancid big one.  You heard the smallest 'poof' sound and wave to of nastiness hit you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on bro!  Not cool!\"  You stood up and thankfully remember to hold onto Kyle as you did so.  You carried Kyle by the feet and started to go to the bathroom.  \"No, that won't work he'll just spray on the walls.\"  Kyle let out another thretening toot.  \"Hold it in dude!  All you've had is some milk a few minutes ago, how are your farts this heinous?\"  And then you froze as you remembered.  Before you found the toolbox and got to work, the last meal Kyle had was a bunch of burritos and from the local mexican place.  Your eyes widened with fear.  \"NO!  You will not unleash that evil on me here!  Hold it in until I get the hammer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dashed for the kitchen and put Kyle on top of his clothes that he'd previously shrunken out of and with the strength that could only be brought on by fear and adrenaline, you moved the big heavy fridge in a matter of seconds.  You picked up the Fusion Hammer of the ground triumphantly and went over to Kyle.  The little baby girl had the biggest shit eating grin on his face as Kyle closed his first tight hiding the nail and preventing you from un fusing him with the baby carrot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you're just being a jerk!\"  You practically yell at your potentially literally shit stirring roommate.  He kicked his feet and laughed like this was the funniest thing ever as you could hear his tiny belly rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diapers!  I have to get a diaper!  But I can't get to the store!  What do I do what do I do!\"  You say as you pace around the kitchen trying to find a solution and then as you looked at the hammer it came to you.  \"I'll make one!\"  You grabbed Kyle's underwear out of the pile of loose clothing and then grabbed a handful of paper towels.  You put a nail against them and slammed the hammer down.  One flash of green light later and you had yourself a pretty crummy looking diaper, but it was a diaper never the less.  You put it around Kyle's waist and tied it up and a knot to make sure it stayed.  And Kyle knowing he had been defeated, finally did his business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took off the diaper and tossed it out the window to get that foulness out of the house and after going to Kyle's room to grab some underwear off the ground, you made him a new diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, how do you like that, I win this round!\"  You said taunting the baby and doing a victory dance that caused your flabby body to jiggle uncontrollably as you wondered what to do next.</span></div></div>",

WOAH!\" You say as you stop dancing but your tubby body continues to jiggle, carried by it's own momentum through the layers of fat encapsulating your swollen body. You stare at yourself for a moment before you physically force your rolls to stop moving by pressing your flabby arms against yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven then it's a little difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally no longer in motion, you look at Kyle who was, for once during this whole ordeal, quiet, his eyes locked on your body as he laid in the pile of clothing, the little nest you'd made for him on the kitchen table next to the Toolbox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you like that 'Kylie'? You like it when mommy jiggles?\" You tease, and your voice seems to break him from his trance as he starts babbling again, his tiny little girl  voice suddenly very serious. You stick your tongue out through pudgy lips at him, and you can taste something that tastes like...bitter butter?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle babbles again and holds a tiny hand over his nose while pointing at you, and look down at yourself and see a layer of sweat covering your arms. It seemed like the little physical activity that changing Kyle, moving the fridge and then dancing was simply too much for your body and your glands, already swollen with butter-infused fat, had began weeping. You take your shirt and raise it up, wiping your forehead with it and trying not to shudder at the pleasurable feeling of the cotton rubbing across your nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Kyle made a strange sound as a loud gurgle came from his stomach. And then that's when he threw up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUDE WHY\" You scream as you dodge the surprisingly powerful stream of vomit shooting from your friend's tiny mouth. \"THAT'S IT, NO MORE BABY TIME I'M DONE I'M OUT!\" You grab for the Fusion Hammer and as the sudden stream of vomit ends you grab Kyle's hand and find the tiny green dot of the nail. You slide the hammer's claw head around the rim of the nail and pull up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash of light and a crash as Kyle unfused from the baby carrot and returned to his full adult size on the kitchen table!</span></div></div>",

He was still a girl after you had changed his gender as a baby with the socket wrench.  Kyle was now standing in the middle of the kitchen looking incredibly cute with a pixie haircut, perky A cup breasts, and was wearing nothing but the fusion made diaper from a minute ago.  Kyle seemed to be taking to having his adulthood back well as the first thing he did was run to the kitchen sink and vomited up white goo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he stopped and wiped his mouth, \"Dude!  You made me drink your boob juice!  That was so nasty man.  It tasted like butter milk Sid.  And I have discovered I do not like butter milk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were a crying and hungry baby, I didn't exactly have much of a choice.\"  You said defending your actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have fed me some of the other baby carrots, that's super healthy for a baby probably.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had no teeth!\"  You said sensing your voice raising as you continued your defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you should have chewed it up and fed me momma bird style.  I couldn't be more nasty than sucking on your giant nipples.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't complaining too much once you started.\"  You muttered under your breath.  But Kyle wasn't done complaining about your parenting techniques.  \"And you turned one of my best pairs of underwear into a diaper and then threw it out!  Not cool bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sorry, would you like to re use the underwear that you pooped in?  It's out in the yard if you want it,\"  You said pointing at the open window in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever Sid, which underwear did you use to make the diaper I'm wearing now?  I hope it wasn't a good one,\"  Kyle looked down at the diaper he was wearing to see if it would still have a table on it post fusion but when he looked down he noticed something else.  \"I almost forgot!  You turned me into a girl too!\"  Kyle covered up his boobs unfortunately for you as you'd been enjoying the view since Kyle grew up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed the back of your head and smiled, \"Ok, for the sex change I don't have an excuse.  My bad bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure is your bad, give me that wrench thing so I can change back.\"  You obliged your friend and passed him the Gender Swapping Socket Wrench.  Kyle was about to attach it to himself when his eyes suddenly lit up.  \"...I just need to go upstairs for a minute.\"  And with that he'd grabbed the wrench and gone off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet he's just gonna give it a few cranks and give himself some giant boobs to look at in the mirror.  And since he took the wrench with him I'm still stuck with these for a little while.  Well, I can at least unfuse with the butter,\"  You said as you looked at the kitchen table where the Fusion Hammer lay never to the baby carrot Kyle had just unfused with.</span></div></div>",

Chocolate and something else in the air, but it had a very pungent smell to it, but that bonus smell wasn't enough to keep you away.  With baby girl Kyle in your chubby arms you took the effort to stand up from the chair and walk into the kitchen where waiting for you with her head looking through the oven glass was Kyle's stoner sister Haylee.  You froze instantly as though maybe if you didn't move she wouldn't notice you, and Haylee was so obsessed with her special brownies she was cooking she almost didn't see you.  Unfortunately Kyle didn't get the message as he began to yawn and wake up making some very cute baby noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley turned from the oven and looked at you and Kyle with a look of confusion on her face, \"Um, what are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...this is my house?\"  You said almost questioning your true claim.  Haylee looked at your and Kyle for a minute before slapping herself in the forehead.  \"Crap!  I am so sorry lady.  This is my bad.  I swear I wasn't trying to rob you or something.  It's just a mix up.  I'll leave.\"  And as quickly as she entered the house, Haylee left the kitchen and went out to her car.  \"Oh man that actually worked,\"  You said letting out a huge sigh of relief.  You'd never been happier that Haylee was indeed Kyle's sister.  You went to the kitchen window to make sure Haylee left, she got in her car, looked at the house before getting back out and going to the door.  This time she rang the doorbell instead of just coming in.  You wondered if you could get away with not answering the door and letting Haylee think you weren't home, but that would be unbelievable even for Haylee.  You reluctantly opened the door for her.  \"Thanks for opening up, I was afraid you'd left or something for a minute.\"  Hayley said before letting herself in.  \"Sorry to bother you but I left my pot brownies I mean my...special brownies in your oven.  I'm just gonna grab those right quick.  \"Sure thing.\"  You said, and even though there was no way she could have recognized you, you still put on a fake voice to try and fool her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed Haylee to the kitchen where she took out the just finished brownies, gave them a nice long whiff, and said, \"Well, I gotta be going now.  Thanks for the over usage!\"  Haylee took her brownies out to the car where you continued to watch her through the window to make sure she left.  But Haylee being Haylee didn't even wait to start the car before she began eating a way too hot brownie.  She downed a bottle of water and was about to start the car when she her eyes widened.  She got out of the car and charged through the front door, went to the kitchen, and pointed at you and Kyle.  \"WAIT A SECOND!  This isn't your house!  Who the hell are you?  Are you a thief?  Worse, are you a politician?  Are you a relative of Sid's?  Are you Sid's girlfriend?  Are you Kyle's girlfriend?\"  Haylee took a breath and let out a gasp, \"Is that baby Kyle's kid?  Am I an aunt?  I'm not ready to be an aunt!  But...but I'm going to be the best aunt there is!  Come here baby girl, come to your aunt Haylee.\"  You were struck with so much emotional whiplash thanks to Haylee you didn't even try to stop her taking Kyle out of your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaylee went into the living room and starting making baby noises to Kyle while tickling him, and Kyle was trying to shout something, but it was unintelligible and was interrupted by his own uncontrollable laughter.  \"So, what's her name?\"  Haylee asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\"   You said trying to get your brain to work with what Haylee was giving you, \"That baby girl's name is...\"</span></div></div>",

His name is Kyle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile on Haylee's face as she continued to tickle Kyle faltered, \"Kyle?  Him?\"  Haylee gave a quick peek down Kyle's orange diaper that had appeared after he fused with the baby carrot.  \"Um, I'm like 95% sure your baby is a girl.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is a girl right now, but that's not my baby...And this is going to be a long story.\"  So you told it, you told Kyle's sister about discovering the magic tool box and messing around with it and how you were stuck as a large woman and Kyle was stuck as a baby until you got the hammer back from under the refrigerator.  \"And that explains why the baby you're holding is really your brother Kyle.\"  Haylee looked from you to Kyle before pulling a pot brownie out of her purse, \"Man, this is some good stuff.\"  Before taking a bite out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not the drugs, although this is actually probably extra trippy for you right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I believe you.  I think this is just a plot to stop me from telling mom and dad Kyle has a kid and prevent me from playing with my adorable little niece.\"  Haylee lifted Kyle into the air and made a kissy face to him, but Kyle just blurted out baby talk that was either 'put me down sis' or a series of curse words.  Maybe both.  \"I can prove it's real, first give me Kyle back.\"  Haylee obliged and you lead Haylee to the mess of a kitchen with some tools on the ground and the fridge half out.  You carefully put Kyle down on the table, \"Don't move dude.\"  You said as you picked up the Size Changing Tape Measure from the ground.  \"Now Haylee, watch close.\"  And before Kyle could protest you put the tape measure beside him and gave it a quick snap.  And before yours and Haylee's eyes Kyle shrunk down from his already small form to being about 6 inches from toe to head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to my niece!\"  Haylee said in shock and awe.  \"I used this tape measure to shrink him to show you that I'm not lying.  I'm really Sid and that's really Kyle...oh shut up Kyle.\"  Kyle had not stopped crying since you shrunk him, but thankfully with smaller lungs it was a bit quieter than his previous cries.  \"Can you turn her back?\"  Haylee asked and you responded by stretching out the tape measure to a little bit shorter than baby Kyle's previous size (after all, he was being a pain with all this crying) and activated the effect.  Sure enough baby Kyle was back to being baby size.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so wild.\"  Haylee said picking up Kyle again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're telling me, it's been a long and crazy day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you've had a busy day being a first time mom.  You could use a break.  So I'll go ahead and take my niece out for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank's that'd be a big help.\"  You said as Haylee began to exit the house, suddenly you realized what was wrong with this, \"Wait!  That's your brother not your niece, and he's got to stay so I can turn him back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can't just say my parents had another kid out of nowhere, that'd be crazy.  But if I tell people she's my niece, people would believe it more that Kyle would have a secret kid.  Besides we've got to go out, I doubt you have baby supplies here, so I'll go out and get some of the basics.  It'll be my treat, think of it as a moving in gift from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Kyle's not going to be a baby for long,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, before you know it she'll be walking and talking, so you should enjoy this time while it lasts.  I know I will.\"  You weren't sure if Haylee was being really dumb, was really messing with her brother, or was just really high.  Or maybe a little bit of all three.  Haylee stepped out of the house and started to head to her car.  You could swear you saw Kyle flipping you off with his cute little middle fingers.  \"So...do I follow and make sure Haylee doesn't do anything too crazy with or to Kyle, or do I stay and get the hammer.\"  Then the smell of a deviously chocolate pot brownie met your nose.  \"Or I could enjoy a little snack first.\"</span></div></div>",

You had to pull the seat belt just about all the way out, but you managed to fasten it around your rotund body.  And now that you were safely in you help Kyle close to your chest making sure you were supporting him.  Kyle said something that resulted in drool falling on your boobs but you decided to interpret it as Kyle saying 'Thank you Sid for saving me from being alone with my super high sister.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne drive later and you were at the local big box store.  After Haylee got out of the car Kyle started saying a bunch of baby nonsense at you which you shut down, \"Dude, I don't love this either, but it's either this or I leave you with Haylee, do you want that?\"  Kyle let out a defeated sounding, \"Kah,\" as Haylee shouted back, \"Let's go slow pokes, the deals aren't going to buy themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking around the huge store for 10 minutes you actually wished you'd grabbed one of those scooters at the front of the store they usually give to bigger or older people.  You were exhausted with the nonstop walking, you were having to use the shopping cart to hold yourself up.  \"Guh!\"  Kyle shouted up at you, looking down at the racecar shaped shopping cart that had a built in section for a baby you saw that you were actually sweating on Kyle.  \"My bad bro.\"  You said wiping your face with your t-shirt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you finished wiping yourself you saw that Haylee was back with a big package of diapers and some baby toys, \"You know what, that outfit just won't do, you should totally get something nice for yourself, after all you must be having a hard time being a single mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've only been a mom for like an hour...and I'm not a mom!  I'm a dude and that baby's my roommate and your brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah I know, I just think it'd be a good idea to treat yourself, you've had such a rough day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...it has been kind of crazy.\"  You admitted, and that was all the opening Haylee needed, \"Then go into this dressing room and put on this dress, I won't take no for an answer.\"  Haylee pushed you towards a dressing room and handed you some fabric, Kyle tried to stand up for you with some screaming, but Haylee had a newly acquired pacifier in hand and promptly used it on her baby girl brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that you actually could use a minute away from the baby you entered the dressing room and closed the door.  You took a look at the big orange dress that Haylee had given you, and then you saw yourself in the full body mirror for the first time since you fused with the butter.   You saw a woman you didn't recognized, although she did have your eyes.  She was about 5'10 and had to be at least 350 pounds.  And you looked like a mess.  It seemed fusing with the butter not only made you fat, but you looked sweaty and greesy with a not good looking shine.  Your hair looked like it was drenched in greece and the yellow shirt you were wearing looking like a rag used to wipe up a kitchen stovetop.  You found yourself actually caring for a moment about your appearances for once upon seeing yourself look this bad.  You slicked your hair back so it at least looking combed and took off your clothes.  After figuring out how to actually put on the dress you managed to maneuver it around until you had it on the way you thought it was supposed to go.  Using your old shirt you tried to wipe off the oils on  your face to the best of your abilities and when you were done, you figured you actually kind of looked cute if you were into bigger ladies.  Upon thinking this though you shook your head, \"Ok, makeover done.  Haylee!  Let's get out of here!\"  You exited the dressing room and saw that Haylee was having fun jingling her keys in front of Kyle and Kyle actually seemed to be enjoying it.  <i>'I have a feeling that will work even when Kyle turns back to normal.'</i> you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Took you long enough, I already bought the dress and my niece's stuff so we can go ahead and get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you helped load the diapers in the car you figured that there were worse moving in gifts you could have gotten.  After all you're going to use these diapers more than you'd use candle holder or a plant.  As you once again got into baby holding position you got ready to head back to the house to unfuse, hopefully before you'd have to use those diapers.  But on the way out of the store you saw that Haylee was going the wrong way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Haylee, the house is the other way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I just have another place I wanted to stop by, it'll be a real treat for you and your little girl.\"  Haylee said as she took another bite of a pot brownie as she drove.</span></div></div>",

After all I need the energy in able to move that stupid fridge.  Besides, I think it's science or something that Haylee's brownies won't affect me much because I'm big.  The stuff inside it spreads out too much so it won't affect me.

I have organs and blood living in me, and that's just like me and Kyle live in the house.  And you know what else?  Haylee might be right, I'm kind of like Kyle's mom.  I sometimes help clean the house, I sometimes use the microwave to make food, I'm like the best mom.\"  You rolled off of the couch and rolled around on the living room floor for a minute.  \"I can totally be the best mom ever you know.  I just gotta live the best life, and it could totally be cool you know?  I can.  I can do the mom stuffs.  Ok?\"  So after pulling on your face skin for a few minutes and trying to see if your body would come off like a rubber mask in the movies (it did not) you decided to continue your pursuit to be the best mom ever for Kyle in your infinite wisdom while being very very high.</span></div></div>",

But Kyle seemed even more adverse to this plan than you were.  Instead of latching on, he kept babbling what you were pretty sure were baby talk for curse words.  You could feel the baby girl's drool and snot starting to coat your left boob.  Again you tried to press Kyle against it hoping he would start to suck and get some milk or something and you'd have a calm baby on your hands so you could think clearly.  But Kyle just balled up his little hands into fists and started going at your boob like it was a punching bag.  Even though Kyle had no real strength, it was still annoying as hell.  Feeling your frustrations boiling over at what you were beginning to think of as an ungrateful baby, you held Kyle up to your face, and resisting every urge to shake him you said over his screams, \"DUDE!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle quieted down at once, \"Kyle, I'm trying to get the hammer to fix us, but I can't do that if you're crying.  You're driving me nuts.  So if you don't want to eat the only thing we have available to us aka my boob juice, then I'm gonna need you to shut up and let be get to work.  We cool?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle nodded, or at least he let the weight of his head fall forward in a nod like motion.  \"I'll take that as a yes.\"  You said calming down.  You were about to put Kyle back on the ground when you remembered the cold tile was just going to get him to start crying again.  \"If I put you on the table are you going to be dumbass and try to climb down and crack your skull?\"  The baby girl had an indignant look as it gurgled something out that sounded like, \"Uh uh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's just get this over with.  It should only take a few more minutes to get the hammer out from under the fridge.  Why the hell do refrigerators have to be so heavy?\"  You put the now calm baby down in the middle of the table besides the toolbox.  Giving one final order to make sure to Kyle his instructions you point at him and say, \"Stay.\"  Kyle drooled in response.  \"I don't know what other answer I would expect.\"  You said as you went back to work trying to shimmy the fridge from out of the wall so you could get to the wonderful Fusion Hammer that was wedged underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInch by inch you moved the massive refrigerator.  Soon the hammer would be within your grasp and you wouldn't be a butter fused fat lady and Kyle wouldn't be a baby girl.  Well you'd both still be girls, but the Gender Switching Socket Wrench would fix that up, but that was step 2.  As you grunted and groaned you were a little annoyed to hear the cute giggling of Kyle who seemed to enjoy your struggle.  \"Laugh it up, you've still gotta count on me to unfuse you from that baby carrot and the more you laugh the longer I'm willing to tolerate babysitting.\"</span></div></div>",

You pause for a moment to wipe a layer of greasy sweat from your forehead and step back to view your progress once more, instantly relieved that you can see the tip of the socket wrench's handle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally!\" You say and you quickly but carefully lower yourself to your knees, stretching a flabby arm through the space between the counter and the fridge, your thick sausage-like fingers close to wrapping around the metallic handle of the magical tool. Meanwhile your roommate continued to babble and giggle from the table and you look over to see his tiny legs and arms flailing in the air in utter amusement. One of his tiny legs becomes caught under the lid of the toolbox and it squeaks and clangs noisily as his little limb kicks at the metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, laugh it up you little turd\" You say quietly, rolling your beady, piggy eyes while confirming to yourself that Kyle has just earned himself additional diaper time, at least until you get the mess in the kitchen cleaned up. There was no way you wanted to be stuck taking care of him for much longer than that, babies were so gross and so small! If you didn't know it was actually Kyle inside the tiny body on the table you would have been petrified with fear of breaking him. But since it was still your buddy and he clearly still had his mind, you were felt a little more relaxed about leaving him like that. You were just about to turn back towards reaching for the wrench when Kyle let's loose a massive shriek of infantile laughter and kicks his tiny legs upwards, causing the toolbox's lid to reach the point of no return as it swung downward towards the latch, almost like it was in slow motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a ball of dread suddenly form and fall into your super-sized stomach as you watch the lid slam shut before your eyes were blinded by a green light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a whoosh of magical energy, the toolbox made the proper adjustments to reality, and as you hadn't been the one touching it at the time, your memory is the first thing to go, the next being a few years (and a couple more pounds) adding to your body. The rest of the house changes accordingly, though not as drastically as may have been expected. Throughout the house things become decidedly more feminine, if a little cluttered and messy. Your bedroom is the worst, your usual tidy sleeping quarters transformed into the nest of someone who was clearly failing at being a slob. An over-flowing garbage can of food wrappers appears next to your bed, a stash of candy bars appearing in your bedside table, your bed itself expanding dramatically outwards to a un-made queen sized monstrosity. Your clothing shifts from the typical male attire to large flowing dresses that accomodate your obese frame, and most of your pants become some form of sweat or flexible material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything belong to Kyle simply disappears, gone are all his video games, his computer, his porn, his bed, clothes, everything vanishing as the wave of light flashed across them. Instead, what few possessions that now belonged to him simply appeared in the small guest bedroom which was converted from the dusty storage room the two of you had been using it as into a pink and yellow nursery. Baby clothes appeared in a dresser, the spare bed shifting into a crib, and several boxes of diapers and a changing table materializing in one of the corners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle's old room shifts as it becomes the room of someone else entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green flash ripples around the world as reality shifts entirely to make you the new, very overweight mother Sydney Barnes, suddenly horrified at what you'd just done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH BABY!\" You shout loudly as you heave your body off the floor as fast as you can and waddle over to the table. You couldn't believe it, you left your daughter Kylie on the table near all those dnagerous tools! You mentally kick yourself for being so careless as you scoop the suddenly confused infant off the table and snuggle her close to your breast, ignoring the confused babbling coming out of her precious little mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy is SO sorry Kylie! She just should have put you in your crib where you belong!\" You blather, fighting back tears of relief and self-hate, glad that your daughter was safe but angry at yourself for being so careless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kylie was now pressing painfully against your fat-swollen boobs with her little fists.It was just her way and you loosen your protective hold on her just a bit and stare down with your watery eyes at Kylie's cute little face. She had so much personality!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe babbled up at you, pointing at your face with a tiny finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right! Mommy loves you!\" You say in a disgustingly sweet cooing voice as you turn and waddle slowly out of the kitchen, leaving the dangerous, un-safe environment as you make your way into the living room and your reinforced recliner. You turn and gently set yourself down into it, leaning backwards with a huge sigh as the chair's frame takes the bulk of your substantial weight and you lean back, putting Kylie on your chest, who simply begins wiggling furiously in your fat folds. You take a flabby hand and begin running it up and down her tiny, fragile back slowly, with just enough pressure to hold your daughter down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy's gonna hel you fall asleep first, okay? Then she's gonna take you to bed and wait for Auntie Hayley to come home\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis only makes Kylie wiggle harder as she begins to furiously babble, almost as if she was trying to tell you something...But that was ridiculous, Kylie wasn't even a year old and though you had to admit she was smart for her age, she wasn't anywhere near ready to start talking. You simply smile softly with your swollen lips and close your eyes as you try to relax, remembering the parenting classes you took and how babies could sense stress and react to it. If you were calm and kept rubbing her back, you knew Kylie would eventually calm down herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhh little baby, mommy's got you, shhhhh\" You say as her babbling turns into almost frantic wails. You do your best to just tune it out, focusing on the ceiling as you continue to stroke her back. Eventually the plan works and Kylie, despite an intense struggle, eventually begins to wiggle less and less, her cries interrupted by cute involuntary yawns before finally she can't seem to keep her head up or her eyes open anymore, and soon your daughter is asleep, nestled between your fat breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit there for a while,, hand on her back as you think about how lucky you are to have her. It'd just been random chance everything had worked out as well as it had. You couldn't believe you were living this close to campus, and it was all thanks to your BFF Hayley and her parents. Hayley was practically your sister, the two of you having grown up together, attended the same school, the same classes and eventually the same college. It was why you both lived together in the house, her parents had offered to put you both up since her dad was a big city contractor and made loads of cash. The two of you basically lived rent free outside of groceries and utilities. And Hayley had just been the best aunt/second mom you could have ever hoped to have for your precious Kylie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure she may have turned into a bit of a pothead but when you'd told her you were pregnant after that random one night stand (you'd gone out to a singles meet up for plus sized girls and gotten lucky, even if it had just been a one night stand and he'd left before you woke up the next morning) she had really cut back. She'd taken to recreating outside and had moved all of her drug related paraphanelia into her room or the basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe helped keep the house clean and watched Kylie whenever you needed to go to class, or the few jobs you'd managed to find. It was insulting that so few places were willing to hire plus sized girls such as yourself, so what if you had certain health requirements? YOu were just as a hard worker as everyone else!  And now with Kylie...You almost doubted if you'd ever go back to being in the workforce, you were even considering dropping out of school just so you could spend more time with your little bundle of joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you're certain that Kylie is sound asleep and you slowly, carefully heae yourself up out of the recliner and make the slow, long walk upstairs, the floors creaking under your immense weight as you make your way to Kylie's room and gently set her down into her crib. You watch in adoration for a moment as her tiny body wiggles slightly in her sleep before you waddle out of the nursery and into your own bedroom, collapsing on the bed as quietly as you can and automatically reaching into your bedside table to stave off that pangs of hunger you were feeling (even if you always felt hungry). You take out three king sized candy bars, prop yourself up in your bed and begin munching down on them, part of your mind telling you that you shouldn't be eating in bed, and that you didn't really need the candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you, like always, ignored the voice and soon there was nothing left but some crumbs on your shirt and bed, and you let out a deep gross burp as you rubbed your stomach, feeling the scar where they'd pulled Kylie out of you months ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well\" You say quietly as your phone buzzes on the bedside table. You look at it, seeing that it was Hayley and she was bringing home a few burgers and a pizza for dinner. You feel your stomach rumble in anticipation and you lick your fat lips. You text her back saying you can't wait, and that the kitchen is still a mess. You leave out how you'd put your child in danger, Hayley didn't need to know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard being a single mother, but you had to admit that it was a joyful, flabby life you lived, and you wouldn't want it any other way.</span></div></div>",

You stepped in a laughed to yourself, \"I think I'm the first girl who's ever been in Kyle's room.\"  With hammer and nail in hand you began to look around the room for something cool to fuse with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His bed?  No, I could just fuse with mine.  His underwear?  Nah, too nasty.  My copy of Halo...wait, why the hell is that in here, it even has my name on it?!\"  You grumble as you put the game case with 'Sid' written on it by the door to grab later, but as you do you knock some magazine on the ground.

We have internet bro.\"  But your judgment didn't stop you from taking a moment to peruse the magazine and take a few mental pictures for later use.  After you finished up you put the magazine on Kyle's computer desk and once again you knocked something to the ground.  Something that made a weird noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, I forgot Kyle got a guitar at that pawn shop.\"  You said as you picked up the acoustic guitar.  Kyle was saying for weeks how he was going to learn how to play it and get all the chicks, but of course he never touched it after buying it and probably has no idea how to play a note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\"  You said eyeing the guitar as you continued to walk around the room before you tripped over something furry.  You had to wonder for a second if you and Kyle had a cat you'd forgotten you had, but luckily the furry thing was just some clothes.  In fact as you picked it up you recognize it as a caveman costume Kyle wore last year.  Again you felt some gears turning in your head as you glanced around at the room and knew what you wanted to try to use the Fusion Hammer on.</span></div></div>",

You would have felt your legs lengthen and grow more toned, your nails grow out, your face change shape just enough to appear far more appealing and sexy. Your hair changed as it became a golden blond, it's former straight shoulder cut exploding into a curly waterfall that traveled down the length of your bare, arched back as your photograph body took on a sexy pose that was just censored enough by your hair and hands to be suitable for sale on a magazine rack in a store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final change, had you felt it, would have been the application of makeup across your now beautiful face, mascara, eye liner, glossy red lipstick applying itself to puffy lips. Had you been able to feel, there might have been a tickling sensation as your skin-tone became gorgeously tan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final change you would have felt would have been the sharp pinch of your naval being pierced by a brilliant green emerald as the nail-head converted to fit your new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead there's simply a flash of light and a soft flutter as your new form simply collapses to the smelly, grungy carpet of Kyle's bedroom. If you had still had your nose, a mouth and other sensations you would have been gagging from the smell of being lost in the disgusting wilderness of your roommate's slobbish mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was now, were you still you, or just a magazine that happened to have a highly sexualized and knock-out version of your female body on the cover?</span></div></div>",

The one closest to you was staring up at the somehow strained ceiling of what you recognized as Kyle's room, his pile of dirty clothes and computer stretching upwards like skyscrapers. And next to it was a small booth that had your name (well, the female version, at least) decked across the pink privacy curtain in bold, glittering font. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" You say and you're taken aback by how...sexy your voice sounds. It's nothing like your original female voice, which just sounded like a higher pitched version of yourself. No, your new voice oozes (purrs might be more appropriate) sex appeal. But the overall newness, even in this clearly knockout body, you're sort of used to it, so you don't bother exploring your further altered body and instead take a wobbly step towards the weird door...window...opening thing to Kyle's room, hoping that you don't trip over yourself and that your new body knows ow to move on it's own, given you can't see your feet anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get closer you can pick up the faintly familiar stench of your friend's room, and you take a step around the 'front' of it to see if it was connected to some kind of tunnel...Only to be met with the same view, with the small booth now appearing across from you. You carefully step backwards, moving back to where you came only to be greeted by the same sight. You then sprint (as best as you can with your new proportions) around both sides only to be met by TWO MORE identical views of Kyle's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh\" You say dumbly as your brain attempts to reconcile what you're looking at. You can almost hear the fail buzzer in your head as the only thing you can come up with is 'oh its a square. I mean cube', which explains absolutely nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's not my fault, brain\" You say as you scratch your head, not realizing how bimbo-like it makes you look. Luckily there seems to be no one around, which you're not sure you're grateful for or terrified about. Just where were you? This was so radically different from you'd experienced from the Toolbox so far!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe I can just leave?' You reach out and touch the door-thing with a hand that you don't realize it tipped by large nails until they bonk painfully off the 'surface' of the opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW ! Shit!\" You cry out in pain as the longer nails clatter against what feels like glass. You shake your hand in pain but the stinging suddenly seems like less of priority as the opening begins to glow green, an fuzzy looking aura surrounding the otherwise borderless cube. You decide to just leave it alone for now and instead turn your attention to the weird little booth next to it. You take a much less wobbly step over to it, your body acclimating to your new centers of mass and gravity, reaching out (much more slowly this time) and sliding the curtain that has 'SEXY SYDNEY' obnoxiously emblazoned across it in glittery text. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know what you were expecting, but it's fairly unimpressive. It just looks like a tiny dressing room, a small stool in front of a dresser that was covered in makeup, topped by a softly lit mirror and your gorgeously sexy reflection staring back at you, big blue eyes widening in surprise. You touch your face gingerly, tracing the subtle differences before your eyes spot the green emerald piercing in your belly button, noticing that the silver casing around the gem looks vaguely like a nail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be where the fusion is\" You say before you turn your attention towards the rest of the booth's contents. On the small makeup table there's a variety of different lipsticks, mascara, eye liner, gloss, nail paint, even a jewelry box that is filled with different types of necklaces, bracelets and earrings. There's even a small selection of wigs that looks Barbie sized! You up one up, a red straight cut, with your fingers and gasp in surprise as it instantly grows in size, a full size wig now hanging between your fingertips! You quickly put it back down, fearful of it coming to life, or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly open the dresser drawers, wary of any sort of interdimensional dressing room demon that might jump out at you, but you're relieved to see it's just clothes. Clothes that were definitely made for enticing men or being easily and quickly stripped off, but clothes all the same. Content to remain nude for the moment, you close the drawers and go back to inspecting the heaps of makeup products on top of the small dresser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's even a selection of...spray tans? You cautiously pick up one that has 'Ebony Goddess' written plainly on the front of it and take the top off. You give it a soft shake, the can rattling before you stick out the edge of your pinky finger and give the can's spray-tip a slight push. With a soft hiss, you watch in amazement as your pinky finger immediately turns a deep dark brown! You rub your finger, thinking the tanning solution would just wipe off but there's just skin! It changed your skin tone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap\" You say, putting the can down and staring in amazement at everything in front of you. Clearly it could allow you to modify your appearance WITHOUT the toolbox! But did you really want to? Maybe you should just try getting out of here while you had the chance...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look out of the dressing booth at the square...at the CUBE again and walk back over to it, reaching out your hand again and pushing it against the 'surface' of the cube, feeling a slight bit of resistance before suddenly your hand breaks through! There's a ripple across the image of Kyle's room as your hand and forearm materialize on the other side and you wiggle your fingers in the digustingly familiar humid environment of Kyle's room before you pull it back, the cube's green aura fading away as it returns to normal. And you had no idea that the suggestively posed image of you on the magazine's cover had changed to show your new ebony-toned pinky finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so crazy!\" You say to no one in particular. You dart over to the next nearest cube and stare out at a rainy street corner you don't recognize and then touching it, allowing the green aura to appear around the cube once more before plunging your hand through it, feeling rain hit your hand and pulling it back to see that it's wet! The run over to the next cube, this time a some kind of store and do the same before your hastily made hypothesis is confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're portals, like that old video game with the killer robot lady!\" You shout in excitement, before darting inside the cube's attendant booth and grab the red straight cut and place it clumsily on your head and giggle as it causes your blonde mane to shrivel upwards as the curls are converted into brilliant red hair that hangs down to your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...this is really cool\" Is all you can say as you ponder the possibilities (and hot redheaded body) in front of you. You give your red hair a soft tug and sigh in relief as it slides right off, your blonde hair spilling down your back once again. You put the red wig down and watch it shrink before you decide to try something crazier. You reach up and grab a handful of blonde locks and pull, chuckling as your hair simply pops off, leaving you with a shiny bald dome that you rub with your free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, cue-ball!\" You say to your reflection before setting the blonde wig back on your scalp, watching it become your hair once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could change this body however you wanted! And with the cubes...You could go anywhere you wanted! Or at least, figuring that it had something to do do with the magazine, at least wherever 'your' magazine was for sale. Which in itself was a weird realization, but you didn't think about it too much. In fact, beyond having fun and trying to figure out how to get Kyle in here, your only other real thought was that you should just get out while you could. After all, you could always come back. You walk back to your original cube and spot the fusion hammer laying where you dropped it on the 'floor' of...wherever you were when you arrived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing I didn't lose you either\" You say, shuddering as you contemplate being stuck like this. This was fun, but you definitely wanted to go back to your normal body at some point. You wonder, briefly, what would happen if you unfused with the magazine while you were here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at the hammer, your reflection in the mirror of the changing booth and then behind you at the cube leading to Kyle's bedroom. After a few moments of thought you decided to...</span></div></div>",

Or Kyle just being an idiot and sticking you in the pile of other porn mags and forgetting about you entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no, I'm good looking like this for a little bit\" You say to yourself, reaching out and touching the cube, causing the green aura to appear around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a step back and stare at the image in the cube.

As you looked at the titles you said, \"Man I hope Kyle doesn't read this thing, don't think I could look him in the eyes...hell what am I kidding.  Nobody reads the articles in these kind of magazines.  But why is all the text so big?  And why is the magazine bigger than me?  And why is the entire room like 10 times bigger than before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you an embarrassingly long time to realize further fulfilling your blonde stereotype, \"Ah crap I came out the same size as the actual magazine.\"  Looking at yourself and comparing yourself to the magazine you just used as a portal to a weird pocket dimension you figured you might be a foot tall, probably something closer to 10 inches or so.  \"Well, this shouldn't be too much a problem, I'll just unfused with the porno magazine and I'll be back to my normal size.\"  You lifted your hand and put it to your belly button to pull the emerald green nail out, but that was proving to be a problem as the Fusion Hammer was no longer in your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?!\"  You said as you looked at the ground around the magazine to try to find it, but it wasn't til you looked up a little more before you realized, \"Ah double crap.  The hammer turned back to it's normal size.  But why didn't I?  That's like cheating or something!\"  You tried in vain to try to work the bigger hammer around your waist to pull the nail out, but you were going to need a second person to pull the hammer.  You were going to need Kyle's help.  Coming to this realization you suddenly felt very aware that you were very naked.  \"I probably should have grabbed one of those fancy bras or something.\"  You began to look around Kyle's room in vein for a sock or something you could use as a piece of clothing, but as you looked under the bed you suddenly felt your nose being assaulted by something that smelled like it was dead, rotten, rank, and everything in between.  You found a used pair of Kyle's underwear.  \"Not touching that for all the gold in the universe!  I'm out!  I tap!\"  And with some track marks as the last mental image of Kyle's room you ran away very thankful you left the door open so you weren't trapped with the smells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to go to your room to get some clothing, but unfortunately you'd shut the door before.  You tried to crawl under the door, and you probably could have made it, if not for the two enormous mounds of flesh attached to your chest.  As you tried to squeeze you just felt yourself giving your nipples carpet burns.  \"Ow ow ow ow!\"  You said as you gently rubbed them to ease the pain, but you kept rubbing them with a grin on your face longer than you needed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I have to go down the stairs to see Kyle like this.\"  You said as you approached the daunting task before you.  \"Now I'm wishing I'd grabbed some of those wigs.  I could totally do this in an awesome Rapunzal way.\"  But alas you just had your long but not long enough blonde curly hair so you slowly, one at a time lowered yourself from step to step trying to get to your roommate.  You weren't paying attention but you were pretty sure you could hear him in the kitchen still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get down the stairs with no more than a few possibly bruises on your round butt from a few rough landings, but nothing you couldn't walk off.  You walked over to the kitchen and called out in a voice that wasn't very commanding at all and said, \"Hey bro!  I kind of got into a situation and need a hand!  I promise I'll let you get your hight back if you help me!\"  But you saw something in the kitchen that made you raise your perfectly manicured eyebrows.</span></div></div>",

The tape measure. It was laying on the tile floor of the kitchen, next to the table, which was very much where it hadn't been the last time you'd seen it. Did Kyle try to fix his height all by himself? What if..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god\" You say and you look down at the floor, suddenly afraid that your friend might have shrunken himself to the size of an ant, or something small enough that you might have accidentally squished. But then you see a flutter of movement by the leg of the kitchen table, and you see Kyle's tiny face leering out at your naked body, which you instinctively move to cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU PERVERT!\" You scream, but it comes out as more of a squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey don't get made at the farmer cause he put the melons on display, bro!\" Kyle says with a laugh, coming out from behind the leg of the table, shrunken once more, but fully clothed. He begins to make his way across the tile towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that even mean?!\" You hiss, turning your body to the side and hooking a leg up to block your blonde bush as you point a long nailed finger at him,\"Give me your pants or something!\". But as Kyle gets closer you realize that wouldn't even work, especially not with your massive T and A. He's shorter than you! He must only be three or four inches tall, he barely comes up to your waist!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle, what the hell did you do to yourself?\" You say as he stops a couple of feet (or inches? What was personal measurement like for shrunken people?) from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nu uh, you first, baberino!\" Your roommate and current pain in the ass says, crossing his arms as he stares at your exposed backside, your rump meat now clearly larger than his head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and give him a unintended pouty look and begin to tell him what happened and how you got like this...But suddenly you get an awful, but fun idea.

I think I can do that, anything for my girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUDE!  Not I'm not your girlfriend!\"  If you didn't need both of your arms to cover up your nudity you'd have slapped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh bro, you're a hot girl.  And you're also my friend.  So that makes you my girlfriend.  Duh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not how this works!\"  You said as you seriously considered trying to step on Kyle.  Kyle kept his stupid grin on his face as he said, \"Whatever you say Sid, let's get up to the hammer in my room and I'll save you.\"  And Kyle began to cockily walk out of the kitchen but you had to call out to stop him to point out the obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, man you're even shorter than me, no way in hell are you going to be able to get up the stairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem no problem, I already thought of that.  You see, all I have to do is climb up my hot girlfriend, and then pull you up and we do it all over again.  It'll be super sweet.  It'll be like when we use teamwork abilities in those co-op games except like maybe even twice as sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you felt the sudden urge to crush Kyle beneath your feet.  \"Nobody, especially you, is going to climb up my body!  Besides even if we get up there, you are way to small to use the Fusion Hammer.  We need to get you all big before anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you want to be the one to do the body climbing, well whatever floats your boat bro.  I aim to please my girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STILL NOT GIRLFRIEND!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few minutes to get everything in position.  You had Kyle laying down with his feet to the end of the Size Changing Tape Measure, and you were pulling the main part back.  Hopefully you could get Kyle to at least a hight big enough to use the hammer and unfused you from the magazine and then you'd be mostly back to normal.  You pulled and pulled the tape measure with all of your strength, you knew you had to set it and get it right or else you might shrink Kyle even small if you screwed up.  You backed all the way up until you bumped into the toolbox that gave a little shudder.  Satisfied you'd stretched the tape measure back as far as your tiny muscles would allow you called out.  \"Ready dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready bro!\"  You heard, and you really hoping you got the setting on the tape measure right as you let go of it.</span></div></div>",

I can see the dust on top of the fridge now!\"</font>  You had to strain your neck up to look at Kyle, you could now really feel your blonde hair rubbing up against your lower back and butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept one hand covering your bare chest and used the other to hold against your mouth to try to amplify your voice, \"Sweet!  Now pick me up and take me to your room.\"  Kyle raised his eyebrows and smiled and you instantly regretted every life choice you'd ever made.  Kyle reached his fingers around your waist, and with one hand he picked you up.  He'd pinned your hands within his palms and your chest was resting on the top of his hand perfect for his viewing pleasure.  \"Dude!  Don't crush me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry bro.  DUDE dude dude, when you made me big, do you think you gave me super strength?!\"  Kyle wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just made you taller, I don't think that's how the tool thing worked.  But sure, maybe.\"  You didn't want to admit it, but Kyle's grip was really strong, but you didn't want him to treat you like some delicate flower, or worse, like a girlfriend so you gritted it out as Kyle climbed the stairs and entered his room.  For a moment you gagged, you'd let yourself forget the smell of this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, so this is your magazine?\"  Kyle said as he picked up the cover girl less copy of 'SEXY SYDNEY #!'.  \"How'd you come out of this thing?  Can you just jump in and out of pictures like in that show with the blue dog?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a cartoon, and I'm not a cartoon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle rolled his eyes, \"Bro, you're like the size of a fairy or something and I'm the size of a giant now.  We might be cartoons drawn and written by some crazy creator.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not how reality works Kyle.  And you can't be a giant, you're like 6 feet tall maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, I'm a giant to you.  So how does this magazine thing work.  Do I have to put you into it to unfuse you Sid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, maybe, we couldn't try to just pull it out of my stomach I guess?\"  You said as you felt the emerald nail in your belly button.  But you were in the magazine when you got fused with it to start so maybe you need to be in it to unfused?  Who knew how this crazy stuff worked.  You reached out to touch the magazine and sure enough when you touched it there was a faint green glow and the cover of the magazine started to ripple like a puddle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!  Cool trick!  Do you think I could go in there?  Can you use your hot magazine girl powers to open portals to other picture books?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt it, but I haven't tried, I've kinda been trying to turn back into a not magazine girl.  I mean not magazine boy me man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on,\"  Kyle said as he looked under his bed into what might have been the portal to hell from how it smelled.  Kyle apparently knew what was in there and where it was because a few seconds later he came out with the yearbook from your senior year in school.  He opened up to near the end and stopped a picture of prom.  Neither of you had dates so the oh so nice members of the yearbook comity took a picture of the two of you alone looking kinda pathetic.  \"Try to enter this and then you can be my girlfriend in the yearbook so we don't look so lame bro.\"  You looked at Kyle and were so dumbfounded by Kyle's crazy idea you forgot to hide your nudity which Kyle appreciated.  </span></div></div>",

You shudder and cause your massive breasts to jiggle, to which Kyle just grins like an idiot s the portal around the magazine fades away, sealing it shut until you touched it once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So bro, you gonna jump into the yearbook and be my girlfriend?\" Kyle asks again, his voice booming down from on high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am NOT and NEVER will be your girlfriend! And now I'm definitely NOT gonna do it!\" You angrily squeak back as you stomp your foot petulantly, causing all your assets to jiggle once more. In truth you were just about to consider giving it a try, if only to see if it actually did anything or nor or if your newfound magical power was limited to 'your' magazine. But now you definitely weren't going to do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, c'mon bro! I'd do it for you...\" Kyle begs, giving you the saddest puppy dog eyes he can manage while holding back a grin at your tiny naked form giving him a full show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care! I just want to get back to being a normal girl! I mean guy!\" You whine, your face scrunched up in a pout that just makes your look sexier than you already are as you stare up at Kyle. You must have touched a nerve because you see Kyle's eyes widen as something massive near his crotch moves, and. you shudder, and suddenly find yourself very thankful that, as far as you knew, Kyle din't have one of those weird giant fetish things. And that despite being a complete idiot, he wasn't evil enough to actually do anything to you while you were in this vulnerable state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lovable idiot routine was actually a bit charming, but you don't really register that you just thought that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to try to change the subject and walk (as non-sexually as your hips will let you) over to your magazine and touch the cover, sighing in relief as the green glow surrounded it, though you saw nothing that looked like a portal back to that weird changing room void place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe I just dive in?' You wonder, biting your lower lip and stretching out a toned leg and touching the magazine with a red painted toe, as if you were testing the waters of a pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUDE!\" Kyle bellows from above, \"I wanna see the place too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you're diving away, landing painfully on your massive tits as Kyle literally tries to jump headfirst into the portal created by you! You gasp as you expect your friend to vanish into the weird void contained within your magazine..But instead he simply faceplants on the floor with a titanic thud, the shockwave actually lifting your small body and sending it cartwheeling through the air with a girlish shriek and face first into...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KYLE CLEAN YOUR FUCKING ROOM!\" You scream as you frantically untangle yourself from the pile of dirty clothes that lay next to the empty clothes hamper. You struggle and grunt as you scramble out of the pair of underwear that had slid down on top of you, instantly feeling violated and unclean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle simply groans in pain as he pulls himself off the floor, rubbing his face with a hand that looks like the size of house to you. \"Ugh...Sid, I think I broke my nose!\" He whines as he flops backwards against his bed. As you finally free yourself from the underwear, flopping backwards on your back and kicking the clinging fabric away with tiny feet, you flop back over and see that Kyle is quite clearly fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, don't let me fall asleep! I'll never wake up!\" He says fearfully, looking at your tiny form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a concussion, you moron!\" You say, rolling your eyes as you pick yourself up and move as quickly as you can without knocking yourself out with your massive tits back to the magazine. You were suddenly worried that if it was somehow damaged you wouldn't be able to get back to the void place, or unfuse. You really, REALLY did not want to spend the rest of your life as a ten inch tall sexpot! But thankfully there's nothing wrong with the cover outside of having a vague Kyle-shaped indentation on the front, it still lights up the moment you touch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't it let me in?\" Kyle says as he crawls over to you on his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scratch your blonde head for a moment and bite a long nail as you try to think of a reason, and for a moment you swear you hear the Jeopardy! theme song playing from next door as the two of you stare at the magazine, the green glow fading away after about a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe because you're not fused with it?\" Is all you can come up with, though you're pretty sure that that must be what happened. The magical tools seemed to have limitless and unpredictable options, but at least they all seemed to follow some kind of internal logic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if I fuse with it I can see the weird place?\" Kyle asks hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I guess so, dude\" Is all you say before Kyle suddenly grabs the fusion hammer.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But you were not nearly as happy when Kyle went by his bed and reached under his mattress to pull out a half empty chip bags and another porno mag.  After getting over the fact that Kyle had multiple pornographic magazines in his room (I mean seriously, has he not heard of internet porn?) you manage to cry out, \"Dude!  What's up?  You're supposed to be using the fusion hammer on me, not grabbing another stupid magazine!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle just shook his head as though what you'd said was ridiculous, \"Dude, you can't just tell me you can jump into magazine magic worlds and not expect me to do that myself.  I mean, it's my dream to have a weird magazine dimension dream world thing for as long as I can remember hearing about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you only learned about it from me like five minutes ago!\"  You said actually jumping up and down in frustration, but all you managed to do was hurt your chest a little and distract Kyle as he stared at you for a few seconds with a stupid grin on his face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, don't tell me to not go for my dreams.  TV always told me to dream big, and my dream right now is to be a comic book character!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's not a comic, that's a dirty magazine, and I mean that in more ways than one.\"  You said eyeing the ratty looking porno mag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the difference between a magazine and a comic?\"  Kyle asked genuinely.  The two of you sat in silence for a minute as you pondered the important life question.  Eventually you shrugged and said, \"Well, I guess that comics get turned into movies and magazines don't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...whatever, it doesn't matter.  I'm jumping into this magazine thing and you can't stop me!\"  And so Kyle put the magazine and a nail over his belly and swung the Fusion Hammer down.  There was a flash of green light and suddenly you saw a magazine slowly falling to the floor.  Cursing Kyle you ran up to the magazine and first saw the title of the magazine that Kyle now was on the cover of.</span></div></div>",

You sigh in frustration, you were HOPING to have gotten out of this body already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, may as well see what kind of girl he looks like\" You say to no one as you march across the carpet, your tiny feet sinking up to your ankles in the unclean fabric. It wasn't a long trek even in your tiny form and you reach the edge of the magazine's cover, blowing a long stray lock of golden hair out of your eyes before you look down, expecting to see some sexpot that happened to resemble Kyle in a suggestive pose staring back up at you. But instead you see something else entirely. On the cover of the magazine, in big, bold white masculine print are the worlds <span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\"><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">KYLE: SEXY SYDNEY'S BOYFRIEND</font></span>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd below it was a handsome version of Kyle's face, with short spiked black hair sitting on top of the hottest male body you had ever seen. And also happened to be completely naked. That chiseled chin, bulging muscles, rippling abs, those intense eyes and that <i>smolder</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, he's hot!\" You mutter to yourself as you stare, slack jawed, at the Adonis adorning the cover of the magazine. You feel a strange twinge in your nether regions as gaze upon Kyle's new body and don't even realize as your eyes begin to drift downward towards the artfully posed and barely hidden space between two legs that looked like they could karate kick the moon in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr something. You were suddenly finding it a lot harder to think as you simply stared at the magazine for a long moment as something warm built inside your own naked, attractive form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You found yourself just staring at Kyle's naked muscular form.  You walked around the magazine cover almost as though if you looked at it from a different angle, you might get a look at what Kyle's junk could look like...for scientific research purposes of course.  Finally you noticed movement and saw the model on the cover smile with Kyle's particular goofy grin suddenly making the body at least 10% less sexy in your mind.  The body moved until Kyle's newly super handsome face popped out of the magazine and said, \"Bro!  You've got to see this.\"  Feeling your face flush a little you wiped a bit of drool from your face and turned away, \"I don't need to see anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude!  Sid my man, you have to see this, it's so sleek and smooth and velvety.\"  Wondering how the heck those words could describe a part of the human body you turned around and saw that Kyle was now wearing some very tight purple briefs that might have actually been made of velvet.  \"Dude, why are you wearing those!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh because it looked neat and was in my void dimension thingy.  You didn't tell me there was like 1,000 pairs of underwear.  Why didn't you wear a bra or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt more dumb than usual as you saw that Kyle had been smart enough to actually wear underwear.  You covered up your chest and angled your lower half so you only showed Kyle half of your ass in a very unintentionally provocative way.  \"Because...bras are dumb!\"  You shout saying the only thing that came to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle grinned his goofy grin, \"Hell yeah!  That's why you're the best girlfriend I've ever had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the only girlfriend you've ever had...wait no.  NOT YOUR GIRLFRIEND!\"  You say catching yourself only a few words too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Kyle wasn't convinced he pointed to his magazine cover and said, \"No man, the magazine says it.  I'm your boyfriend.  So that makes you my girlfriend.  The magazine says it so it much be true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...magazines are stupid and lie all the time...AND I'M MAD AT YOU.\"  You said as you remembered something important.  \"You fused with the magazine, and made yourself small, and now we're stuck like this!  We can't use the fusion hammer at this size!  We're still less than a foot tall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle approached you squinting and stood right beside you.  You looked down and saw that Kyle's rippling pecs were right beside your breasts practically pressed against each other.  You felt yourself breathing a little heavy when Kyle said, \"What do you know, I'm just as tall as you.  I'd figure I'd be like super tall compared to my girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah. uh still not your girlfriend.\"  You said taking a deep breath and making yourself look away from Kyle.  <i>'If we get out of this I swear I'm never looking at porn again...for like a week.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess we need to go downstairs and use the tape measure again, I can't let my girlfriend be just as tall as me, I want to be tall again!\"  Kyle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not girlfriend.  But I don't know if that's the best idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because when we made you tall last time, instead of unfusing me you just fused yourself with a different porno mag dude!  Not cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, all right, my bad bro.  My bad.\"  Kyle said raising his hands in guilt, \"Then we'll make you tall this time, I could be into bigger women I don't know yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we could but...\"  You hesitated as you tired to make your brain work fast, \"I've had the fusion hammer and the gender switching wrench used on me, if I use a third magic item maybe...I don't know.  Maybe I'll explode or something.  I don't know, that's a lot of magic dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, good idea.\"  Kyle said before nodding, \"I guess we just need to settle down until someone finds us.  I think we're small enough that we can share a bed if we cuddle together in my old shoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou vomit in your mouth at the idea of getting close to Kyle's disgusting old shoes, \"I don't want to cuddle in your old shoes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then, we can cuddle in the toolbox downstairs, it'll be like we were sleeping in a magic coffin...actually let's do that!  It'll be so cool!  Come on, let's try it!  Only for like a second!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Kyle, you didn't know about cuddling in the toolbox, but it was better then an old stinky shoe.  And you had to face it, Kyle had proven he might not be able to save you.  You might have to wait for someone else to come along and help and the toolbox could provide shelter from rats or earthquakes or whatever could hurt you at this size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you couldn't help but wonder if there was some brilliant idea that might be able to get you out of this mess.</span></div></div>",

You wanted to open up the magazine and pour through the pages.  Maybe the magazine even had a giant centerfold in it that you could rip out and hang on your wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped thinking.  You knew you might have just had a good idea.  But you needed to think it out.  You stood there not even bothering to wipe the blonde hairs out of your face before you finally said, \"DUDE!

You're thinking the same idea as me!\"  You said as you practically bounced with excitement over you Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did?  I did?  What idea?\"  Kyle said adjusting his fancy new underwear to try to hide his growing manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got an idea!  If I go into my magazine, but instead of coming out of the cover, I come out of the centerfold I might be bigger!  After all the centerfold is like 2, 4, or more pages big.  That will make me like 2, or 4 or more times bigger.  Big enough to finally use the hammer and unfused myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have to?\"  Kyle said sounding a bit disappointed at this possible news.  But you were already on the move.  You touched your magazine and it had a faint green glow as the portal opened.  \"See you in a minute bro.\"  You said, blowing him a kiss without even realizing it before diving in head first.  You were once more in the void.  And the first thing you did was run and grab some underwear.  You managed to find a purple set that seemed to match the underwear Kyle was wearing.  \"it just looks comfortable.\"  You said to yourself as you spent time figuring out how to put on a bra.  After you managed to succeed you looked around the void.  And sure enough after some looking you managed to see some potential portal openings that were bigger than the magazine cover portal you'd used last time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, I think this is going to work!\"  You said picking the biggest portal you could find and before giving it a second thought to even look inside of it, you jumped in.

But unbeknownst to him, the green light from your passage into the yearbook continued to glow softly, like the light of a cellphone, from the pages. Not that Kyle would have been able to tell, but he slowly began to flip through the rest of the yearbook, seeing that EVERY picture of you has changed to show your new body in place of your old body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile within the yearbook you finally regain your senses enough to pull yourself to your feet, and you part the veil of blonde hair in front of you to see...</span></div></div>",

You were in a bathroom (clearly the women's bathroom, given the number of stalls and lack of urinals), standing in front of a row of sinks and mirrors that reflected your knockout, but still naked, body back at you and you sigh dejectedly. That's when you see it, the faded wall painting of the 'Redford Hills Warriors' on the wall near the exit door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" You say quietly as you pad across the cold tile floor, unaware of your nipples standing erect at the chill in the bathroom.The first thing that entered your mind was that you'd somehow been transported to yours and Kyle's old high school! But that's when you see things are a little...off. Instead of a back wall near the end of the line of bathroom stalls, there's simply a empty , but familiar looking void. You walk over to it and throw out a hand with a little bit of force, expecting the tell-tale resistance and green glow as the portal opened back to the real world...Only to nearly fall forward onto your face again as your feminine hand swipes at empty air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHH!\" You scream and you scramble to keep your footing, your breasts and ass jiggling painfully as you stumble out of the bathroom. For a moment you expect to start falling like a cartoon, but instead you simply stumble out onto the Void's 'floor'. You regain your balance and take a breath, straightening your hair once again as you turn around and see the clear division between the 'school' and the rest of the Void. The ENTIRE school rises up before you, a cut-away that shows every single classroom, gym, bathroom, office, it's myriad chambers all with one wall missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah\" you mutter softly as you take a few steps backwards so you can see the whole thing. It was like a movie or the set of a TV show!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Or like a dollhouse' A dark, scared part of your mind tosses out, and you suddenly feel like you should find the exit. You wheel around on a tiny heel, flapping your arms in the air as you try to keep your balance, and then sigh in relief as you see a familiar portal leading back out to...Kyle's enormous, grinning face. Next to it was another one of the weird dressing rooms, but there was something else, some kind of long table covered in what looked like some kind of control panel?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That definitely wasn't there the last time\" You mutter as you pad over on your bare feet to get a closer look at it. And it is indeed some kind of control panel, looking like something out of a sci-fi movie as it has various screens, buttons, keyboards, dials and sliders, all of which controlled different options, but it looks powered down, and you curiously poke the power button at the top of the bank of controls, stepping back as the strange device powers itself up, but other than a soft electrical hum and a billion tiny lights, there's no real change beyond the primary screen saying;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSIMULATION: REDFORD HILLS PROM<br>\r\nCAST: SENIOR CLASS + FACULTY<br>\r\nLOCATION: GYM<br>\r\nPRIMARY ACTORS: SEXY SYDNEY #1 &amp; KYLE EUBANKS (RELATIONSHIP STATUS: COUPLE)<br>\r\nSTART: Y/N<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over the screen and from. Was that your name now? OR at least until you unfused? You weren't sure if that made you feel uneasy, insulted, scared or a combination of all three. And what was that about the two of you being a couple?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am NOT his girlfriend!\" You say to no one, but there seemed to be no way to edit the options on the screen. Instead there were just two buttons, a large glowing green 'START' button and a red 'CANCEL' button. You decide to not commit to anything without understanding the rest of this thing first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn away from it and move over to the next screen and section of the panel that has 'CAST' stenciled under it. This section looked more like a traditional PC with a mouse (which was embedded into the console but whatever) that you gave a tiny flick and watched as the cursor on the screen had a spazzout before you get serious. This particular section, once you started moving and clicking around, gave you access to the ENTIRE school population, both past AND present! And there was a keyboard and a search bar! You quickly type in 'KYLE EUBANKS' and his profile pops up! There's his school ID picture, his name, date of birth, weight height, gradepoint average, gender, the somewhat concerning 'projected IQ' number...You go back and search for yourself, only for a 'no results' message to pop up on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an annoyed grunt you type in 'SEXY SYDNEY #1' into the search box and immediately your new face pops up, with all your information listed next to it. You glance at your IQ, but given you didn't know what your actual IQ was, you were just glad that it was above Kyle's. But unlike Kyle's profile, none of your boxes were editable, something you figured had to do with the dressing room nearby. Conceding defeat that, until you unfused everything was just going to register you as a magazine girl, you move on to the next screen, the one that had 'SCENARIO' stenciled beneath it. Predictably it has a list of hundreds upon hundreds of what it classifies as 'pre-loaded' scenarios. School dance, exam week, The Big Game, Homecoming, a entire list of hundreds of somewhat stereotypical scenarios...But there was also an option to create a custom one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man!\" You say, feeling that same feeling of excitement like you did when you figured out you could change your current body around in the dressing room. You could type in anything you wanted, and you had a feeling that it would be projected into the weird model.set/dollhouse version of the school in front of you! You move to the final screen that had 'SOUND' stenciled under it, and take a look at the thousands of slide keys and dials that dominate the control board next to it. You're not much of DJ, so you decide to just leave it all alone for now and wander back towards the main screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could make anything happen here! You could edit as many details for anything you wanted, and since the dressing room was here, you could clearly change yourself as well! You look back at the giant face of Kyle and decide that you should probably do...Well, something before leaving. IF you didn't change anything you'd have to deal with his whining, plus you suddenly felt uncomfortable with the idea of your naked body being that close to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn back to the control panel and decide to...</span></div></div>",

You feel like you should start with Kyle. After all he was the entire reason you were here in the first place, and currently still carrying around a set of breasts large enough to kill a man (at least one your current size), so you figured some turnabout was more than fair play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull up his profile and mess around with interface until you find an option that says 'spawn'. You click on it and suddenly Kyle appears in front of your eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle? Did I just warp you in here or something dude?\" You ask in confusion, but Kyle doesn't respond, he simply stands in front of the console staring blankly into the distance. You reach across the console and wave a hand in front of your friend's face but there's no response. He's not even blinking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that, were it not for the fact that Kyle, at times, seemed a little baindead you would have been concerned. You reach further across the console, leaning on your ruby-red tipped toes in your shorter body and grab Kyle's nose and twist! You were expecting your friend to scream or swat your hand away or just...do something, but instead he continues to stand there motionless. Almost like he was a mannequin or a wax figure or something!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around and look out the portal back to the real world and see that Kyle is no longer staring into the face of the book, instead you seem to once again be staring up at the stained ceiling of Kyle's bedroom. You have a brief flash of concern, that somehow the magic of this weird place had warped Kyle to you and turned him into some kind of zombie, but you breath a sigh of relief as Kyle's massive face suddenly returns to fill up the portal as he takes a long swig out of a massive can of soda and subsequently belches, and you swear you can small the foulness leeching through into the Void as you have a tiny hand in front of your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well, he's fine at least. So is this just like some kind of doll, or something?\" YOu say, turning back towards the motionless Kyle standing in front of you. You decide to be a little vindictive on top of your curiosity and poke him in the eye for good measure, but nothing really happens. With a shrug you turn back to the console and look over it some more. It seems that you can spawn anyone you want, namely other members of your old school by bringing up their profiles!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to do anything to Kyle you can't unfix, you quickly select another student at random and spawn them, the average looking figure of some kid named Bill popping up in front of you. You don't recognize him, but then again you had done a pretty poor job of keeping track of most of your classmates, given how large your school was. Maybe he was in another class, or something. You were sure that he had his own story to tell, but right now you just needed him as a guinea pig (and to you, he sort of looked like he typically was one anyway. You don't know how or why you feel like that, but you just do, for some reason).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill's clone isn't much of a looker. He's pudgy, kind of geeky looking but overall just sort of average. You quickly change his gender to 'female' and watch in amazement as Bill's motionless body melts into that of a girl's! She's got frizzy hair and a large rear and hips, but is otherwise still a bit of a plain Jane. You look back at the console to see that 'Bill' is no longer the name of the profile, instead it reads 'Willow'!.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is SO cool!\" You squeal and, after finding the 'Save As' button, you've somehow created a entirely new student! The old version of Bill is still there, but now it lists 'Willow' as his sister! There's an option that says 'add to current simulation?' and with a shrug, you click 'YES'. When you got bored with messing around here, you'd have to check that out and see what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow knowing what you can do, you figure out how to despawn Bill and Willow, leaving the clone of Kyle standing there all alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin mischievously as you begin to get ideas of what to do to this helpless representation of your best friend (and reason why you were still stuck as a hot porn mag chick and not back to being a regular girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guy\" You say after a few moments. \"I meant to think guy!\" You look around in the Void as if trying to convince some unseen audience that was what you meant to think before you realize how silly you're being, turning back to the console and your clone victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was, what would you do to him first?</span></div></div>",

After a moment you see the changes to your body in the bathroom mirror.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blinking away a few straggling floaters from your vision you can immediately tell that your hair is different, shorter, and you look to the mirror. There, staring back at you, is a girl with brilliantly white and spiky hair that hangs down to her shoulders. Brilliant bright blue hair dye (at least, you think it's hair dye) frames her cute face. Her body, or rather, your body, is tall and curved, your breasts being at least a full cup size larger, held in place but a really tight, really short spaghetti strap white top with three brilliant splashes of red across your chest. Your mid-rift is exposed entirely and you see a strange piercing in your belly button that you make a mental note to check out after you finish exploring the rest of yourself. Your legs hips and legs are incredible, and it's clear that you're a chick with a knockout booty, all constrained by some pure white pants that end above your ankles and the two red, open topped low heels you're now wearing. You look at your hands as your nails seem slightly longer and capped in the same bright red as your top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set the hammer down on the bathroom sink and turn your hands around in amazement before you notice your mouth. Your limps are plump and caked in bright red lipstick, and behind them are the whitest, cleanest, brightest teeth you've ever seen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Like, it almost hurts to even look at them!' You think to yourself, not catching the first word your brain tossed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel up your pants. They look like jeans, but jeans, even the tightest, are not this form fitting. And they're not tights either, they're just some weird hybrid of the two that seres no function other than to accentuate your hips and legs. You turn to the side and you see the extreme curvature your body has as it clearly adapted to the contours of the toothbrush's form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why did my tits get bigger?\" You say and you put a red tipped hand to your new lips. Your voice is so...airy. It's not like the bimbo next door, Tiffany's voice, but it's certainly a lot higher than your previous female voice had just been. \"Wow...\" You say again as you stare into your wide, new eyes. They've changed shape slightly, and you suddenly realize you look a little Asian. That's when you remember the nearly invisible 'Made in China' disclaimer on the backside of the brush. They've also changed color as your blue eyes take on the golden flair of the company that manufactured the oral hygiene tool in the first place combined with the fact that you don't really recall the last time you saw someone of an Asian persuasion having blue eyes. Now it's just a softly golden brown staring back at you from soft eyes that sort of look like almonds, but it's clear that part of your original Caucasian ethnicity is making you look more mixed than fully Asian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run a hand over your left arm and feel how hairless and soft it is. How firm your feminine muscles are. You may not be cut like a weight lifter but it's clearly the firmness of the toothbrush showing, giving you the appearance of a chick that at least exercises regularly. And how soft and clean your skin feels! As a guy you had to admit, you skin was naturally a little oily and even as girl-Sid your skin wasn't entirely oil free. But now? IT seemed like there was just enough to keep your skin from drying out and ripping like a wet paper bag, but it was fantastic feeling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run a hand through your hair and it feels surprisingly stiff. It still sways from side to side when you playfully bob your head back and forth, but it never becomes disorganized. \"I'll totally save on trips to get it cut!\" You giggle to yourself, not really knowing why. You turn your attention back to the soft glint in your naval, peering down at it to see it's a very small green piercing, clearly the head of the nail (although why it was there instead of your hand, well, you had to figure that must have been because you hit the toothbrush right in the middle).. You look back up and grin to your new self in the mirror, your perfect pearly whites no longer fazing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're totally hot! Like you won't be winning any wet t-shirt contests (you suddenly think it might be fun to try though), but you are totally rocking your magically gifted ensemble. All you really need to complete the look would be some jewelry, like a couple of big hooped gold earrings, a couple of bracelets, maybe a necklace and you'd be turning heads for miles down on the boardwalk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just felt so...fresh and energized! You were totally still you on the inside, obviously, but something about this body just made you want to rush out and greet the world and have a little fun! You blow yourself a kiss in the bathroom mirror and mince downstairs (only tripping once in your heels) and strut into the kitchen. You strike a very girly pose in the doorway, hip cocked to one side with a hand placed upon it, sliding your free arm up the door frame as you give Kyle a playful, teasing look.  It would have grossed you out before but there wasn't any harm in it, you were still in, like, control. But after a moment your smile goes limp as you realize he's still got his nose buried in the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to get his attention by...</span></div></div>",

Kyle's face was still shoved in the weird book laptop/PC book/tablet diary/thingy that you'd made just a few minutes ago while testing out the hammer. Part of your mind is telling you that you really should have explored the hammer's abilities before fusing yourself to something, but you brush it off. You WILL get your roommate's attention, and you're going to have fun doing it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slide off the door, your movements fluid like a cat, kicking your low heels off as silently as you can and creeping barefoot across the cold kitchen tiles until you're directly behind Kyle. From over his should you can see a flurry of moving images from the past playing out like a Youtube video and you promise yourself that you'll check it out later, after all it DOES look particularly interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But first things first' You think to yourself with a toothy grin as you stealthily place a small hand on the back of the chair Kyle is sitting in, before you slide yourself around him as quickly as you can. You pull down the moving picture book with your free hand and Kyle's eyes snap up, his face looking angry before turning to confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, tiger\" You purr, and despite the voice in the back of your head screaming that this is a bad idea, you lean in and press your soft lips against his, closing your brown-gold eyes as you shiver in excitement as how -nice- it feels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMHHPHH!?\" You hear Kyle mumble before you pull away from him, another huge grin forming on your exotic face. He stutters nonsense for a moment before leaping up from the chair, the pc-book flopping to the tile with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who, what, WHO!?\" Kyle's words fail as his brain does a somersault while you decide to tease him some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly what a girl like me wants to hear, tiger\" You say, leaning against the kitchen table with your spectacular rear as you look at your longer fingernails, emblazoned in red. You turn your face into a fake pout, \"I was trying to surprise you! I thought you'd like it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, uh, yeah it was good. GREAT! It was great! But I don't really even know who you, I mean, how did you, uh\" Kyle talks almost too fast for his brain to think of words to say before he gasps dramatically and sucks in a lungful of air to calm himself down. You can't help but giggle at how adorably awkward he looks, despite the fact he always talks big game. But you suppose you ARE big game now.. \"I, uh, mean, I liked it but who are you? Does my roommate know you're here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, dude! It's me! Sid!\" You say, finally dropping the act as another wave of giggles threatens to break into full blown laughter. \"I used the hammer and fused with my toothbrush! Like I totally wasn't expecting anything like this! I feel amazing!\" You say, stepping back and gesturing with your new hands to, well, all of the current you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? Dude, you kissed me!\" Kyle said, \"That was so cool! Do it again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of you wants to, just to go with the flow and do something fresh with your life, but the larger part wins out and you stick your tongue out at your best friend.. \"What kind of girl do you think I am?\" You say with mock anger in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hot, be-my-girlfriend kind?\" Kyle suggest, and you bop him hard on the shoulder, which surprisingly hurts you as much as it does seem to hurt him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!\" You both say at the same time, before you look at each other and both explode into a heap of laughter. This was so great! You hadn't had this much fun just...doing nothing in such a long time! If you'd known that fusing, with a toothbrush of all things, was going to fill this great you would have done it right away instead of wasting time! Eventually your dual fit of laughter subsides and you wipe away a couple of stray tears from your eyes. As Kyle gets his own under control, he starts walking around you, and you can see what he's doing. You place your hands on your hips and strike a pose as your friend checks you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, Sid! You said the toothbrush did this? you're, like, a total knockout!\" Kyle is practically drooling as he takes in your new form, his eyes lingering far too long on your new ass, ut as much as you feel like you should be disgusted, it's simply too much fun to see his reaction. And besides, it was kinda nice to be looked at like that. You were certain that if it wasn't Kyle you'd feel uncomfortable, but for now, letting your best friend get an eyeful was hurting anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it, like, really caught me off guard! I was expecting to look like a dentist or something!\" You say as Kyle finally finished his inspection of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you gonna do now?\" He asks, taking his seat again and picking up the weird book-pc hybrid and setting it on the table. \"You gonna unfuse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a second, and part of you thinks that maybe you should unfuse, the other part of you is just having way too much fun at the moment. If just hanging out at home was this fun going out on the town could be a whole new level of entertainment! Or maybe you could test out the tools some more? You couldn't help but wonder what would happen if you experimented on yourself while fused?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Nothing good' A small, bitter voice says from somewhere in the back of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally reach and a decision and tell Kyle that you're going to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After thinking on it for a minute you decided you wanted to go out on the town a little bit and experience your new body in the outside world.  But when you looked at Kyle to tell him this, he already had his head back down in his computer book typing something on it's keyboard pages.  You looked over his shoulder to see some words form, <i>'And then Sid with the body of a crazy hot asian chick's body came in, I was so irritable she had to come over and kiss me.  Sid had some super fresh minty breath  It was pretty freaking hot.'</i>  And as Kyle was typing you saw video materializing on the page and was surprised to see yourself, or at least your female toothbrush fused body, sauntering in and kissing Kyle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude!  Stop being a dork and put away the book.  You've got the real thing's right here in front of you!  You can jerk off to the memory of my hotness later.  Like, let's go out and do something dude.\"  You said without realizing you had your hands on your waist and cocking out your hips in a very sassy fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!  Let's go get some grub.  We can be boyfriend and girlfriend Ouch!\"  Kyle said as he rubbed his freshly punched shoulder, \"I mean...<i>pretend</i> to be boyfriend and girlfriend.\"  You thought about Kyle's proposal as he smiled a cheesy grin.  And who were you to say no to a smile like that.  \"Sure, let's go.  But you have to let me lean on you, I'm still getting used to the heels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle agreed without hesitation and the two of you jumped into Kyle's truck and drove downtown to the nearest big chain Italian place so that you could be cheap and fill up on free bread while only ordering soup, a favorite technique of Kyle's.  You couldn't put your finger on why, but as you walked in the restaurant holding onto Kyle to stay standing, you noticed people more than before.  To be specific you kept seeing so many smiling faces.  Some of them were smiling at each other having a good time with friends, dates, or family, but you definitely noticed a smile or two in your direction that probably wouldn't be there without the crazy hair or the B cups attached to your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was a perfect gentleman and offered to pull out your chair to which you gave your first ever curtsy.  And so your feast of free bread began.  You had put down a loaf and a half when the waiter finally came out with the cheapest vegetable soup on the menu.  As you dug in you looked at Kyle and saw something that set something off.  In between Kyle's otherwise perfect smile was a piece of spinach stuck between his two front teeth.  That would not do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pushed aside the bread and soup and jumped across the table much to Kyle's surprise and you went right up to his face and put your tongue in his mouth.  Kyle tried to push you off at first, but it didn't take him long to get into a hot chick jumping over the table to kiss him.  You ran your tongue all over Kyle's teeth and you didn't stop till you had cleaned them all.  You finally pulled away and pulled Kyle's spinach stain out of your mouth.  With Kyle's teeth clean again your eyes widened as you realized what you had just done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, what the heck was that?\"  Kyle asked sounding both confused and excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I think...I think fusing with the toothbrush might have some side effects.  Let's get out of here.\"  You said standing up and Kyle followed you after putting some 1 dollar bills on the table to pay for the meal.</span></div></div>",

But as you were leaving you kept seeing mouths and teeth and with each coffee stain or yellow tooth you felt a shudder deep down.  <i>'Who'd have thought fusing with a toothbrush would give me a mouth fetish or something.'</i> you thought.  But with each toothy smile you saw you felt like you had to help them, like you had to be in their mouth.  You closing your eyes even though you were tripping over Kyle's feet a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you managed to escape the restaurant and feel concrete and asphalt under your heels.  \"Do you remember where I parked dude?\"  Kyle asked when you got to the parking lot.  You sighed and said with your face buried in his chest to avoid eye to teeth contact with anyone, \"Like, how am I supposed to know man?\"  But after a minute of not moving you, and figuring since you were outside you were less likely to see someone and be compelled to kiss them.  You dug your white and blue hair from Kyle's chest and began to look for his truck and you found it a few rows down.  Right beside a smiling happy married couple who had just gotten out of their expensive car.  And that husband had stains so bad his teeth looked like George Washington's wooden ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle couldn't stop you.  You kicked off your heels and charged at the man, you couldn't stop yourself.  He didn't even notice you until you were right up on him.  Before he could finish his cry of \"What the fu...\"  You had found your target.  You had pushed him up against his own car and had forced your lips against his and your tongue.  You could feel your minty fresh breath and saliva overwhelming the man's senses.  He was so stunned he didn't even push you back, but his wife was a different story.  You felt two arms wrap around your exposed midriff and wrench you off with all her might.  With a great tug your tongue finally left the man's mouth.  \"Patrick!  Who is this woman!  Do you know her!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear I've never seen her in my life Leslie!\"  The husband said after taking a moment to recover.  \"Did she drug me?  My mouth feels weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see.\"  The wife said examining her husband and she let out a gasp.  \"Patrick, your teeth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she knocks some out?\"  the husband said putting his fingers in his mouth to feel them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they're...they're perfect!  I've never seen them that white before.  You girl!  What did you do to my husband?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally felt in control of yourself again, you looked at the woman before you and shrugged as you said, \"Um, ancient Chinese secret?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever the secret is I want more of it,\"  The husband Patrick said.  \"I was going to go to the dentist next week to start a series of professional cleanings and it was going to take hours and cost an arm and a leg.  And you just did better work than a dentist in less than a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie reached into her purse, \"You're right Patrick, you mam, could you set up an appointment for me and my friends?.  As well as a follow up for my husband.  Do you take cash?  Will a hundred dollars per session work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the crisp hundred dollar bill being offered to you and didn't even hesitate.  \"No problem.  Meet me at my place and I'll totally take care of you.\"  You gave the couple your address and they were off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic, let's go honey.  With the money we're saving we can splurge on a little desert tonight.  Let's give those new pearly whites a test run.\"  The happy couple left a confused you and Kyle standing in shock at what just happened.  \"So...what happens now dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'll tell you what it means.\"  You said stuffing the $100 bill in your top.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>An hour later, Kyle is pounding a hastily made sign that reads \"Fyu Jiu Shen Holistics\" into the ground outside of your house with a hammer (one that didn't come from a magical toolbox) while you look on approvingly. You weren't entirely sure that the words made all that much sense, but it sounded 'Asian' enough (and you had giggled when you realized what it sounded like phonetically) to sound official.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you'd even use it as a name for yourself, if this hare-brained scheme actually worked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Except you already have a name. You're Sidney' Said the same quiet, bitter voice in the back of your mind as you watched Kyle finish hammering the sign into the ground. He turns to look at you as you lean against the door frame, dainty arms crossed beneath your boobs. You raise one and give him a thumbs up and a toothy grin, which he returns as he trudges back towards you and the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still can't believe you just made a Benjamin off kissing someone, bro!\" Kyle says as he hops up the short set of steps. He extends out a fist and you bump it with your own, although you go French Fries while he stays potato.Oh well, it was the thought that counted in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn and slip through the doorway as Kyle follows. \"Like, you and me both, dude! But this is so great! We'll totally make bank if that chick actually shows up! But we gotta get this place cleaned up before she gets here!\" You frown at the slightly messy interior of your shared home, especially the mess in the kitchen but that wasn't an easy fix in the short amount of time you felt you had. Instead you start hurriedly mincing about the rest of the house straightening things, arranging them so it looks somewhat professional. Your living room has a couple of large doors that close it off from the rest of the house so you simply let the curtains on the inner sides down and close the room off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, what about the kitchen?\" Kyle says as he follows you around being entirely unhelpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just, ummmm\" You pause for a second and you raise a red nail to your lips as your try to think of an acceptable solution, \"I guess, like, go get the shower curtain from the bathroom? It's got those silly Zodiac thingies on it, we can just hang it up in the doorway!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" Kyle says and he hustles upstairs, his feet that had been, until just a short while ago, the same size as yours thundering away. You try not to giggle as he trips over himself on the second to last step near the top and let's out a loud 'OOF' before he scrambles back to his feet and disappears down the upper hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your attention back to cleaning up the lower floor, and you stride into the small sitting room opposite of the living room. It's not very large and leads to the laundry room, you and Kyle had yet to really do much with it or otherwise mess it up. But it was a little dirty and dusty from dis-use, so you strut into the laundry room and grab one of Kyle's underpants sitting in the basket next to the washer and dryer. You're not really sure why they're down there, given your roommate rarely does his own laundry, but you had more pressing concerns as you walk back out to the sitting room and begin using the undergarment as a makeshift dust rag. You wipe down the small coffee table, the shelf full of fake books that was there when the two of you moved in and try to make it as 'officey' as you can. You hear a rattle of noise from upstairs and you figure that Kyle has finally figured out how to remove the shower rod from the wall and was in the process of bringing the curtains downstairs, so you turn to admire your work. It was as clean as you could make it, for now. Maybe if, or when this became a legitimate source of income you could fancy it up more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you do think that your haphazardly cleaned home needs one finishing touch to look legitimate. You retrieve the small iPod speaker stand from the living room (tossing Kyle's underwear behind the couch in the process) and set it up near the back of the sitting room as you dock your phone with it. Since you didn't have your phone on you at the time you fused with the toothbrush it has luckily remained unchanged, so you're able to pretty easily pull up some generic sounding background music. You sigh softly and feel immensely proud of yourself at the job you did in such a short time as you see several cars pull up outside. You make your way out to the hallway and frown as you see the doorway to the kitchen still open, revealing the mess inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle! Our guests are here!\" You try to shout as quietly as possible as you look out the front door, flicking on the porch light as the group of strangers, including the man and woman from earlier gather and inspect your 'business' sign before marching towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a noise from upstairs and you turn to see...</span></div></div>",

Her dress is the same deep blue as your shower curtain with golden trims while a very over-sized shawl hangs off her body, stylized versions of the sun and moon emblazoned upon it. Her arms are covered in several large, cheap looking bracelets and two huge and equally cheap looking hoops hang from her ears. She's older than you as you see the beginnings of crow's feet around her eyes and a few rogue streaks of gray in the slightly damp looking beehive that dominates her figure. The unruly mane is barely held in check by a faded rainbow headband that threatens to shake loos as the stranger begins to bounce down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only takes you a second to realize what has happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle, like, omg what the hell are you doing!?\" You hiss as loudly as you can, stealing a look out the door's window to see the crowd of potential clients begin to make their way towards your front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude! I thought that maybe we could make some more cash! I could read their futures and tell their horoscopes with those old Tarot cards I bought last year! That's part of the holistic experience, right?\" Kyle says in his nasally voice that seems just a little too high pitched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see the group of people getting closer as your minty and fresh brain begins to panic. \"That's totally not how any of this, like, works!

You give his retreating backside one more glare and you notice that this new body of his apparently didn't come with shoes. His giant 'hairstyle' disappears around the corner to the upstairs hallway right as the doorbell rings, and pushing aside your annoyed thoughts you take a deep, minty breath and refocus as your chipper mindset slides back into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach out a slender hand and pull open the door, opening your home to the group of people that were there to get their teeth cleaned by the magical powers the fusion with the toothbrush had bestowed upon you. There, at the head of the group, was the woman from the restaurant. \"Hi! Leslie, wasn't it?\" You say, flashing your pearly whites that seem to flash in the low light of the evening, causing one of the other ladies in the group to gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See! I told you, girls!\" Leslie says to the rest of the group, who murmur in agreement. She turns back to you. \"Now I know this is going to sound embarassing, but you didn't give me your name when you gave me your address.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your eyes widen for a moment but your brain kicks in. \"Oh yeah, sorry about that, my boyfriend and I were just in such a rush that I forget to tell you. My adoptive name is Sydney, but my birth name is Fuyuki! Fuyuki Jiu Shen. You can call me either, whatever you, like, prefer! It's nice to meet you again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Adoptive? It /IS/ your name you ditz!' The buzzkill voice at the back of your head mutters as you extend a hand towards Leslie, who gives is a shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now that we know each other, I'd like to introduce you to some of my friends!\" Leslie says, releasing your hand as she begins to point at the women in the group. \"This is Hannah (a short, slightly pudgy girl with glasses wearing a brown ruffled dress), Jackie (a pixie cut slim blonde in a white sleeveless top) , Linda (a fairly normal looking brunette in a green shirt), and Gwen ( who was owning the mature punk rock look with her half-mohawk and black tank top). And Patrick and the boys are back at the cars\" Leslie points a thumb over her shoulder and you follow it, seeing Patrick and three other men standing around the two cars parked behind your old blue clunker and Kyle's white pickup. You catch Patrick's eye and he gives you a little smile and a wave, which you return, wagging your fingers at him and trying to ignore the weird feeling in your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn back to the women. \"Well, now that we're all introduced, are, like, totally ready for the best dental work of your lives?\" You say, to which the women share a look of momentary apprehension before Leslie breaks the tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet! Lead the way! C'mon girls!\" She says with genuine enthusiasm and another huge grin you lead the group into the house. You take a few steps forward and point a welcoming hand towards the sitting room, trying your best to block their view of the kitchen but you fail as you see every single one of them look at the mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, please don't mind the mess. Like, it's just from the earthquake, my boyfriend was gonna fix it before you arrived but he had to run to the store to get some nails! And stuff.\" You say with a giggle that you hope isn't too nervous. The last thing anyone needs is all these strangers finding out about the toolbox, or worse, leaving before you can get paid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But isn't that his truck from the restaurant out front? You guys got into it when you left...\" Leslie says, a trace of suspicion on her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah but he totally took my car!\" You lie and hope it works, a silent sigh of relief running through your mind as the group appears to buy the lie as they head into the sitting room. They take a look around the small chamber and take a seat at the coffee table and you are thankful that you had enough seats to accomodate all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'll need to get more in here later' You think to yourself, and the bitter part of your mind just scoffs. 'What later? You know you have to unfuse when they leave...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girls settle themselves, you take a breath. \"So\" You say, \"Which lucky lady is first? Also this is gonna sound totally weird but I need you girls to smile at me so I can see your teeth, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie raises her hand and stands. \"Well, I brought us all here so I should go first. How do you want me to smile? Like normal or extra toothy?\" She says, which makes her friends chuckle nervously. Clearly they weren't entirely sold on this so you'd have to sell it pretty hard to get them on board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Extra toothy, if you don't mind!\" You say and Leslie's lips part as she gives you a smile that's more scary than heartwarming. With your new superpower you can clearly see some plaque between the teeth, some yellowing. You, strangely, feel compelled to see more. \"Can you open for me now, Leslie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn your command the otherwise stranger opens her mouth and you see a couple of molar caps and at least one cavity that was on the cusp of starting. not to mention the somewhat jagged edges of some of her teeth. All that imperfection made part of your mind reel and the compulsion to kiss her began to override the rest of your patience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Leslie, I've, uh, seen what I need to see. Are you ready?\" You say and before she can really respond, you pull her into your arms, grabbing the back of her head and pushing her lips against yours as she lets loose a muffled cry of surprise. Without a word your tongue slides from your mouth to hers, pushing aside her lips and gliding around her teeth, running over them with your magical saliva and wiping away the imperfections that you had seen. And then just as suddenly as you had started, you were done, releasing Leslie from the kiss and stepping back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow!\" Leslie gasps as you release her. She opens her mouth and begins feeling her teeth with her fingers and tongue. \"Like WOW! It really does work!This is amazing!\" Your pleased customer turns and bares her teeth to her friends, all of which gasp in surprise at how clean and perfectly repaired her teeth are now. And you suddenly realize that you feel a rush of energy flowing through you, making you feel like you did when you first fused! Was that what this body needed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever it was, you needed more of it. You grin and give a little bow. \"I aim to please. Who's next?\" You ask and four different pairs of arms shoot into the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to select the next lucky woman when someone new steps into the sitting room and causes all six of you to shout in surprise!</span></div></div>",

Do you use the same...unique technique?  Do I need to smile for you?\"  Gwen shined her teeth which seemed only slightly yellow but there was a noticeable chip in one of her front teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle didn't even try to hide the excitement in his face.  With a big goofy grin he said, \"Oh yeah, that's right.\"  And he dove right in kissing Gwen.  You stared on in great annoyance.  That should be your tongue in her mouth.  You're saliva and tongue should be working their magic, but now thanks to Kyle you wouldn't only get half the work.  Half the rush.  But you didn't want to cause a scene.  You looked at the ladies who were still waiting and put on a welcoming smile before offering your services to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a few minutes and a few hundred dollars later some very satisfied customers with perfectly white and whole smiles left the house.  They even picked up the make shift sign which had fallen down since it was so shoddily put together.  As soon as they ladies and their men were out of sight your smile disappeared and you turned to Kyle.  \"Like, seriously, what the hell was that?  I was the one who was going to kiss them.  I totally had it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle snorted and brushed you off, \"Come on man, it's no big deal.  We got it done in half the time and we split the money 50/50.  Wait you weren't planning on cutting me out of the payday right?  I'm the one who took you out of dinner and started this whole business.  I deserve half of the money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not about the money!\"  You said tossing your cashing in the air, and you meant it.  Even thought the voice in the back of your head thought you were a little crazy for doing so.  You were so mad Kyle had stolen those kisses from you, those magic moments where you changed a persons mouth and controlled the color and plaque to your will.  You loved the feeling those kisses gave you so much you couldn't get it out of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what's it about then!\"  Kyle said picking up your cash.  He obviously didn't get it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just unfuse yourself.  If you want money you can keep it.  You can set up appointments and be my secretary.  But I do the kissing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Secretary?  Are you serious bro...or is it sis?  Whatever.  I'm not doing what you say.  You can't control who I kiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes I can!\"  You say as you shoved your green tinted clone.  Kyle did not like this.  \"You did not just do that.\"  And Kyle shoved you as well.  The next thing you knew you were screaming as you charged Kyle tackling him into the pitching.  You two tried kicking each other in the balls but once you realized that wasn't working you two started scratching and pulling each other's hair.  Eventually you give Kyle a tittie twister that left him vulnerable and you pinning him down on the kitchen floor with tools strewn about from the tussle.  With Kyle at your mercy you decided what you wanted to do to him.</span></div></div>",

And the longer her stayed like this, the longer he'd keep getting in your way!

That tiny voice in the back of your mind shouts out, but it's barely more than a whisper in the face of your raging emotional storm of anger and jealously. You don't see the hammer or the socket wrench, but you do see the tape measure. It like the Toolbox, was sitting on the kitchen table where you'd left it. If you could just shrink Kyle down you could dump him in a jar of mouth wash and be done with him once and for all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Or maybe just put him on a ledge somewhere before you change the two of you back to normal because this is getting way out of hand?' The voice says, and this time it cuts through your rage induced haze. Yes. Yes of course. That seemed like a much more reasonable course of action than out and out murder of your best friend. You'd just have to hide the tools after and make sure he never pulled a stunt like this again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's not what...oh nevermined' The voice says, growing quieter again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the problem with the plan is that no matter what, you've got to release Kyle from your iron pinch of slightly erotic doom in order to reach the tape measure. And the moment you do, well, you'll just have to be quick, right? You give your roommate's magically created nipple one last turn, as hard as you could manage and Kyle let's loose a scream that sounds more like a moan of pleasure as the twinned body beneath you squirms even more (though you're not quite sure if it's to knock you off anymore).

It was close to 9pm. \"No, we should just wait until like tomorrow. It's too late now. Let's just straighten up and then I'm gonna go to bed.\" You say with a yawn, stretching your slender arms up behind your head. The first day for the business had worn you out, even if you'd only had a handful of customers. There had been all the paperwork you had to fill out to get permission from the city, the online courses you had taken to be certified to work on teeth (even if no one really knew exactly how you and your sister did what you did), and then all the failed networking you had tried to do before today. And then the earthquake that had knocked just ruined your kitchen on opening day. After a full day of waiting by the phone, in the house and spamming refresh on your social media accounts (you had tons of support on your Instagram but most people were the just cross-traffic from Jiu's camgirl pic).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily you'd thrown your inhibitions to the wind and kissed that stranger when you and Jiu had gone out to dinner.

Nothing that would pay the bills of course, but it was slowly growing (thanks in large part to the fact that people on the Internet lapped up hot Asian chicks in tight clothing like a dog and water). You didn't exactly understand what 'ASMR' was, but it was certainly more popular than the handful of massage videos you'd put up. You were almost jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when it hit you, like...well, something bright and hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, sis. What if we made videos for here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiu turned to look at you, confusion on her face. \"What, you mean for the house? Do you want to sell it or something? I don't think Dad would be okay with that...\" She said, mentioning your adoptive father who had actually bought the house for the two of you a couple of years earlier when you had first started college. He was the owner of a big contracting company in the city so he could afford it. Even if you did have to let your adoptive sister Haylee stay with you and smell up the house for a semester before she dropped out and moved back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another reality, the previous version of you would have realized that the toothbrushes you and Kyle had fused with were actually a couple of years older than the two of you, and the fusions had aged both of you up to 24, the same age as Haylee, and already putting the two of you well into college. But that version of you was gone, blasted away with the flash of the toolbox closing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try no to roll your eyes at your sister. You loved her, but she was so dumb sometimes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! You're SUCH a ditz! No, I mean for, like, the business! You can do your weird whispering stuff and we can totally promote this place! I'll even make videos too! My massage and mystical healing videos have a few thousand views! I could do more of those and talk about dental health and stuff!\" Suddenly you find yourself getting really excited again at the possibility of growing your business while doing something really fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! If I'm a ditz then you're a ditz! We have the same, um, DNA!\" She protests, but you can see by the grin that she's intrigued as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone knows the older sister is the smartest!\" You say, sticking your tongue out, getting a raspberry in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I don't think that three minutes beats sharing a womb for...\" Your sister trails off and you take the chance to rib on her some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nine months\" You say with a big shit eating grin and she blushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was gonna say that! You just beat me too it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big meanie\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dumb-dumb!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the moment of catty insults the two of your burst out into giggles again. It was hard for the two of you to stay mad at each other. You then get back to cleaning up the kitchen and finish a short time later with the two of you struggling to set the fallen cabinet upright. With a couple of womanly grunts you get it off the floor and lean it against the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew, I'm all sweaty now\" You say as you wipe the slightest bit of perspiration off your forehead. \"Guess I'm gonna take a shower before bed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, can I record it? People love those sounds for some reasons! But all it makes me kinda need to do is pee\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gross Miss B-O Queen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give her a overly dramatic sigh of disgust and march out of the kitchen and towards the stairs, your sister following behind you. You march up the stairs and each go into your bedrooms that, as far as this version of reality was concerned, was just the same as you'd left it some hours earlier. Jiu's was always a mess, but you tried to keep yours in a better condition. Now, at least. It made you feel more professional now that you were running a business. You look at the bookshelves that were lined with dentistry books, books on oral hygiene, all things you'd needed for college, and then on the other side of your massive fluffy, plushy speckled bed was the bookcase that held all your books on astrology, mystical and holistic healing along with your massage school books. And there, tucked away on the very bottom shelf, was you secret shame book on how to be a better kisser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kick off your low, open topped heels and strip down to your bra and panties, which you remove in short order and toss the clothes into the laundry chute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe this is why her room is always a mess, Jiu's room doesn't have a laundry chute!' You think as you watch your clothes slide silently down to the laundry room below. Satisfied, you mince out of your room and out into the hallway completely naked. You walk past Jiu's room, which is a lot like your own, aside from the mess and the far corner she has turned into her 'recording studio' where her camera and microphone are. You lean against the doorway and stare at your twin who is busy setting up for a recording session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting in the shower, don't flush the downstairs toliet, 'kay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiu looks up at you and gives you a wolf-whistle before putting on the stereotypical 'Asian accent' that she knows you find absolutely annoying. \"You so fine. You look for fucky fucky with other girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, you know I hate that so much. It's, like, insulting to both of us, you know that right? You say as you narrow your almond shaped eyes at her. You could both speak passable Mandarin (badly) but you'd learned it more as a shared interest in your birth heritage rather than actually needing it, since you had both been adopted in China by your mom and dad when you were both still babies. That's why you both went by Fuyuki and Jiu rather than your adoptive names of Sydney and Kylie. But Jiu just stuck her tongue out at you. You flip her the finger and stomp off towards the bathroom, sliding in and locking it behind you. Just in case your sister decided to sneak in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cast a look at the sink, the full counter which hadn't been there in the previous reality and the mountain of cosmetics and feminine beauty products that covered the surface between the two sinks. Your eyes dart across each product, the numerous soaps, creams, brushes and the two toothbrushes (Jiu's was solid blue, while yours was a Redford Hill's 49ner's toothbrush) that say innocently in their stand. Your eyes linger on them for a moment before you shake your head and wander over to the bathtub, turning the water on and eventually getting into the shower wear you wash the day's (minimal) dirt and grime off of you. Had any part of the old Sid remained, you would have found the shower to be incredibly hot and sensual, but you're just Fuyuki now, and it's just another shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finish, dry yourself off and brush your teeth, feeling an unusual connection with your toothbrush but you just shrug it off as 'business jitters' before returning to your room. You stop by Jiu's open door and watch her staring intently into her camera, stroking a microphone while whispering something. You catch her eye and you pretend as theough you're about to blow a giant raspberry to ruin her recording, and she tries her best to keep her face passive before you hurry off suppressing a giggle fit. You slide into your bedroom and pull on your sleepwear; a pair of pink pajamas and a gray tank top before you slide into bed, checking your phone one more time to see if there were any hits for the business on social media.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisappointed but still optimistic, you slide your phone onto the charger and turn off the light, relaxing in the semi-darkness of your bedroom. Tomorrow you'd have Brad fix your shelf, maybe give him a massage and a free cleaning in return...and maybe use him to boost your client list. He did know quite a few people at college after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are peaceful as you slide off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

You run a hand along the hood, feeling the heat from being in the sun all day before you start walking around it. It was small, only a two door with a cramped backseat that was filled with crushed cans, a couple of anomalous articles of clothing and a pile of papers and school text books. The torn leather seats, the flaking steering wheel, the dash in which the most modern thing about it was CD player that had replaced the tape deck. The odometer that was nearing the 200k mark.

You stop for a moment, thinking on how you're going to do this, the logistics of trying to hold the nail in place while using the hammer momentarily puzzling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" You say, and after a moment of experimentation with hand positions, you figure it out. You turn your hand upside down and hold the nail between your middle finger and your thumb. It's awkward, but you have a good enough grip that you should be able to accomplish your task. You get ready to strike yourself, raising the hammer and swinging it down, but pause at the last second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh shit!' You think, your face suddenly paling in fear, 'Is this going to hurt?' You don't know if magical objects changing you and your car would actually hurt or not, but you decide to err on the side of caution.

It's really awesome! This thing can make video out of whatever I wrote in here! See?\" Kyle flips the book around and shows you a video of the two of you, with you still in your original male body, dressed up as pirates at some birthday party when the two of you were little. It's a fairly romanticized adventure, as the book must of taken what was written literally, as you don't recall fighting off vikings and a giant kraken when you were seven years old with nothing more than a small boat and large, boxy swords. But you have to admit, it WAS pretty cool to see that the book could do that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move towards the table and suddenly realized you're getting sucked into Kyle's vortex of 'so dumb he's interesting', and you almost clock yourself in the head with the hammer as you pat your face, snapping you out of the bro-trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cool, Kyle, but I really don't want to test thing out alone. A little help?\" You say, and you strike a very female pose as you stick your hands on your hips. Kyle rolls his eyes and slams the book shut as the past versions of you and your best friend cheer on top of the kraken's corpse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damn, I gotta look at that later' You say, making a mental note to yourself as you turn and head back for the door, Kyle marching along behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So dude, I thought of what I could name the book!\" He says as the two of you exit the house and tromp down the steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" You ask, uninterested as the two of you head for your car. \"I was thinking you'd call it like, a Compu-Book or something\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No man, get this, I'm gonna call it a Netbook!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply stare at him, clearly unimpressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get it?

Your skin was now sagging off of your arms.  You were also not wearing your 49ers shirt anymore, but you now wore an old blue dress that had a number of rips and cuts in it.  Feeling up your face you felt that you definitely had some wrinkles.  And the hairs that hung before your eyes showed your hair had gone from jet black to beginning to grey.  \"Dude!  You look like my grandma!\"  Kyle said amazed as he laughed his butt off at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I <i>cough</i> don't!\"  You said with a much raspier voice.

Kyle was exaggerating about you looking like a grandma, but you certainly looked like an older lady, probably in her late 40s early 50s.  Now that you saw this, you actually started to feel it.  You noticed the aches in your knees that you hadn't noticed yet due to the shock.  You looked down at your hand and saw the green head of the nail that you'd hammered into yourself to make you like this.  Looking down you saw that you had dropped the hammer in all the chaos.

Wishing you had a cane to smack Kyle with you just gave a glare as Kyle got his off-white truck, \"Fine, but you're paying.\"  He had to help you into the passenger seat and the ride wasn't comfortable especially when the road got bumpy.  Feeling a headache coming on, you finally made it to the liquor store.  Kyle handed you all the cash he had on him and helped you out of the vehicle and gave you a thumbs up as you slowly walked into the store.  You grabbed a cart and using it for balance you got through the store without too much pain.  You loaded the basket up with beer and liquor before pushing it to the counter.  You began to empty the basket when the lady behind the counter said, \"Let me help you with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up and saw that a good looking woman who looked about 30 grabbed the scanner.  She was a hot latina brunette with at least C cup breasts and legs that went for days.  You squinted while staring at her breasts and said, \"Thank you...Josefina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem ma'am, but just for the future, it's ok if your son comes in to help you out, you don't have to be 21 to enter the store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My son?!\"  You cough and look at the glass door and groan as you see Kyle practically mashed up against the door watching you complete the purchase.  \"Uh yeah...that boy's a handful.\"  You say deciding not to deny the accusation in case she thought you were buying alcohol for a minor.  You handed Josefina the money and started to push the cart out the door when you felt your back seize up again.  \"Are you ok ma'am?\"  Josefina rushed out from behind the counter to check on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm great, I'll won't feel the back pain when I get home.  I guarantee you that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I see.\"  Josefina said staring at the liquor getting the wrong idea.  Josefina had a look in her eye like she was considering something before saying, \"You know, have you ever thought of doing yoga?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yoga, after I gave birth to my little girl last year I was having back problems myself, I started doing yoga and I was running like a well oiled machine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you were.\"  You said looking the confirmed MILF up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not a cure all, but it helps.  There's a woman's yoga class that I go to that I'd really recommend for you.\"  Josefina reached behind the counter for her purse and pulled out a card for a gym and held it out.  Not wanting to be rude you smiled and took the card, \"Thanks very much,\" and left the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip back to the house went much better than the ride to, because now you had a beer in your hand and in your belly.  Although on one of the bumps you spilt some on yourself leaving a nice brown stain on your blue dress.  All in all downed 3 beers on the ride and it really filled you up.  When you got back Kyle helped you out and started to carry the beer in when you said, \"Hammer.  Now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle blinked a few times as though trying to remember something before saying, \"Oh yeah!\"  And grabbed the hammer and pulled the green nail from the palm of your hand.  In a flash of green you felt your hand on the warm exterior of your glorious old clunker.  \"I'm back to normal!\"  You said as you enjoyed the lack of back pain and bent over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, normal.\"  Kyle said in a drone, you looked up and saw that Kyle was staring at your still female breasts that you'd just given Kyle a good show of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up,\"  You said quickly adjusting your shirt to cover as much of yourself as possible.  Then in a weird moment of sadness you looked at your car that you now felt a weird closeness to after being fused with it.  You ran your hand over the chipped blue paint job, the squeeky door, the big brown stain on the middle of the hood.  You looked at your car for a minute in disbelief.  \"Dude, Kyle.  That wasn't there before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle looked at the brown spot you pointed at, \"It looks like someone took a dump on your car, not that you can really tell the different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, but no dude, that's the freaking beer stain that I just spilt on myself as the old lady!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, that's trippy...now what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a minute.\"  You said as a bunch of dots appeared in your head and you started to try to connect them.  You thought about the beer, the back pain, the car, the stain, the MILF, the yoga gym card.  Everything that had just happened began to connect into some sort of picture in your head as you decided what to do next.</span></div></div>",

I think I've got an amazing idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you be a genius as we drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and made your way inside and after spending over an hour as the fairer sex you grabbed the Sex Change Socket Wrench, and much to Kyle's disappointment you attached it to yourself and turned it until you were your normal male self again.  You opened up a beer and explained your master plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So bro, when we were driving back from the store, I spilled beer on the blue dress I was wearing and when I unfused there was a brown paint spot on the paint job of my car.  You follow?\"  You said explaining slowly so hopefully even Kyle could understand.  He nodded in agreement.  \"Well, if when I fused with my car my body became messed and broken, but what if I made myself less messed up and broken.  I think that if I made old and hurt fused me feel less messed up, then when I unfused my car will be better and actually work consistently.  Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think.\"  Kyle said slowly, \"That sounds like it'd work Sid, but how are you going to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With this and that hottie from the liquor store.\"  You said holding up the gym card Josefina gave you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm confused.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but follow me.  I'll have to turn female again but that's not a big deal with that toolbox.  I become the old lady again by making myself a girl and fusing with my car again.  I go to the yoga class Josefina was telling me about.  The old body gets more flexible and hopefully hurts less and so when I unfused my car hopefully I can drive it around without fear of it blowing up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That seems like a lot of crazy work just for a better car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's either that or spend thousands trying to fix it or buy a new car.  All this plan would cost me is time, sweat, and a gym membership.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your dick,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can get it back later no problem.\"  You say and use the Socket Wrench to once again become a woman and man again in a few turns of the wrist.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You cast one last look down at your crotch and say \"Goodbye for now, buddy\" which earns you a suppressed \"snerk\" from Kyle before you crank the wrench back, your body changing once more into your female form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeyy!\" Kyle cheers and hands you another bottle of beer, but you shake your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks. Being a little buzzed might make this a little easier but if I show up wasted there's no way they'll let me into that yoga class\" You say, grabbing the hammer and a nail again as you march outside. The plan was clear in your head; get the old lady body in better shape, get your car back into working order. As Kyle had said it seemed like a lot of work, but right now you were on summer break and the two of you were mainly just cruising off both of your parents for the time being. No work, no school meant you had nothing but time on your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you're going right now?\" Kyle calls out from behind you, the sound of his chair clattering against the tile of the kitchen as he makes his way through the house behind you. You get the distinct feeling that he's staring at your ass, but you're surprisingly starting to get used to it at this point. Maybe it was just plain ignorance or maybe the tools were helping you acclimate somehow, either way you just keep out walking until you're once more outside and feeling the cool evening air on your skin as the sun dipped closer to the horizon. The street is quiet, as usual, and it's almost peaceful...Until Kyle barges noisily through the front door behind you. \"But what about the beer?\" he asks as the two of you approach your car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I'm going right now, and the beer can wait! Maybe if I show up they'll let me in without asking too many questions!\" You say, placing your hand on your car and bracing yourself for the change. You line up the hammer and let it fly downwards, the pain sharp but brief as green light fills your vision. And as the sharp pain recedes, a longer, unending ache replaces it as you once again become fused with your car, brown stain and all. \"Shit\" You mutter, staring down at it. That wasn't going to look too good on the women you wanted to make a good impression on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at least the pain wasn't as bad as it had been the first time you had fused, thanks to the beer. You turn to Kyle, who is standing there with bottle in his hand and a look of amazement on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I still can't believe this is happening, it's so cool!\" He says, taking a swig from the bottle at the most inopportune time possibly as a police cruiser pulls onto the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put that down you idiot!\" You rasp and you swipe at the bottle, pulling it away and hiding it from view as the cruiser rolls past your house. You see the cop inside giving you an odd look, and you wave sheepishly as it rolls slowly past the two of you, continuing down the street, although you notice it's much slower than before. You and Kyle stand there like fools waiting for it to reach the end the street and turn onto another one before you turn, as fast as your current body will allow, back to Kyle, a crooked finger pointed in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We cannot get caught, you get that? The last thing I need is to end up stuck like this because you weren't paying attention!\" You hiss, before you let out another cough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, sorry\" Kyle said as he rolled his eyes before reaching his hand out towards you. At first you think he wants his beer back, and you make to hand it back to him, but he shakes his head. \"No, bro, give me the hammer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink in confusion. \"Why do you want the hammer?\" You ask. Surely he didn't mean to unfuse you already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I can go with you, duh!\" Kyle says, pulling a nail of his own out of his back pocket. \"I want in on this! Give me the hammer and I'll go fuse with my car!\" Your friend points down the street to where his own vehicle was parked. It was an off-white, shortbed truck. It was a few years old, but it was all in all in good condition. Kyle had gotten it as a graduation gift from his grandfather, who typically ran through cars every fifty thousand miles or so and liked to brag about them to the other old men at the retirement resort he and Kyle's grandmother lived at. It had proved useful for when you and Kyle had moved into your house a couple of months earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, your truck is fine. You don't need to go to yoga. Why would you even want too?\" You shake your head at Kyle, out of pity for how dumb he was and out of shame for how you ended up with him as a best friend. At this point you almost felt like a dog would be more intelligent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three reasons, bro. One, free tune up for my truck. Two, it's gonna be filled with hot chicks like that cashier lady, and three, because you never let me do anything fun\" Kyle grins, as if his logic was completely unassailable. You start to throw it back in his face but you pause for a moment and rub your eyes. Everything was getting blurrier as it got darker, and honestly it felt like more effort than it was worth to stand here and try to convince him otherwise. And, really, you were a guy in a girl's body currently transformed into old lady by fusing with your car in some crazy eyed scheme to somehow skirt a repair bill. All because of some magic tools that you'd come across by chance. You were so far beyond logic and reason that you simply shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, whatever. But first you gotta do two things\" You say, and Kyle's grin falters a bit before it turns into a look of horror as his mind instantly goes to the gutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that you dolt!\" You yell and once more wish for a can to whack him with. \"I need some yoga clothes, and since I am my car, you need to drive\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Okay!\" Kyle let's loose an enormous sigh of relief, \"But you're still gonna let me come, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you can come. But you gotta be a girl. This is a women's only yoga club and you've gotta be a chick to get in. So go get the wrench and turn into a girl. I'll go wait by your truck\" You turn and start hobbling towards Kyle's truck, rolling your eyes as you hear him hiss \"YES!\" to himself before he charges back up the walk and into the house. You suddenly feel slightly vulnerable, an old lady out on the street alone, but you're in a pretty decent part of town despite the police cruiser from earlier suggesting otherwise. You realize you still have Kyle's beer in one hand and despite not wanting any of his backwash, you take a few swigs of it and smile as the buzz helps ease your aching joints. You reach Kyle's truck and lean against it for support, trying not to talk yourself out of your own idea when you hear the front door crash open once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready!\" Comes a decidedly female voice, and though all you can see is a blurry figure running up to you, you can tell by the way it moves that it's a girl. Then suddenly Kyle pops into focus and you can see just how different he, or rather she, looks. It was clear that Kyle had used the wrench a bit more than you had, as small mountains rise out of his chest and a flowing mane of black hair cascades down his back. His face is pretty, he almost looks like a fusion of Kate Mara and Amber Heard, if you had to compare him to anyone. He's actually a bit of a knockout, though he doesn't seem to realize it as he hurtles around the front of the truck and hops in the driver's seat. You join him as quickly as you can, and immediately buckle up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd already risked death once by letting Kyle drive today. No since tempting fate more than it had already been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slam of the doors and a girlish squeal of excitement from Kyle, the two of you were off into the evening, headed for the shopping complex nearby.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You grunt and groan in pain as Kyle speeds through traffic, cutting off other cars with last minute lane changes as he tries to beat every red light. It was different from going to the grocery store right outside your relatively low traffic neighborhood, but here in the more bustling part of the city Kyle's reckless, aggressive driving surfaced. You clench your eyes closed as you simply don't want to see your inevitable doom. There's a sharp turn and a screech of rubber skidding across pavement as the truck feels dangerously close to tipping from the high speed manuever before suddenly, despite the seat belt , you're thrown forward into the truck's dash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, fucking stop!\" You cry out as your frail body throbs in pain from the impact.. You gasp in pain and open your eyes to see that the two of you are inches from the bumper of a small sedan that was patiently waiting patiently for a parking spot near the front of one of the stores in the shopping center. \"Dude!\" You cry out, and Kyle just grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you want to get to the yoga thing before it gets over, right? Gotta be quick, broski!\" Is all he says, giving you a very smug look with his female face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm just so thankful for your thoughtfulness\"  You grumble as you rub your forearms. You can already see a slight bruise forming on the underside of your left arm from the impact. You had to wonder what the effect would be on your car once you unfused. The sedan in front of you finally slides into the parking space it was waiting for, and as you roll by you look into the car's interior, locking eyes with two small, terrified looking children, a blonde woman with a hateful look on her face and a very angry, thick necked man who simply yells \"Get off the road you crazy bitches!\" as you roll past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle, in response, casually sticks a slender arm out the window and sticks a single finger in the air as you accelerate past the now parked sedan at way too fast a speed. You cruise down the frontage road in front of the collection of businesses, passing a hunting store, a cafe, a pizza eatery and a vape shop before you reach the shared parking lot of the three big franchise stores. Here, Great Buy, Bulls-Eye and Richard's Sports Authority dominant the shopping center and serve as the central conflux for most of the traffic in the general area. You wince as Kyle goes over one of the speed bumps without slowing down before sliding cutting off an approaching vehicle heading for the parking space that had just opened up near the entrance to the sports store. You hear the driver of the other car give an angry honk as they cruise past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to stare at Kyle, who puts the truck into park and removes the keys from the ignition. \"You know, you don't have to piss off every other driver on the road!\" You crane your neck and look out over the parking lot. You can't see very far with your older eyes but you can tell there were several parking spaces close by that your friend could have parked in without being an asshole, or in this case a bitch, about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I got my driver's license from the school of Talladega Nights\" Kyle says as he undoes the seat belt clip as you do the same. You sigh in disgust as you know what's coming. \"And that means I know that if I'm not first, I'm last!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish to hell I had never rented that movie\" You mutter as you slowly make your way out of the truck, \"I think it actually made you WORSE\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, 'mom'\" Kyle says as he waits for you to make your way around the truck to him, \"But look, I got us a perfect spot bro. You can't walk that great, so now you don't have to walk very far!\" Kyle points at the admittingly short distance from the truck to the car, and as you feel bone grinding on bone in your hips, you do feel a little bit of relief. But the last thing you need to do is encourage Kyle's behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just get this over with\" You sigh and creakily make your way across the road, Kyle suddenly taking you by the arm and helping you along at a slightly faster pace as the blurry lights to your left suddenly snap into focus as the silhouette of a waiting car. 'Shit' you mutter to yourself, once again realizing just how worn down your current form is. With Kyle's help you find yourself on the sidewalk in front of the door, and then you find yourself inside, the cool air conditioning feeling almost too cold, and you fold your wrinkled arms tight as you shuffle forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, wait\" Kyle says, and he disappears into the blur for a moment before returning with something large. As he snaps back into focus you realize he's got a motorized shopping cart, and while you do feel embarassed, you mutter a quiet \"thanks\" as you slide yourself down into the seat. After a few moments of awkward testing of the controls, you get the hang of things and in short order the two of you are cruising down the main aisle, Kyle in the lead as you follow closely behind, relying on Kyle's younger eyes to find the right part of the store. Eventually you slow to a stop next to a rack of sporty looking women's clothes, and the two of you stand there for a moment staring at them and exchanging puzzled looks with one another as you don't really know what to do next. It was one thing to shop for clothes as a dude, but as a buxom chick and a old lady? Suddenly your plan seemed to get much more complicated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully though, after a few moments of awkward indecision, a store associate pops up from seemingly nowhere. She's slightly older than your actual age with curly brown hair and an athletic build, which you expected for a sports store. A name tag that reads \"Hello! my name is [<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">J E S S I C A</span>] dangles off the left breast of her green polo shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, welcome to Richard's! Is there anything I can help you two ladies with?\" She says with a voice that is way too chipper. You open your mouth to speak but Kyle leaps in first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah. We, uh, need some clothes. Yoga clothes. Me and my mom need yoga clothes\" He stutters out and you can see he's taken with the girl. Kyle always did have a thing for fit chicks. You try not to groan as he once again refers to you as his 'mom'. The store associate nods and gives you a soft smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's right over here, please follow me!\" She says, and you follow her as she walks at a brisk pace down a couple of aisles to several racks filled with thin looking pants as you and Kyle hustle to keep up with her. You're once again glad that Kyle used his brain and got you the motorized cart, this would be a long, painful process without it. \"These should be what you're looking for!\" Jessica says, holding an arm out to the rack that seems to be made out of fabric. Your eyes almost hurt from looking at all the different colors of yoga pants, such was the amount of variety to choose from. You and Kyle reach out and feel the pants, the material soft and not unlike sweat pants, not at all what you were clearly expecting. You had reached for a pair of gray leggings while Kyle went for the brightest and most attention grabbing pair of pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of silent investingation, you see Kyle frown as he lets go of the pair bright green pants he was holding and turns to the associate, \"Uh, these aren't latex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spandex\" You grunt out before you see the weird look on the associate's face, \"Uh, you mean spandex, dear\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, actually...\" Jessica says, taking a pair of green leggings from the rack and flipping over the tag, \"Most yoga pants now are made from a synthetic cotton blend. It's more flexible and breathes better. We actually don't have many spandex products in store anymore. They were more of an 80s and 90s thing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\" You and Kyle say at the same time. This was so weird, you were guys, you knew nothing about clothes other than if they looked cool and if they fit right. Actually shopping was so far outside your collective comfort zones. After a moment of staring at the rack you look up at Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you, uh, this will be alright? Kylie?\" You ask, and try not to break character as Kyle just stares back at you with wide, brown eyes and shrugs. You sigh and grab two pairs of the gray leggings and toss them in the small basket at the front of your shopping scooter, but Jessica stops you front pulling away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, ma'am? Did you check the sizes? If you buy too small they might squeeze hard. I don't want you to accidentally hurt yourself. What are your measurements? I'd be more than happy to find the right size for both of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stare up at Jessica, your mind blanking for a response. You don't know your measurements! And you're sure as hell Kyle doesn't know his. The look of confusion and approaching panic on both of your faces must have been apparent as Jessica's smile fades from cheeriness to soft concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay! I can help with that!\" She says, and points towards the nearby changing rooms. \"If you would just like to go in there, I can get your measurements and I'll find both of you a great set of yoga clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, all right\" You mutter and ease your scooter towards the door of the changing rooms, Jessica and Kyle falling in behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approach the door, over the electric buzz of your scooter you can hear Jessica softly say \"It's really great that you're helping out your mom, she looks like she's had a rough life\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah. She's had a few, uh, rough years. I just, uh, want to help her feel better. It's why I'm taking her to yoga classes. Sometimes you just need to try something...holistic? Instead of pills\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's so true! It really helped me and my mom bond after she got sick. It's just a shame that most of our generation don't care enough to do stuff like this for their parents...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Christ' You think to yourself as you park your scooter and let Kyle and Jessica help you up and into the changing room, 'Is this what being old is like?' You can't help but feel a newfound respect for your parents and grandparents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you find yourself...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You reach the changing rooms and Kyle practically leaps to your side, helping you up out of the motorized shopping cart before you really know what's going on. You wince in pain as your broken down body creaks and groans from the movement and from being in the scooter, but after a moment you find your balance and you glare at Kyle for a moment before you remember to stay in character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, uh, honey\" You mutter, casting a look at Jessica who is simply standing there with a look of concern on her face, but you can see the twinkle in her eye that she's touched by the care and concern of your 'daughter'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it, mom!\" Kyle says, a enormous goofy smile on his face as he helps you hobble towards the dressing room entrance. Before you know it you're standing in one of the small stalls as Jessica zooms behind you and places a small 'Do Not Enter' sign near the entrance of the collection of tiny rooms before turning to both of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, who would like to go first?\" She asks with a grin, and you and Kyle stare at each other for a moment before you sigh and nod to the store employee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go\" You say, and for a moment you see a look of disappointment flash across Jessica's face before the outrageously perky look on her face returns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" She says, and points to the stall next to yours, \"Miss, if you'd like to wait in there while I help your mom, I'll be with you in just a moment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, sure. Okay\" Kyle says and, giving you one last look, minces into the stall and closes the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay ma'am, if you'd just like to take your dress off for me so I can check your cup and waist size?\" Jessica asks as she enters your stall and closes the door behind her. YOu can her a shuffle from the other side of the wall and you know Kyle is eavesdropping. You half expect to see his pretty little head pop over the top of the stall's wall and stare at the two of you, but he never does. And you have more pressing issues, while you've now been a female for almost five hours you still hadn't actually checked yourself out, even when you were in your young female body. You shudder to think of what you might look like beneath the dress, given the numerous rust spots and broken upholstery of your car's interior. But there was no choice, you had long committed to this crazy hare-brained scheme and you had to see it through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod, you raise your hands and freeze for a moment, not really knowing how to remove yourself from the dress. Do you slide the straps off and let it fall or what? After a few seconds of thought you simply decide to remove the dress like you would a shirt, and pull it up over your head, getting a gasp of surprise from Jessica. And then there you are, a skinny, hunched over woman in a threadbare white bra that cupped your meager breasts and a pair of matching panties that left little to the imagination. In the wall mirror you can see your body is dotted with pre-mature liver spots and moles, as well as a few splotches of off color skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look terrible, and you try not to blush in embarassment at the look of pity on Jessica's face before she  moves to your back and begins measuring you with a tape measure that she had pulled out of one of her uniform's pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\" She says for a moment, before pulling at your bra strap for a moment. After a moment she releases it and says \"Well ma'am, I have your measurements! After I take your daughter's I'll go get you a nice set of yoga clothes! Now if you'll excuse me...\" And she's gone without really wanting for a response, practically leaping out of the stall and into Kyle's before you can't even think of a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright miss, I've got your mother's numbers, are you ready for me to take yours?\" You hear Jessica's voice ask from the other side of the wall, and you can hear Kyle give a amused, unladylike snort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, sure!\" It's 555-8675-309!\" Kyle's voice sings out and you facepalm. He just gave this random girl his actual cell phone number!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh my god Kyle what are you doing!?' you think to yourself, preparing for the alarmed response from Jessica, but instead you just hear a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I meant, um, your OTHER numbers\" Jessica says, and you can hear the playfulness in her voice. You can't believe it, Kyle had been a woman for all of forty minutes and already he was picking up a chick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oohh...Yeah, but there's something I gotta tell you...\" Kyle says from beyond the wall, and you can feel the blood drain from your face. He wouldn't actually tell this girl about the tools, would he!? You open your mouth to warn him away, but you hear a girlish gasp come from the other stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Oh, miss!\" Jessica's voice says, \"I didn't know you weren't wearing a bra!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What.' Is all you can think before you realize that until you had fused with your car, your younger female body hadn't been wearing any female clothes, bra and panties included, either. The socket wrench that changed your genders clearly didn't adjust your clothes. With this realization, you suddenly want to peak over the top of the stall yourself, but you know that your current body wouldn't never be able to do that. You begin to slide the dress back on when you hear Jessica continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I like to go, uh, all natural. The whole holistic thing, y'know\" Kyle says, and you've known your friend long enough to be able to tell when he's playing at being Casanova. You roll your eyes. The idiot doesn't even know what holistic means!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I, um. Okay\" Jessica says, and you can hear her pull out her tape measure and, with not a insignificant amount of girlish giggling later, Jessica gives Kyle the same quick little spiel and darts out of the dressing room. A few seconds later you pop out of the stall and make your way to Kyle's, swinging it open and catching sight of the two huge pendulums on his chest, hanging free as he models himself in the mirror, turning to look at you with a look of surprise that quickly changes to another dumb grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude! I, I think I've seen this porno!\" Is all he can say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes, but can't help but nod in agreement. Part of you says you should hobble back to your stall, but another part can't help but stare at Kyle's tits. It had been a while since you had seen boobs that perfect, and you were transfixed by them as Kyle played with them; squishing them together, jiggling them, making them bounce with a couple short hops. It was entrancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd before you know it, Jessica has returned with an armful of stretchy looking clothes and you realize a moment too late that you had been standing there with the stall door open for all to see. She doesn't move for a moment, but then she apparently remembers that she's still an employee and hastily pushes you into the stall and closes the door behind her. It's a tight fit with all three of you in there, and you realize you'll never get anything accomplished if you jst stand there and stare at Kyle's tits all night, so you give him a little nudge with your elbow, causing him to jerk sideways and give you an accusing look, only realizing a few seconds later as you motion to his shirt with your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Um, sorry about that!\" Is all he mumbles before he tosses his shirt back on and you try not to get clobbered by his flailing arms. After a moment he's covered again and the three of you seem to snap out of the full trance. Jessica recovers first and, as best as she can, puts the handful of selected outfits on the floor, rising up with a black and blue pair of pants and a sports bra and holding them up against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, ma'am! I tried to find the pair that matched your dress, and this was the only color available in your size!\" She says almost apologetically before shoving the clothes in your hands as if to say 'it's your problem now' before she turns to Kyle and begins rattling off a list of different female clothing related stats and a variety of outfits that range from gray and pink to pure pink on pink. You eventually drift off and wander out of the stall, taking your blue yoga outfit and waiting in the motorized scooter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't really know how long you wait, but eventually, after a ton of disguised flirting, Jessica and Kyle mince out of the dressing room, Kyle holding a pair of pink and black yoga clothes while Jessica carries the rest to a Returns basket and drops them in unceremoniously. The next thing you realize you're both standing at the checkout lane, with Jessica relieving another co-worker so she can personally take your cash. The scanner beeps four times and the total amount of $87.67 pops up on the display screen, waiting for you to put your card in. With a sigh you reach towards your pocket and...feel nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh shit!' You swear inside your head as you realize that you didn't bring your wallet with you! And the fusion didn't give you a purse or anything like that, so how are you going to pay? You turn to Kyle, who stares at you for a moment before he picks up on the frantic eye motions towards the card reader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. OH! Uh, yeah here you go, uh, mom\" He says as he quickly pulls his wallet out and hands it to you. \"I forgot I was, uh, carrying it so it wouldn't hurt your back\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you 'sweetie'\" You say and try not to sound angry. You flip open the billfold and do your best to hide Kyle's driver's license from view, sliding out the first card you can grab with your aching fingers. You slide it through the card reader and Jessica's smile suddenly turns into a small frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take you long to realize why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael Eubanks? Who is that?\" Jessica asks, and your blood freezes. You used the emergency credit card Kyle's dad had given him. It was his name on the card. And outside of that, the man was known to be a hardass about it being used. You look at Kyle, who is trying very hard not to freak out. It's all on you to come up with the story.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Michael Eubanks?  I mean, there is a perfectly totally normal and reasonable reason for why that name is on the credit card...haha...there totally is...heheh...right mom?\"  Kyle had a hysterical look on his face as he tried to rattle his brain to come up with a reason why 'Kylie' would have Kyle's dad's credit card.  Jessica was looking more and more skeptical, it could have been your imagination but you thought you could see Jessica eyeing the security guard outside of the store.  It was obvious that Kyle wasn't getting you two out of this, so it was up to you.  But how were you going to come up with an excuse of having Kyle's dad's card.  But then it hit you, you think you remember from a movie that the best lies had some truth in them so why not go with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't go acting crazy around the nice young lady Kylie.  Don't mind her Jessica, Kylie just get's a little odd when you talk about her father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica raised an eyebrow as she now looked at you, \"So Mr. Eubanks is your husband than?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou coughed as you choked on the air a little, you probably should have realized she'd make that leap in logic.  Keeping your old voice as steady as you could you said, \"Why yes...he's my hubby all right.\"  And then in a stroke of inspiration you looked down at your hand and saw the emerald green nail poking out of it close to the base of your ring finger coincidentally.  You quickly flashed your hand showing off your 'wedding ring' for a moment before hiding it again.  Thankfully this seemed to work, Jessica suddenly looked less sceptical and ran the card through he machine.  \"Sign here please.\"  She said offering you the receipt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew you shouldn't sign it so you said, \"Why don't you sign it 'Kylie', you know I have a hard time signing things with my...arthritis.\"  You said it as a lie, but a pain in your hand made you think you might actually have arthritis with this body.  You could not wait to get the hammer and unfuse yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...sure thing mom.\"  And he signed the piece of paper.  Thankfully his signature was so sloppy Jessica wouldn't be able to tell he'd signed 'Kyle' instead of 'Kylie'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so with bags of new yoga clothes, you and Kyle managed to leave the store without getting yourselves arrested, a small victory but a victory nevertheless.  As you made your way to the parking lot with your knees howling in pain along the way Kyle squealed a very girlish squeal.  \"I can't believe it, we did it!  We got the clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...we managed to successfully go shopping.  Now let's go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we just got the clothes, I thought you wanted to do yoga to make your body and car better.  Let's just go do that now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head, \"I am way too exhausted to do even that.  I now understand why my grandparents used to only go outside once a day if that much.  I feel completely drained.  We'll do the yoga some other time and that's hopefully be the only thing I do with this body.  Although before then I might wash my car, get the oil and tire pressure checked and a bunch of other stuff done to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But wait, I thought you were doing the whole old lady yoga stuff so you <i>wouldn't</i> have to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ideally yeah, but I've got to do something to make this body usable.\"  Kyle still looked confused so you said, \"Let me put it like this, on the suckitude scale of 1-10 this body is like a  12.  But maybe if I do some basic things to take care of my car it might bring it down to like a 7, and hopefully if I can do the yoga stuff I can make it a 1 and my car will be in great shape.  Does that make sense.\"  You said going though your kind of convoluted logic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, but so long as I still get to see hot girls in yoga outfits I'm cool with your weird plans Sid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle managed to get you two home without any more problems, although when you got back you were annoyed to see Kyle rush back in the house without even helping you out of the truck.  You slowly shuffled your way back into the house and into the kitchen where Kyle was hunkered over the toolbox probably looking for the Gender Switch Socket Wrench to turn himself back.  \"Hey, grab me the hammer so I can turn back ASAP.\"  You said.  Kyle didn't even acknowledge you as he continued to search the box when all of the sudden Kyle's phone began to ring.</span></div></div>",

You looked down at it and squinted until the name on the caller id became clear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Dad</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you've got to answer it,\"  You said, \"It'll just be worst if you put it off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm a girl right now dude, I can't!\"  Kyle said actually having a good reason.  \"Then turn yourself back,\"  You said grabbing the Gender Switch Socket Wrench from the table and moved towards him pointing the tool at him in one hand and taking up the still ringing phone in the other.  Kyle actually began to back off as though you were pointing a gun at him.  \"Oh man up,\"  You say in annoyance finally backing Kyle up against the counter, you shoved the phone into his chest almost dropping the phone between his boobs and then you attatched the Wrench to his crotch which magically attached like a magnet and gave it a few turns.  Within seconds Kylie was Kyle again and you popped off the socket wrench and began to attach it to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your old saggy breasts turned into old saggy pecs you heard Kyle meekly say into the phone, \"Hey dad.\"  Those were the only two words Kyle got to say before you could hear a tirade of anger from the other end of the phone.  Kyle pulled the phone from his head like it was on fire and you could make out a few things like 'what were you thinking' and 'that card is for emergency's only' and 'what did you even spend 100 dollars on at a women's clothing store?'  Kyle continued to look at the phone in horror as you whispered to him with a low and raspy voice, \"Dude, just lie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour words seemed to snap Kyle out of shock and he nodded, he gingerly put the phone back to his ear and said, \"But dad it was an emergency I had to...get clothes for...my girlfriend...and her mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could have sworn you heard something that sounded like a disbelieving laugh coming from the other end of the phone, Kyle continued, \"I'm not lying!  Sid and me were just here working on house repairs when my totally real girlfriend and her totally real mom came over and asked for help and...NO!  You don't have to do that!  It's totally cool dad bro!  But...yeah...ok...later...\"  And then he blushed a little and whispered so you might not be able to hear him tell his dad, \"Love you too.\"  And he ended the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou picked up the hammer to get ready head to the garage to unfuse yourself and your car so you could get your youth and body back.  \"So, how bad did it go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not disowned so it could have been worse.  But my dad is insisting he comes by next week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not so bad, your dad's strict and stuff but you can take a few hours to hang with him.  Maybe he'll get us some beers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle shook his head, \"No dude, you don't get it, my dad's coming here for a reason.\"</span></div></div>",

You're just about to pull with suddenly Kyle races over and grabs the hammer out of your hand, easily overpowering your broken down body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL!?\" You roar in your raspy old man voice as Kyle retreats away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you can't turn back in here! What if, like, the car just comes back and wrecks the house?\" Kyle says, pointing at you and then making an explosion sound. It takes you a few seconds to realize that he's right. You can't un-fuse here, you'll have to go back outside to the street!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, fine\" You say and you hobble towards the door, trying not to let the throbbing pain in your feet get to you, \"Bring the damn hammer and let's get this over with\" You growl back towards Kyle, who just falls in step behind you. After a few minutes longer than it should have taken and ignoring Kyle as he babbled about something, you're standing on the sidewalk next to your usual parking space, lit by the orange glow of the streetlight a few feet down the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me the thing\" You say, holding out a leathery hands, into which Kyle deposits the hammer with more force than he should have. You try not to call him a shithead as you wince from the stinging new pain in your hand as you quickly flip the hammer over, press the claw head against the nail head in your skin, and pull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash of green light, youth and vigor fills your body once more as the rusty bulk of your car re-appears right where you had started the adventure, and you do a powerful leap into the air as strength returns to your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit dude! You CANNOT believe how good this feels!\" You tell Kyle as you bend and stretch without any pain. After a few moments of enjoying being young and healthy again, you give your car a soft pat on the hood. You felt a new kinship with your rusty steed, and you made a silent promise that you'd make good on your plans to give it a little TLC before going off on your hair-brained scheme to fix it via yoga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you done?\" Kyle says, and you turn to see him with that look on his face he typically gets when he's pissed off about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Yeah I'm done.\" You say, sliding the hammer into your front pocket for safe-keeping. You lean against your car and cross your hands, silently delighting in the fact that you're not squishing boobs together while doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you not hear me? Dad is coming over tomorrow! He, like, freaked out when I told him about the shelf and the earthquake so now he's bringing one of his crews over and they're gonna look over the entire house!\" Kyle said, pointing dramatically back out your domicile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug. \"So? I'd call that a win. Free home improvement and it doesn't cost us a nickle!\" Kyle's dad owned a contracting company, it was part of the reason Kyle and his sister Haylee were airheaded and clueless, and part of the reason you two could afford a house in the first place. \"They come in, fix the cabinet and whatever else we want them to fix and we blame it on the earthquake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Sid, you don't get it.

You knew that Kyle's dad, Mr. Eubanks was a bit of an asshole, but kicking you out because of something that wasn't even your fault? That was a entirely new layer of bullshit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you it was bad!\" Kyle whines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but...I mean he lives on the other side of town! He knows there was an earthquake! How can he just fucking sit there and blame us!\" You say, pointing the hammer at Kyle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, you know that, like, the only reason we got this place was because of my mom, right? She talked him into it! And she and my aunt Linda are up in Oregon visiting my grandma right now so there's no one to block for us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...What about my parents?\" You say, despite knowing they won't help. They made it very clear that if you were going live on your own, after college started you were expected to get a job and start paying your share of the rent. They were just giving you the summer to 'be a kid' so long as you didn't ruin the house. And if Kyle's dad showed them what had happened and blamed it on you instead of the earthquake, you'd find yourself back home on the other side of town. And that was entirely unacceptable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, we're fucked!\" Kyle said, looking at the ground in defeat. You join him in his downward gaze, only to see the head of the hammer poking out from your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait\" You say, an idea forming in your head. You walk towards the house, grabbing Kyle by the collar and dragging him behind you despite his sputtering protests, and before the two of you know it you're in the kitchen, staring at the toolbox, sitting inconspicously on the kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, we have magic tool! If anyone can find a way out of this mess, it's us!\" You say triumphantly and you see a flash of excitement light up in Kyle's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. YEAH!\" He says as you put the hammer and the handful of other tools back into the toolbox, \"But first make me the right size again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" You say, and suddenly you remember the original incident that started everything. The surprise shrinking, your botched attempt at making Kyle big again, the testing and eventual fusion adventure that had ensued. You had forgotten that you'd left Kyle several inches shorter than he'd been before everything had happened. But you don't remember quick enough as your body continued to close the lid of the toolbox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a bright flash of green light that came from the seam between the toolbox's lid and body, and for a moment you thought something terrible was going to happen as you suddenly couldn't see anything, but as quickly as the light had appeared, it had faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said we should probably drink all the beer we bought first, bro!\" Your roommate said as he hustled to the fridge and began pulling out the somewhat impressive collection of alcohol that you'd bought at the store a couple hours ago, seemingly oblivious to the fact that he was still a flat 5ft even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle, don't you want to be your normal size again?\" You ask, suddenly worried about your friend. Sure, he might have been a blockhead but not even he would forget something like that in the span of two seconds, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Dude, this IS my normal size! You wouldn't let me be bigger because everyone would freak out the next time they saw me, remember? And now that my dad is coming over we need to make this place look as normal as possible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't remember! Somehow closing the lid to the toolbox had changed his memories, apparently everyone's memories but your own to where this new size was how he had always been! Almost as if the problem had been...fixed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let go of the toolbox with a start and back away a few steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" You say, and Kyle just fixes you with an odd look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, we've been messing with that all day and you're just now getting freaked out by it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, dude, it changed reality! Like when I closed the lid, you were wanting to be back to your normal size, which is 5'9! But now you think you've always been 5ft tall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what?\" Is all Kyle says as he takes his hand and tries to guess how tall that would have actually made him, \"But, bro, I've always been the short one and you've been the tall one! That's sort of our thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No dude, this morning? Same height!\" You say, even though it wasn't entirely true. Kyle had actually been two inches taller than you at 6'1 but if you were the only one who remembered...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Kyle said, grabbing two of the beers off the counter and bringing one over to you, \"Dude, that's crazy! Make me tall then! I won't have to ask to get stuff out of the cabinets now!\" He says and you actually feel a little bad about what had happened to your friend. You open the toolbox again, expecting some kind of similar lightshow, but it just opens like a normal toolbox. You grab the tape measure and, now knowing what you're doing, you stretch it up to 5'9. And Kyle's smaller form swells as it grows several inches in a heartbeat until he was now his 'normal' height of 5'9.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap! Everything looks smaller!\" Kyle squeals in glee. The first thing he does is march over and grab a box of ceral out of the cabinet, and you see his face just light up. \"So awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou toss the tape measure back into the toolbox and close the lid, once again eliciting a flash of green light that drowns out everything else for less than a second. You look back at Kyle, who was still standing by the counter, box of cereal in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want some cereal too, Sid?\" Kyle said, and you shake your head. Your friend shrugs and quickly goes about fixing himself a bowl of cereal to go with his beer, and you feel your own stomach growl. But once again you're utterly amazed at the power of the toolbox. Kyle thought everything was normal again! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh god' You say as you suddenly realize how wrong things could have gone. If you had stayed as an old lady, if Kyle had stayed a girl and the toolbox had been closed...What would have happened? Would you have forgotten who you were? Your memories of Kyle weren't changed, so maybe it had to do with who was touching the toolbox when it closed? The idea of being stuck as an old lady, especially if you couldn't remember who you were, sent a very cold shiver down your back and you suddenly felt the need to sit down. Kyle joins you after a few moments, bowl of cereal in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's your plan to keep my dad from kicking us out, Sid?\" Kyle asks, slurping down a spoonful of tiny O shaped cereal bits. You blink before your own brain lurches into motion again. That was right, Kyle's dad was coming over to fix the house and kick you out! But now with the toolbox, knowing what it could do...You could save both of your hides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" you say slowly, as your original plan starts to form again, \"We need to use the tools and...\"</span></div></div>",

How is that supposed to do anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ugh this idiot' You mutter in your mind before taking a breath, \"This toolbox can change reality when you close the lid! You didn't remember being small, or the fact that I literally just made you big again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What-\" Kyle starts as his eyes go wide, but you don't let yourself get caught in a recursive loop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, it happened. But yeah dude, if we change ourselves with the toolbox and then close it, everyone remembers us being changed! So if we change ourselves into people your dad respects, we can close the toolbox and make it seem like we've always been like that, see? Then we can tell him to not kick us out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Is all Kyle says as his brain struggles to process the information. \"I don't...Sid, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UGH!\" You say and lacking any other way to prove it to your friend, you open the toolbox, take out the gender changing socket wrench, and in a moment of inspiration, retrieve your cellphone and take a picture of yourself, putting the cellphone into the toolbox. You give the socket wrench a few quick turns until you're once again a woman, put the socket wrench back into the toolbox and, making sure your cellphone is secured, close the lid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sid, why are you-\" Is all Kyle says before the flash of light silences him and blinds you. When it fades, Kyle is no longer sitting across from you, but now he's rubbing your shoulders! \"Don't worry about my dad, babe! He'll come around, I mean if we have to we can just stay at your house, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder at the implications are with that statement and despite it feeling pretty decent, you shrug off his hands, fish your cellphone out of the toolbox and swipe it over to your pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!\" You shout in glee. Your idea was right! There was the male version of you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, who is that Sydney?\" Kyle says from behind you, and you can feel the jealousy in his voice. You quickly swipe the video into recording mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle, this is Sidney. I just closed the toolbox to show you how it changes things. In this reality, I'm a girl!\" You pan the camera up so that Kyle's very confused face comes into view, \"This is you from this reality! See, you're in a entirely different place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babe, I-\" Is all that gets onto the recording before you lay the phone down and re-male yourself, much to the shock of this version of Kyle, and you slam the toolbox closed. One flash of green light later, Kyle had once again returned to his spot in front of you, with his bowl of cereal, looking confused as ever. You quickly pull your cellphone out, still recording, and show him the evidence, you as a guy, you as a girl, the different version of him, and the flash of green light and static as you closed the lid on your phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUDE!\" Kyle yells, jumping up from his seat, nearly spilling his bowl of cereal everywhere, \"HOLY SHIT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I KNOW RIGHT!?\" You yell back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you actually WERE my girlfriend! That was awesome! Do it again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink and just lower your head to the table. An all powerful, reality warping toolbox, and still the only thing he could focus on was that female you was his girlfriend. \"I'm not your girlfriend!\" You mutter before popping back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! No. We need to focus on keeping the house! Here's my plan, we use this toolbox and change either one or both of us into people that your dad can't control or will listen to. Then once we're no longer getting kicked out, we change back, change reality, and enjoy a better living arrangement!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...Who are we gonna turn into?\" Kyle asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you said he listens to your mom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! No way. Mom is off limits! I'm not turning into her and you're not either!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you don't have any ideas on who else we could change into then it might be the only option\" You say, and after a few moments of thought (You swore you say smoke rising out from Kyle's ears as his brain worked over time), he suggests that...</span></div></div>",

You watch as he leaves more than a few tiny Os and splashes of milk on the table as he dumps his bowl unceremoniously in the sink and wanders off. You frown and grab a paper towel and clean up the rest of the mess before tossing the quickly ruined paper towards the trash can before following your friend, not noticing that it missed the trash can entirely and landed on the floor with a wet plop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she's your mom, you should be her!\" You say, grabbing the gender changing socket wrench off the table as you follow Kyle into the living room, where he's sulking in his spot on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to be my mom! It'll be weird! What if dad, like, comes onto me or something?\" Kyle fiddles with turning on the Xbox but after a few moments tosses the controller to the side, clearly uninterested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want me to be your mom? How is that any less weird? What if he comes on to me? So I just sit there and take it? What happens when another version of you pops out nine months later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUDE! Fucking get out of here with that shit!\" Kyle says, shoving you away as you try to sit down next to him, his face twisted in anger. \"How do we explain that mom's back after only being gone a day anyway? It takes a long time to get there if you drive, there's no way she could make it there and back in a day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's the only thing we could think of! And we need to do this tonight, dude. Your dad said he was coming TOMORROW, if you remember\" You say as you plop yourself down on the recliner across from Kyle. After a few minutes of angry silence you begin to play with the socket wrench in your hands, making sure to keep it well away from actually attaching to you. You had to wonder if this was all it did or if you could make it do other things...You guys hadn't tried it on actual objects yet, and you slide it down where it hooks effortlessly onto the recliner. You were about to give it a turn when Kyle finally spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would we even do it? Like, all the tools just make their own versions of things, right? So we wouldn't actually look like my mom, right? How do we convince my dad to accept a total stranger, even if she kinda sort looks like mom?\" Kyle finally says, stopping you from turning the wrench. You pop it off the recliner and twirl it around in your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think if we got a picture of your mom, then we turn into a girl and then we use the hammer on it it should turn fuse us into a copy of her, right? I mean it'd probably help if the person changing looked a bit like her already...\" You trail off, eyeing Kyle who simply flips you off and tries to shove himself further down into the couch cushions. It was true though, Kyle and his sister Haylee both took after their mother in the looks department, that must be why Kyle always looked better than you when he a female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly felt jealous for some reason, but you didn't dare say anything and go back to messing around with the socket wrench like it was a balancing stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like it, I don't agree with it, but I accept it, okay? You don't want to be her, I don't, but we gotta do this\" He says, slowly rising out of his seat. You do the same, the socket wrench forgotten for the moment as you toss it onto the cushion your rear had just occupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should flip a coin?\" You suggest. You don't really want to leave the decision up to fate but it seemed the best course of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could play a game of Halo, loser has to change?\" Kyle suggests without much of a poker face. It was a trap and you knew it, given Kyle was way better than you at the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or I could just change now and save us some time\" You say sarcastically as you walk over to the end table where a bunch of random items were laying, junked there by Kyle and yourself. You fish around for a moment before pulling out a quarter and showing it to your friend. \"We'll use this\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just a wimp. If you actually played instead of getting mad every time someone killed you'd be good enough to win!\" Kyle says, taunting you and you feel your cheeks burn. It was true, you were known to rage when you were killed in a video game. That's why you preferred single player, because the computer was easier to beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are we doing this?\" You try to push forward, past the subject, \"I choose Heads\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, Tails, I guess\" Kyle groans as he walks over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoever's side it lands on, they have to change into your mom. No back outs!\" You say, holding your fist out to Kyle, who eyes it for a moment and gives it the weakest brofist ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then, in 3...2...1...\" you countdown, and then you put the coin on your thumb and give it a flip. You both watch in the air as the small piece of metal flips end over end as it rises towards the ceiling and suddenly begins to reverse, heading for your waiting hand. You brace yourself for the metal to hit when Kyle's hand darts in front of you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KYLE WHAT!?\" You yell as he swipes the coin out of the air in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll say it was heads just to save your ass!\" He says as he points a finger at your face, \"Fifth grade wasn't that long ago, bro, I still remember what you did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder at the memory and repress it. \"Hey, that was different! Just give me the coin and I'll hold it out for both of us to see!\" You say, and silently curse that Kyle had indeed seen through your plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" He says, and shoves you out of the way, grabbing the socket wrench off the recliner and making a bolt for the stairs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"COME BACK HERE!\" You roar and tackle Kyle before he has a chance to escape to his room. The two of you collide and land painfully on the hardwood floor of the entrance hallway, a mass of grunting, cursing limbs before you feel the coin slip out of both your fingers and go bouncing off the walls! You and Kyle untangle yourselves just in time to see the coin...</span></div></div>",

You push yourself up out of the kitchen chair with more effort than it should have taken and you feel the world spin again as nausea makes it's presence known and you lean against the table until the world stops it's tumble. You close your eyes and try to will the feeling away as you feel the other changes on your body. There's something covering your arms, a light jacket or something, but your legs are barely covered. You use your free hand to trace along the alarming bump in your mid-section down to your legs and you feel the ragged remains of jeans that had been quite clearly cut off. Further down you feel your toes wiggling in shoes that seem to be entirely cushion. As the wave of nausea passes you slowly open your eyes and turn, slowly, to face Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle, what happened to me?\" You ask, and your voice is entirely different to what you had sounded like only moments before. Where your Girl!Sidney body's voice was a little higher pitched, your new voice is smooth, sultry, and you feel the words dance off your plump lips that strangely taste like a waxy strawberry. You blink a few times and you swear your lashes are longer than they had been, and in fact you're pretty sure you don't look like the duplicate Mrs. Eubanks standing in front of you, thinner lips hanging slack as she/he struggles to find the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I, uh\" Is all Kyle can say and you roll your eyes in annoyance and you push past him, heading towards the downstairs bathroom that had the full length mirror in it. You must be really overweight because you can't fully run, instead all you manage is a bit of a half-waddle before you reach the bathroom door and fling it open. You flick on the light with a wince of pain as your eyes adjust to the light reflecting off the white tile and the mirror before finally your new form swims into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it's not your face that your eyes lock onto first. It's not even the massive pendulum breasts barely held in by a white top with a frilly neckline or the light blue overshirt that covers your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo the thing your eyes are drawn to first is the large forward bulge pressing out through your white undershirt. In shocked horror you slowly raise the bottom of your shirt up over the bulge, your brain already trying to tell you what it is but your mind refusing to believe it until you see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then you felt it. A kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Oh god. OH GOD!\" You scream in terror and launch yourself backward out of the bathroom, stumbling over your flailing legs as you start to fell, only to have someone catch you. You look up to see Kyle staring down at you, his changed eyes wide as he says...</span></div></div>",

Mom always told me it was the first picture they ever got of me, but I never saw myself.  I was probably hiding behind mom.\"  Kyle said helping you back to your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at your slightly old clone of your current body.  You closed your eyes and took a deep breath, \"Dude, do you really not get it?\"  You said pointing at your distended belly which had a belly button that poked out farther than you'd ever seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  It's weird that mom used to be fat or something, but she lost the weight, although I don't know why her boobs got smaller.  Did she get them reduced or something?  She never told me that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KYLE!  I am pregnant!  I am your mom when she was pregnant!  With you!  You are in my belly!\"  You were practically yelling, you felt a bit hysterical at the moment.  You felt nauseous, stressed, but weirdly satisfied at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second bro.\"  Kyle said letting what you just said sink in, and even though your situation was insane, it still stuck out to you as sounding super weird to hear Candace Eubanks, a woman you'd known most of your life say 'bro' in Kyle's clueless tone.  Suddenly Kyle's eyes lit up as he bent down and adopted a dopy baby voice, \"Hello in there little baby.  I'm you but big, I can't wait to see you.\"  Kyle reached out a hand to touch your stomach but you slapped it away.  \"Touch me and you lose the hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle nodded and nodded his head letting long black hair bounce up and down with each nod, \"Good idea Sid, if I touch myself it could lead to a time paradox.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't your reasoning for not wanting to have your newly pregnant belly touched, but for all you knew with all the magic stuff Kyle could actually have a point.  Probably not, but better to be safe than sorry.  \"All right, fine.  I'm your pregnant mom, but let's stop that.  Get me the hammer and a new picture of your mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, those are the only two pictures of mom.\"  Kyle said casually as he started to pull at his hair, he seemed to be getting distracted with the hair falling in front of his face constantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You only have two pictures of your mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I have more?  I can just go see her on the other side of town whenever I want and look at her or pictures in old photo albums.  Plus I've got picture stuff in the cloud, and I don't think you can fuse with the cloud.  Can you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably not, but this still sucks.\"  You said.  You wanted to just remove the nail and let Kyle go talk to his dad on his own, but you respected the honor and dignity of the coin flip, plus Kyle would never stop calling you a chicken if you backed out of this.  Even if you had a 10x more inconvenient body then him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, so now that we're both my mom, what's the plan.\"  Kyle said as he sat on the toilet in a very unladylike fashion waiting for you to reveal some grand plan you don't have yet.  How the heck were you going to come up with a plan to convince Kyle's dad to let you and Kyle keep the house by using two copies of his wife at different ages.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was now midnight.  You and Kyle had spent the rest of your day coming up with a plan and after Kyle proposed plots from about 50 different movies, he actually proposed one that was crazy enough to work.  But Kyle's dad needed to be asleep for it to work, and you needed to go over to his place in your car.  \"And then you have to come out here get the hammer and...oh man this so crazy.  How is it ever going to work?  AND STOP KICKING ME KYLE!\"  That last bit was yelled at your belly where baby Kyle seemed to be just as into this plan as the real thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down mom, I mean Sid.  Just do the breathing thing we saw on the internet.\"  Kyle offered you a comforting hand.  And Candace Eubanks hand tighter around younger and pregnant Candace Eubanks hand as you took some deep breathes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good bro, we don't need you freaking out and giving birth to me in the middle of the plan.  Although I would totally love to see how cute I looked back then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not even thinking about that now or ever dude, after we're done here I'm unfusing ASAP.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's do this bro!\"  Kyle said as he and you put on matching black robes you just got from a costume shop before it closed.  You entered the house with Kyle's spare key and as quietly as you could you tip toed all the way to being just outside of Michael Eubanks bedroom.  Kyle whispered, \"You go first.\"  You put your finger to your mouth whispered \"Shh\" in a way softer and sweeter sounding way than you'd intended.  But Kyle was right, for the plan to work you had to go first.  You opened the door which as you tried to sneak sounded like the squeakiest door you'd ever heard in your life.  You took a few steps into the room and your eyes began to make out Kyle's dad.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael Eubanks even when sleeping was an intimidating man.  He was a very tall man as evidenced by his feet sticking out of the end of the bed usually standing at about 6'4.  He kept a short buzz cut because he felt like any man who had their hair any longer was an unproductive hippy.  You took another step closer, but this step also heavily squeezed and Michael definitely heard it this time.  With alarming quickness he sat bolt upright in bed and in a second had turned on a lamp and grabbed a hammer from his construction company from his bedside.  \"Who's there?\"  The gruff voice you'd heard most of your childhood playing with Kyle.  You continued to stare at Mr. Eubanks.  He slept shirtless and for an old guy in his 40s was pretty ripped.  You felt a weird tingling in your body's stomach that you weren't sure you could blame on baby Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Here goes nothing.</i>  You thought as you removed your hood.  The face Kyle's dad saw shocked him into dropping the hammer.  \"What the...\"  he said completely dumbstruck.  Taking a deep breath you said in as mystical a voice as you could manage, which with Candace's deeper and sultry voice was actually easy.  \"Michael, I am the ghost of...Christmas past.  Do you remember what you told me when I told you I was...pregnant with our son?\"  You said trying not to gag a bit, again the pregnancy might have had something to do with that.  Making sure you left an impression you made sure to stick your belly out a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you that I loved you...and that I wanted to be the best father I could be.\"  Michael said sounding like he was tearing up.  You were just glad that your vague question worked, \"What would you tell yourself 18 years ago that you were kicking your son out of his new home, what would you tell me...love.\"  This seemed to have the desired effect, Michael seemed shook.  \"I-I would say that it was for his own good.  He...he needs the discipline.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But is that love?\"  You said in a spooky way.  Michael began to stand up from his bed but you shouted, \"NO!  Do not approach the ghost...or else. Listen to me my husband Michael Eubanks, tonight you will be visited by three ghosts.  I'm one of them and it's time for the next one goodbye.\"  You had a much longer and grandiose speech planned out, but baby Kyle just kicked you in the bladder and you really needed to use the bathroom since it wouldn't be a good look for a 'ghost' to pee itself in the middle of the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you passed by Kyle and motioned for him to go in you could hear him in the background say, \"Hey da...I mean...honey.  I am the ghost of Christmas Present and I...\"  The rest you didn't get to hear as you ran for the guest bathroom.  After a few minutes of relief later you snuck back to the outside of the room and waited for Kyle to come out and tell you the results.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You didn't have long to wait. After returning from your impromptu bathroom trip (which had been an experience in and of itself, given the fact that you were clearly about ready to pop the weird out-of-time baby Kyle out) you only had to wait a few minutes while Kyle finished up his spiel. IT was pretty simple, Kyle, as the 'Ghost of Christmas Present', was supposed to just point out how unhappy 'their' son was and how it was more harmful to try to treat him as a child rather than give him the independence and trust of being an adult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you can't help but feel the urge to hurry Kyle up as your feet start to ache and your new passenger were starting to hurt, almost as much as being the old lady had. You lean against the far wall as the weird past version of your friend began kicking again, and you suddenly just had a lot of sympathy for Kyle's mom. It certainly explained a lot that Kyle was just as hyper and excitable in the womb, your womb, as he was as a young adult. Suppressing a groan of pain you do the only thing you can think of (the two of you having failed to make it through the whole YouTube video from earlier) and start gently stroking your swollen abdomen. You close your eyes and tell yourself that it shouldn't be too much longer, and eventually the kicking subsides. You're not sure if you lulled baby Kyle back to whatever amounted to sleep or not, but you were thankful all the same as you were able to relax for a few moments before you hear the bedroom door opening and you open your eyes to see Kyle hurrying out. You wince as you put pressure back on your feet and waddle over to Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" You ask in a hushed whisper, \"Did he buy it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle gives you a shrug that looks really weird in his mom's body. \"I don't know! He just sat on the bed and stared at me the whole time, dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you stick to the script? What did you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what you told me to say! 'Oh darling blah blah blah I'm so worried about your relationship with your son and how you won't let him be a man blah blah blah don't kick them out of the house blah blah blah\" Kyle said as the two of you made your way downstairs. You probably shouldn't have gone back upstairs given your...condition, and the fact that Mr. Eubanks could have stormed out at any moment and caught you right there in the hallway. But c'est la vie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you reach the first floor you give Kyle a whack on the back of the head. \"You idiot! I hope that isn't what you really said!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I just...can't remember. I sort of ad-libbed a little bit\" Kyle said, and suddenly he won't meet your gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, what did you do?\" You ask as you beeline for the living room couch, eager to take the pressure off your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, to sell it I may have...kissed him?\" Kyle's face goes beet red and you just stare at him in surprise and disgust before a thud from upstairs pushes you past shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking gross, dude! But whatever, help me up and let's get out to the car so you can fuse\" You say, eager to initiate phase three, which apparently Kyle had either already forgotten or clearly misunderstood it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? Dude, no! Whatever happened to the tag team? You get to be Past and Future, I do present!\" He whines more than a little too loudly in his mom's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHH!\" You hiss, pointing upstairs where the faint sounds of muffled footsteps were emanating from. YOu could also swear you hear Mr.s Eubank's voice, but maybe it was just your imagination. \"No, I'm already pulling double-duty here!\" You point at the large protruding bump at your midsection, \"I CAN'T be the future Ghost! Besides I've already been old today, you do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, this is SO unfair!\" Kyle pouts, stamping his foot and sending his mom's breasts jiggling underneath the contemporary housewife clothes that his mom had been wearing in the picture. \"Let's just go tag team him like this or something! I don't want to be old!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well tough luck numbnuts, this was your plan, he's your dad and I'm pregnant with you! We're already committed and it's just one more round. Just do it, sell it, so we can go home and never speak about this again while enjoying our no longer at risk living situation, okay? You try rationalizing with Kyle as best you can, but apparently the sudden excitement has woken your passenger up, and you suddenly feel queasy all over again. You start rubbing your hands over your belly again in the hopes of soothing the younger version of your best friend, but it doesn't do much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, bro?\" Kyle says, rushing over in a rather motherly fashion, and as he leans in to touch you, you bat him away with a free hand before pointing at your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will deal with this, just go fucking represent!\" You snarl as quietly as you can, the last of your patience disappearing with the pains. You're also not sure how much the weird hormones are doing to you because suddenly you can't think of anything but eating a pickle and some ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh fine!\" Kyle groans and in less of a hurry than he should be in, he hustles outside. You shift on the couch and crane your neck to look out the living room window to watch as the silhouetted form of Kyle in his mom's body opens the driver side door of your car, the overhead light turning on just enough to let you see the floral print on his top as he bends over, before he rises back up, hammer in hand. You watch as he looks at the hammer, at the nail, the car and then turns around to look at the house, to which you then wave your hands in a 'hurry up' motion when he gaze drifts over to the living room window. He gives you a weird look before he turns around, places his hand on the car like you showed him, lifts the hammer and then...</span></div></div>",

Plus he had to do it, it was an important part of the 3 step plan.  You waddled over to the front door to let your partner in crime back in.  \"This sucks.\"  The low and oddly still kind of sultry sounding voice of Kyle as older Candice Eubanks said.  You felt your smile turn into a frown as you thought, <i>'Kyle's mom makes for a better looking old lady than I did.'</i>  And it was true, while you had been almost completely broken down and barely able to move, Kyle as Candice moving at an actual normal pace.  Even her hair wasn't completely grey as yours had been.  You pushed aside this really weird feeling of jealousy aside and said, \"Come on Kyle, we have to finish what we started, we need to finish this before he fully wakes up.  You've got to knock this out of the park.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it dude,\"  Kyle said possibly marking the first time a 50-60 year old woman had called you 'dude'.  You both anxiously made your ways back to Michael's bedroom door.  It seems you two weren't the only excited ones, you could feel baby Kyle rocking and rolling all over your organs.  <i>'I'm totally going to get you back for this...being an old lady is not enough payback.'</i>  You thought as you tried to slowly breath and rubbed baby Kyle back to sleep in your round belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, what do I say again?\"  Kyle asked, you sighed, at least he was attempting to stick to the plan.  \"Just talk about how you're from Christmas Future and if he kicks us out of the house bad stuff will happen.\"  Kyle nodded and you heard a noticeable crack coming from his vertebrae.  \"Ouch, got it.\"  Kyle opened the door and you weren't sure what was squeezing more, his bones or the floor.  Finally the last part of the show began as you heard blankets rustle.  Kyle's low and breathy voice began, \"I am the Ghost of Christmas Future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Candace?  What the, what's going on?\"  Michael's usually stern voice now seemed to be filled with concern and confusion, maybe this plan was going to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am your so...I mean wife form the future.  I'm here to tell you if you kick Kyle and his bro out....bad stuff will happen. Oooo.\"  Kyle said adding self made sound effects for added effect.  \"If you kick them out then bad stuff will happen.  Wars will start.  The world will end and mutants will take over the Earth, our son will have to live in the sewer and marry a rat lady.\"  A soft <i>clunk</i> could be heard outside of the door as you slammed your head into the wall upon hearing the crazy stuff Kyle was spewing.  Maybe you should have given him an actual script.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was what seemed like a full moment of awkward silence.  Finally Kyle took a few steps back towards the door awkwardly his job being done.  As Kyle cracked open the door you took a look in to try to get a quick glimpse of Kyle's dad to see how he was dealing with meeting 3 different versions of his wife in one night.</span></div></div>",

Sure enough there was Michael Eubanks clutching his chest and gasping for air, \"Oh crap, this is not going as planned!\"  You said as adrenaline began to rush into your brain and body.  You moved to his side as though you were once again an energetic young man instead of a very pregnant woman.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began holding onto Michael's hand and as you did Michael's eyes focused on you and his breath steadied a little bit, but he was still in bad shape.  \"He'll be ok, we just have to do something to help him out and keep him calm so his heart doesn't explode or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, my dad has a pacemaker, maybe his heart is going to actually explode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pacemakers don't work like that, they have batteries or something I think.\"  You said, although now that you think of it this stunt you and Kyle pulled tonight probably took years out of that batteries life.

But he'd have to wait.  You held his hand for a few minutes, and while his breathing didn't seem life threatening, it was not normal and you didn't feel good leaving him like this.  \"We have to do something.\"  You said trying to think of something to do.  We can't just hit him with the magic hammer and knock his problems away, he's an old dude with an old heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you had a stroke of inspiration as finally came up with an idea that you had a feeling could help Michael out.</span></div></div>",

You knew you had to calm him down, and feeling a sense of dread well up in you, you thought of an idea.  You smiled down on Michael and smiled sweetly and gave him a soft shhh.

Michael closed his eyes and flopped back onto his flat pillow and said, \"I love you,\"  Feeling very awkward you said, \"Uh, and I guess I love you.\"  \"I love you too dad!\"  Kyle chipped in oh so helpfully and with this comfort Michael fell fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly and quietly you and Kyle escaped from his parents house and went to the parking lot where you both spit repeatedly into the bushes to purge all of Michael's saliva from your mouths.  Kyle then got the hammer and pulled out the nail that fused him and the car and then pulled out the one fusing him and the picture.  \"So...we're never talking about this again right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\"  You said getting in the passenger side of the car, you didn't even wait to pullout your own nail you were so exhausted from being on your feet so long.  Kyle got in the drivers seat and passed you the hammer so you could unfuse yourself which you happily did.  \"Let's go home dude.\"  \"Got it Sid.\"<br>\r\n________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day you and Kyle didn't even feel like doing anything with the toolbox besides use the socket wrench to turn yourselves back into dudes.  You two were so worried about losing the house when all of the sudden Kyle's phone began ringing.  Seeing it was his dad on the line he was very he was hesitant to pick up the line, so you took the phone, answered it, and pushed the phone into his hands.  \"Thanks bro.\"  Kyle said sarcastically before saying, \"What up daddio.  I mean sir.\"  A minute later you saw Kyle's eyes light up and said, \"Really!  Oh man, thanks!  I can't wait to tell Sid!\"  before hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?  What'd he say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said he thought a lot about it last night, probably thanks to us dude, and he said we can keep the house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Booyah!\"  You said jumping up on the couch and doing a victory dance.  But Kyle stopped the over the top celebration before you could attempt a celebratory flip, \"Whoa whoa whoa bro, dad had something else to say.  He said we can keep the house, but there's something we've got to do or else we lose it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what is it?\"  You said figuring that whatever the task was, it was better than being homeless or worse, begging mom and dad to let you move back in.</span></div></div>",

At some point you'd waddled back to the living room and sat down in the recliner just to give your feet a break..and you're pretty sure you'd passed out after massaging your swollen belly to soothe the out-of-time baby version of Kyle from continuing to karate kick your insides. As he'd settled down, you'd found yourself getting pretty comfortable in the recliner.. On top of already being exhausted from the events of the day (and evening), the lateness of the hour and the quiet confines of Kyle's parents house had taken their toll. The final straw had been the muted voices of Kyle (as his own mother) and his dad talking in the room above, it was just enough that you had felt your eyelids dropping against your will...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then suddenly a thump from above cause your eyes to snap open, adrenaline pumping in your veins. Kyle was taking way too long, unless he was improvising you hadn't wrote THAT much for him to say, he should have come to tag you in while he changed into the older version of his mom for the coup de grace. You heave your pregnant form out of the chair like a beached whale flopping itself back towards the ocean and eventually find your feet, waddling as fast as you can out of the living room, up the stairs and down the short hallway to Kyle's parents bedroom, giving only a passing glance at the hallway bathroom as you once again feel the urge to pee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, something might be wrong. Check on Kyle now, pee later' You think to yourself as you grab the door knob to the master bedroom. You look down and spy the fusion hammer and a couple of spare nails leaned carelessly against the baseboard of the hallway and roll your eyes, bending over as best you can to pick it up before focusing your attention once more on the door. You give the door knob a swift turn and swing it open in dramatic fashion. light from the hallway filling the dark room with white light and illuminating the scene before you. Your eyes follow the trail of clothes from the middle of the room to the side of the king sized bed, tracing the lacy bra that hung to the sheets...And then onto the bed proper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n And then you let loose the highest, most girly gasp ever at the site in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle, in his mom's body, was in his parents bed, his female form pressed up against his dad's own naked body! The two had been lip locked, Mr. Eubank's hands running down' Kyle's mom's body while Kyle's hands were...somewhere else. But now both of them were now staring at you with wild, surprised eyes. You, as the calm, intelligent, level headed and reasonable person you are, assess the situation and think of the most rational response that you can come up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KYLE WHAT THE FUCK!?\" You scream at the top of his mother's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUDESIDIDON'TKNOWHELPME!\" He screams back as Kyle's dad stares in confusion at the young, pregnant version of his wife and his wife yelling at each other. And then something seems to click as he brow twists in fury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW WAIT A GODDAMN MINUTE-\" He begins, but you don't give him any time to respond as you do the only sensible thing you can think of.</span></div></div>",

For some reason you and Kyle had decided to turn into copies of his mom because it would help you convince his dad to not evict you.  But figuring out how exactly in the world that was going to help, well you still were arguing about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, how about this Sid, we pretend to be time traveling body snatchers, who will take his body unless he gives us the deed to the house.\"  Kyle said pacing around the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's even dumber than your ghost of Christmas past plan.  Seriously, why the heck did we have to turn into your mom for this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, dude, my mom is the only one dad will listen too, but we can't just walk up to him and ask, we need to come up with a trick of some sort.\"  Kyle continued to pace around making you more mad, you'd been the 9 month pregnant version of Kyle's mom for a couple of hours now and you were feeling more temperamental than normally.  \"Well I don't see why we didn't come up with that major part of the plan before we used the Fusion Hammer.  And quit pacing around!  You're making my feet hurt just watching you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle stopped pacing and looked at you like you were an idiot, \"Duh dude, we have to have my mom's body to think because if we get into her head, we'll come up with a better plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the dumbest thing I've ever hear you say, and that includes the stupid rumbling baby you is making in my stomach right now.\"  You shouted slapping your pregnant belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  Don't do that, you'll give me brain damage or something!\"  Kyle said, but before you could shout some insult at your best friend the door suddenly opened.  And inside stumbled Kyle's stoner sister Haylee who seemed to be off in her own little world.  She practically danced around into the house with her eyes closed, as she moved she began to talk, \"Sup bro, hey Sid.  I just took some of a dankest stuff and thought I'd share and...whoa.\"  Haylee seemed to finally open her eyes and looked between you and Kyle both of whom obviously were in two different versions of her mom's body.  \"Sorry mom...and mom.  I thought this was Kyle and Sid's place.  Man this stuff is more potent than I thought.  I'm going to take a nap now, feel free to share in the joy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd without even hesitating Haylee sat down by you on the couch, put her head on your rounded belly and instantly fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down at the cute Haylee on your stomach and tried to comprehend the weirdness that just happened.  But your staring was interrupted by a yelp of celebration.  \"Dude!  I've got it!\"  Kyle said holding up a high fight.  You weakly returned it and asked, \"All right, so what's the plan, how are we gonna convince your dad to not kick us out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know!\"  Kyle said confidently, \"But if we take some of Haylee's stuff, we're sure to think of something.\"  Kyle quickly held up a small bag of Haylee's supply and made a smile that made Kyle's mom's face look kind of dumb.  You thought it wasn't the best idea, but hell, if taking the stuff could make Haylee think having two clone moms out of nowhere was normal then maybe it could make you think of a brilliant plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, pass the stuff over.\"  You said and within a few minutes both you and Kyle took some of mind expanding substances and within a few minutes you didn't even know what was going on.  You didn't know how much time had passed, but when you came to, something was very, very wrong.</span></div></div>",

After being under the effects of Haylee's 'special stash' you had vague flashes.  You remember leaving Haylee on your couch back at your place while you and Kyle, both still with different versions of his mom's body.  You both had a plan after all of convincing Kyle's dad to let you keep the house.  You couldn't remember now what that plan was, but high you surely had a banger of a plan.  You remember getting to Kyle's parents house and getting super paranoid and anxious.  You were not handling the high well, but then the best part of your plan happened.  Kyle played the part of his real mom and cooked his dad dinner (a frozen pizza) and put some of Haylee's 'special stash' in the pizza to help make Mr. Eubanks easier to talk to.  You also came up with the idea of opening up a bottle of wine and pouring yourself a glass or 5.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could kind of remember Mr. Eubanks getting back home and eating and you think you talked, but you can't remember if you managed to convince him to let you keep your place.  In fact you didn't even know where you were.  It was dark, so you fumbled around beside you and managed to turn on a lamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn that off babe, I really don't want to see any light after that crazy pizza and the all that wine.\"  A voice said beside you.  Your eyes opened wide as you turned to see that facing away from you with his eyes closed IN BED WITH YOU was Michael Eubanks himself.  You turned off the lamp and closed your eyes hoping you were still tripping.  But alas, when you opened your eyes you were still in bed with your best friends dad.  \"Uh....\"  Was all both your body and brain could say.  You were quite broken.  After a full 10 minutes of stunned silence as you watched Michael sleep your brain reset and your body moved.  You looked under the blankets and for some reason you were both naked <i>'(SOME TOTALLY INOCENT REASON STOP THINKING LIKE THAT BRAIN)'</i>, you thought to yourself not letting any other thought cross your mind.  You got out of bed and grabbed a robe on the ground, you tired the cloth tie around your still pregnant belly and made your way to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babe I've been thinking,\"  A sleepy voice from the bed said, \"I think you're right, we should give Kyle and Sid a chance with the house, they're growning up and the responsibility of taking care of the house will be good for them, I can't treat them like kids forever you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, thanks Mr. Eub...I mean....honey?\"  You said weakly.  You opened the door and were about to leave this memory behind Michael had to add, \"And you were amazing in the sack last night.  We haven't done it like that in about 20 years.  It reminded me of pregnant sex for some reason.  You know what I mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was enough for your psyche.  Without another word you left, you managed to find the clothes you were wearing before not he ground outside the room, you took them and went by the living room where Kyle seemed to have not fully come down from his high as he was starring at an especially shiny spoon...actually Kyle was probably back to his normal self.  Kyle looked at you and jumped up, \"MOM!  I mean...Sid.  Bro.  Did it work, did my dad let us have the house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got the house, let's just go and change back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet!  But why are you wearing my mom's robe?  Why are you...\"  Kyle asked before you quickly cut him off.  \"LEAVING NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a quick drive back to your house that was thankfully yours again, but you did consider driving into oncoming traffic, maybe you'd be lucky and go into a coma and get amnesia and forget at least the last 12 hours of your life.  The second you get back to the house you make a B line right for the toolbox.</span></div></div>",

Like these nails are HUGE and all this yoga crap is so thin, I could, like, get ten for the price of one!\" He said as you began to disappear under the pile of merchandise as he threw them over the top of your headrest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't...That doesn't sound like a smart idea, dude\" You say, but it's clear he's not istening as he pulls back from his search for yoga treasure and sits firmly into the driver's seat, another 'I e:Heart Yoga' bumper sticker out. He begins pulling the pile of nonsense off of you while you stare at the second bumper sticker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why...You let her talk you into buying two of them!?\" You ask incredulously as Kyle begins making a haphazard pile on his lap. It seems like the only thing your friend hadn't grabbed were the yoga blocks sitting in the floor of the truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, duh\" Kyle says, pausing for just a moment, \"They were two for $5, bro! If you just get one you're literally wasting money!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...That's not how any of that works\" You say, but Kyle just rolls his eyes at you as he arranges the two yoga DVDs on top of the clothes and the yoga mat that was only an inch from your face now. With as much dramatic flourish as he can manage, Kyle sets the second bumper sticker on top of the stack and tries his best to pull the nail and hammer out of the dashboard without disturbing the stack of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is gonna be so awesome!\" Your friend says, positioning the nail so that it'll go right through the stack and into his leg. He raises the hammer, and despite one final protest from you, brings the hammer down. There's a flash of light and suddenly, Kyle re-appears, but he's definitely different. Instead of the pale brunette look he had previously though, now he looks entirely different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you're pretty sure that if you had a dick, it would have shot right off your body. His breasts are large, straining against the sports bra and hot pink top that reads \"I EHeart Yoga'. His arms are slender but toned, decorated with strange tattoos and large bracelets, as well as more than a few hair ties, you can see the muscles beneath the skin, and his mid-rift is bare save for the small pack of muscles. His legs are covered in black tights, but given how his ass has sweeled you're pretty sure that his hips are to die for. His face had completely changed, his eyes a little larger, a little brighter, plump lips and a cute nose that frame a face that hides exotic hints beneath it's creamy, darker skin tone. You weren't sure but he looked almost...Indian? Or maybe Asian? It was hard to tell, but it accented his Caucasian genes perfectly. His hair had been somewhat long before, but now it was a waterfall of dark brown hair with the lightest of blonde highlights held back by a equally pink headband. A hand ful of beaded braids decorated his scalp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blinks for a moment before turning to you and saying...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You looked at Kyle in the driver seat who had a fire behind his new brighter eyes.  \"Are you ready to start your training?\"  You kept staring at the new, hotter, and more yoga centric Kyle and realized you're mouth was open wide after being dumbstruck by the beauty that was your best bud/room mate.  \"Uh, yeah bro.  That's why we're here, let's get our yoga on.\"  You slowly wrapped your wrinkled figures around the truck door handle but before you could give it a tug you heard the purr of the trucks engine as Kyle started it up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle, what are you doing?  We're right outside of the gym where the yoga class is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle turned to you and gave a know it all smile, \"Sid my companion, you can't seriously think I'd let you learn yoga from the back room of a shoddy little gym?  You now have one of the most knowledgable yogi's in the world as your roommate now, let's head back to the house and start your lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I thought you wanted to come here to look at the hot girls in their yoga outfits?\"  You say very confused at Kyle's sudden change in motivation, and if you were honest with yourself you were looking forward to seeing a bevy to beauties in tight clothes as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's something that sounds ok, but you need to get serious about your yoga and taking care of your body and you are not going to be able to do that if you're looking at girls and distracting them and yourself.  No, we'll head back to the house and start.  You'll be as flexible as a really bendy bendy straw before you know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Kyle and cautiously refastened your safety belt and let Kyle drive you back, and it seemed another upside of Kyle fusing with all the yoga stuff was that he actually seemed more chilled out on the road, he didn't even run anyone off the road once.  And unless your old eyes were deciding you, Kyle actually stayed at the speed limit the entire trip.  Although he did insist on stopping by the store for more yoga supplies since he was currently fused with just about everything he'd bought earlier.  So now armed with his 4th 'I <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> Yoga' bumper sticker of the day (after all only getting 3 was like leaving money on the table) you finally made the trip back to the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you managed to slowly get out of the truck and make your way back into the house, Kyle had already moved all the furniture aside in the living room for excursive space.  Kyle finished rolling out two yoga mats and much to your delight, he removed his hot pink top leaving him standing there in just a sports bra showing of those glorious curves.  \"All right Sid, let's start with some deep breathing exercises.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later you felt yourself sweating a whole lot more than you thought you would doing yoga, you were balled up on the ground in something Kyle called 'child's pose' and were taking slow breaths to cool off after the work out.  And it was more of a work out than you'd expected.  You just thought you'd do some simple stretches and you'd feel better, but the way your old body stretched and moved at odd angles and holding poses really got your heart racing.  You had to lean on chairs for a lot of the poses, but Kyle was really encouraging and helped you out every step of the way.  It felt nice to have a beautiful woman putting her hands all over you and manipulating your body even if the woman was Kyle and your body was an old ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And whenever you're ready for it, lift your body up and think about what you've done today.  Good work, I'm proud of you.  Namaste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a deep breath and said, \"Wow Kyle, that was actually amazing.  This body already feels a lot better, I bet I'll be able to start my car up no problems for a couple of weeks after this.  I can't wait to unfuse and give the old girl a drive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I'd do that, your body is entering a very important stage in the yoga training, you should keep your body like this for a while to best maximize the good work we've done today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes, \"Whatever bro, I just think I'm ready to go from being an old lady to a young man again.  And then who knows what I'll become.  After fusing with all the yoga stuff you became a super yoga master, maybe I should try to fuse with some carpentry books so I can figure out how to fix the cabinet and other stuff in the house.  Or maybe some trashy magazines so I can have something to talk about with some of the girls at the bars.  What do you think Kyle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Sid I think it's probably not good for your chakra to call your yoga master a 'bro'.\"  And Kyle rolled his big beautiful eyes much to your surprise.  You look at Kyle and come to a realization that Kyle hasn't called you 'dude' or 'bro' in over two hours.  A new personal record, and you weren't sure you liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Kyle, get me the hammer and we'll unfuse ourselves.\"</span></div></div>",

If it hadn't been for the fact that Kyle had brought the hammer in with him and had apparently hidden it while re-arranging the living room, you would have just gotten it yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle slides out of the cross-legged pose he was sitting in and rises from his mat in one fluid motion, almost like a cat. He takes a long, deep breath and you can't help at the way his cleavage swells, until his reply takes all the weird attraction out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No?\" You ask as the ominous feeling turned into a cold lump of dread in your now activated core. You struggle to rise to your feet and before you know it Kyle is there, helping your old body rise off your yoga mat with surprisingly gentle firmness, concern in his big eyes as your bones creak and you wince in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, because you've made a commitment to getting healthy, Sidney. For both you and your car\" Kyle says, steadying you as you finally rise all the way up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...I can just BE healthy by unfusing!\" You protest, and Kyle just shakes his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sidney, did you really even think your plan through? If you unfuse, you're not going to help your car or yourself. Yoga is a slow process that requires dedication and time in order to produce results, just like any other form of exercise. You were always going to need to stay fused with your car until you reached your peak level of physical and spiritual wellness, don't you see?\" Kyle talks slowly and softly, as though he's explaining this to a five year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...that's ridiculous, Kyle! Just give me the hammer back, dude! And don't you want to go back to being a guy again?\" You say, despite it actually making sense the more you think about it. Your original plan had just been fuse on whatever days the gym Josephina had invited you to and then unfuse after every yoga session. It was scary how much that this woman in front of you was making sense and did NOT sound like Kyle at all. It had to be the DVDs he had fused with, they were overwriting his personality!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle narrows his eyes and you almost wither under the glare he gives you. \"As a matter of fact, Sidney, I happen to LOVE the way I feel right now. I feel at peace with myself, and this body is healthier than I ever had been before. I feel at peace with the universe. And we'll definitely have to do something about that. While I am your yoga teacher I am going to ask you to not call me 'dude' or 'bro' or any of the other disrespectful things that we used to call each other. And I'm not much of a 'Kyle' anymore...Instead, call me Kaira. In today's chaotic world we could all use a little more peace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! You're Kyle! Those DVDs must be messing with your head! And we can't stay fused, what happens when our parents call or drop by? Or your sister! We can't just vanish from the face of the earth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose we'll just have to explain it when we need to, then. And I would love to get both of our parents on the right path to being healthy in body and spirit. Haylee, the sweetheart, she needs a positive female role model anyway. She smokes far too much Marijuana to get any medicinal benefit\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT ARE YOU EVEN TALKING ABOUT!?\" You scream in frustation, and immediately regret it as your throat begins throbbing and dizziness takes over. You feel yourself wobble, and suddenly Kyle, Kaira, whoever the hell this stranger was in your house, helping you over to the couch and setting you down. There was no way the two of you could ever explain any of this to your parents! Not even Haylee, who was constantly high as fucking kite! You had to change Kyle back, you had to change back. Things had gone too far out of control, but the horrible, broken body you inhabited now had to take a breather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the path the universe has put us on, Sidney. Open your heart and accept it, as I have, and before you know it you'll be living a much better life. You might not even want to change back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big...fucking chance...of that!\" You hiss as you try to glare at Kyle/Kaira as his/her pretty face swims in your pained vision. And then his blurry figure disappears as you hear her walking away, bare feet padding softly on the hard wood floor as she walks over to the coat closet. She opens it and bends over, and you feel a weird twinge in your female nether region as her incredible ass pushes the yoga pants to the limit before she straightens back up and reveals the hammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go put those tools up someplace safe. You don't need temptations to ruin your journey. Would you like anything to eat? I'm going to clean out the kitchen and get all those horrible processed foods out, tomorrow we'll go shopping and get some nice, pure foods for your new diet!\" Kaira says, and she heads for the kitchen where the toolbox was sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly had an even worse feeling drop into your stomach. You had to get to the toolbox before the yoga freak hid it, there was no promise she'd let you transform back even if you played her insane game! This was YOUR life and you knew you had to fight for it! Pushing yourself off the couch with as much energy as you could manage you charge after Kaira right as she was dropping the hammer into the toolbox, a hand on the lid as she prepared to close it, humming some song like everything was right in the universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a wordless cry as you reach a wrinkled arm out towards the box. In the blur of what happened next, you don't really know what happened.</span></div></div>",

A flash of green light emanated from the gaps in the metal, washing across you, Kyle/Kaira, the house and the entire world in a single moment. The house changed from that of two young adult men to that befitting two women, one old and one young.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGone were the Xbox and Playstation, gone was the indulgently large HDTV, gone was the lumpy couch and ratty recliner and the other junk in the living room, replaced by a modest 50in flatscreen and a new couch that was covered in throw pillows and a light blue sheet cover. Gone were the white walls of the house, replaced by warm, neutral colors that changed in each room. Paintings and flowers now adorned the walls and hallways, while your bedrooms as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGone was your somewhat messy room, the twin bed, small TV, computer, closet full of T-shirts and jeans, posters of cars and women, and your porn stash all vanishing, replaced by a large four post Queen bed that was covered in decorative pillows and quilts. Your closet was filled with clothes befitting a woman who was clearly on the back half of middle age. Flowery curtains donned the windows and a large dresser and full body mirror appeared in place of your desk, a stack of make-up appearing on top as well as numerous little cheesy keepsake miniatures, such as a overly-cute cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Kyle's room, the dumpster heap vanished. Gone were the piles of dirty clothes, gone were the empty beer bottles and soda cans. Gone was the twin bed and gone was his closet full of clothes, gone was the much larger, trashier stash of porn.. Instead his room appeared as though a bomb of Feng shui had gone off. If you had seen it you wouldn't even know what to call the things that now inhabited Kyle/Kaira's room, only that it was pretty clear the room belonged to someone who lived and breathed yoga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as for the kitchen, where the two of you were, well, nothing really changed aside from a wine rack, womanly decorations and the conversion of all the food from tasty, processed snacks and drinks into nothing but health food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what had happened to both Sidney Barnes and Kyle Eubanks? Or rather, what had happened to Sydney Knowles and Kaira Patel?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad you somehow managed to touch the Toolbox before Kyle/Kaira had closed it, allowing you to remember the old reality?

Typically you always insisted on driving even though your car was in far worse shape, you were at least sane on the road. Now you were fused with your only other mode of transportation and it was clear that with your eyesight you shouldn't be behind a wheel. As you watched the lights flash by you could feel yourself becoming sick to your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, dude, can you go a bit slower?\" You ask Kyle, rubbing your forehead and eyes, \"This body really isn't built for this. I feel...frail?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Kyle says, and he takes a way too long look over at you before suddenly a horn snaps his attention back to the road. He jerks the steering wheel to the right and dives back into his lane as an SUV goes barreling past. \"Woo, close one!\" He hollers, a stupid grin across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just close your eyes and clench your hands tight to the door grip as Kyle swerves through traffic like a madman when suddenly the loud blare of a siren and bright red and blue flashes draw both of your attention. You look in the side mirror and when that fails to reveal anything other than a blur you turn and look directly behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, jockeying into position behind Kyle's truck, was the same police cruiser that had patrolled down your street just a few minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\" You yell and look at Kyle, who was darting his eyes between the road and the cruiser in his rear-view mirror. The realization of just how deep of shit you are in hits you as Kyle begins slowing down and pulling over to the side of the road, traffic parting around you to make room for the police cruiser to follow you over. The two of you don't have any identification in your current forms, and with an open container of alcohol and the smell of it on both your breaths...You're both in huge trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, what...what do we do?\" Kyle asks, his voice loud and full of panic as he finally slows to a stop. \"Should...Should I flash my boobs at him? Maybe he'll just let us go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That only happens in movies! That'll just piss him off even more!\" You shout back and turn to the sound of a car door slamming behind you, the blurry shape of a large officer making his way towards you. \"Oh god, we're so screwed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have only a few moments to decide your fate, and in a panic you tell Kyle to...</span></div></div>",

Kyle is still driving, and there's more lights than before. Your best friend is screaming at you but you can't tell what he's saying until suddenly the world snaps back into focus as the seizure or heart attack or whatever it was that had crippled you moves on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly take a look around, trying your best to take in your surroundings as Kyle speeds down the city streets, ducking through traffic on both sides of the street and taking turns and curves way too fast.

If you weren't so old you'd be able to help him navigate through-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait\" You say quietly, and Kyle's head snaps towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH GOD SID YOU'RE OKAY I THOUGHT YOU DIED BRO!\" He screams, and for a moment you seriously think he's about to let go of the wheel to reach over and give you a hug. Thankfully, he doesn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah bro, I'm fine! It's just, we can get out of this! Can you get us into a parking garage or something!?\" You scream back, and Kyle just stares at you for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get us into a parking garage ahead of the cops! Or down and alley or just wherever! If we get out of sight, we can use the hammer and I'll unfuse! Then we fuse you with your truck and we get in my car and drive away!\" You don't know how great the plan is, but it was certainly better than playing GTA: IRL Edition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle grits his teeth and nods, though you're sure he doesn't fully understand the plan as he pulls off a series of wild manuevers that eventually leaves the cops behind as he skids his truck into a small alley between apartment buildings. You grab the hammer and leap out of the truck as best as you can and hobble forward a few feet until you're clear of the truck's front bumper. Sirens are everywhere, and your hiding place isn't going to last long, so you dig the claw of the hammer into your flesh and remove the nail in a flash of green light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd suddenly, you feel much, much better. The energy of youth flows through you, and your body no longer feels as if it's one speedbump away from death. You feel like screaming at the top of your lungs and running, but there's just no time. You slide around your faithful steed and grab Kyle's arm, his skin feeling really, really smooth in your hand as you slam it on the white hood of his truck and place the nail on his flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really, really hope you're right about this, bro\" Kyle says, biting his lip and staring at you, big brown eyes on the verge of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Me too\" Is all you say before you slam the hammer down on the nail. The flash of green light blinds you, and you hear Kyle scream in pain as his skin shifts beneath your hand. When the light fades you see that...</span></div></div>",

Where once stood Kyle with his hand on his truck stood but a single woman.  Kyle looked very similar to how he looked pre fusion in most aspects, but he did seem a few years older, had light traces of gray in his black hair, and also had a bit of a pot belly.  As you looked at the truck fused Kyle you were a little annoyed and jealous that Kyle's vehicular fusion wasn't as debilitating as yours, then again his truck was still in much better condition than yours.  You continued to look at Kyle's body in with a hint of envy, blue and red lights started flashing down the alley.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick!  Get in the car!\"  You said and Kyle didn't need to be told twice.  You both climbed into your sometimes reliable old blue car and tried to start the engine which gave a weak sputter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang it Kyle, I blame you for this!\"  You said angrily turning the key again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I do to your crummy car?\"  Kyle said with a weirdly raspy voice that wasn't his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You nearly gave me a freaking heart attack when I was fused with my car, and I'm sure that didn't help out the engine.  Come on baby come on!\"  You shouted pleadingly to your car, and as if it heard you it finally started.  You prepared to step on the gas and get out of there, when there was a knock on your window.  You looked over and saw a large man with short black hair and a cheesy mustache.  Deciding you didn't want to go on another chase you lowered your window in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me ladies, have you seen a white truck drive through here?  It had a young black haired woman driving and I believe an older woman in the passenger seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened and then you breathed a sigh of relief, you'd almost forgotten that this was kind of the plan.  You put on your biggest fakes smile and said, \"Sorry officer, I haven't seen anyone matching that description.  Have you Kylie?\"  You elbow Kyle softly who to your surprise seemed to be checking out his body as you were talking to the cop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?  What?  No, I haven't seen anyone, but if they were speeding it was probably because the driver was good enough to do it and the other people on the road are a bunch of bit-\"  \"THAT'S RIGHT KYLIE WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYONE!\"  You shouted over Kyle so that he didn't say something else that could get you arrested.  The officer gave the two of you a probing glance, but thankfully he seemed to decide that he'd rather try to chase down Kyle's white truck rather than figure out what two women were doing acting weird in an alley.  \"Well, you ladies drive safe, there are some crazy things going on out there on the road today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that again.\"  You say as the officer walked back to his patrol car and finally left your sight.  For the first time in what felt like forever you breathed.  You and Kyle sat in silence before Kyle finally said, \"So...we still doing yoga Sid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't even look at Kyle as you put the car into drive, \"You know what.  No.  Not in this timeline.  Doing yoga with that old woman body sounds like too much work.  After dealing with your driving and a cop chase I want to go do something relaxing.  Let's go have some fun.\"  And you drove off into the evening looking for adventure.</span></div></div>",

Bro, you in there?\" Kyle says, walking around you and peering in all the windows, as if you're somehow hiding in the small confines of your on interior. \"Dude, this isn't funny!\" Kyle says after making a complete inspection of your body and even looking under you. But you're just right there in front of him, and if your had a brain and a mouth, you would have told him that you weren't playing a prank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're just a car.

The Jeopardy! theme drifts through the afternoon air from the open window of Mrs. Jenkin's house as Kyle's brain begins to piece the clue together before he finally snaps out of it. \"Oh shit, are you MY car?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushes the unlock button and dutifully, your locks disengage, your interior now waiting for the human that, had you a conscious mind, you would have either been terrified of the prospect of or simply accepted, depending on what type of mind you would have had. Instead you simply wait, and after a few moments, Kyle walks slowly around your front bumper, eyeing you as if you're playing some kind of massive prank and getting ready to pull the punchline, and slowly, carefully grabs your driver side door handle and lift. Your door opens without resistance and the warm air of the afternoon pours in as your new car smell pours out. Still cautious about being made a fool, Kyle slowly lowers himself into the driver's seat and slides the key into your ignition and turns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd without hesitation, your engine rumbles to life, a smooth and fuel efficient start-up that quickly leads to your internal mechanics purring powerfully. As a human, or to anything living creature, the feeling would have felt something like an orgasm. But you can't feel, because you're just a car.. Kyle glances around and pulls his other leg in and then slams the door shut. If you'd felt anything, you might have registered the sensation as painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U, good, good joke, dude!\" Kyle says, coughing out a laugh that sounds as fake as the smile on his face looks. \"You really got me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you're really a car!

After his investigation is finished, Kyle sits back and puts both hands on your steering wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this is too creepy. MAybe...Maybe I should change you back? But then again, I do like the idea of, heh, riding a hot chick\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would have slapped him, had you a mind and arms to do it with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter more than a few moments of thought as the last of the cobwebs blew out of his brain, Kyle decided to...</span></div></div>",

For one, you can't really 'see', there's just a blurry gray blob that sits in front of what you assume are your new eyes. Even the sounds from the rest of the world are heavily muted and you can hear Kyle yelling in excitement but it's as though you're underwater and he's yelling through a pillow. And you feel the intense weight of your new body, but it's not entirely uncomfortable as everything seems pretty distributed across you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you do find it a little hard to think. It sort of feels like you're extremely groggy after one of your late night gaming sessions and you haven't had any caffeine yet. You feel something hot and warm on your right side, and after a few seconds you realize Kyle is breathing on you, which disgusts you to no end. There's another string of unintelligible words from your friend and another pause, almost as if he's waiting for you to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I really hope I didn't just mess up' You say to yourself as you muster up all your half-strength that you can and try to talk. You feel...something inside you start turning and with a roar, the blurriness of your vision disappears, the sounds of the word snap back into full clarity and you feel more power than you had ever felt before flood your system as your engine roars to life. You're absolutely flooded with information, the exact position you're at, the time of day, the temperature, every finite detail of your new body, plus a buzzing in your ears that you somehow know is the signal of hundreds of radio stations waiting to flow through your antenna. And you feel gas and oil coursing through you, lubricants gurgling in your new metallic guts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro?\" You hear Kyle say to your right, and it feels like he's talking directly into your ear. You would wince if you have any flexible muscles, and with a little effort you manage to turn your radio on. You feel the buzzing in your ears grow louder as your mind scans through the channels, eventually finding one called 'Local.FM'. You select it and suddenly you feel as though a gag has been removed from your mouth. If you had one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter releasing a strange squelching couch through your speakers that causes Kyle to grab his ears in pain, you figure out how to adjust your volume and turn it down to what you think might be an acceptable level and say \"Holy crap this feels so weird!\" You say and you adjust your volume once again because it didn't sound exactly right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle recovers and his face turns from wory into a huge excited grin. \"Dude! You're a car!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a car, dude!\" You reply as the giddy thrill of it all finally catches up with you. But to your surprise Kyle runs around your front bumper, grabs your driver side door and opens it, which feels exceedingly weird, almost as if you're being peeled. And then you feel his weight settle down into you and you rock back and forth as your shocks absorb the action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude! What the hell!\" you say in annoyance at Kyle, who is already checking you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sid you are loaded! You have sat.radio, TWO HD cameras and a big ass screen here in the dash!

Your old car is just too beat up, there's no telling what would happen to you if you hit it with a hammer. Instead, you rationalize (as best as a guy currently a girl due to a magical socket wrench carrying a magic hammer can) that the better the car, the better off you'll be. But you've got to be careful, because if both cars are home it means that the owners are home, and the last thing you need is for that moron Brad and bimbo Tiffany to come charging out after you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approach the house, you do take some solace in the fact that as a girl, you're at least somewhat anonymous, so if you do get caught all you have to do is just run for it and then sneak back into your own house later and change back. You look down at your white and gold San Francisco 49er's t-shirt and blue jeans; you'll just have to make sure that these clothes change back with you or you never wear them in public again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's almost the perfect crime' You think to yourself as you get close to Brad and Tiffany's house. Taking a precautionary look around, and craning your feminine neck as far as you can to peek in the front window, you don't see any activity beyond a dog-walker down the sidewalk and a taxi turning off farther down where your street meets the intersection. You eye the Rocket Red muscle car for a moment and your male mind fantasizing about owning it, revving the powerful engine and speeding down an open road at top speed. You'd always wanted one, and despite your parents being wealthy enough to essentially pay for a home in the city, close to the college campus you'd be attending in the fall, they'd been pretty firm on 'no frivolous purchases', a muscle car being one of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing around one more time you peer into the tinted windows of the muscle car, gleaning as much information from the interior as you can...But you can't see much. Not that you really need to other than simple human curiosity. This was the kind of car you'd wanted for so long, that you'd promise yourself that you'd own once you got out of college and landed a boring job somewhere that paid halfway decently. The interior of muscle cars were always fairly spartan: black leather seats, a lit, overly busy dash and very little space for much else. You had to wonder what Brad had done to his on the inside, but you figure you'd find out soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout putting too much thought into your plan, you place your hand on the muscle car and then realize that you'll have to hold your hand upside down in order to hold the required nail, so you flip your hand over and hold the nail as best as you can between your thumb and middle finger. You raise the hammer up, and swing it down, suddenly realizing at the last second that what you're doing is extremely dangerous, and that you might be about to inflict a massive amount of pain on yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you're too late to stop physics, and the head of the hammer connects with the head of the nail. A intense wave of pain washes over your body as green light fills your vision, and you feel your body begin to shift, becoming...</span></div></div>",

Seriously, you\u2019re\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ear began ringing, and the green light flared up with it. You shook your head, willing both annoyances to go away, and felt something bouncing behind it. You reached up to grab whatever was on your head, and to your surprise, felt soft, tangled curls. Even after using the socket wrench to turn into a woman, your hair had remained in its short, unkempt style. Now, it was a bright red, and propped up in a curly ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s voice suddenly shouted from behind you, and you whipped around so fast that your ponytail smacked you in the face.

You\u2019d watched the Olympics a couple times, so you know what the body of a pro athlete looks like. Right now, yours surpasses all of them. Bulging muscles and veins decorate your body, some barely hidden by a pair of golden shorts and a sports bra. Squeezing your arm would usually squish the skin, but now it does nothing, as though your arm was made of stone. With every flex, your eyes grow wider and wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back up, and quickly notice that you and the six foot Kyle are eye level. Shaking it off, you begin to talk. \u201cThis is insane! That hammer gave me the perfect body!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll say! I\u2019ve dated some muscular chicks before, but you...\u201d Kyle is barely able to rip his gaze from your bicep and return to your eyeline. \u201cMan, you take the cake!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re pretty sure you knew what Kyle meant, but the wording still catches you off guard. Honestly, you\u2019d forgotten all about Kyle\u2019s thing for athletic women. Remembering it now almost makes you want to rip the nail out of your hand immediately. \u201cTakes the cake... Of the women you\u2019ve dated?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No! No, that\u2019s not what I meant! I wouldn\u2019t mind dating you. Or someone who looks like you,\u201d he adds, barely recovering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought pops into your head that forces you to stifle a laugh. You could start flirting with Kyle, just to mess with him of course, and see what happens. He forced you to remain a woman after all, so it\u2019s only fair you get some payback. Still, that\u2019s a risky form of revenge. It might be easier just to hammer a nail into Kyle and whatever would cause him the most discomfort.</span></div></div>",

If you were going to be his eye-candy, it seemed only fair that he become yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe closest thing you could fuse Kyle with was the pink convertible. You figured that since you clearly took on the defining traits of the muscle car, maybe he'd become a hot blonde chick or something. But then again, you guys were making a LOT of noise, and you notice a few cars that cruise past slow, their drivers craning their necks to get a look at the two of you. Maybe it'd be best if you went home first and find something there to fuse him with before Brad and Tiffany, the Trust Funders, came out to see what all the commotion was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems like it takes you a few moments longer than it should to reach a decision before you decide to....</span></div></div>",

The cat gives you a parting hiss from having her slumber disturbed once more, but you ignore it in your race to get inside.

You roll your eyes and begin to open the door when you hear the tell-tale sounds of wood splintering, and you suddenly realize you're literally about to rip the door off it's hinges.

You roll your eyes so hard you think that they might fly out of your head. Your friend had no idea what was about to happen to him and he was treating this all as a game, which it probably was in his mind. Kyle never really was the sharpest knife in the drawer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon\" you say motioning him to follow you and like a loyal hound he does. You can feel his eyes on your ass as the two of you walk into the kitchen where the mess from earlier is still waiting to be cleaned, the almost forgotten cabinet that started all of this still waiting for a repair that at this point, might not ever come.

It's actually a lot harder than you expected since the butter wasn't actually frozen and was a bit melty. Why the hell did you even have butter sitting out anyway? It's not like the two of you actually baked or, frankly, cooked anything yourselves anyway. But regardless, you still manage to skewer the stick of butter with the nail and you lean back, hoping Kyle wasn't catching on, but true to form, your best friend was still rambling to himself, caught up in the adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So yeah dude, you should totally hit the beach and enter that contest. My sis can help you buy some killer bikinis or one pieces of whatever it is chicks wear, it'll be so epic!

His double chin hung limply, his puffy cheeks growing red as beady, piggy eyes stared out in shock. Stubby, flabby hands began patting a rotund body down, rolls of fat jiggling as Kyle felt himself up, hands grabbing at the prominent man-boobs that had swelled into existence over a heaving gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude\" Kyle wheezed, \"This is not cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just laugh, a harsh, cruel, feminine bark that sounds nothing like your usual laugh. \"Well now you know what it feels like to be experimented on against your will!

Give me that!\" Kyle roars, sounding more like a squealing pig than an actual threat, and he lunges at you, grubby hands reaching for the hammer. Luckily it seems as though your best friend had the exact opposite of what had happened to you, and his movements are slow and ponderous, giving you more than enough time to simply move out of the way of the incoming sausage arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, maybe you should work out more 'babe', you tease, sticking your tongue out as Kyle stumbles forward, his balance thrown off. Clearly he didn't know what to do with all the fat hanging off of him. He placed a heavy arm on the counter to steady himself, and already you can see a sheen of prespiration appearing on his forehead. \"Do you want my trainer's number? I'm sure he could get you back into shape in no time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fu-fuck you, Sid\" Kyle wheezes as he fumbles for the paper towels, pulling off a sheet and wiping his forehead with it. In that moment you start to feel sorry for your friend, but he had sort of been a jerk to you and left you stuck as a woman, and then had the gall to get caught up in his own fantasy. No, he could stay like that for awhile, at least until you changed back. You watch as Kyle pulls himself along the counter towards the kitchen table, hauling himself into one of the chairs as he continues to wheeze. For a moment you weren't sure what concerned you more; that the chair he was now sitting in would crumple under the weight or if he was about to have a heart attack, but after a few moments the chair seems stable and Kyle stops wheezing as his lungs finally catch up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'll give you a copy of my diet, it'll do wonders for you!\" You tease again, no longer concerned, and Kyle just flips you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Change me back, Sid! This really, really sucks!\" Kyle pleads with you, but you just shake your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, being experimented on does suck! But you did it to me, so now I get to do it to you! It's only fair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm a lardass! At least you're a hot chick!\" Kyle says, gesturing to, well, all of you.

Until you're ready to apologize, you can stay like that!\" You turn in a huff and begin tossing the tools back into the toolbox, which was sitting innocently on the floor, looking like the normal toolbox that it clearly was NOT. You toss the hammer in, the socket wrench, the tape measure and the level, the four tools you actually used and they sit on top of a multitude of others that the two of you hadn't bothered to try in the span of the twenty minutes it took for both of your lives to veer off into the weird and unexpected. You take a step back and nod in satisfaction; the mess in the kitchen was finally cleaned, save for the cabinet, which seemed to be begging to be fixed but you ignored it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'll probably have to buy normal tools if I want to fix it anyway' You say to yourself as you turn back to Kyle, who was simply staring at you in confusion, his brow furrowed and his piggy eyes darting back and forth as his brain struggled to process the information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...What are you doing?\" He asked, trying to get up but the effort seemed too much for him and he stayed in his seat. You grin cruelly and strut back over to him, working your body as much as you could before leaning close to and whispering in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, lover, maybe I'll do what you said and go win myself a bunch of cash with this body. When I get back, maybe you'll be ready to apologize, and maybe I'll be ready to change you back!\" You try to make the threat as sexy sounding as possible, but you have to admit you don't have practice in being seductively bitchy.

After all, my car is a clunker...A girl might need some tools if it breaks down on her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you dramatically slam the toolbox closed, causing a unexpected burst of green light to flood the kitchen.

But don't call me babe dude, you know that just ticks me off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle waddled into the room with a smile on his chubby face, \"Sorry Sidney, it's just, you moving in here with me is like a dream come true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, it's better than living with my parents or in a dumb run down dorm.

Kyle flipped a few pages and pushed a few buttons and said, \"I know it was just prom and was kind of lame, but I was thinking of getting this made into a picture and framed.\"  You glanced down at the Netbook and dropped the toolbox on the table in shock.  Inside of the magically fused book was a moving picture of fat Kyle and buff female you at your high school prom together.  You'd recognize that bad paper mache under the sea gimmick anywhere.  You remember going to prom but you certainly didn't remember going with Kyle and he certainly wasn't fat and you weren't a chick since those developments only happened in the last 15 minutes or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're brain was trying not to shut down and was trying to figure out what happened when it finally hits you.

Looking around the room the damage was bad, but it could have been worse.  The kitchen table was splinters, the cabinets you were supposed to be repairing with your tools now were unrecognizable, and the doorway to the kitchen now had a car sized hole at its base.  And speaking of the tools, they were now scattered all over the kitchen in different nooks and crannies, it was going to take a little while to find them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least Kyle isn't trying to kiss me...oh crap, where's Kyle?\"  You said aloud, and on cue a groan comes.  You rush to your friends side and say, \"Bro!  I'm so sorry dude, I took it too far man, wake up!\"  Kyle seemed to be drifting in and out of consciousness.  You didn't want to bring him to a hospital, after all, freaking magic was involved in all this.  You tried to think of what to do for him, you did know CPR, or at least you'd seen it done in movies before, maybe that would help?</span></div></div>",

The green light subsides and you see that once more the car is gone, and once more you have muscles that would put most Olympian bodybuilders to shame.

He seemed to not know what to think or say, being a trust fund brat he'd probably never had someone stand up to him like this before.  \"Sydney, who do you think you are?  You think you can just probably take my car and then push me around like I'm you're little plaything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a sense of power pushing this spoiled brat around you simply nodded your head, and in an instant Brad's face oddly softened up before he said, \"Good, I like that.\"  And then he took a few confident steps to you head first.  You thought he was about to go for a headbutt on you, but then he got on his toes to reach you and kissed you on the lips.  You're brain completely shut down.  What was happening?  What just happened?  What?  Huh?  What?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're brain and body were still frozen in shock when a soft whimper came from the kitchen behind you.  You broke the kiss and pushed Brad about 10 feet out the door as you turned to see a crying mess of Kyle standing in the doorway.  \"Sydney...baby...how could you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't!  Bro he just...did that to me and...\"  You said trying to explain what happened as you tried to process what happened yourself as Brad came waltzing into the house wiping dirt and leaves off of his clothes.  \"Why don't you just go off and cry weakling.  Sydney is obviously too good for you and I'm going to save her from your pathetic courtship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  Kyle's not pathetic!  And excuse me?  You think you're going to <i>save</i> me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad put on a cheesy smile, it seemed he was in his element acting like a scumbag.  \"I can offer you so much more than...that.\"  Brad sneered at Kyle before continuing, \"I will happily drop that bimbo Tiffany in and instant and then I can get you a new car, I can get you a new house so you don't have to live in a dumpster fire with the butter bean over there.  What could he possibly offer you that I can't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love!\"  And Kyle's voice was stronger than it had ever been since you'd fused him with the butter.  \"I love Sydney as a friend and as a lover.\"  You threw up a little in your mouth at this.  \"You want to just buy her like a thing, but she's not a thing, she's my girlfriend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to buy her, she's going to choose me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!  She's going to choose me!\"  Kyle retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brain was finally starting to piece itself back together after the surprise kiss.  Literally an hour ago you were just an average dude trying to fix a broken shelf and thanks to some magic toolbox you were a muscle bound babe in the middle of a love triangle with your best friend and a rich douchebag.  You looked at the two and thought how you could resolve the situation.  You could obviously back up your best bro Kyle against this jerk and kick him out of your home before figuring out how to fix reality and stuff.  But a little plotting part in the back of your mind had an idea.  You could pretend to go with Brad.  He buys you a bunch of stupid gifts and then you turn yourself back and you're instantly rich.  You'd of course split it with Kyle 50/50...or 80/20, after all you'd be doing the work.  But all of this was hurting your head, part of you just wanted to end this whole thing right here and now. </span></div></div>",

Instead, you rationalize (as best as a guy currently a girl due to a magical socket wrench carrying a magic hammer can) that the better the car, the better off you'll be. But you've got to be careful, because if both cars are home it means that the owners are home, and the last thing you need is for that moron Brad and bimbo Tiffany to come charging out after you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approach the house, you do take some solace in the fact that as a girl, you're at least somewhat anonymous, so if you do get caught all you have to do is just run for it and then sneak back into your own house later and change back. You look down at your white and gold San Francisco 49er's t-shirt and blue jeans; you'll just have to make sure that these clothes change back with you or you never wear them in public again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's almost the perfect crime' You think to yourself as you get close to Brad and Tiffany's house. Taking a precautionary look around, and craning your feminine neck as far as you can to peek in the front window, you don't see any activity beyond a dog-walker down the sidewalk and a taxi turning off farther down where your street meets the intersection. You eye the Rocket Red muscle car for a moment and despite your male mind fantasizing about owning it, revving the powerful engine and speeding down an open road at top speed, the pink convertible just looks more appealing you at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing around one more time you sneak around the muscle car and inspect the convertible. It's hot pink, almost glowing in the afternoon sun. It's designed to catch looks, no matter the time of day, and the interior is pristine white from seat to dash. It looks expensive, almost moreso than the muscle car sitting next to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout putting too much thought into your plan, you place your hand on the convertible and then realize that you'll have to hold your hand upside down in order to hold the required nail, so you flip your hand over and hold the nail as best as you can between your thumb and middle finger. You raise the hammer up, and swing it down, suddenly realizing at the last second that what you're doing is extremely dangerous, and that you might be about to inflict a massive amount of pain on yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you're too late to stop physics, and the head of the hammer connects with the head of the nail.

Even with closed eyes you could still somehow see a flash of green light as the hammer hit the nail.  There was a brief moment of pain and then nothing.  Slowly you opened your eyes almost expecting to see a fountain of blood splattering all over the hot pink convertible.  But there was no blood.  And there was no convertible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down you didn't see the car, but your hand was still in front of you where it had been before, although now it had a green nail imbedded in your skin.  Skin that was no pristinely smooth with fingers that ended with long pink nails.  But your fingernails weren't the only things about you that were pink.  A quick glance down and you saw that you weren't wearing your old 49ers shirt anymore, but now you had on a hot pink dress that was the same color as the car.  And it wasn't a normal dress you'd see your mom wear on Sunday, but some ridiculously expensive looking dress you'd see on some tv award show made of some fancy cloth you'd never heard of.  Several gold bracelets dangled from your wrists and you could feel something resting on your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments of looking at yourself in the parking lot you noticed even more changes.  Streaks of almost platinum blonde hair fell into your line of sight.  You took a quick pull at it thinking it was a wig or something, but a tug and a sting of pain later showed it was your actual hair now.  Looking down you also saw that your boobs which were just a modest A cup before now looked like the size of small melons.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God.\"  You say to yourself in amazement at the transformation you had just undergone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohmygawd!\"  You heard a voice cry.  Looking up you felt your heart skip a beat as you saw Tiffany, the trust fund bimbo who's car you had just fused with was standing on the front porch.  \"What happened to my car?\"  She cried out in a very whiny sounding voice.  Panicking you turned to walk away from confrontation but you stumbled and almost fell over high heels you now discovered you were wearing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you stop!\"  Tiffany called out as she approached you.  Realizing there was no way you'd be able to outrun her with your new body you did the first thing you could think of.  </span></div></div>",

Now more prepared to deal with this problem head on you look at Tiffany and say, \"Can I help you?\"  You were surprised by the almost hum of your smooth voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany approached with a look of worry and concern on her face, \"Like, yeah, I think my car was stolen just a minute ago.

It was the cutes color, it was a bright platinum blonde color, exactly the same color as your hair actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  What a coincidence!\"  You said feeling your voice get even higher as a bead of sweat began to form on your forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, exactly, a coincidence.\"  Tiffany said looking at you, and it looked like she had stopped talking to devote all of her brainpower to any idea that seemed to be forming in her head.  Now seemed to be the time to make a run for it, \"Well, I'm just going to be going now since I'm totally innocent and have nothing to do with your missing car.\"  You say as casually as you can as you turn to walk away.  You even began to whistle a tune just to show how casual and innocent you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second, that song you're whistling, that's my car's horn song!\"  Tiffany said pointing an almost accusing finger at you.  You cursed yourself, no wonder you couldn't get the latest teenage pop song out of your head.  Tiffany seemed to have finally come to a conclusion and said what was on her mind.</span></div></div>",

Not unless she had seen you fuse yourself to her car directly, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED!\" Tiffany shouted suddenly as her brain seems to have finally flickered to life, \"I totally knew that my horoscope was real!

Let's go shopping!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was just what Tiffany wanted to hear, and somehow deep down you knew that.  <i>'Did my subconscious say that or something?'</i>  You thought to yourself as Tiffany practically jumped for joy.

After some feeling to noticed something you wouldn't expect from a  fancy dress like the one you were wearing, a pocket.  \"Well, that is technically my 'trunk' I guess.\"  You thought to yourself with a grin as you pulled out a phone.  It was a familiar phone, it was the same model as the one you had, but it was pink and had a jewel case.  Thankfully your new fingerprint worked on it to unlocking it.  Inside the phone were a bunch of apps you were familiar with, but there was also a gas station location app and a navigation app you'd never seen before.  You opened up the contacts page and noticed all of your normal contacts, but you also had Tiffany, Brad, and a mechanic.  You kept scrolling until you found the name you needed to see.  You opened up a text window with Kyle and wrote, \"<u>Dude!  It's Sid.  Long story but I had to drop the hammer in a bush at Tiffany and Brad's.  Grab it and I'll meet back up with you later!</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later you heard your phone give a cute little ding and saw that Kyle wrote back, \"<u>Got it!  Anything for my girlfriend <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/inlove.png\" alt=\"*InLove*\" title=\"InLove\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hastily and angrily wrote back, \"<u><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/facepalm.png\" alt=\"*FacePalm*\" title=\"FacePalm\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> I AM NOT UR GIRLFRIEND!</u>\"  You thought about tweeting more angry texts but Tiffany came back waiving a pair of keys to the red muscle car.  \"I got our wheels since you don't have them anymore!  Get in the car and let's hit the road!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to resist Tiffany's command you walked over to and got into the muscle car.  You were blown away by how comfortable it was.  You didn't know how to describe it other than it smelled like money.  As Tiffany revved the engines you ask, \"So where are we going?  What are we shopping for?\"</span></div></div>",

It means that we need to get ourselves a couple of hunky boyfriends.  Maybe we'll even find twins!  Wouldn't that be the best Daisy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, you did not think that would be the best, hell you didn't even have a girlfriend now and here you were being pushed by Tiffany into getting a boyfriend.  \"Tiff, why don't we just have a nice quiet night and go to a movie and get a burger or something and then go back to the house.\" '<i>Where Kyle is hopefully waiting for me with the hammer</i>'  You think to yourself.  But this wasn't the enthusiasm Tiffany hoped her car turned BFF would have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be such a stick in the mud Daisy!  Or should I say car in the mud?  Not that I'd totes ever drive you in the mud.  Embrace your new body!\"  Before you knew it you had grabbed a handful of your own breasts, <i>'Uh oh, since I'm fused with her car and I guess technically belong to her, I have to do as she says.</i>  You remind yourself.  \"Not like that silly,\"  Tiffany said giggling at you and sticking her tongue out cutely.  \"What I mean Daisy is that you need to have fun, be a bit more, um...impulsive! Like, flash that guy in the truck next to us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to stop yourself you turn to face the truck driving along side you and pulled down the top of your pink dress exposing the breasts that the dress barely held in.  The guy driving the truck who looked like he was still in high school suddenly swerved and almost drove himself off the road he was so surprised by what he just saw, all while Tiffany squealed in delight next to you. In a brief moment of sadness you looked down at your boobs and realized some random stranger had just gotten to see your naked boobs before you could.  Feeling a bit sad and indignant about this you noticed that Tiffany had taken an exit and was slowing the car down.  \"We're almost there, this is the Citadel.  It's the hippest and nicest club in town.  Totally posh.  We are totally going to go and find us some boys to have some fun with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought to yourself, <i>'Yeah, like that's going to happen.'</i> and as though Tiffany read your thoughts she said, \"Now go in there and get yourself a boyfriend!\"  \"You got it girlfriend!\"  You say in an enthusiastic voice unable to stop yourself as you found yourself swaying your hips as you sashayed into the club.  \"How the heck am I going to get out of this.\"  You thought to yourself trying to think of a plan.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Citadel was unlike any other club you'd ever been inside in your life.  It was clean.  This was obviously the place where rich and best looking people got together and hooked up, the bouncer probably wouldn't let anyone in who wouldn't get cast in a young adult drama.  The people you saw in the club seemed to match up with that theory as every girl looked hot and every guy had a jaw line to die for.  And you quickly found yourself almost magnetically attracted to some of the men.  But with all of your will power you managed to pull away and continue walking in the club.  But with each guy you passed it was getting harder and harder.  Eventually saw a guy at the bar with a way too tight shirt that showed off his muscles that looked way too big to even be real.  You had to get closer to examine them, touch them, caress them.  And maybe you'd even talk to the guy attached to the muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dibs!\"  A voice called out behind you pulling you out of your trance as Tiffany brushed past you and practically jumped into muscle man's lap.  You breathed a sigh of relief and thought, <i>Thanks Tiff, you just saved me from a fate worse than death...ok maybe not that bad but I'd probably wish I was dead once Kyle turns me back with the hammer...wait a second!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lightbulb went off in your head as the lights of the club flashed around you, \"That's it!\"  You say as you frantically pat down your butt much to the delight of some of the guys in viewing distance.  And you wanted those eyes on you, it was the best way for you to get a man\"NO!  Don't think like that.\"  You say as you pulled out your pink phone and scrolled through the contacts till you got to K.  You tapped the screen a few times and much to your relief Kyle answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What up Sid...or should I say Sydney.\"  Kyle laughed loudly at his own bad joke that he'd probably been working on since you used the gender switch socket wrench on yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude no time for that!  Will you be my boyfriend!\"  You desperately say into the phone as your eyes began to wander to a very cute barman who you definitely had the eye of.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  Huh?  What?\"  Kyle said not sure he was hearing you right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just say yes!\"  You practically yelp into the phone as you wink at a passing waiter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, if you insist, I'll be your boyfriend.\"  Kyle said and in a moment it was like a fog had been lifted.  You no longer wanted to attract the men in the club to you.  After all you'd completed Tiffany's order, you got yourself a boyfriend.  You breathed a sigh of relief, \"Thanks bro, you just saved my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem...so does this mean I get to see you naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou punch the phone and you hear a soft \"Ouch!\" escape from your lips in pain as your delicate hand throbs. You looked at the other end of the Citadel and saw Tiffany all over the muscle guy and you shudder, realizing how close you had come to just being another arm candy bimbo. As much as a pain in the ass Kyle was being he really did just save yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still there, 'babe'?\" Kyle says, unaffected by the long distance assault, and as much as you'd like to strangle him (and honestly yourself at this point), you tear your gaze away from Tiffany and focus back on the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you grab the hammer dude?\"  You asked hoping that your luck was with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I grabbed it no problem.  What am I supposed to do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for that, I need you to listen to me carefully, I have an idea.\"  You said as you put together a plan in order to get yourself unfused.</span></div></div>",

You look around and see the bright yellow lights of the bathroom on the other side of the club, realizing the only way you'll ever be able to have a conversation with your, ugh, boyfriend is if you get some place quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLD ON A MINUTE!\" You scream into the phone once again and without waiting for Kyle's reply you make for the small row of bathrooms. But suddenly walking is a LOT harder than it had been a few minutes ago, when you were following Tiffany's order to get a boyfriend. As though a spell had been lifted, all the skills you needed to walk in heels vanished, and you find yourself clomping and stumbling across the club's crowded interior. More than once you bump into a guy and you have to push yourself away quickly as something in the lower area of your body pulses in excitement as they quickly grab hold to steady you. It seems that some part of your mind must, on some level, still be fixated on trying to find a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'God I hope that isn't permanent' You think to yourself darkly as you finally reach the far side of the club and the potential solitude of the bathroom. You, on instinct, begin to head into the men's, but catch yourself at the last moment and make a course correction into the first of the two women's bathrooms, pulling open the surprisingly heavy door and sliding in, the door sealing away the crazy loud atmosphere of the club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women's bathroom was, thankfully, empty aside from you. In fact you were somewhat disappointed that it wasn't at least a little bit fancier than a typical public toilet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SID! ARE YOU STILL THERE BRO!?\" Kyle's voice breaks the silence and remember what you had been doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit! Yeah, yeah I'm here!\" You say pulling the phone back up to your lips as you move away from the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what did you want me to do with the hammer?\" Kyle asks again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I need you to do is come here and pick me up and take me home so I can get back to normal!\" You look up from your carefully plotted steps as you pass the large wall mirror, and you nearly drop your phone as you finally get to see what you look like in full detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour new body is enough to put nearly any other woman to shame. Your breasts truly are the mountains they feel like, and your ass curves and fills out the lower portion of the dress better than you'd ever seen on any woman. Your hair seemed to glow in the bathroom lighting, so blonde and voluminous, and your face looked as if every stereotypical hot blonde had been crammed into one. Your lips were puffy, but not ugly and of course, covered in a glossy coating of pink. Your eyes were wide and blue. Like crazy blue. Sapphire even. Your nose was small and upturned just enough, and just a hint of rosiness was dashed across your cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Kyle saying something on the phone, but you don't register what it is as you are suddenly caught in a trance at your own reflection. You move closer, setting your phone down on the long counter as you lean in close and touch your lips with pink-capped fingers, awed at how soft and pliable they are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Dick sucker lips' You think suddenly and just like that you're back in reality. You back away from the mirror and grab your phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, if you're just gonna keep putting me on hold I'm just gonna hang up\" You hear Kyle say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT!\" You cry, \"Sorry! It's just, it's a little crazy here right now! Like just come get me, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I would, but I don't know where you are!\" Kyle whines from the other end of the phone, and you realize that you really hadn't even clued him in on the changes that had happened to you or the situation you were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm, uh, at this place called 'Citadel'. It's some really nice club down town\" You say, hoping Kyle knows where it is because you were too busy exposing yourself and trying to come up with a way to get out to pay attention to the street you were on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit dude! That's the high roller bar! Haylee tried to get in one time but the bouncer wouldn't and her date dumped her right there and I had to pick her up! What's it like on the inside? How much is the booze?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, at least he knows the directions' You think before you force a light, very girly sounding cough to make Kyle shut up. \"Let's try to stay focused, please?\" You say as politely as you could despite the head whack you want to give your friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, right. Yeah I'm, uh, on my way!\" Kyle says before hanging up on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I'll just chill in here while I wait\" You mutter as you stare at the call ended screen on your phone. \"At least this place has free WiFi\"</span></div></div>",

Soon after you finish your phone call and you begin surfing the Internet on your phone, you get  company. Not wanting to interact with members of your newly acquired fellow sex, you hurriedly stumble your way into one of the stalls, slamming the thin plastic door closed and locking it. You pray that no one comes to harass you, but your fears seem unfounded as the intruders come and go in relative short order. You overhear someone called 'Chloe' telling 'Jessica' all about some guy named 'Matt' and the little whore all over him at the bar. You can only assume they're talking about Tiffany, and for some reason your blood rises a little bit as they trade catty insults about her, but you see your hand reaching for the stall door and you shake yourself out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's just the spell.

And while both your folks are upper middle class (thus why you and Kyle live in a pretty decent house close to the campus), in the look department Kyle is decidedly average, looking more like Jonah Hill than early 2000s Freddie Prinze Jr. Plus, knowing Kyle, he's probably decked out in nothing more than a pair of jeans and a t-shirt, thus rounding out his 'not club material look'. But then again, even normal girl you hadn't been much of a looker, it was only because you were currently fused to car that you had the looks and curves that you did, so it made sense why the bouncer wasn't letting your friend in the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait a second, that's it!' The idea pops into your mind and you begin clicking your phone with your long pink nails as another group of girls wander into the bathroom, gossiping. And according to the gossip, Tiffany was looking for 'some girly girl in pink' because she and 'Matt' were ready to leave and head back to his place. The noose was tightening, who knew what would happen if you showed up without a boyfriend that met Tiffany's 'standards', and definitely if the two of you went home with some strange muscled guy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Dude you gotta look hot!!!

Easily over six feet tall and overflowing with muscles, even more so than the guy you'd almost given yourself to at the bar had been and barely contained by the red shirt that was stretched taut over his skin. His chisled face and striking jawline looked like something out of an action movie, and a short mane of fiery red hair topped the head of the behemoth in front of you. You don't recognize him at all outside of his body language and somewhat clueless expression on his face, which is clearly Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least you think so, most of the guys in the club probably didn't register too high on the intelligence index. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh,...Sid...ney? It's Kyle\" The man says in a deep, rolling voice that sounded like far-off thunder. But suddenly you find yourself too distracted by Kyle's looks to ponder anything else. Those muscles rippled and twitched and before you knew it, you were reaching out a hand to touch them. You brush a fingertip against them and suddenly your heart seems to explode and the fragments tumble down towards your nether regions, catching them on fire. You give a little gasp of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" You say, in a daze, not fully realizing what was happening. All you wanted to do was touch those muscles, to be touched by those muscles. After all this was your..friend. Your...boy...friend. Your hand touches his body and you realize you don't really care about leaving anymore. You COULD leave, so much more you could do at home, but here was fine. There was music here, drinks. Your BFF.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! Dude, you're freaking hot!\" Kyle says, a big stupid grin on his face as he stares down into your grand canyon of cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not the only one\" You purr, and despite something in the very back of your mind screaming no, you press yourself against him, feeling something hard and stiff press against your abdomen. \"Mmm\" You say, sliding a hand towards it, \"I'm REALLY glad you came...\" you feel safe, secure, desired in his embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, um, you really weren't kidding about being my, uh, girlfriend?\" Kyle says as the two of you move out of the doorway and he unintentionally presses you up against the cold wall of the club. A shiver of excitement and chill runs down your spine and does little to cool the pulsing furnace under your dress. But it's enough to make the voice in the back of your head sound clearer. You needed to get out of here, you needed to unfuse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I kid about something like that?\" You purr as you...as you...</span></div></div>",

You two car fused friends were so close that your breaths embraced together.  And you breathed in Kyle's breath and tasted it.  It reminded you of gasoline, but instead of gagging on the taste like you normally would you found yourself savoring the flavor.  His lips were right there, the thought crossed your mind to taste more, you couldn't stop yourself as your lips parted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAY TO GO GIRLFRIEND!\"  Tiffany screams as she practically jumps up against you grabbing your shoulders, \"You found the hottest guy in the place, well second hottest, my guy is totally hotter.\"  Tiffany said pointing out the muscular guy you ran into earlier at in the club that Tiffany stopped you from approaching.  \"No way, I'm totally hotter than that dude.\"  Kyle said taking a step to the guy you think you remember being called Matt.  \"Yeah!\"  You said backing up your friend who was just pretending to be your boyfriend, yeah, totally just pretending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt's eyebrows rose at this challenge, he took a step towards Kyle, you were afraid that Kyle was about to get the hell beaten out of him and you doubted fusing with a car gave Kyle super fighting powers.  But instead Matt just struck a pose and began to flex his muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?  That all you got bro?\"  Kyle said and he started to pose with his new muscles.  You observed Matt and Kyle strike poses and flex different muscle groups, it was practically hypnotic, you couldn't stop staring.  \"Bet you never saw anything like this as my car.\"  Tiffany's airy voice whispered into your ear, and then a little louder she said, \"Matt is a professional bodybuilder.  He told me he's going to she me his clean and jerk later.  I don't know what that means but it sounds super kinky Dasiy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle's pose lost it's muster, \"Daisy?  I thought you said you were Sid?  Oh crap did I get the wrong girlfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs though a car crashed through your mind, it suddenly became clear.  You wiped your mouth where a small bit of drool had formed watching Kyle and Matt.  That thought discussed you now, and you had to thank Kyle's stupidity for bring you back to reality.  \"No Kyle, I'm the girl you're looking for, and according to Tiffany my name is Daisy.\"  And then seeing Kyle's still confused expression you rolled your eyes and decided to go over the top, \"I can't wait for you to...<i>hammer</i> me later.\"  You added a wink for good measure and a look of what you hoped was clarity appeared on Kyle's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany let out a long whistle, \"Woo hoo!  Human less than a day and you're already getting right too it!  Well good for you girlfriend!  Come on, let's get out of here.\"  Tiffany lead the way out of the club with Matt putting an arm around her waist.  Kyle saw this and got a big dumb grin on his face as he put his arm around your own tiny waist.  You thought of pushing him off but knew you needed to keep up the ruse...and besides, it didn't feel that bad.  You could deal with it as the four of you made it to the parking lot where in a moment of panic you remember the car you and Tiffany drove here in was currently fused to Kyle.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You reached up and grabbed Kyle\u2019s arm. Any thoughts about how your hand didn\u2019t even reach halfway around his bicep were forced away as you whispered, \u201cHey, how are we getting out of this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle blinked, confused. \u201cGetting out of what? Oh wait! Dude, you mean your dress right? I bet I\u2019m strong enough to just rip it off now, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew he wouldn\u2019t be much help, but the feeling in your underwear made it seem like he was actively working against you. \u201cKyle, can you please, for the love of God, focus? We\u2019re about twenty feet from Tiffany realizing her car is gone! She might be dumb, but she isn\u2019t brain dead.\u201d You glanced over to see her draped over Matt, who was going on about the latest diet that she just <i>had</i> to try. If there was any time, you might\u2019ve taken back what you\u2019d said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Kyle said. \u201cI\u2019ll just unfuse or convince her I\u2019m her car or something. It already worked for you and you didn\u2019t even try!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat gave you pause. You hadn\u2019t considered being so blatant. And Tiffany was the perfect blend of stupid and sugary sweet to go along with it. But with Matt around, there was no way you could risk it. Glancing from him, to Tiffany, to Kyle, to the ever approaching parking space, one thought rang loud and clear in your head. There was no way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOHMYGAWD!\u201d Tiffany\u2019s screech interrupted your grim realization. Her already large eyes now took up most of her face. The perfect style of her hair fell apart as she grabbed hold of it. \u201cWas this a no parking zone? I can\u2019t get towed, not now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou honestly didn\u2019t know why you were so worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you got jacked, babe,\u201d Matt said, patting Tiffany\u2019s hair back into place. \u201cHere, I\u2019ll call the\u2014\u201d he started, then froze. \u201cShit, I must\u2019ve left my phone in the club! I\u2019ll be right back babe!\u201d He shoot a pair of finger guns at Kyle as he ran back to the entrance. \u201cBrochaco.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Kyle hummed, his hands in his pockets. \u201cDidn\u2019t know he was multilingual.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is terrible. This is terrible!\u201d Tiffany\u2019s scream echoed against the brick walls surrounding the parking lot. \u201c\u2018Left my phone in the club\u2019? That\u2019s the lamest excuse ever! Daisy, get over here, I need you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething compelled you to go to Tiffany\u2019s side and comfort her. Whether it was your car programming or basic compassion was up in the air. \u201cI\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t an excuse,\u201d you said, rubbing your hand on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled away from you, and made a sound almost like a hiss. \u201cOf course it was an excuse! I\u2019ve heard them all! I just want to be friends, I need to use the bathroom, my test results came back positive, my wife\u2019s been in a horrible accident!\u201d She listed them off, increasingly manic. Tears were falling down her face now, her makeup smudged and streaming. \u201cAll of them! It\u2019s just,\u201d she sniffed, \u201cnone of them have been used on me! It always happens to the less attractive girls around me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was uncomfortable to realize that you felt offended. For your and Tiffany\u2019s sake alike, you quickly shook it off. \u201cLook, Tiffany, you\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour car didn\u2019t get stolen,\u201d Kyle butted in, a proud smile spread across his face. \u201cAnd it didn\u2019t get towed. And I\u2019m reasonably sure Matt didn\u2019t bail on you, he seems like an okay guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany sniffed again. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to rush forwards and cover Kyle\u2019s mouth, but your car side fixed your feet to the floor. You did what you could, and glared daggers at Kyle, who continued without pause. \u201cBecause I\u2019m your car. Your other one. Not Daisy, that\u2019s still Sid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait...? Wait, Daisy, you didn\u2019t just get a man, you got a car man!? That\u2019s incredible!\u201d She shot up and hugged you hard enough to make you cough. In an instant, her eyes had dried and began to sparkle again. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you Daisy! You got yourself a HUNK!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you could do to keep from screaming was offer a small smile and nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two are so CUTE together!\u201d Tiffany clapped her hands together to emphasize her already exaggerated words. \u201cI\u2019m so glad I could make this happen! The perfect couple! All you\u2019re missing is...\u201d Tiffany trailed off, and her mouth hung open. \u201cHuh,\u201d was all she could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll you\u2019re missing is a ride. And if my cars are becoming people, does that mean? Oh my god, I\u2019m going to be your car!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany ran forward and scooped you into a hug even more painful than the last. \u201cI\u2019m going to be your car! That\u2019s incredible! I hope I\u2019m a little smart car! That\u2019d be cute, don\u2019t you think!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t believe what you were hearing. \u201cHold on, you actually <i>want</i> to be a car?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor you, babe? No question! Plus, I read in my horoscope that I should embrace change and accept the inevitable. It doesn\u2019t really matter if it\u2019s from last September since I cut it out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced at Kyle, who had already taken out the hammer. If Tiffany was offering... Well, there was no harm in just using her to get home, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Tiffany? How about you pick a car here and we\u2019ll turn you into it! I think it\u2019d be sweet if you decided.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany stood silent for a moment, maybe for the first time in her life. In that moment, you were terrified she\u2019d hug you hard enough to break your spine. Instead she held your waist very gently, and looked you in the eye. \u201cDaisy, you are the best girl friend I\u2019ve ever had. EVER. Now let\u2019s get shopping!\u201d she screeched, and the illusion of meaning was broken. You rolled your eyes the second the turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course she\u2019d see it as another shopping trip.</span></div></div>",

You did not want to risk any confrontation so as you passed an alley you squeezed Kyle's butt to get his attention since you hand was there (when did that get there?) and motioned to the alley.

Are you ashamed of me now?\"  Kyle asked letting his insecurities show.  \"No Kyle, you're just currently fused to Tiffany's ride and didn't want to be around for whatever happens next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh..that's a good idea.

You were glad it was so dark so Kyle couldn't see you.blushing.  But the alley was so narrow that you wouldn't be surprised if the heat you could feel in your face could be felt by Kyle who was still holding onto you, and you him.  You found your hand moving around Kyle's well toned butt absent mindedly but were brought back to reality when you came across something long and hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hammer!\"  You said wrapping your fingers around it's shaft.  \"Oh yeah, forgot I had that.  The bouncer tried to take it from my but when he saw how dangerous my guns were he knew I didn't need that thing to do damage.\"  Kyle said once again showing off his muscles.  You once again felt a small sliver of drool escape your open lips as you looked at him.  In that moment you knew what you had to do.</span></div></div>",

And you gave it a tug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa there!\"  Kyle said in surprise, \"Careful with that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what I'm doing,\"  You said rolling your eyes and putting the claw of the hammer into the nail stuck in your hand and ripped at it with all your strength.  One quick moment of pain and a green flash later and you were yourself again, at least the female plain jane version of yourself in your jeans and 49ers shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, does this mean you aren't my girlfriend anymore?\"  Kyle said sounding disappointed.  \"No dummy!\"  You said harshly before cooling down for a second, after all you kind of asked him to be here.  \"I mean, thanks Kyle, I was in big trouble and you helped me out.  Thanks bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem bro...or should I say...sis!\"  Kyle roared with laughter but you were so grateful for Kyle's help you didn't even facepalm, you just stood there and smiled.  After Kyle's laughing fit you said, \"Come on Kyle, let's get out of hear.  You park your truck in the club parking lot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, why would we take my car?  We got one better, I mean I just have to unfuse and we've got ourselves a sweet ride even better than grandpa's truck!\"  Then before you could stop him, Kyle took the hammer from you and took the claw part to a sparkling green nail that was in his knee.  You knew something about this was probably a bad idea, but before you could put the pieces in your head together there was a flash of green light and the sound of a very loud crashing sound just inches away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap.\"  You said realizing why that was a bad idea.  Just inches away from you where the pink convertible was sitting squeezed into the alley was no a squished pile of metal.  The red muscle car Kyle was fused with had rematerialized on top of it with some force.  It looked like the cars had hit each other going at full speed they were so dented and beaten up with broken glass and parts hanging on by a thread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, we probably can't drive the red car now, let's run to the truck!\"  Kyle said and for once one of his ideas sounded pretty good.  The two of you started to leave the alley when you saw a small army of people approaching brought on by the sound of the crash.  \"Not good,\"  You say, the police might get involved, or worse, Tiffany might see hers and Brad's expensive cars totaled.  You looked down and saw some rats scurry away threw the alley past the crashed cars, but there was no way you were climbing through that without hurting yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do dude?  What's the plan Sid?\"  Kyle said with wide and worried eyes.  In the moment you saw the fusion hammer still in Kyle's hands and knew what you could try to do.  You grabbed the hammer from Kyle and prepared a nail as you slammed the hammer down on it's target.</span></div></div>",

That meant you had to exit through the crash you two had made.  As you watched a small group of rats crawl through the small gaps in the crash you had a stroke of inspiration.  Disgusting and gross inspiration.  Fueled by fear of getting caught and adrenaline, you jumped out and grabbed two unaware rats in your girly hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touchdown!\"' Kyle said holding his hands in the air, \"But why did you do that?\"  There was no time to go into details, hell you hadn't even thought more than 5 seconds ahead.  \"Take this, and give me the hammer.\"  You shoved a rat into Kyle's chest, \"Ew dude, this thing could have cooties or the dysentery or something.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo time to even tell Kyle he was wrong.  You get a nail and before Kyle could protest you slam the hammer through the rat into his chest.  A flash of green light later and at your feet was a foot tall rat man with a vaguely humanoid body and rat claws, tail, and very rat like facial features.  Features you were about to share.  Before Kyle could finish his exclamation of, \"DUDE!\"  You held the nail between your fingers and brought down the hammer through the rat and your thigh.  A moment of pain and a flash of green light later you were face to face with Kyle the rat man.  But time was still of the essence.  You grab Kyle's hand in one claw and desperately wrap your other arm around the hammer that was now the same size as you in the other.  With the sound of humans and sirens behind you, you knew you had to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>RUN RUN RUN!</i>'  Was all you think as your rat lady woman brain shouted as you made your way through a gap between the crashed cars.  After a lot of squeezing, you finally saw the end of the metal maze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd saw a dead end.  \"Dang it!\"  You shout in a voice that almost sounded like a squeak.  There was nowhere to go, but where had all the (other) rats gone?  Kyle crawled over past you to see for himself.  \"Bro!  Look down there!\"  He grabbed his tail and used it as a pointer looking at the dead end of the alley.  Faintly you could see that a bunch of rats seemed to be going a gap in the side of the alley that you were pretty sure led to the sewers.  It wasn't something that sounded fun, but it would be better than being discovered.  \"Or we could try that!\"  Kyle pointed his tail up and you saw a couple of rats seeming to defy gravity as they climbed the vertical brick wall.  You could see Kyle was pointing at an open window 2 floors up.  It seemed the safest and most sanitary place, but there was no way you could carry the hammer up there, you'd have to leave it in the alley and pick it up when the chaos died down.  As you sat in what used to be the trunk of the pink convertible (aka your old butt) you decided what would be the best option.</span></div></div>",

You guessed that it was at least a short enough fall as you watched a few rats now half your size, slid down happy to get away from the noise of the surface world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo Sid.  Let's do this bro!\"  You didn't even notice Kyle had walked up next to you.  He offered his hand and you happily took it.  Sure he wasn't the brightest tool in the box, but there was nobody you'd rather go through this weird and disturbing experience more than your best bud.  You give his claw like hand a tight squeeze and you both along with the hammer dropped down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no idea how far you fell, but you were glad it was so dark you couldn't see the bottom of whatever you were about to go splat against.  Finally after what felt like a lifetime even though it happened over the coarse of maybe a second, you hit the ground.  At least you wished it was the ground, you actually hit some sort of sludge that you instantly knew you didn't want to think about what it was made of.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude!  It stinks so bad down here.  It's worse than the gym after track day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's smells worse than your sister's cooking,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing smells worse than that Sid.\"  Kyle said in an oddly serious tone as you saw him shiver.  \"Wait a second, I can see you, but there's no light down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you fused us with those rats, they must have been radioactive rats with super rat powers!  Quick, try to shoot a web.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head, \"I doubt that's the case, rats can probably see in the dark.  We probably learned that in school at some point...maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's probably right,\"  Kyle said sounding dejected, but a second later he looked at you and perked up, \"You know, even though you fused with a nasty rat, you look pretty cute.  I'm proud to call you my girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M NOT YOUR GIRLFRIEND!\"  You squealed, \"Well you kind of had to be my boyfriend because of weird magic when I was fused with the car, but it's over.  It's done, I officially break up with you!\"  Kyle kicked some muck in annoyance, \"Dang, I didn't even get to try to grope all your boobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All my boobs?\"  You said and for the first time since you fused with the rat you actually got a good look at yourself.  You were still obviously still female based on the two small bumps on your brown furred chest with tiny pink nipples sticking out.  But below those were two boobs, and below them another set.  Being very carful of your claws you touched your face, it was mostly covered in fur and you had an extended face, especially in the nose area.  You even had ears that really stuck out and were a little rounded.  Looking at yourself you were disappointed that apparently your clothes didn't change with you this time, but even if they had they'd be ruined forever by the sewers so it didn't make much of a difference for now you guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Kyle, let's figure out how to get out of this mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Sid, I think I just realized that we have a bit of a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what problem is that?\"  You said wondering how this day could get worse.</span></div></div>",

The two of you dove down into the muck and mire of the sewer for hours desperately looking and feeling for the magical fusion hammer that you'd used to turn into rat people but after nearly a full day with no sleep you two had found nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's it, we're rats forever.

Plus if we can get some chairs down here this sewer set up won't be so bad.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over the next few weeks you and Kyle tried to make the many mile journey back to your house for the magic tools to maybe transform yourselves back, but after failing to sneak into some cars and almost getting ran over the two of you decided it was for the best to live your lives as rat people rather than risk them and lose them.  You guys had to resort to dumpster diving for food, but so many restaurants threw out perfectly good (at least by yours and Kyle's teenage boy standards) food that you guys actually ate well.  After just eating dumpster food and sleeping in the muck you guys knew you needed to change, to evolve.  But you couldn't do it magically.  So instead of getting the magic toolbox you got the second best thing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA real toolbox.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found a good section of the sewer that was near a lot of major chain stores and after a lot of scouting and more hard work than the two of you had done in your lives you managed to get tools and materials to build with them.  After a lot of trial and error you guys had managed to build some beds, chairs, and tables with cloth taken from dumpsters used as padding.  A few months later you managed to get a good haul of a working electronic tablet being thrown out with a charger.  Thankfully your section of the sewer had an electrical outlet and was below a coffee shop with free wifi.  While living as rat man and rat woman in the sewer you had managed to work your self back into a place you were as humans.  Eating expired food and watching youtube all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen one day, on the year anniversary of you guys finding the magic toolbox and your lives changing forever you guys celebrated with some cheap wine and stale beer that was being tossed out.  You got crazy drunk of the first time in a year and it took that to do what came next.  You did what you had once thought of doing that day a year ago in the club.  You kissed Kyle.  Maybe it was the alcohol, maybe it was a year of rat estrogen running through your veins, but one thing you knew is that you were in this with Kyle and you had a bond that could never be ripped apart.  And with some liquid courage you decided you might as well take the next step.  The next day you pushed your beds together into one and got to work making a family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime goes by in the blink of an eye.  Before you know it it's fourteen years later.  You have four teenagers living under your concrete roof all named after classic artists, Cash, Elvis, Kanye, and Beyonce.  You and Kyle would get your kids food (pizza was their favorite because you had raised them to be sane rat people).  And at when you weren't out doing that you were all gathered around the tablet watching nostalgic old shows.  The kids absolutely loved kung fu stuff.  You and Kyle even started training them in the art of the ninja based thanks to tutorial videos.  You crafted the kids their own weapons to fight with.  One day the four announce that they wanted to go to the surface world to fight crime.  You tried to stop them being the doting mother you were, but their minds were made up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four teenagers went to the surface world and fought crime and defended the little people (even though they were only about 1 foot tall themselves but dang it they were that good).  With Kyle at your side you'd lay back in bed and watch grainy footage of them on the tablet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've had a good run, haven't we Sydney.\"  Kyle said watching a tiny rat blur beat up some sort of mouse like robot, a humanoid rhino, and some sort of pig with horns..the world had changed a lot in your 15 years unground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaned over and kissed Kyle, \"It wasn't bad, I'm happy to be your girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See!  Told you so bro.\"   Kyle said before turning on what the two have you had dubbed the 'Happily Ever After' playlist on the tablet.</span></div></div>",

Orinoco casually walked up the steps to your porch and starts purring louder than your engine ever could and starts walking through your legs in a figure eight pattern, her favorite move.  You couldn't stop yourself from smiling, \"Well, at least my sudden change in gender didn't scare you off cutie.\"  You bent down and started petting your favorite neighbor.  You'd always had a soft sport for cats, but your parents never let you have a pet growing up for fear of it destroying all of their stuff.  When you graduated one of the first things you wanted to do was get a cat, but then you found out Kyle was allergic and it'd be kind of crummy of you to get something that made him miserable, especially since he and his dad were some of the key reasons you guys even had the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continued to pet Orinoco and lamenting what might have been you see Orinoco drop something fuzzy down at your feet, it seemed to be her favorite toy.  A toy squirrel stuffed with catnip, she loved to know on that thing and you enjoyed tossing a few feet and letting her bring it back.  Before Orinoco you didn't know that cats liked to play fetch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to drop the hammer so you could get both hands in on the Orinoco love but thought suddenly took over your mind,  a curious seed that began to grow and take over your mind in an instant.  \"I could fuse with you.\"  You said in a sing song voice to Orinoco.  Sat yourself down on the porch and put Orinoco on your lap after she finished scratching some fleas.  Orinoco actually rubbed her face against your new breasts, still seeming completely unfused at her favorite human's gender change.  As the black and with white paws continued to share the love you thought of sharing a lot more than that as you gentle held the nail in the palm of your hand and held it against Orinoco's neck.  \"Don't worry, this won't hurt, I think.  And if it does I'll take the worst of it.\"  You said in a calm voice as you shook with anticipation on the inside as you brought down the hammer.  A flash of green light later and you took in your new body.</span></div></div>",

It was both wonderful and disgusting as the taste of wet and maybe mildewy cloth soaked in your mouth, but inside that cloth was heaven.  It was like you were on a new plane of existence.  The rational part of your brain told you it must be the catnip toy Orinoco had in her mouth meaning the fusion was a success, but who cared about that, you had a new favorite toy to enjoy.  You laid on your back and rolled back and forth enjoying your high.  <i>Is this how Haylee feels all the time?</i>  You thought thinking of Kyle's constantly high sister.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enjoyed your quiet bliss until you heard the sound of the rich neighbors across the street, Brad and Tiffany, rev up Brad's fancy red muscle car making so much noise you were practically forced to open your eyes, and when you did you finally saw what your body had become.</span></div></div>",

And don't talk about hooking up with my bro, sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're 18 right?\"  Kyle nodded, Haylee smiled, \"Good enough for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe your ears, Haylee wanted to hook up with you?  Hell yeah.  She was a hot older lady who could probably teach you stuff.  Plus you could really annoy Kyle by doing it and after having to kiss him, you were all up for getting back at him somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley looked like she was about to head for the door when she stopped and said, \"Well, I just came over to find out if you, Sid, and the house were still alive.  But now that I know you've got yourself a girlfriend, I think that's cause to celebrate.  After all I never thought this day would come.  Hell mom and dad probably didn't think this would ever happen.  They'll get a kick out of the news.  So let me tell you what we're going to do to celebrate.</span></div></div>",

What you're wearing now looks like guy clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>That's because I'm a guy and they are my actual clothes.</i>' you thought before making up an excuse, \"No need to do that Haylee, I'm wearing guy clothes because...I'm working with Kyle to fix the shelf!\"  Thankfully the truth was an easy enough excuse to come up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, isn't the cute, a little couple's project for you two, but trust me.  Let the man build that thingy over there and let's find you something to look good in.  Hell it'll end up being just as much a gift for Kyle as it is you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle's ears perked up and his face turned red thinking about his 'girlfriend' pretend as you may be, showing up in something sexy.  \"Yeah!  You two go and get something special for you.  I'll be the man of the house and fix this all on my own!\"  Kyle flexed his nearly non existent muscles and started looking in the magic tool box for whatever he would need to actually fix the shelf.  You really didn't want to see why trouble Kyle could get into without your supervision, but Haylee had already practically pushed you out the door.  Next thing you knew, you were on your way to some clothing store.  On the way Haylee told you a few stories about Kyle, some of which you already knew, but she did tell you a good story about when she made him put on a dress and makeup when he was younger.  You got a good laugh about it and couldn't wait to make fun of Kyle to his face, but then you remembered that Haylee was about to do the exact same thing to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you go to the women's clothing store she eyed you up and down and grabbed a few dresses to take into the dressing room.  You couldn't believe you were about to have to try on a dress, and then to make matters more awkward Haylee entered the same dressing room with you.  \"You don't mind if we share?  It's just us girls after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, totally.  Just us girls.  The two of us are indeed girls.\"  You said as you watched Haylee begin to change in front of you.  You stared for a few seconds before remembering you were supposed to be changing too.  You took off your shirt and Haylee asked, \"Like, why aren't you wearing a bra?  You've got a cute pair that needs support.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...uh...all my bra's...got destroyed after the earthquake.  Yeah, that's what happened.\"  Haylee looked at you curiously before nodding knowingly, \"I've heard that can happen.  Tough break.  We'll get you one to go with whatever dress you pick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus the seemingly never ending wave of dresses began.  Dresses of all sorts of shapes and colors.  Some of them you were pretty sure you wore backwards or sideways but Haylee was either too high or polite to say anything.  Finally Haylee proclaimed that a really lacy black dress with see through parts over everything but the chest and waist area.  Hayley also made you get a black set of lingerie as an additional gift.  \"Thanks.\"  You said dryly, \"You really shouldn't have.\"  You said on the ride back to your place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it,\"  Haylee said as she pulled up to your home, \"Have fun with Kyle, don't be afraid to make a man out of him.  Oh, and if you see Sid, tell him to ring me up.\"  Haylee smiled as she let you out of the car.  \"I'll definitely call you...I mean tell Sid to call you.\"  And with that Haylee left.  You started to slowly make your way into the house wondering if you could somehow change back to your guy clothes before Kyle saw you, but then you remembered that you just left the most immature and dumb person you know alone in the house with a box of magical tools.  You run into the house and into the kitchen and sure enough, Kyle had been tinkering.</span></div></div>",

I'm back!\" You call out as you enter the house, \"Get the wrench, I want to change back now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut only silence greeted you as you walked through the house and into the kitchen, where the now familiar mess awaited you. It looked like your 'man' hadn't even touched the cabinet, it's intact but fallen frame still sitting on the counter where you had left it before all this wackiness had begun. You roll your eyes and walk out, quickly stomping up the stairs to your room, eager to get rid of all these girl clothes and put on your original clothing (even though it too, was built for the woman you now were at least it was better than the nonsense you were wearing now).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut maybe you'd keep these. Just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly enter your room and close the door behind you, locking it. And then you slide your desk chair in front of the doorknob, just in case. You do a quick search through your bedroom and closet, and confident that Kyle is not perving, begin to slide off your gifted clothes, though you take your time to appreciate your new curves and feminine physique. You really pull off the 'girl next door' look, as the magical wrench clearly changed more than just your gender and breast size. You ass is shapely, your legs toned and slender, your lips just the right amount of kissable, and your blonde hair vibrant as it hangs down to your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take more than a few moments to explore your body in the privacy of your bedroom, but you shy away from fingering the slit between your legs. You're not ready for that yet. Instead you take a few pictures of yourself in various stages of undress before finally you're completely nude. You soon around a few times and you can't help but giggle quietly. Despite the weirdness of the past couple of hours, you had to admit it had been surprisingly fun. Maybe when there isn't a mess in the kitchen and Kyle isn't around, you'd spend a little more time in your female form. But right now you needed to take care of said mess, and you finish your private modelling session, slipping your old clothes back on and smiling at their familiar comfort. You shove your more decidedly female clothes back into the bags and stick them at the back of your closet before leaving your bedroom, half expecting to run into Kyle trying to keep through the door. But there's just the empty hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown and walk down the hall, sticking your head into Kyle's messy room, but aside from the piles of clothes everywhere, it's empty. The upstairs bathroom is empty as well, as well as the spare bedroom. You start to grow concerned, so you head back downstairs, finding the living room empty and silent, the downstairs bathroom vacant, and Kyle's car is still in his parking spot. The only other place he could be would be the basement. Maybe he went down there to see if there were any other magic items?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk into the kitchen and pass the mess of tools on the floor. You cast them a sideward glance and then stop in your tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was Kyle, six inches tall once more, jumping up and down next to the toolbox, arms waving frantically. But something was wrong.</span></div></div>",

Your brain takes a moment to process things, as you crouch down on your knees as carefully as you did earlier as you peer closer. You ignore the tiny woman's cries of distress as you stare at her body. It's clearly Kyle, his features were now female but not so radically changed that he, she looked like a different person. Her clothes were the same as what he had worn before, just slightly feminine like your own. Kyle's black hair wasn't much longer than your own, his miniature breasts flopping up and down without the support of a bra, his face cute with just a hint of boyishness. He, much like you, looked very much like the girl next door. Just smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\" You say, and Kyle, or rather Kylie at this point, covers her tiny ears and spins away, and you kick yourself mentally. \"Shit, sorry dude!\" You say quietly, and she turns around to flip you the bird, though it just looks adorable at that size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to see what it felt like! And then I was almost smaller than I was before! So I wanted to make myself talked and it worked the first time...but then I thought I'd just make myself talked enough to make putting the cabinet up super easy but my fingers ipped and I ended up small again! Dude, help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes at Kyle's miniscule form and think that this might be an appropriate punishment for his bad ideas. For now, at least. But the reasonable side of your mind is telling you to just change you both back to normal before any other weirdness happens.</span></div></div>",

He was like the perfect little living doll, it'd be a shame not to leave him like this to admire at least for a little while.  Kyle noticed you hesitate and called out, \"Come on bro!  Help a bro out!  It's what a good girlfriend would do!\"  Suddenly the cute little girl looked a lot more annoying to you as she laughed at her own joke.  You were still annoyed that Kyle had made you pretend to be his girlfriend in front of Haylee, unconsciously you wiped you lip as though to get the last of Kyle off of them from when you had to kiss him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, your 'girlfriend' is just so tired today, she needs a break.  So she's going to enjoy some alone time in her room.  Feel free to do the same, not that you'll make much of a mess to clean up at your size.\"  You laugh to yourself as you stand to leave.  Kyle calls out one more time, \"WAIT!  I shouldn't have done that!  My bad bro!  My bad.\"  You saw that Kyle did seem sorry and a little scared, but your mind was made up, he messed with you, so you were gonna mess with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you in the morning,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you can't leave me like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, you're right.\"  You turn and head to the fridge and after a little bit of prep you put together a plate with some leftover spaghetti and a plastic cup full of beer that Kyle might be able to submerge himself in if he tried hard enough.  \"Good night.\"  You said as you shut the door, you were pretty sure you heard some curse words on the other side, but you didn't care, to you this was the funniest prank you'd ever pulled and what made it better was Kyle pulled it on himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got to your room you cursed yourself when you realized you left the Gender Switching Socket Wrench in the kitchen with Kyle.  Not wanting to go back and get it and ruin your cool dramatic exit you smiled when you realized your alone lady time was happening sooner than you thought.  You excitedly stripped off your clothes and jumped into bed where you let your hands explore to your hearts content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning you woke up in a sticky and sweaty haze.  You went to take a shower and found it to be just as much fun as your personal adventure last night.  After throwing on some boxers, sweat pants, and t shirt without even putting on the bra and panties Haylee had so kindly gotten you yesterday as you made your way to the kitchen to finally fix Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you walked in you heard a sluring voice call out, \"Hey!  Hey!  There yous are!\"  You got on your knees to look at Kyle who looked a bit out of it after making a make shift bed out of a dirty wash rag that was on the floor.  You also noticed that the cup of beer had been almost entirely drunk, very impressive considering Kyle's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn me back now you, you are.  You're only a girl a day and your being, you're being a total bish.\"  Kyle slurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and rolled your eyes at the cute small woman, you thought about letting Kyle sober up, but you knew him, he'd probably do something dumber than normal if you didn't fix him now.  \"All right, all right.\"  You said grabbing the tape measure and putting it at Kyle's feet and slowly you pulled it up.  Deciding to prank him a little more you said, \"How about 4 feet tall?  That seems tall enough right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO Sid!  Make me my real hight!  Hell make me giant!\"  And the tiny drunk woman kicked you in the shin out of frustration.</span></div></div>",

You realize that you're smaller than you had been as a guy because you have to stand on your tiptoes to get the tool up there. You have a brief thought about making yourself taller but you decide not to give Kyle the satisfaction of seeing you needing the tape measure as well. You turn around and smile at him. Her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, behave and be a good girl, 'honey' and I'll make you big again!\" You say in the sweetest girlfriend voice you can manage, ignoring the flurry of curses and screams of rage Kyle flings at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next order or business, now that he was taken out of the equation, was returning to normal yourself. You reach down and grab the Gender Changing Wrench and cautiously attach it to your crotch, glancing at Kyle's small form as she posted in silence, a cute micro glare making you giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tense up your arm to turn, but stop.

But then again, you really do need to take care of the current mess, not to mention what might happen if you have any further unannounced visitors.

And then to put the cherry on top of the 'annoy Kyle' sunday, you got out your phone and called his sister in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Haylee, this is Sid.  Sidney told me I should give you a ring so I wanted to know if you wanted to go out sometime.

You made sure Kyle was standing at the end of it and extended it up to his normal hight, you even gave him an extra inch as a show of good faith to your roommate.  You enjoyed watching the 6 inch tall woman grow and grow until she was normal human hight, it was a nice rush watching the cleave grow up and up closer to your eyes, and you made sure to look the entire time.  \"Dude.\"  Kyle said and you looked up to his pretty eyes.  \"Yeah dude?\"  You replied.  \"Where's the Gender Changing Wrench thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up on the fridge <i>Kylie</i>, I'll grab it for you,\"  You were about to reach for it when Kyle said, \"Bro I've got it, I'd like to enjoy reaching for some stuff on my own.\"  Sure enough Kyle got uncomfortably close to the fridge mashing his breasts against it as he got on his toes to reach the socket wrench.  And to show he could get to the top shelf, he got some top shelf vodka (which was actually incredibly cheap) and some cereal and started to dig in.  Suddenly you heard a car horn at your front door.  \"Looks like that's my date.  You know, your sister.\"  You said rubbing it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, dude, whatever.\"  Kyle tried to brush it off, but you were satisfied knowing you were definitely annoying him with this date.  With a spring in your step you left the house and jumped in Haylee's car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley decided to take you to Olive Garden for food, you were feeling bad that you were going to a nice place and you were just dressed in your t shirt and sweats, but thankfully Haylee didn't care and the restaurant didn't kick you out for not dressing fancy enough.  It seemed that after the earthquake yesterday the place wasn't very busy, in fact there was barely anyone there besides you and Haylee and the staff so you guys got a nice and secluded seat in the corner.  Very romantic you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two had just sat down and were about to dig in on breadsticks when something caught your eye.</span></div></div>",

You mumbled something unintelligent in reply.  Before you could do anything to stop it, Kylie was pulling up a chair right next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me lady, you're not welcome here.

Your eyes were open in panic and with one eye you could see Kyle's unblinking eye contact with a devious glint in his eye, and out of the other you saw Haylee grow more and more angry before she stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally pulled away from 'Kylie' and went after Haylee, \"Wait, I swear this isn't what it looks like!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I think it's exactly what it looks like, what else could it be?\"  Hayley paused for a minute before she left the restaurant, \"You know, I actually thought you were a good guy, but I guess I'm just attracted to losers.  I hope you don't rub off on my brother, he's a good kid.  An idiot, but a good kid.\"  And with that Haylee left, you tried to chase after her to tell her the truth, to tell her everything, but Kyle had dug his claws into your arm.  \"No no no, you don't get to leave me as a shrunken lady AND do my sister bro.  Now we're even.  Let's get out of here.  I'll give you a ride.\"  Kyle started to leave the restaurant ushering you out with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even?  What the hell are you talking about?  I'm furious at you!\"  You said angerly getting into Kyle's car since your ride in Haylee had just left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, like I just said bro, you freaking left me stuck as a shrunken lady with nothing but a washrag and cereal.  I could have died!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you are being a big baby!  Died?!  That's being freaking ridiculous?  What was going to kill you?

It's against the bro code!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you're just being petty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh uh!\"  Kyle brilliantly retorted as the two of you pulled up in the driveway.  You were both about as mad as you had ever been with each other.  Both of you in quiet fury got out of the car and walked to the front door.  Slowly at first, but the slow steps turned into a stride that turned into a sprint as you both went through the front door at the same time not even bothering to close the door and pushing each other on the way to the kitchen with the tool box where you were both ready to pay the other back.  You weren't even sure who grabbed what, but you both went after the other and in one move the fight was over.  You looked at each other, the tools you used, and the damage you had done.</span></div></div>",

You were so mad it seemed you'd grabbed a saw from the toolbox and in two sweeping slashes had managed to cut off both of his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen seeing Kyle's feminine arms on the ground suddenly washed all the anger away.  In an instant, anger was replaced by fear and sorrow.  \"Oh my god, oh my god, I'm so sorry man!  I didn't mean to I just...I...\"  The woman before you who had no arms attached to her torso looked to be in shock.  You were so shocked at the horrifying image, you didn't even notice Kyle wasn't bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro...\"  Kyle said weakly, \"I can't believe you just did that Sid.  Not cool.  Not cool.\"  Then Kyle started to fall to his knees but you managed to catch him before his long flowing hair could hit the ground.  With tears now falling freely you just kept saying, \"I'm so sorry, I was stupid.  We were both stupid, but I was really stupid.  I'm sorry man, what I did wasn't cool.  Not changing you back and then going after your sister when I knew it'd make you mad.  I just...I just wish...I'd give anything to get you back man.  Don't die on me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle slowly opened his eyes, and to your surprise he was smiling.  As Kylie you were taken aback by how pretty a smile he had.  \"Sid, there's one thing, I need to tell you before I...before I...\"  Kyle's eyes began to close.  You leaned in close and asked, \"What is it?  Please, say something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Kyle's eyes opened with and with a strong voice not befitting someone who had just had their arms cut off said, \"I still have control of my arms dumbass.\"  And wiping the tears from your eyes you turned and saw that much like out of a horror movie, Kyle's arms were moving, and what more they were moving with a purpose.</span></div></div>",

If so it could be worse, it didn't hurt.  Although it felt like you were being held down by something.  And you sense that something was happening around you.  You tried to concentrade and could make out Kyle's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro are you there?  Oh man you're not waking up?  Oh man I didn't want to kill you, but...you're not moving.  Your hearts still beating and your breathing, but you're not doing anything.  Are you brain dead?    Did the pliers pull out your brain?  Oh man, bro I think it did!  I think you're thoughts or...your ghost, or your soul or something is stuck in the pliers!  Bro that's totally it!  I hope.  Or else I'm probably going to jail.  Let me just put you back in your body.\"  You suddenly felt as though you were being moved, and with some more concentration you felt like you could see again.  You could see yourself being lowered back to your body, but before you were put back in, you were pulled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa whoa, man, this is too good.  I've an idea I think.

BRB.\"  With that Kyle put the Soul Grabbing Pliers on the table with your soul stuck in them unable to leave and go back to your body...hell any body until Kyle let you go.  In the pliers you didn't have a sense of time, you just sat there.  It could have been minutes or hours, but finally Kyle came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got the perfect place to put you bro.

In a panic you said, \"Crap!  Someone's coming, hide!\"  But before you could so much as hide behind a chair leg, a heeled leg stepped into the kitchen.

And sure enough she put the tape at your feet and stretched it up to about your normal hight before she snapped it closed.  You shot up and up and up until you were eye level with Haylee.  \"Wait, I thought I was taller than you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaylee smirked, \"I don't like my boyfriend to be taller than me, makes kissing a pain in the neck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?

Don't wait up.\"  Haylee stood up and grabbed your arm and you happily followed her to the front door.  \"Wait!  You forgot to use the tape measure on me!  Oh come on, you could at least give me my dick back!\"  The tiny voice called form the kitchen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you tonight...or if I'm lucky, tomorrow.\"  You shouted back not even trying to hide the enormous grin on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?  No!  Ewww!\"  Was the last thing you heard before you left with your new girlfriend.  You didn't even feel the need to go out to dinner after the last outing went so badly.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You and Kyle ungracefully roll out onto hard, cold plastic and...grass? Or rather, plastic grass. You both quickly re-collect yourselves and stand up, spinning around to figure out just where you were. From this point of view you can't see much, other than cracked yellow-white paint against the enormous backdrop of Haylee's bedroom, but as you turn to Kyle you can see that you are both somewhere she recognizes and is terrified of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, we're-\" She begins, but is cut off by Haylee, who looms over the top of the structure. Her movements are a bit clumsy as her weight moves the entire structure a few inches, but sends you and Kyle careening across the lawn of fake grass as you try to stay upright. Her eyes are slightly un-focused and dull, it's clear that Haylee is extremely high, and that is saying something, you knew that Haylee had, over the years, built up a bit of a tolerance. She must have taken being 'cheated on' harder than you or Kyle could have ever predicted. Or maybe it was just the straw that broke her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you both love each other so much, let's see how compatible you are in the long term!\" She says with a lopsided grin that sends a chill down your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, this is her dollhouse!\" Kyle says as she walks back to your side, and you suddenly see it now. The tiny, sandpaper shingled roof, the hand cut windows, the carvings around them. And beyond, in the shadowy interior, you see hallways and rooms filled with miniature furniture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The whore speaks! Why yes, little slut, this is my dollhouse...and your new home! You're both so lucky! Think of it as a newlywed present from me, your glorious goddess that you cheated on, to you, my new little family of toys!\" Haylee's voice is playful but anyone could have heard how fake it sounded. No, the giantess looming over you, that could kill you in an instant, was mad. Very mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haylee!\" Kyle suddenly shouts, waving her arms and jumping up and down like an idiot. You enjoy the show of her breasts bouncing but mentally facepalm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She is looking right at us, you bimbo' You think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haylee! It's me, Kyle! Your brother!\" She says, and suddenly you can't believe the simply genius of it. Surely Haylee will realize how absurd this all is and that it was all a prank...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Hayle simply sends down a massive finger and knocks Kyle to the ground. You quickly pull her back up to her feet and you both stare up at Haylee's sneering face, terrified at the power she has over you. It's clear that she's so high that she might not even realize this is happening, which is even more terrifying. What happens if she decides to play rough? You and Kyle are both extremely fragile at this size, one clumsy move and the two of you could end up as paste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No talking, skank! Now, as I was saying...\" Haylee snarls before looking away for a moment, her enormous, potentially deadly hands sliding behind the roof of the house and you can hear her fumbling with something, along with a metallic clink before the world starts to move again. You grab Kyle and sink to your knees, stabilizing yourselves against the new movement as a massive section of wall swings around the right side of the dollhouse. It was already high quality, but apparently it opened as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There! Now I can see!\" Haylee booms again, \"Now, as I was saying, my grandfather built me this when I was a little girl! I don't play with it anymore, but now I can give it to two pathetic little souls in need of a home! Oh it's so romantic! She sneers. Then a giant telephone pole of a finger slides down and points to the gaping front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on in. Carry her.\" Haylee growls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Kyle, who simply stares back, her feminine face pale and terrified, just as yours must be. With an apologetic shrug, you stand up and then clumsily take Kyle in your arms like a stereotypical groom would, and carry her into the dollhouse. Your tiny feet clack against old wood and you try to get a glimpse of your surroundings in the shadowy conditions before you and Kyle are bought blinded by the light as Haylee flips on a flashlight. Kyle yelps if fear as you drop her unceremoniously on the floor as you try to shield your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but the lights don't work anymore! Anyways, welcome to your new home, cheater and slut! Now, I want you to...\"</span></div></div>",

As soon as she was gone you turned to Kyle, \"We gotta get out of here!\"  You ran out of the old dollhouse and tried to make a plan to escape.  You were leaning towards just running out the door and running as fast as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, that's not gonna work.\"  Kyle said sounding down and out.  \"My sis lives miles away and we're freaking tiny people.  No way would we make it without getting squished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what the hell are we gonna do?  Your sister is acting like a phycho, I might rather stare down crossing the highway than be at her mercy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now you know why I didn't want you dating her.\"  Kyle said with a really smug smile gracing his pretty face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please, you just didn't want me to bang your sister and rub it in your face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ju de man you you just...nuh uh!\"  Kyle very eloquently said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well, for what it's worth, I kinda wish I didn't ask her out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're only saying that because we were captured by Haylee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh,\"  You said as you both awkwardly laughed.  It felt good to laugh in the face of life stuck in a dollhouse.  After that awkward giggle ended Kyle said trying to be optimistic, \"I don't think we'll be stuck here forever.  Haylee just really high.  Like even more messed up than normal so I think if we just keep her happy until she sleeps, wakes up, and hopefully sobers up a little bit then maybe she'll finally listen to our words and let us go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure about the letting us go part, but that's probably the only chance we have I guess.\"  You both shook hands agreeing to try to get out of this mess when Haylee came back in the room.  She set up a folding chair in front of the dollhouse and had a bowl full of popcorn, a plate of what you would bet were pot brownies, and some wine she was drinking straight out of the bottle.  \"This is going to be better than Big Brother.  All right 'Flake and the Fluzy', dance for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Kyle looked at each other and both knew what to do as you reluctantly began to entertain your captor.</span></div></div>",

You look up at the bleary eyed girl that you had taken out to dinner just a short while ago, and then back to the guy-turned girl currently pushing his/her sizable boobs against your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, when in Rome...' You think to yourself as Kyle looks up at you with wide brown eyes. You take one last look at Haylee and then with as much enthusiasm as you can manage, you wrap your arms around Kyle and press your lips against his! Your friend struggles for a moment, his smaller body wiggling against yours as he tries to pull away, but you press your left hand against the back of his raven maned head and push it against yours. He tries to complain but only gets out a few panicked muffled sounds before you manage to calm him down by staring at him as apologetically as you can, flashing your eyes towards Haylee and the thunderous crack of a pork-rind being crushed by her teeth. Kyle seems to get the message and calms down, ceasing his struggles as he runs his own slender arms around your waist and leans into you, breasts pushing harder against you as you try really, really REALLY hard not to get, well, hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Kyle tastes REALLY nice, you realize, and his lips are so soft. He feel him lean into you even more and you swear that you heard a feminine moan, though with the blood pounding in your ears and...elsewhere, you may have just imagined it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is too great!\" Haylee cackles from above and with a few swipes of her phone you hear the sultry sounds of a saxophone blaring from it's speakers. It was that one song, the really romantic one from the 80s that was only really famous because of the opening saxophone. But you don't have time to really focus on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle slowly slides out of the kiss and lays his head against your chest as he begins to sway, and you can tell that he knows that you've got a raging hard-on. Hell, anyone could, but he is either REALLY dedicated to playing along, or...maybe he's also turned on? He didn't exactly struggle during your protective embrace during your imprisonment in the jar...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, you find yourself slowly swaying and turning in a circle in the foyer of your current residence as your tormentor turns her phone's flashlight on and shines it down upon the two of you, blinding out the rest of the world as she giggles evily from on high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the song stops you and Kyle...</span></div></div>",

You chance a peek and you see Kyle's eyes are still closed but they're not scrunched like you expected. No, instead he looks...well he looks like he's enjoying it. You. But finally you break off the kiss and Kyle gives a slight little moan of disappointment as you pull away, but he manages to hook his smaller fingers between yours on your left hand to keep you from pulling all the way away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, THAT was certainly something!\" Hayley says with a tremble in her voice as the two of you look up at her. She fights back a sniffle and wipes a stray tear from her eye. You feel Kyle give your hand a slight squeeze and you glance over to see him give you a small knowing smile that shows his perfect white teeth behind those plump lips. But before you can do anything else, or even will the raging hard-on in your pants away, Hayley turns her attention back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think that was a good opener, but what do you have next? What is the 'Little Couple' going to do next?\" She says and you hear the dangerous edge creep back into her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh\" You mutter as you look at Kyle, who simply gives you an animated shrug that sends his generously sized breasts jiggling.

It's either play Hayley's sick little game or get squished, and at least it could be something you enjoy doing, even if you'll never be able to look at Kyle the same way again.

Everything is almost to scale, and has a pretty decent level of detail. It almost looks like an actual house! But your wandering gaze returns to Kyle as you reach the couch and you both slide down onto it. It's pretty uncomfortable, the 'cushions' are little more than just two pieces of fabric over a formless lump of cotton, and the couch itself is just a wood frame covered in cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you're determined to make it work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment you slide a hand onto Kyle's leg and you're surprised to hear him giggle and lean in. You lock lips once more and with a sideways glance to Hayley's massive leering face you begin to kiss more passionately, more intensely as both your hands slide across Kyle's body while his own slides across yours. And before you realize it, there's something soft in your pants gripping something that was just a second ago very painful. But the pressure is released and you look down, seeing your jeans unbuttoned and Kyle's hand buried in your pants. PArt of you, the sane part that wants to deny everything that has happened today, tells you to be freaked out, but the larger part of you continues to go with it as Kyle's hand gently works your cock up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slide a hand up his shirt and get a nice, full handful of breast flesh. It's soft and warm and nothing like you had expected. You squeeze it, and Kyle moans in pleasure as he leans further into you. Suddenly you feel your member pulsing and you grab Kyle's ass with another hand, causing him to squeal as you find your own release. Kyle let's loose a girlish gasp and suddenly you're very tempted to remove his pants, as well as your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove, you barely register the giggling giant or the phone she's holding.

It felt overwhelming, you could not think of a way you were going to get out of this, but you took some solace in the fact if you were in this mess you were at least sort of comforted that you were in this crummy spot with your best bro and hot chick.  Sure they were the same person but that couldn't be helped right now.  As Haylee turned up the brightness and stared at the two of you intently you held Kyle close and said softly, \"Well, she didn't squish us the first time, lets try kissing again, maybe she'll leave us alone then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the hairs on the back of your neck tingle as you felt the warm air from Kyle's mouth on your ear as he said, \"You got it bro.\"  And the two of your wrapped your arms around each other in a weird awkward hug, and then you bent your head down to kiss the small woman again.  You kissed and you kissed like your life depended on it, and it kind of did.  As you kissed you felt yourself getting so into it you started moving your hands all over each other's bodies.  You don't know how long you wear kissing, but your mouth was actually starting to get really tired when the room suddenly cooled down.  The flashlight was off of you and you could hear a woman crying.  You stopped the kiss and looked down to see if it was Kyle, but that didn't make sense since the crying seemed to be coming from all around.  Kyle pointed at a window in the dollhouse and you looked through it to see Haylee was on her bed sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough tears and sobs you could make out the words Haylee was saying, \"I'm...so sorrrrrry!  I...I thought that she was the other woman...but now I know.  I was the other woman the whole time!\"  Haylee blow her nose into an old pillow.  \"I'm sorry Sid, I did you wrong!  I presumed you into going out with me when you were obviously already in love!  And I tried to tear you apart!  I'm so sorry!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood in the dollhouse slack jawed, you looked over to Kyle who shrugged, \"She's probably had too much to drink on top of her usual pot smoking.  Or maybe she's on her period, I don't know.  My sister's a little crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I think i agree on the crazy part.</i>  You thought to yourself as you tried to wave at Haylee to get her attention, once she wiped her nose and looked at you with her red eyes you shouted so she could here and lied, \"I'm so sorry that...things got weird with us.  I totally didn't mean to mislead you or anything.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaylee nodded, she seemed to have finally gotten all the tears out of her system, \"It's ok, I'm so sorry I kidnapped you and your love, I'm sorry.  I promise that as long as you two are tiny I'll do whatever I can to take care of you.  I'll figure out whatever Egyptian curse or government conspiracy shrunk you and undo it.  And until then I promise to take super good care of you!  I'll get you food, you can live in my room, I'll even raise your babies for you, I can be a pretty good babysitter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...wait, babies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm too young to be a dad!\"  Kyle said wiping off your saliva that was still on his face as though that was going to get him pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you two worry your pretty little heads.  I'll go ahead and grab you two some little people food.  And no matter what happens you still have each other!  Love will prevail!\"  Haylee said and left the room leaving you and Kyle alone in the dollhouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok...so I don't think she's going to kill us.  That's good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't tried her cooking,\"  Kyle said but he seemed to be happy getting squashed wasn't in his immediate future.  \"So let's just sit back and relax and enjoy life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just saying we don't have to get in a rush to get back to the house and the tools.  Think about it, at this size we've got no responsibilities, no classes we have to go to, no repairing the house.  We can sit back and let my sister wait on us hand and foot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you'll be stuck as a tiny woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle shrugged and looked down at his boobs, \"There are worse ways to spend some time, besides, it's not going to be forever.  We'll eventually get Haylee to take to the house and turn us back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to admit, there were worse fates than being taken care of by a giant woman while rooming with a hot chick who seemed to like to fondle herself.

It clearly wasn't the living room of two immediate post high school eighteen years old boys. Clearly Kyle had gone on a actually intelligent rampage across the house with the tools while you were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a slight creak from behind and above, and you turn as quickly as you could, your breasts swinging painfully as you look up. And then your jaw drops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, leaning seductively on the banister, is the most gorgeous woman you've ever seen. Her breasts are huge, clearly HH cups that threaten to spill out of the white bathrobe that is clearly tied as loose as it can be. Her face is just the right kind of angular, high cheekbones and exquisite lips topped by glittering green eyes. Black hair flowed down her back, clearly longer than your own shoulder length cut. The robe cover most of the rest of her body, but one incredible leg just though the slit of the robe. The woman's full lips part into a perfect smile and she softly bites her right index finger. You simply stare as something warm and strange begins to pulse in the void between your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, you look gorgeous! Not as gorgeous as me of course but darling, you are rocking it!\" Her voice is a melodious purr and she starts to descend the stairs, every piece of flesh on this woman's body rippling in just the right way until suddenly she's in front of you, an inch higher and her breasts dangerously close to your own. It takes you a moment before you're able to look up from the canyon of flesh. From here you can tell she's clearly a few years older now, more Haylee's age, maybe a year older.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Is all you get out before you swallow, trying not to visibly drool all over the stranger, whose face twists into confusion for a moment until brightening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! It's me, Kyle! Well, Kylie, now. Though I do like the ring of Sophie...\" She says, placing her hands on her hips and twisting slightly, giving you a view of her impressive ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" You utter again. Normally you're not a mindless putz around women, but Kyle is a level beyond any you've been around before. It, and the wet, hot pulse from your crotch has sidelined your higher brain functions for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, after you left I made myself tall again. Couldn't reach anything. And then I thought 'Why should Sidney get all the fun?' so I took the wrench and just started cranking it. Eventually it just left me looking like this, but I gave it a few more cranks just to be sure. You don't even know how wonderful this feels! Everything is so...soft!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply stare at her before your brain pushes something through the fog. \"Did...did you fix the cabinet like that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle, or rather Kylie fixes you with a look that is one part offended and one part amused. \"No, you silly girl! I don't know the first thing about tools! I called the neighbor over, he was sooo happy to help a damsel like myself. After he was done with the kitchen I had him tidy up the living room. And then, well, I rewarded my big strong man\" Kylie looks off to the side with a dreamy look as she runs a finger slowly down her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...The magic, how, what did he, where-\" You stutter as the news of a stranger using the magic tools seems to be enough of a concern to kickstart your brain, but Kylie places finer on your own lips and you feel something something almost electrical shoot through you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you don't have to worry about that, little one...\" She purrs, leaning close as your brain struggles to stay above the hypnotic pull off lust. What did Kyle do to himself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKylie smiles again and leans in close, whispering into your ear.</span></div></div>",

My, our, own little pet to use for WHATEVER we want...\" Kylie's voice is soft and hot in your ear and you shudder, your legs weak as you feel the heat between your legs intensify and you become aware of the dampness in your underwear. Electricity shoots though you as she places two small, but powerful hands on your shoulders as she leans back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to see him? Or do you want to see... something else?\" She purrs. You feel you own hands sliding across the soft fabric of the robe coming to rest on the crest of Kylie's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Something is wrong. Get away!' The rational part of your brain tries to scream as the primal attraction you feel towards this woman, who was just hours again your male, and stupid, best friend. But whatever Kyle did to himself to become Kylie is overpowering, dominating your senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...I-I want to see him\" You say, swallowing loudly and forcing your hands off Kylie's rear as you take an almost painful step away. You almost melt at her playful pout before she slinks over to the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're a kinky, girl aren't tou? Follow me, he's in my room...\" She says, beckoning you towards her. You feel your feet moving on their own as you become a passenger in your own body. You stare at Kylie's swaying ass as you both ascend the stairs and as she shashays towards her bedroom door, opening it with a backward grin to you which you barely notice as your brain fights between regaining full control and staring at the greatest female posterior you've ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then you're in Kylie's room, which is significantly different from Kyle's pigsty. Instead of piles of clothing scattered across the floor and a unmade bed, the door reveals a definitively female room. A large four poster bed takes up most of the room, covered in expensive looking fabrics as silk drapes down from above. The part of your brain in control right now tells you to toss Kylie on it and stop fighting the inevitable, but you tear your eyes away, focusing on the other large piece of furniture in the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere Kyle's desk had been, now large makeup stand takes up much of the rest of the freespace, a large mirror and stacks of small cases which all sorts of labels you don't recognize, and in the middle, a mason jar with a small, terrified man flailing within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God\" You whisper. It was different when it was Kyle, but a complete stranger shrunk against his will? You couldn't tell what part of your brain was turned on by it. You feel Kylie's hands slide across your shoulders again as she whispers into your ear once more. Her breasts press pleasurably into your back and the fog in your head becomes thicker, your knees even weaker than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we start training our pet, or do you want an audience, lover? We can do anything we want now. We can be goddesses\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe largest part of your brain tells you to give in, to become Kylie's next conquest, to be hers and doom your neighbor to his face as a plaything. But the smaller part of your brain still screams out in resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

Three fingers snap open the button of your jeans and creep downward through the gap, searching for the pounding, fiery furnace that lurks within. In just a few moments you feel them reach the outermost edges of your female folds and what is left of your rational mind vanishes beneath the waves of pleasurable bliss. You let loose a gasping, feminine moan and arch backwards under Kylie's touch as she presses her perfect lips against your soft neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you creep backwards as one until you collapse onto the massive bed. What comes next is a blur as you slide out of your clothing, tossing it all away as Kylie's robe, already loosely held closed, opens up almost effortlessly, revealing the absolute perfection of her body. You press your bodies together as your new sexes touch, and what is left of your truly conscious mind vanishes in the explosion of passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lose track of time while in her embrace, the fog over your mind too great, too powerful to break free from when she is near, and in the few moments you find to yourself you're far too exhausted and longing for her touch again to form more than a few coherent thoughts. All you can manage is a vague recollection that it's been a week since she conquered your body, and mind. During that time you've experienced sex as a woman, with a woman, and the two of you had once been men. And the small man, a true innocent victim, had simply disappeared. He hadn't been much fun anyway, too overcome by Kylie, and too small to truly pleasure either of you more than you could do yourselves. Other victims came and went, men and women of different shapes, colors and sizes ending up in her clutches before vanishing after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Kylie had done with them at this point, you had no idea, nor did you care too much. To be honest, you didn't even care all that much about becoming a man again. Nothing else mattered but your mistress, her wants, needs, desires. You're pretty sure that she'd used some of the tools on you while you were either asleep or too drunk on her to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were hers, body and mind.</span></div></div>",

Instead of Kyle there working on the stupid shelf like he was supposed to, there was a...snake lady with a bunch of stuff littered on the ground.  In a panic covered your eyes dropping the girl clothes Haylee had bought for you on the ground, \"Damn it Kyle!  Did you open up a portal to hell or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I didn't dude!  You're being sssssso rude dude!\"  You heard the sound of a woman's in the kitchen, it must be the snake lady and there's only one potential snake lady who could call you dude even if you're currently a chick.  \"Kyle?\"  You ask still covering your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's me, but why aren't you looking at me?  I'm not that ugly am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUDE!  I do not want to turn to stone right now!\"  You said honestly, there was no way you'd put it past the tools to give Kyle that kind of power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snake lady hissed as she laughed, \"Hss has hss, dude I'm just a sssssnake lady.  It's the ssssssnake HAIR lady that turns you to ssssstone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost looked but wanted to make sure, \"And you're sure you don't have snakes for hair snake lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause as though Kyle needed to actually check that he didn't have snakes for hair, finally Kyle said, \"Yeah I'm sssssure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling pretty sure nothing bad would happen by looking now, you took in the mess of a kitchen that looked more messed up than you'd left it.  A bunch of tools were on the ground as well as what looked like two arms that had to belong to Kyle considering the snake lady who was wearing nothing but Kyle's sweat shirt didn't have any limbs at all attached to his green and scaly body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok bro, how the hell did you do this to yourself?\"  You ask completely confused how one person could be so incompetent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I sssstarted trying to fix up the cabinet like I said.  I wanted to impressss my girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not your girlfriend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're my friend and your a girl now so I think that countssss.\"  You sighed audibly upon Kyle saying this, you didn't feel like having this argument now, you just wanted to know what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle continued, \"Well I wanted to paint it up nice first, sssso I grabbed a paint brush and I wanted to see what magic it did so it used it on my foot and it turned into a cow foot!  Then I used it on the same foot again to try to undo it, and it turned into a bird foot, and then it turned into this snake tail.  It fused with my other leg and I kinda fell.  And when I fell I knocked the saw into my arm and accidentally cut it off, but it doesn't even hurt!  I can ssstill movie it.  Ssssee!\"  You looked at one of the arms on the ground and it waved before giving a thumbs up.  Politely you wave back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sssso after I cut off that arm, and since I already had a ssssnake bottom half, I thought it'd be cool to cut off my other arm and with a little work I was able to do it.  But being a ssssnake got boring after a few minutes got boring so I tried to reattach my arm with the sssocket wrench.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we already knew that Socket Wrench messes with gender.  Or did you forget about these.\"  You said emphasizing your boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot.\"  Kyle said while moving his shoulders in what you guessed was a shrug.  If this were anyone else but Kyle you wouldn't believe it but since this was him you believed that it was a genuine accident.  \"And after I used the wrench and wasn't able to reattach my arms you walked in and then you sssscreamed and covered your eyes and then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok ok I get it I get it.\"  You stepped into the room and thought about what to do next.</span></div></div>",

See, I only used it below my waist, see.\"  Kyle slithered...well, it was more like he rolled, he didn't seemed to have gotten used to his snake body, he went over to his arms that were under the table and the arms moved no their own lifting up Kyle's top to reveal a pair of still human breasts, at least a C cup.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\"You said staring at his breasts with your jaw slightly hanging open.  \"Do you know how to turn back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure I do, there's a paint scraper in the tool kit.  So that makes sense if that would undo it.\"  You were actually kind of amazed that Kyle displayed that much use of logic.  But that breakthrough of thoughts ended as Kyle chuckled and said, \"Dude, this is pretty cool,\"  Kyle said whipping his tail body around the room knocking over the chairs and knocking the tools all around the room, \"You should totally try it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were kind of ready to just turn back into a dude and just calling Hayley up to see if she wanted to go out some time, but that could wait.  Besides, it looked like Kyle had knocked the Gender Switching Socket Wrench somewhere and you were too lazy to look for it right now.  \"Sure, this'll be sweet.\"  You sat down on the floor so that you wouldn't fall over if you suddenly got tentacle legs or something and threw off the heels Hayley had bought 'Sidney'.  You bent over mushing your breasts into your knees and felt the Species Changing Paint Brush sweep against your toes.  Or at least your former toes, after you brushed your feet you saw that you now had a cloven hoof instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle gave a hearty laughed, \"Dude!  You've got a pig foot.  Sooie!  Oink oink little piggy.  Sooie!\"  Kyle continued to laugh at his own...'cleverness' and you decided to go for a redo and used the Brush on your pig foot and in a matter of moments you now had a brown dog paw.  \"Check it out, I've got a dog foot now.\"  You said showing your friend who replied, \"Well, you're a girl now, sssso it's more like a...bitch foot!\"  Kyle once again laughed to himself including pounding his detatched arms on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes and once again used the brush on yourself and you watched as the paw turned into a scaly green tail.  But unlike Kyle's snake tail, your tail had a fin at the end of it.  Kyle stopped laughing and said, \"Whoa, dude, you should totally keep going with that, trust me, it's super cool to have no legs.  You gotta try it bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou admitted that it certainly was an interesting option so you decided to go through with it and continued to used the brush up your legs.  The two fused together as you moved the brush up.  You even lifted up your dress Hayley had bought you and moved the brush all the way up to under your belly button.  You looked up to Kyle who was low to the ground watching you from an upskirt angle.  You flopped the tail around on the kitchen floor knocking more tools out of the way.  \"I see why you kept doing this.  It's kinda fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right?\"  Kyle said as you both flopped your tails around both chaoticly and in a way to figure out how to move.  Both of you were kind of unsuccessful in the later.  \"Dude, I can't believe my girlfriend turned into a mermaid.\"  Kyle said staring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I told you, that was just a cover to get rid of your sister.  I'm not your girlfriend.\"  You tried your best to get into as close to a standing position as you could but failed, but as you failed the magical Tape Measure fell off the table.  You looked at it and said off hand, \"If I used that on myself now I'd turn into the Little Mermaid, am I right?\"  You laugh at your dumb joke but then you and Kyle looked at each other both thinking the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sid, Bro, you've gotta do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe irony of the situation of very strong.  You looked at the tape measure intently before making a choice.</span></div></div>",

You put the lip of it by your fin and scratch it a good ways before Kyle said, \"You're doing the right thing.\"  You agreed, this felt like the right thing, not the smart thing, but the right thing.  You snapped the Tape Measure and instantly you felt yourself falling into yourself.  Before you knew it you were using your tail and swimming around in the now oversized dress Hayley got you as you searched for the opening.  Finally you saw a light at the end of the tunnel and managed to wiggle your way out.  You looked up and saw Kyle's arm holding open the dress for you to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks bro.\"  You said as the hand offered you a high (more like low) 5.  You obliged slapping your tiny hand against the massive hand that was now taller than your entire body.  But after the high 5 you see Kyle staring and remember you're currently topless.  You quickly put your arms over your breasts as Kyle laughs and says, \"No problem bro, happy to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at the gargantuan servant lady who looked like some sort of mythical dragon or something from your current perspective.  You said triumphantly as though you had just won some sort of prize, \"Well I did it.  I'm a Little Mermaid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, that'sss sssssweet.  Do you think you can make yourself have long red hair to make it even better?\"  Kyle asked.  You take a look at the scattered tools that litter the room.  \"I don't know, we haven't found anything that does hair color yet.  We'll have to experiment more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to experiment.\"  Kyle said and you could have sworn you head him lick his lips.  \"Not that kind of experimenting bro.  So, what to do now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean what to do now?  Do ssssome ssssongs from the movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's probably be fun...but I haven't seen the movie since I was like 4 so that's not an option.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem I can jusssssst get my phone and play ssssssome sssstuff for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could Kyle, but your stuff is upstairs and you haven't even figured out how to leave the room with that snake body let alone go up the stairs.  And I'm in an even worse position to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, well I can grab some tools to experiment with like you said, that'll be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if we should do that yet, first you need to clean up the mess you made while you and your tail were thrashing around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  Why do I have to clean up Ssssssid?!  You made a little bit of the messsssss!\"  Kyle said sounding offended as he did anytime he was asked to do something productive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knocked over the tape measure and I already picked it up and used it.  Everything else was all you bro.\"  Which was true, the kitchen area did look like a bomb had gone off thanks to Kyle messing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FIne, I'll ssssshow you what's what bro!\"  Kyle said making himself much taller by extending his tail to be as intimidating to you as possible.</span></div></div>",

A new reality, but you didn't realize it yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, that was super trippy man.

I'm a freaking mermaid and I haven't even tried to swim, that could be cool to try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to sssay more, I'll get you there.\"  And out of nowhere Kyle displayed lightning fast reflexes you didn't know he was capable of period, let alone in a body he'd only had a few minutes.  With a display of freakish dextarity he whipped his tail around and wrapped you up in a tight squeeze and then began to move like a bullet.  In practically the blink of an eye you had gone from the kitchen, to up the stairs, to your room all in a few seconds.  All the while you were screaming your head off, it felt like you were on a roller coaster that you had not signed up for.  Next thing you knew you were suddenly thrown in a body of water.  You tried to gasp for air, but you found oddly enough you could actually breath under the water.  This was so cool!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut wait...why was there a body of water in your room?  You looked around, you were surrounded by a bunch of seaweed, coral, and even a plastic castle.  As you swam around you suddenly slammed your head against the wall.  A glass wall.  All of the sudden it hit you.  \"I'm in a freaking aquarium?!\"  You said wondering where this came from, you never had one in your room before and looking through the glass it seemed to be the same shape and colors as your room.  Seeing that snake lady Kyle was watching you with amusement you breached the surface of the water and asked.  \"Kyle!  What the hell is going on?  And where are your arms?  Why didn't you just carry me in those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle looked confused, \"I...don't have arms.  I've never had arms.  And why are you calling me Kyle?  You've known me sssince I hatched, it's your old pal Kylie.  Are you okay Sssidney?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Kyle...or well, Kylie dumbfounded.  Kyle always thought he was a snake girl named Kylie and you had an aquarium in your room.  You don't know how, but somehow the house and who knows, maybe the universe had changed and it probably had something to do with that toolbox.  As you wondered what other reality changed had happened, Kylie looked at you still confused but turned her scaly lips into a smile.  \"I know just what will make you feel better.\"</span></div></div>",

Just below your armpit and just above the dress you were still wearing you put the arm against your flash and like magic it connected.  All of the sudden you could feel and control a third arm.  Kyle spoke up, \"Dude what the hell!  I can't feel my arm anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring your roommate you smile as you took his other arm and attached it to the other side of your body.  Smiling you flexed all four of your arms, \"Check it out, I could totally cosplay as Goro from Mortal Kombat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way man, more like the 4 armed chick from the ssssequels.  Besides, dudes don't make nearly as much from cosplaying as the chicks do.  Not use the saw to cut off my arms and give them back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a minute.\"  You said as with two arms you got your phone and started surfing the internet and with the other two arms made yourself a sandwich.  \"Can you at least make me one?\"  the sad sounding snake lady said from the ground.  You shrugged Kyle's arms and fulfilled his request as you continued your research.  \"Man, having 4 arms makes doing stuff so much easier, I bet if I was a dude again I could lift like twice as much and fix this place in no time.\"  You held out the sandwich and Kyle took it from you with his mouth.  Mouth still full of bread and peanut butter because he didn't want to drop it on the ground Kyle tried to speak, \"Ssssho whush oo loohing up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stuff.  Turns out the girl Goro is called Sheeva and it turns out snake girls are called 'naga'.  We learned something today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle managed to force the last of the sandwich down, \"So can you get me a beer, and also what are you going to do next.

You were not particularly scared of snakes, but just something about a partial one being as large and questionably as smart as you just sent a chill down you spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" You say, reaching down to grab the socket wrench that had bestowed you with your not half bad female form, \"Honestly I'm wore out from shopping with your sister. Shopping for clothes as a woman is almost as exhausting as going shopping with a woman as a man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Kyle both hoth groan and roll your eyes as if you both knew your slightly sexist joke to be true. Neither of you had been lucky enough to have girlfriends, but you both chuckle anyway, your airy giggle backed up by the rattle like hissing of Kyle's, and just like that you're creeped out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, uh, yeah dude. I'm gonna change back and just go to bed.\" You say as you attach to socket wrench to the void between you legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw man, but I liked having a girlfriend!\" Kyle says, his serpentine face forming a pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M NOT AND WILL NEVER BE YOUR GIRLFRIEND!\" You say loudly and slowly, and before you can give him a chance to retort, you start cranking the wrench in the opposite direction, your girl next door good looks melting into what you've always considered to be an above average male body. You give yourself a few more extra twists before removing the wrench and you are suddenly very aware of your larger cock pressing against your feminine underwear. You turn beet red as Kyle bursts out into a loud, rattle-hiss fit of laughter, his scaly form shuddering as he eventually collapses on the counter. If snakes had tear ducts, his scales would be wet with tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nissssce outfit, dude!\" He says, finally composing himself enough to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, laugh it up, you oversized pair of cowboy boots!\" You snarl back, raising a newly muscled arm and hearing the now tightened fabric rip apart under the strain, which only causes Kyle to break into another fit of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddamn it!\" You say and, with as much grace as you can as a well endowed man can in small, tight fitting woman's clothes can, exit the kitchen and dig your old clothes out of the collection of shopping bags. Once you've successfully changed back, you walk back into the kitchen, your pride in about as many tatters as the outfit you had just worn was in now. Kyle gave you a fanged smirk as you flipped him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sssssso now what?\" He hissed, and you realize that ever since you had watched The Jungle Book as a child how much you hated the stereotype of talking snakes and snake people hissing every S word. You try not to grit your teeth in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, do you want to change back? Then tomorrow we can actually clean up this mess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, ok\" Kyle says, with as much of a shrug as he can manage without shoulders before nodding towards his arms, which were now dutifully crawling towards him, \"Help a snake-brother out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like snake-sister\" You say as you pick up his severed arms and look them over, ignoring the forked tongue Kyle was sticking out at you. The ends of his arms were exposed, the bones, muscles and sinewy tissue flexing as they wiggled weirdly in your hands, but there was no blood, just a very pale aura of green surrounding the pseudo-wounds. With a lack of ideas, you simply hold Kyle's arms back up to his shoulders and, to your amazement, they simply merge with his snake body! They shift shimmer as scales spread over every inch of his newly reattached limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude!\" Kyle says, \"That was awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but agree. Now that your roommate was back in one piece, you pick up the paintbrush and the socket wrench and hold them out towards Kyle. \"Which one do you want first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm...\" Kyle says, slithering closer and peering at each with his slited eyes.</span></div></div>",

I<i> am</i> getting pretty hungry...\" To make his point Kyle opens up his mouth, his dark lips sliding back as his jaws open wider than any human's possibly could as two large, dripping fangs slide out from the folds of skin behind his initial set of smaller more teeth-like fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder at how deadly and unreal they look. You picture Kyle lunging forward and grabbing you with his mouth, the fangs digging down into your flesh, your organs, the venom within seeping into your bloodstream, killing you from the inside out as your body shuts down. The imagine of his body curling around you as those frighteningly massive jaws slowly slide down around your paralyzed body. The feeling of suffocation as you slide down Kyle's throat and into his serpentine guts, alive just long enough to feel the effects of digestion begin to break you down into chemical proteins for the monster that had devoured you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, dude, are...are you okay?\" You hear Kyle saying, and suddenly you snap yourself back to reality, seeing Kyle, having retracted and closed his fangs and mouth, looking at you worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah. Yeah dude, I'm good\" You say, blinking off the horrifying vision of being eaten alive. Maybe you were more scared of snakes that your originally thought. You look down at the paintbrush in your hand and relax the white knuckled grip you apparently had on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sssso...You gonna change me back?\" Kyle asks, shifting in his scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.

Eager to get rid of the kinda scary snake lady before you, you quickly slipped the brush up his body and watched as he transformed.  You had been expecting Kyle's legs to appear, but instead of feet you saw two pink cloven hooves appeared.  With the brush still moving up the scary and scale ridden body Kyle's flesh became pink and plump.  You even saw the paintbrush pass over his chest and create what looked like a bunch of nipples appear.  You kept moving up and Kyle shouted, \"Hey stop!  That's not human in case you didn't notice dummy.\"  You considered just slapping his face with the paint brush to complete the piggy transformation but decided that you wouldn't like it if he did the same to you so you stopped with the brush.  Kyle rolled off his back and got on his four little hooves and looked up at you to say, \"Dang it, don't leave me like this, try again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, if you insist.\"  You said as you put the brush up against his curly little tail and went to work again.  The curly tail turned into a short and stubby tail coated with cotton.  And it wasn't just the tail, as you ran the brush along the pig body, the size of the body didn't change much, but curly white fuzz grew wherever you put the brush.  \"Dude, still not human.  Try again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time you tried to be quicker and more furious with your strokes.  So much so you didn't even notice the details as when you stroked the brush, flesh seemed to just disappear.  \"Dude!  Stop!  I'm almost not there anymore!\"  A tiny headed Kyle said from the body of a mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, got a little carried away.  Want me to try again?\"  \"Yes!\"  The angry little mouse girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time when you painted flash seemed to appear out of nowhere as it was like the tiny mouse body stretched and stretched until it was the size of a human child.  A human child covered in a thick lair of black fur.  When you got to the feet you watched as the legs you were painting turned into what seemed like hands at the bottom of them.  You looked at the paintbrush as though it might be busted or something, but when you got a look at the rest of Kyle's body it hit you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You turned me into a monkey now?\"  Kyle said as though it were your fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"  You said annoyed, \"At least this body has legs miss I-made-myself-a-freaky-snake-lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's better than before I guess.\"  Kyle said as he bent his weird finger like toes and giggled at the sight of them.  With it looking like you were done with the paint brush you put it down and debated whether you should keep messing with stuff to try and turn Kyle back to normal or just leave him like this for a while.  After all, he was kind of close to being human again.</span></div></div>",

As interesting as it was seeing Kyle turn into different creatures with the stroke of a brush, you'd been doing it for like an hour at this point and were starting to get a bit bored with it.  With a shrug you took the paintbrush and put it back in the magic toolbox.  This did not go unnoticed by Kyle, \"Bro, what the heck?  I'm not back to being me yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know man, but I'm tired and I'm starting to get hungry, let's take a break.  We'll turn you back later.\"  Kyle gave you a glare with his weird human lady monkey face that looked like it came from an old sci fi movie.  \"Oh come on Kyle, let's order a pizza.  I'll pay.\"  And seeing Kyle still looking sour you had a stroke of inspiration that would lift his spirits.  \"It's not that bad man, just think of the look on pizza driver's face when a monkey walks up to him to pay him.\"  This was the exact thing Kyle needed to hear, \"Bro, Sid, that is genius!  I'm in!  Let's do it!\"  Kyle had a big toothy grin on his face as he began to bounce in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little over a half hour the doorbell rang and Kyle eagerly ran with his hands to the front door, he reached up to open it and from the kitchen you heard the poor delivery boy let out a curse as you laughed your butt off.  You took a peek to the entry way to see the driver drop the pizza as Kyle offer the cash.  Deciding you had to intervene before the poor kid passed out or something you said, \"Don't mind Kylie, she's well trained.  Watch, Kylie, Jump!\"  Kyle followed your request.  \"Kylie, what's 3 x 3?\"  Kyle proceeded to hold up 6 fingers.  You shrugged and decided it was close enough and followed that up with, \"Kylie, kiss.\"  And you pointed at the driver.  Kyle smiled and puckered up his big rubber lips and moved to the driver who backed up and said, \"CoolThanksBye!\"  as he practically ran off of the porch and back to his car.  Kyle shut the door and actually collapse with laughter, and you did too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sid bro,  that was too freaking good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best part is we didn't even have to tip!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I tried,\"  Kyle said puckering up his lips again making you laugh even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you enjoyed your pizza recapping the story that just happened blow by blow over and over again.  Kyle was making the most of his primate problem by trying to eat pizza with his hand like feet with mixed and messy results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not envy how much shampoo you're going to have to use on your body tonight.\"  You said looking at the cheese and cause caught in his fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about, we're still turning me back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mischievous grin you gave a big fake yawn and said, \"I don't know, I'm feeling pretty tired.  We'll do it first thing tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's messed up bro!  Not cool!\"  Kyle said pointing an accusatory finger toe at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, think of this as payback for saying I was your girlfriend and making me shop with your sister.  Good night Kyle,\"  You said as you grabbed the toolbox and put it on top of the refrigerator where you thought it would be out of reach.  You then went up to your room with a smile on your face as you wondered what tomorrow would bring as Kyle began to climb up to the toolbox.</span></div></div>",

But how...?\"  Your mind that was still trying to wake up and deal with this crazy wake up call finally but two and two together.  \"KYLE!\"  You shouted and the giant monkey smiled and in a voice that almost knocked you over said, \"You rang?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck happened last night?  I didn't drink that much did I?\"  You said trying to remember if you did something to yourself last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, last night you left me stuck as a monkey, but what you forgot is that monkey's are good climbers.  I reached the toolbox and was about to use the paintbrush on myself but then realized I could accidentally turn myself into a bug or fish or something.  So I decided to do the next best thing.  Mess with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you used the Tape Measure to shrink me and the Socket Wrench to turn me into a girl with giant boobs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty awesome, huh.\"  Kyle said happily, and while you were glad you were still human, this still was inconvenient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you got me.  You got me good.  Now what?\"  You asked and you were pleased to see Kyle's face faulted, he obviously didn't think that far ahead.  You'd hoped Kyle would realize he'd gotten you good enough and turn you back, but sadly something rare happened and Kyle got the look on his face he got when he had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what now.\"  Kyle said with a laugh and before you knew it, Kyle had taken his hairy palm and enclosed it around your hourglass waist.  You let out a scream of surprise.  Kyle began running through the house and you felt like you were about to vomit as the room moved at what felt like 100 miles per hour.  You could barely tell that Kyle had taken you to the back yard.  He approached a tree and said, \"I think I saw something like this in a movie, or tv show, or a gif.\"  And with you as a tiny woman in his hand, he began to climb to the top of the tree.  Leaves slapped against your face as Kyle climbed up and up and up until he reached the tip top.  Satisfied with his accomplished quest Kyle swatted at some birds and bugs with his free hand.  He then with that hand he pounded on his chest and let out a primal cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, you've had your fun, let's just go back in the house and fix ourselves.\"  You said spitting a bit of monkey fur from your mouth.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"There, you've had your fun, let's just go back in the house and fix ourselves.\" You said spitting a bit of monkey fur from your mouth. It's oily and smells, but then again you didn't really expect anything different. It was Kyle after all. Your best friend turned primate stares at you for a moment and you see the corners of his mouth start to curl into a smile, revealing a mouthful of deceptively sharp teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, are you tired of...\" Kyle held on to the top of the tree with a free foot while using his free hand to pull a pair of sunglasses out of his pair of shorts he had (thankfully) put on last night. Your eyes widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, don't do it\" You say, seeing where it's headed, but it's too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Monkeying around?\" Kyle says, sliding on the shades. You groan as loudly as you can while he lets loose a primal cry into the morning air, before breaking out into a very primate-like laugh of grunts and snorts. You just facepalm in your friend's hand as he swings around the top of the tree until his fit of laughter finally subsides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh c'mon Sid, you know that was great! You walked right into it!\" Kyle says, looking down at you, and you have to suppress your fit of laughter at how ridiculous he looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. Ok. It was a little funny\" You say, and then you clap your hands over your mouth. 'Oh no!' You think as Kyle bursts into laughter again. You turn bright red and give yourself a facepalm, you were really not having a good morning. \"Can we just go in, please? Someone might see you and call, I don't know, like the zoo or something! Then you'll be dancing for peanuts and I'LL be stuck like this!\" You say, gesturing as best you can to your very ill-proportioned (and female) body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle gets in a few more chuckles before the laughter finally gets out of his system. \"Yeah, I guess you're right, bro. But that would be kinda cool, never work again,naked all day, free food...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And beating off all the MALE monkeys with whatever stick you can find\" You say, pointing at the small buds underneath Kyle's fur. His eyes go wide as he suddenly realizes that he, too, is alo female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you're right!\" He says as he starts making his way down through the tree. You cover your head to avoid, as best as you can, anymore leaves and branches whacking you in the head as the two of you go down as quickly as you had gone up. \"Man, that would suck. I mean if I did get caught, I'd want to be a dude monkey. Walk around with my banana, heh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't engage. It's better that you just get inside without anymore distractions. The two of you finally clear the branches and Kyle slides down the truck of the tree like it was a fire-pole in a firehouse, and he scampers across the yard in a loping gait before you're at the back door, watching him fiddle with the doorknob for a moment, choosing, for somereason, to try to open it with one of his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks!\" He says defensively when he sees you staring up at him with a 'really?' look on your face. After a few more moments of chimpish behavior, Kyle grunts in annoyance and just opens the door with his free hand and hustles inside, depositing you on the table before he climbs onto the counter where the toolbox laid open to the world. Around it were several tools the two of you hadn't tried out yet, but the massive orbs on your chest demanded an answer before the two of you started experimenting again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, bro\" You say, walking over to the edge of the table, taking a look over the edge and involuntarily shuddering at what might happen if you fall (or if someone accidentally knocks you) off of the table, \"Before we change back, how did you make me small but make these damn things so big?\" You point two slender fingers at your massive breasts. Kyle stares at you (or rather, your boobs) for a moment before his brain kicks into gear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Oh, uh, I used...\" Kyle reaches into the toolbox and you see him rummage around for a moment before he turns back to you wielding a weird looking tool that had a sharp needle on end and a stubby pencil on the other, connected by a small joint at the top. You had no idea what it was, and it was clear Kyle didn't either. \"Whatever this thing is\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad either of you any knowledge of tools outside of the basic wrench/screwdriver/hammer/nail group, you would have recognized the new tool as a compass, but as neither of you did, the mystery remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how does it work?\" You asked, and Kyle slid off the counter and tottered his way over to you and you subconsciously back up from the edge of the table as the chimp that was your best friend loomed above you like an actual King Kong. Or Queen, in this case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, after you went to bed and I got the toolbox down, this was the first thing I saw after the tape measure and the paintbrush. I was gonna change myself back, but then I thought about pranking you instead! And also I thought it might be too dangerous to mess around with alone. So I just sort of messed around and found out that this thing, whatever the hell it's called, is like the tape measure but it shrinks and grows single things!\" Kyle explained as best as he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached over your head and a shadow covered you for a moment as his furry arm blocked out the light as he grabbed the decorative fruit basket on the table, setting it down beside you. The fruit basket was something Kyle's mom had done. The woman loved to decorate, and one day shortly after the two of you had moved in, Kyle's mom showed up unexpectedly with an armful of decorations that she insisted by set up. The fruit bowel was the only one that hadn't ended up tossed into the storage room, simply because the two of you never really ate in the kitchen and thus it had been forgotten about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, watch this!\" Kyle said, and you do indeed watch as the monkey above you spreads the tool apart into a wide V-like shape, the needle of one end, which Kyle placed on the apple at the center of the little plastic display. The slowly, he drew a invisible circle around the basked, stopping as he reached the point where he started and then he began to push the pencil end is...And your jaw goes limp as you watch the entire fruit basket, save for the apple, shrink. Then Kyle repeated the process, only in reverse, and the fruit basket grew outward until now the apple was the smallest item.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See!?\" Kyle said excitedly as he pulled the tool away, \"I used the tape masure to make you tiny, then I used this thing to make your boobs huge! And dude I had them even bigger but they looked too weird, so I shrank them down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"you look down at the colossal feeling mounds on your chest. \"Gee, thanks\" You say, your tone dripping with sarcasm, and Kyle just grins. \"Well, can you fix me now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That depends\" Kyle says, leaning on a table chair and scratching his head wit ha foot, \"You gonna change me back? This has been fun but I'm starting to go a bit...\" He paused, the words suddenly fleeing from his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apeshit?\" You suggest with the best shit-eating grin you can manage, and then it was Kyle's turn to roll his eyes. \"Hey, you walked right into it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, very funny Thumbimbo\" Your best friend says, but you see the little grin at the side of his mouth. He walks back to the counter, scaling it with ease before putting the weird tool back in the toolbox before retrieving the tape measure and heading back to you. \"Ready to be big again bro?\" He asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, hit me dude\" You say and Kyle swipes you off the table and deposits you on the kitchen floor. From this height you can feel the coolness hugging the tile and you feel a shiver run down your spine at how absolutely massive everything appears from down here. Kyle bends over and slides out the small lip of the tape measure and you step on it, and as he rises, so do you. In a flash you're back to your normal height...But you realize you still have the now truly enormous basketball boobs swinging around in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, shit\" You mutter, \"We should have changed these first\" You say, and Kyle just shrugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind them\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"that's because you're not the one they're connected to, numbnuts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeesh, fine! I'm on it!\" Kyle groans, and with another swap of tools you find your breasts down to a much more manageable A-cup. You're still a woman, but after retrieving the socket wrench and giving it a few cranks, you're back to your normal male self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright dude, now fix me?\" Kyle asks, handing you the paintbrush with one of his feet. You nod and after a few minutes of searching in the toolbox, which seemed drastically larger than it appeared to be on the outside, you find a small vial of clear liquid that had PAINT REMOVER stamped on the label. You open the vial's lid and dab a few drops of the strong smelling liquid into the paintbrush and turn back to Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here goes\" You say and run the brush across his face, his eyes clenching tight as his face transforms from chimp to human, his features definitely female as long black hair cascades downward from his scalp. Your eyes go wide in amazement and you quickly run the brush across the rest of Kyle's body, fur melting away to soft pink skin. After a few moments, where once was a chimp was now a normal, kinda pretty looking, human female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle opens his eyes and grins, \"Thanks, bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but stare at his exposed chest and, distracted, you mumble \"No problem\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle blinks for a moment before following your gaze downward. \"Oh, fuck!\" He shouts, arms flashing up to cover himself, \"Dude! Not cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's pretty cool\" You say before you bust out into laughter. Kyle's eyes narrow and before you know it he has crossed the kitchen and grabbed something from the toolbox, lunging at you with it with a womanly growl. You throw your hands up in defense, and in a flash of green light you feel yourself change...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as the green light dissipated the first thing you saw was Kyle's boobs.  His cute, naked, and oddly large boobs.  <i>Wait a second, Kyle's boobs weren't that big a minute ago.</i>  You thought, and then you looked up and saw that Kyle's entire body looked bigger than it was before.  \"Dang it Kyle, I just got back to normal size, why'd you shrink me again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cute girl snorted in very Kyle like fashion, \"Dude, I didn't shrink you, well, kinda, but not really, I only got part of you...pinhead.\"  Kyle snorted again and wiped his nose, with the tool that you recognized as the thing that sharing and grew different body parts.  \"You shrunk part of me?\"  You went to scratched your face as you began to think, when all of the sudden out of nowhere a giant hand starting coming at you.  You moved your hand to block it, but the giant hand flew out of the way.  A second later the light bulb went off in your tiny mind.  \"Ah, you shrunk my head.\"  And you went to faceplate yourself but stopped yourself before you potentially squished your brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle hadn't stopped laughing, \"Dude!  Sid, you look so silly bro!  It's like a real life funhouse mirror!  Do you want me to get you a thimble helmet in case a bird mistakes your head for a nut?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha, you got me bro, now turn me back to normal, this is just dumb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you deserved it for staring at my boobs.  Not cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't wearing a shirt!  Hell you still aren't wearing one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never thought it was a big deal when I didn't wear a shirt before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head, although it was so small you weren't sure Kyle could tell what you were doing, \"That's because you were a dude, bro!  And also a monkey and a few other animals but you probably weren't talking about then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well...\"  Kyle seemed to have run out of excuses momentarily, \"Well once I turn back my boobs won't be a problem for you, unless you've got a problem with my pecs too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had pecs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just shut up and help me find that weird wrench thing that'll make me a dude again.\"  You scared the room which looked multiple times bigger thanks to your new perspective, but you also were able to notice the obvious better than Kyle.  Taking a slightly disorienting step you managed to move to a counter where the Gender Switch Socket Wrench was laying.  You held it up and waved it in the air, \"Are you looking for this <i>miss</i>?\"  You said with extra emphasis on the miss.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah bro, pass it over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You pass me that weird needle pencil size change thing and I'll pass you your manhood.\"  You said staring at the Compass still in Kyle's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No chance, you pass the wrench to me first.\"  You both stared at each other from opposite ends of the kitchen.  Nobody made a move.  \"Well, we know what we have to do now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\"  Kyle said with a knowing nod, \"We have a duel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we...what?\"  You said in confusion, you were just going to say that you both hand over the tools to each other at the same time.  What was Kyle playing at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's what we have to do Sid, we're both men...shut up, who want to be the man.  But to be the man, you have to beat the man, so we have to fight and the winner gets to turn back...and the loser gets to prank the loser.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I think see where you're going with this.  How about this for the duel.  Stand by the toolbox and on the count of 3 draw a random tool and use it on the other person until they give up, and if nobody gives up we draw again.  How's the sound.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle looked at you with vacant eyes, \"I was just going to saw we play rock, paper, scissors.  But that's like twenty times cooler, let's do it!\"  You sighed, despite the fact your brain was technically the size of a peanut now you still felts smarter than your friend.  The two of you put away the compass and socket wrench respectively so you could both use a new tool against the other.  As you both stared at each other over the toolbox you felt a bead of sweat run down your tiny face.  \"So, last chance to back out, there could be some dangerous stuff in this toolbox.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle smirked, \"No chance, I aint chicken.  Besides, I kind of stabbed you with the needle pencil thing and you're not bleeding to death or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough, ok.  3, 2, 1, go!\"  You both practically dived for the tools in the toolbox ready to make the first strike.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately something you did not foresee involved your shrunken head, with a tiny head and a normal sized body your depth perception seemed to be a little off and it gave Kyle the advantage he needed.  As your hand grazed drill of some sort, Kyle grabbed a pair of pliers.  And before you could even offer a surender, the cute girl before you put on a big doppy grin and jabbed the pliers into your chest.  You tried to look down, but you couldn't see below your chest and shoulders, but it felt like the pliers had actually gone <i>inside</i> of your torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle squeezed the pliers.  You felt shiver go through your whole body as though your whole body had gone numb.  \"Kali ma bro.\" And with a yank Kyle pulled the pliers out of your chest and you felt like you were going along with him.  Suddenly your vision changed.  You were no longer attached to your shoulders, you were stuck on the pliers.  And what's more you didn't feel like you were seeing anything normally.  It was as though you were now a camera that had 360 degree vision, you could see the floor, ceiling,  Kyle's ass, table, Kyle's boobs, and your limp body that had just collapsed to the ground at the same time.  Kyle moved you in the pliers up to his face, \"Sid?  Is that you in there?  Are you this weird ball of blue energy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to say 'Yes', but nothing came out, after all you no longer seemed to be attached to your mouth.  Kyle looked at you with wide eyes, \"Dude, you just glowed, I think that's a yes.  Oh man, I think I ripped your soul out of your body with these pliers!  You know what that means?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat the concept of souls were real?  That your very life was literally in Kyle's hands?  That from this angle you could see you could really use a haircut?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means I win, and that means I get to use this.\"  Kyle roughly dropped you on the table and went for the Gender Switch Socket Wrench.  He attached it to himself and a few quick turns later Kyle was once again a dude.  You tried to move, but it seemed that while you would stuck in the Soul Stealing Plier you were stuck in them.  \"Good to be back.\"  Kyle said in a low grumbly voice as though he felt he needed to overcompensate being a female for like 12 hours.  \"And now that I'm back...what do I do with the loser aka you dude.\"  Kyle picked you and the pliers up again as he had a painful look on his face as he thought of what to do with you.  After a few minutes a light lit up behind his eyes, \"I think I've got an idea, I know exactly where I'm going to put you.\"</span></div></div>",

You recover quickly, as does Kyle, and you both find yourself facing off with each again from across the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled out a...sledgehammer!? With Kyle was holding onto a hammer with an almost comically sized head that looked like it was made of rubber. Was it a mallet? Yeah, that seemed like the right word.

And if you had a normal shaped head it would have connected, but lucky for you, your head was still the size of a golf ball thanks to the Part Size Changing Compass and Kyle misses your head by inches.  You feel like your head just missed getting hit by a car, and you weren't going to let Kyle get a second pass at it.  With all of your strength you lift the sledgehammer and swing with all your might upwards.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>CRACK</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour blow connects with Kyle's stomach just a few inches below his breasts.  \"Got you!  I win!\"  You say dropping the sledgehammer on the ground in celebration.  With your victory claimed you walked up to Kyle and took the Compass from his pocket and attached the pointy end by your face and opened up the pencil half until it grew your head back to it's normal size.  Satisfied with your victory you walked back to Kyle who was still holding his stomach where you hit with the sledgehammer.  \"Nice try bro, I'll grab you the socket wrench so you can be a dude again and then we'll figure out what the sledhammer did.  You got any idea?  You feel any different Kyle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle chuckled and looked up at you, and when he did you took a step back in surprise.  Before you was girl Kyle's cute face, but with cracks in it as though he was actually breaking.  And the cracks were spreading, \"Sid...I don't feel so good.\"  And Kyle fell down onto the kitchen floor and shattered into hundreds of pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle!\"  You scream.  You bend down and pick up lumps of pink flesh.  Even though Kyle seemed to have been almost chopped to pieces, there was no blood on the floor thanks to the magic stuff somehow, but that was a small comfort.  \"Oh my God, I've killed by best friend!\"  You pick up a particularly large and fleshy looking piece that used to be your friend and feel tears welling in your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude!  Stop it!  That's part of my boob your squeezing!\"  You drop the boob part and gasp, that was definitely Kyle's voice you heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle?  You're alive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally!\"  You hear his voice say, looking around you pinpoint the voice as coming from Kyle's lips which had slipped under a chair next to a toe and a flesh piece that had a mole.  \"I'm alive and I gotta tell you.  This is wild.  I'm feeling everything in every part of my body.  It's so trippy man, I feel like I'm high.  You should totally hit Haylee with that sledgehammer, she'd get a kick out of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cool and all, and I'm really glad I didn't just murder you, but how are we going to put you back together?\"  About 50 flesh pieces around the room all jiggled, you guessed that it was an attempt at a shoulder shrug.  Deciding to go to the source and solution of all your problems lately, you went to the toolbox and found a tube of glue.  Looking around the room you picked up the soft breast tissue you'd picked up earlier and after some searching you found a piece with a round nipple on it.  You squeeze the glue tube and a lime green substance oozed out onto the flesh in your hand.  You put the two together and in a quick flash, the flesh was fused together to make a whole breast.  \"Ok, I think I can put you back together bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear, by the way one of my ears is under the sink, I can hear the pipes dripping.  But could you please stop fingering my freaking nipple...or at least put on some gloves.  Your hands are freaking freezing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry bro.\"  You said putting the boob on the table and stare at all the lady Kyle parts that scattered the ground.  There had to be nearly a thousand of them.  This was going to take forever and you were never that good at puzzles.</span></div></div>",

Eventually your vision catches up and the feeling of nausea passes, but you realize something is wrong. Very wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire room is huge again! You stare up at the tool box on the counter. It may as well have been on Mt. Everest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell man!\" You fume, \"Why'd you fucking shrink me again Kyle!\" You try to pull yourself up, but realize you can't move! In fact, you can't do anything but more your eyes and talk! You try to move your legs, but there's only the feeling of the muscles wiggling against themselves. You try to move your arms but get the same result. You try to lift and turn your head, but all you manage to do is give yourself a headache from the strain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle, what did you do to me!? Get your ass over here and fix me, this is too weird!\" You cry out, expecting to see Kyle's pretty female face loom over you with his normal stupid grin. But he never appears, and eventually you become aware of a faint voice coming from...The counter?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle, is that you!?\" You call out, straining as much as you can to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude you broke me! I'm in, like, a billion different pieces all over the place!

The rest of me is scattered all of the place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink at that as your mind tries to piece together what he's talking about. After a few minutes you realize what had happened, hitting him with the sledge hammer must have broken him into little pieces of assorted body parts! But that still didn't explain what had happened to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you can see me right?\" You call out, continuing the weird, very weird game of Marco Polo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Dude, you look like a pancake!\" Kyle's voice says from the counter top, \"I guess the mallet, like, squished you flat like a cartoon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can't move! Can you move?\" The prospect of both of you being stuck like this forever suddenly causes panic to enter your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I can do is wiggle around! Like hang on let me try something!\" Kyle goes quiet for a few moments, but you can definitely hear the sounds of...something happening. Then suddenly you heard Kyle scream over the top of what sounds like metal shifting. Was it the tools?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" You call out, and for a moment you're fearful that something has happened to Kyle, silencing him forever before you hear his girlish voice once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude I can move my mouth using my tongue! I bet if I tried hard enough I could find a tool to fix us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can't move, so you better damn well better!\" You yell out again, suddenly jealous that your roommate has locomotive power and you're stuck on the floor like a doormat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually...</span></div></div>",

Maybe you could nudge yourself into a tool to hopefully make this situation better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you began to move around very slowly on the tile as thought you were a puck on the weakest air hockey table you could imagine.  After minutes of slow moving and Kyle announcing when he licked a new body body part, you felt your body against something.  You couldn't see what you were hitting, but you thought that whatever it was you could hopefully activate it by rubbing against it enough.  Without consulting Kyle who was coughing up a hairball of his own hair at the moment, you pushed up against the tool with all your might as you felt the magic go to work on your flat little body.</span></div></div>",

It's like magic man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, magic.\"  You said mildly amazed by this latest relatively minor magic feat by the toolbox and it's contents.  \"So...what did that Paint Remover do to me.  I didn't have any Species Changing Paint on me.  You notice anything different about me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, oh I know this one!\"  Kyle said raising his hand in the air as though answering  a question in class and also exposing one of the boobs he'd just been hiding.  After giving it a quick glance you ask, \"So what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sweating a whole lot.\"  Kyle said knowingly.  And now that Kyle mentioned it, you were sweating an awful lot since he splashed you.  But what was weird is that you weren't hot at all.  You wipe your hand off of your brow and look down before shouting, \"WHAT THE!\"  On your hand where you expected to be regular sweat, was what seemed to be liquid flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh snap!  Dude!  You're melting!  I saw this movie, it's like you're the evil witch!  That's what you get for looking at my boobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not an evil witch I'm your best friend!  Now figure out a way to fix me!\"  Kyle began to desperately look through the toolbox tossing all sorts of tools everywhere, but he didn't see anything that screamed, 'Stop your best bud from melting.'  You were to afraid to move that you would liquify or something, but the Flesh Stripping Paint Remover was doing it's job as your flesh seemed to melt off of you.  Finally it finished it's job leaving you as something you wouldn't have expected.</span></div></div>",

Nononononono!\"  You said frantically as you tried to catch the skin and muscle dripping off of your arm and tried to stick it back on, but you might as well have been trying to attach water to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I'm gonna miss you man.  You were the best bro I ever had.\"  Kyle said solemnly as he waved goodbye to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not dead yet!  I think!  I hope.\"  You said as the melting effect on your body continued to spread.  Both of your arms were now just bones that you still somehow were able to move like normal.  Looking down you could see through the neck hole of your shirt that your ribs were now visible and there was nothing inside of them.  It looked like your organs were liquifying too thanks to the Paint Removal stuff Kyle had splashed you with.  By the time you took this in it seemed you had stopped dripping flesh.  Mainly because you had no more left.  You put your boney hands to your face and felt nothing but a hard and smooth surface.  You close your fist and give your head a knock.  It hurt like normal but there was definitely a sound of hollowness meaning you no longer had a brain either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude you're still moving?  You're still alive!  Oh man that's freaking sweet!  And even better you have the greatest Halloween costume ever.\"  Kyle said.  \"It's not a costume it's my body!  And that's my body too.\"  You said pointing down at the frankly nasty looking mess on the ground.  You tried to cup your liquified body in your hands but it just siphoned through the cracks of your bone hands.  \"Dude, a little help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got your back Sid.\"  Kyle said as her ran off to the hallway closet where he returned with a never before used mop still in it's original plastic.  \"Are you really going to mop up my body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's either that or use a sponge, or do vacuum cleaners work on liquids?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't think so.\"  You said as you sadly watched Kyle mop up the liquid and put it into an empty trash can.  As Kyle did this you again felt your face.  It was definitely just a skull with nothing over it including lips, tongue, or eyeballs.  You had no idea how you were able to talk and see but figured 'Magic' was going to have to be the answer you'd settle on.  Once he was done Kyle put the trash can full of you in the freezer.  \"So...are you sure you're not dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug awkwardly and felt your shirt get caught in between your bones as you moved them.  \"Dang it, give me a minute.\"  And you removed your shirt and kicked off your pants.  \"DUDE!\"  Kyle said covering his eyes.  \"Might as well look Kyle, after all you already mopped up my penis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'm really glad I didn't use the sponge.\"  Kyle said as he got up to wash his hands.  \"So, what do you want to do now?  You want to try and fix this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta try, it's either try or go move into a haunted house.\"</span></div></div>",

Although you knew whatever Kyle tried might not work, he was your best friend and probably wasn't going to give up until you were fixed...or turned into something really funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle went to the toolbox and started digging until he found what he was looking for, \"Voila!\"  Kyle said holding the Gender Switching Socket Wrench into the air as though he had just pulled the sword from the stone.  \"How the heck is that going to help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this thing makes us grow boobs.  So if it can make you grow boobs like this it can also make you grow skin and stuff.  Sure it'll be girl skin but it's better than nothing right?\"  Kyle's logic wasn't too crazy so you said, \"Well what are you waiting for, girlify me man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure of what to stick the socket wrench to, Kyle went for the biggest and smoothest serfaces aka the back of your skull.  Kyle gave it  a few cranks and asked, \"How's it looking up there?\"  You looked at yourself and was a little disappointed to see the fleshy bumps you'd experienced before didn't grow.  But the socket wrench did something, you could see your pelvis shift around.  \"Nothing.  Oh man, my voice changed.\"  You were surprised by this minor change, but sadly you weren't closer to being a whole human being again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang.\"  Kyle said and he threw the socket wrench carelessly somewhere, \"What the heck!  Change me back.\"  Kyle just shrugged and went back to the toolbox, \"You said yourself it didn't really change anything, all it did was give you a prettier voice.  No big deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd think it was a big deal if it happened to you.\"  You mutter under your breath as Kyle once again picked another tool form the box.  \"Let's try this!\"  Kyle said holding up a yellow rectangle.  \"How in the world is the Gravity Switching Level going to fix me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle spoke slowly as though he was explaining something obvious to a child, \"Well, your skin and stuff fell off of you.  If I use this it might go back up onto you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you were pretty sure gravity didn't work like Kyle was saying, but you were desperate and wanted to try anything.  Kyle got the bucket of your melted flesh out of the freezer and put the bucket at your feet.  \"Go on, get in.\"  You lightly dipped your toe in the goop and felt (and weirdly saw) a shiver go up your spine.  It felt like you were stepping into freshly made pudding.  Trying not to think of your body as a desert you stood still and let the goo rise to your calf.  \"All right, let's do this.\"  Kyle said putting the level up agains the bucket of flesh and then he flipped it.  Suddenly the cold flesh pudding started crawling up your legs, through your pelvis and rib cage, and finally into your skull.  For a second you thought it might actually be working, but then it kept going up going through your mouth and eye sockets creating on of the surreal feelings you'd ever experience, and the liquid splat against the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang,\"  Kyle said again, \"I thought that would work,\"  And Kyle once again flipped the level before tossing it away.  Instantly a cascade of red and other colors splashed down on you back into the bucket.  It was the worst shower you'd ever had in your life.  Weirdly enough you were glad your head was a skull because at least you wouldn't have to wash that nastiness out of your hair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you poured the remaining liquid out of your eye socket, you hear the <i>snap</i> that sounded oddly metallic and before you could process anything you found yourself shrinking down and down and down until you we skull high in the bucket.  \"What the heck was the reasoning behind the Size Changing Tape Measure?\"  Kyle just shrugged, \"I dunno, magic?\"  You let out a very frustrated girlish scream as Kyle grew you back to normal size and looked for a new tool to use on you.</span></div></div>",

Your feet shrunk down and fused into a cloven hoof, a hoof that could not hold your weight.  You hit the ground and Kyle capitalized by running over the rest of your body with the paintbrush.  You tried to look behind you, but your now huge feeling neck didn't really let you look back at your body.  You could tell your arms had turned into another pair of legs.  You weren't sure what kind of animal you had become until you looked cross eyed at your own snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude!  You turned me into a pig!

It sits somewhere in the Pacific Northwest, just close enough to civilization that it does not lack for modern comforts, yet far enough away to be considered isolated from the rest of the state of Cascadia. Getting lost in the vast wilderness of the Northern Range state park is a very real danger for the unprepared. Especially so in the forests surrounding Owl Creek, your home town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are Logan Reed, a local 19 year old enjoying your complete and absolute freedom of summer vacation after graduation. You're of average height at 5'9, you're physically fit with blonde hair and blue eyes, and you're part of the 'popular' group at your high school. OR were, at least, given that you're no longer IN high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've got a full ride scholarship to Cascadia State University starting in the fall, so you're not overly concerned with getting a job just yet. Instead you've chosen to enjoy the moment and spend time with your friends from school, most of which you'll never see again once you all go your separate ways in the fall. This goes doubly so for your best friend Keanu Palmer, who you've known since both of you could walk. And despite trying to coordinate getting into CSU together, Keanu was eventually woo'd by a very lucrative football scholarship to Ohio State.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo before you end up separated forever, you and Keanu have been living the high life, partying whenever possible, hanging out around your small town and goofing off in general. That's how you both ended up in your current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you had been invited to hang out at a bonfire at Stacy Jensen's house, which sat right on the edge of the state park. There was nothing really unusual about it, you'd been there plenty of times before, but it was no big secret within the group that you had a thing for Stacy, though you never acted on it. You caught a ride in Keanu's vintage Camaro, a largely rusted piece of junk that he kept saying was going to restore, and when you both arrived it was just chilling out and getting your low key drink on with beers that Peter Lincoln had...'liberated' from his dad's stockpile. Erika Hinkle, Jordan Jones and Chris Penworth, your other friends slowly turned up at the evening dragged on. Jokes were had and all around it was another great night to be alive as the full moon illuminated the night. When the alcohol took hold and you all began daring each other to do things is when it all went wrong. Keanu had just taken your own dare and did a perfect back-flip off a nearby log while holding his beer. While you were all cheering, Keanu returned to the fire circle and handed you tally marked scuffed rock that the group was using to keep score in this ridiculous and meaningless game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right! Showed up your ass!\" He laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah\" You joked back/ You drained the last of your beer and tossed back by the cooler that Peter had smuggled them here in, listening to it clink against the other bottles that had steadily accumulated during the evening. \"So, what do you guys want me do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence and the crackling fire was all that responded for a few moments. You'd all been doing pretty juvenile things and the game was starting to get boring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Stacy started, before furrowing her brow, \"Let's make this one count for all the marbles! Last one gets the rest of the beer in the cooler!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Peter started to protest but he was quickly shouted down by the rest of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Logan, I dare you to take that rock and put in on Barnabas Point tonight!\" Stacy said, and another hush fell over the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarnabas Point was near the head water of Owl Creek, a craggy outcropping of rock that stuck out over the gorge where the large, ice melt and spring fed lake became the actual creek. It was deep in the woods, and while not dangerously isolated, going there at night would be rough. Not to mention dangerous. It wasn't too far from Stacy's house but it still made for a decent hike. On foot, on the designated trails, it was at least two hours round trip. At night, at least an hour more both ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Stace?\" Erika said, looking from you to her more than a little drunk friend, \"I don't think that's a good idea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy huffed and stood up, her small frame wobbling a bit, \"Well I think it's a good idea! WE get to leave something that will be there forever! Something from all of us! And then Logan can camp out there and then when the sun comes up we'll all go out together, take and We'll take a big picture and put it in something and mount it out there with the rocks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence again fell across your group. Erika and Keanu eyed you worriedly while Stacy looked as though she was on the verge of either crying or getting really, really angry. Peter. Jordan and Chris were all silent as they watched the exchange. And you had to admit, she did have a point. There was something...powerful about leaving part of your group behind at a place where it was very unlikely to ever get disturbed again. Not to mention there was still at least twelve beers left in the cooler.... But at the same time, you didn't really want to go out. One of the trails ran very close nearby and it and the other trails leading to the Point were often safe from bears and moose, but you could never predict wildlife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys are jerks...\" Stacy sniffled and she started walking towards her house, leaving the bonfire behind, the mood of the night having gone from enjoyable to buzz kill in a mattter of seconds. And you hated buzzkills, especially if you were involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stace, wait up!\" You said, rushing across the short distance to grab the girl by the shoulder, \"I'll do it. You're right, I think it'd be really cool to leave a piece of us out there! But I'm not going on the trail at night without any hiking gear, ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy sniffled again but the tears held back. You removed your hand from her shoulder and she gave you a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Logan\" She said, giving you a squeeze, \"It just gets to me that this is the last summer we'll all be together, I just want to make it special\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know the feeling\" You replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH GET A ROOM!\" Keanu mockingly yelled from the fire, breaking the tension and sending the group into a fit of laughter and catcalls. He was a good guy, a good friend, and he gave you a mock punch on the shoulder when you and Stacy returned to the fire. He grinned as you made a dramatic deal out of it, but then fixed you with a serious stare. \"I'm down with this, but we both know it's a bad idea to go out there ALONE. So if you go, I go.. That way when you wind up IN the creek I'm there to pull your drunk ass out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother round of chuckles as everyone looked over at Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, okay!\" She said, her face beaming and red, though from the beer or the fire you couldn't tell. Okay, so you can use mine and Peter's backpacks,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which Peter is HAPPY to donate. We'll give you guys some walkies, and some water and food just in case! KEanu, do you need to use my backpack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I still have mine in my car, I'll just go get it\" Keanu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a plan, Stace!\" You say. Knowing you'll have supplies makes this dare much less challenging. Preparation was always important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, then all you have to do is watch out for the Wackerknobs\" Peter said, he face dark,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are Wackerknobs?\" Jordan asked. The 'new girl' of the group, she'd moved into town a couple of years ago and had yet to hear the local legend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeanu rolled his eyes, \"They're boogeymen that are supposed to live in the forest, based off some old Native American legends. Some bat-monkey things made out of leather and wire and the only people who have ever seen them are the local druggies. It's a tall tale. They jump on you and, depending on which junkie is telling the story, they either bite you, fuck you, and they feed off of it like a vampire or something. The druggies are the only ones who have ever claimed to see them so it's probably just someone's bad trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you've got nothing to worry about\" Peter said, folding his arms and glaring at you and Keanu for a moment before getting up and retrieving his backpack from his truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes about half an hour but soon you and Keanu are loaded out with supplies to make the trip and are standing in front of the dark wall that is the tree line, your flashlights beaming into the vegetation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if either of you comes out before sun-up, I get all the beer!\" Peter hissed. You were pretty sure the it was the inebriation talking, but there was a sinister tone to his voice that you hadn't heard before Stacy had hugged you. Was he jealous? You didn't bother asking and simply nodded. With a wave, you both stepped onto into the woods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither you or Keanu had any idea what the two of you were walking into.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even with flashlights and the full moon overhead, it was slightly freaky being in the forest at night. It wasn't the first time, of course, you don't grow up in a small town with not a whole lot to do without ever setting foot in the woods, but there was definitely something different about tonight. During the day this was a pretty nice trail, it was a soft incline and in the winter you could see out across the valley where town was, as well as the creek's rather dramatic path down through the woods. But in the dark, though, all you could see was what was illuminated by your flashlight, and whatever moonlight made it down through the canopy. After a few minutes of tense silence as you left the glow of the campfire behind though, Keanu nudged you and slid his backpack off his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, don't worry. Bears don't come down off the mountains this late! And if we get into trouble, well...\" Keanu said enthusiastically as he unzipped his backpack and slipped his hand in. You recoiled when you saw, in the pale light of your flashlight, what he pulled out; a loaded magnum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" You half-yelled, back-pedaling away from your best friend, \"What the hell Kee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, it's legal!\" He joked before sliding it back into his bag, \"Remember when that moose fucked over those tourists last year? Totaled their car and put them both in the hospital in Big Tree? Well dad decided that  me, mom and him should all get protection in case it ever happened to us. That's why we were all out of town right afterwards, we were taking gun safety courses\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why am I just learning about this now?\" You frowned as you walked back over to your friend, still surprised and feeling a little bit betrayed that he kept this a secret from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Just sort of slipped my mind with all the college shit we were both doing. Anyway, it's not like I've actually had it on me a lot. Can't exactly carry a firearm onto school premises, even if it is locked in your trunk. Sorry, I guess.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could totally tell he didn't mean it, but you just gave him a look before turning and heading up the path, \"Well come on then, Rambo. I think we're almost there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you resumed walking in silence for a few minutes, the sounds of forest life all around you. Not that you were going to show it, but you did feel a little safer knowing about the gun. They weren't common but there were wolves and moose around, not that anything short of a cannon would stop a moose, but the added level of security did help. It would also deter any Druggies, should you stumble across a violent one. Most of Owl Creek's drug users typically kept to themselves, an eclectic group of men and women of all ages that seemed, on the surface at least, pretty counter culture. Though there were some in their small population that had a history of being violent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So\" You said, breaking the silence, \"What was up with Pete back there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got hugged by his girl and he got his panties in a twist about it\" The future football star beside you said, \"Man, you didn't know that Pete's been crushing on Stacy since Freshman year? I know you were hitting those books hard but dude, did not know you were that out of the loop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew he was crushing on her! Are they actually an item now?\" Stacy had been dating a guy in Big Tree, one of the larger towns in the next county over. It had been a bit of a scandal for a while, given that Big Tree and Owl Creek were sports rivals. But the guy had moved down to Seattle and that had been the end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe in Pete's mind! He's been trying to impress her since the break up. Why else do you think he would risk bringing all that beer to a casual bonfire?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, shit\" You said. Last thing you wanted to do was cause a rift between your group of friends over a petty love triangle. But your further thoughts were interrupted by a soft glow up ahead. The Point wasn't fully lit, but there was a small United States Forest Service monument with a plaque on with a bunch of boring information about the explorers who found it and it's significance to the biosphere or something. There was a concrete landing next to the actual point where you could look out over the gorge and the lake, complete with railings, benches and a single solar powered light post.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet!\" Keanu said, \"I was tired of walking anyway.\" The two of you picked up the pace, but as soon as the landing came into full view you both stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, sitting on the bench across from the dim light, was the vague silouette of another person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up, Keanu said, sliding his backpack off and retrieving the magnum, \"Just in case\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded silently as your friend shoved the firearm into his back of his pants, flipping his shirt over it. With a nod of readiness from him, you both slowly proceeded forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys can stop being sneaky. I've heard you both coming for like fifteen minutes\" The stranger called out. The voice was airy with a very slight nasal twinge to it. There was a flick of light that lit up an obviously feminine face as the stranger lit a cigarette and took a drag, the embery tip blazing somewhat ominously in the shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we don't want any trouble!\" You called out, holding a hand in front of Keanu's chest while you ascertained the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there won't be any. I don't bite, kid\" The woman's voiced sounded bored, maybe annoyed, and with a nod from Keanu you both moved forward slowly, exiting the woods and stepping onto the overlook. Your flashlights danced over the woman's figure; limp brownish red hair, a oval face with dark, brooding green eyes, pouty lips, a slight dash of of freckles, what was clearly a joint and not a cigarette hanging limply from her lips. She was wearing a leather coat that concealed her arms but did little to hid her not inconsiderable bust that seemed poorly restrained by a gray top, and her jeans were ripped and torn in several places all the way down to her seen-better-days sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://img00.deviantart.net/b9f7/i/2017/095/4/4/plum_lips_in_the_forest_by_stephanie_van_rijn-db4td10.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://img00.deviantart.net/b9f7/i/2017...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christ! Get the light out of my eyes!\" She hissed, and you and Keanu quickly clicked off your flashlights, both muttering an apology. The three of you stared at each for a moment before she made a sarcastic motion for you both to sit down, which you did, cautiously. The wind and rustle of leaves filled the night, the woman pulling out her phone and staring at it for a few minutes before clicking it off and sticking it in her pocket, taking another drag on her blunt before staring up at the sky, letting her drugs hand idly from her narrow fingers. In the dim light you could see the smoke curling off into oblivion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\" Keanu suddenly blurted out, \"I know you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" The woman replied, never moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're that chick that works at the gas station out by the highway! It's Allison Pricefield, isn't it? Graduated a couple of years ago?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my name. Apparently.\" It was hard to tell through the sarcasm but you detected a bit of bitterness in her voice. \"And yeah. I've seen you both around. Also seen you both staring at my ass from your cars. And down my shirt. So hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think my mom goes to church with your mom. It's,,,Amber, right? And you've got a little brother? Dad works at the mill in Big Tree?\" Keanu continued to press her, despite her obvious attempt at baiting both of you. This was his thing when confronted with strangers, he always tried to press for some form of familiarity so that he didn't feel so awkward. And if this was Allison Pricefield, you were in the presence of one of Owl Creek's Druggies. And outside of the marijuana, there was no telling what she could be on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five for five. Way to be. You think if you get six maybe I'll suck you off for a dime bag or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat shut Keanu up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So\", Allison said matter of factly, sitting up straight again and fixing you both with a curious stare before taking another hit, \"Why are you two all the way up here? Looking to get some quality fucky fucky time in where you thought no one would be? Romantic date?\" Her eyes twinkled mischeviously in the dim light of the light post.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! No! No. We're out here because of some friends!\" You blurted out, \"We're here on a dare, that's all!\" Your answer didn't seem to satsify her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boring. But I guess so was I back then. Now it's just come here, sit for a couple of hours, get high and go home. Hell, I probably still am boring, I just wear it better!\" She said with a harsh, almost hateful laugh, flaring out her jack and and shaking her breasts at both of you in a very un-ladylike manner. You were weirded out but kind of turned on. It was true you and Keanu had scoped Allison out more than a few times at her workplace. This though, this was pretty amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison smirked at both of you before leaning back,  taking another long drag off the dwindling roll of paper that sent her mountains rising and falling. You figure Keanu must have been choked on his own drool as he was suddenly struck by a coughing fit. You shot him a glance to make sure he was fine before shifting in your own seat to hide your growing erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, Allison. Is this what you do every night? Come out here all alone just to get high?\" You asked. Honestly, weird as it was, you were glad for this very strange turn the night had taken. Maybe talking with her would make the night go by faster. Plus the more you stared at her, the more you stared at the marijuana she kept smoking so damn sexily. It was kind of making you want to give it a try...But your thoughts were interrupted by her reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only when the moon is full. Wasn't really my choice, but I guess this is what I was destined to be\" You could almost feel the hate and bitterness in her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" You asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison stared at you for a moment before taking another deep, sexy breathe. And then she...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Allison stared at you for a moment, taking another deep, sexy breath before leaning forward, holding her hand out to you, the diminishing joint held skillfully between her middle and index fingers. Her dark nail polish weakly reflected the dim light, and her face was dead serious, those deep green eyes staring directly into yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a hit, and I'll tell you exactly what I'm doing here\" The woman's voice was quiet, yet full of determination. In the dim light you could see the dead seriousness in her eyes, you could smell the smoke coming off the paper, the burning plant within. You could feel the temptation, not just for Allison's explanation but because a part of you really just wanted to cut loose. You only got one of these kinds of summers, after all. Keanu must have seen the look in your eye because he shot off the bench and tried to smack Allison's hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck that! Get that shit out of our faces! Logan, don't do it man!\" You could see Keanu's face taut with anxiety, though you found it a little hypocritical that he'd so violently reject marijuana, yet have no problem taking part in under-age drinking. And you knew why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ke, I don't have to worry about random spot checks from my university. I can do whatever I want!\" You said calmly, reaching out and plucking the stub of a roll from Allison's fingers. She leans back as you inspect it, her pretty face never losing that look of dead seriousness. Every now and then her eyes flickered towards the tree line, but the largely remained locked on you. You stared at the rolled piece of paper for a momet, casting one last look at Keanu who simply shook his head, before you took a long drag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body recoiled immediately, not prepared for the heat and smoke. You began coughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold it in. You cough out all the smoke and it won't work\" Allison said, her eyes still locked on you. You did as she asked, forcing your body's reflex to cough out the smoke. As soon as your body stopped shuddering, you felt the effects. Lightheadedness, a slight tingling sensation, but nothing else. You were actually a little disappointed as you flashed Allison a grin and handed it back to her, your fingers brushing against hers and the touch seemed electic. She paid it no mind as she turned to face Keanu, the joint pointed towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really should try it.\" She said, and her voice was almost...pleading? There was a twinge of desperation in it, and the disappointment was clear in her eyes when your friend batted her hand away and moved to sit on the far bench. \"Well, just remember that I tried\", she said, before she tossed the blunt to the ground and stepped on it with a shoe, smuching it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you were going to tell us why you were really out here\" You prompted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" She sighed, \"Yeah, I did. It's going to sound weird but I promise on my life that every word of it is true\". This was so weird, she was like a whole new person now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was about a year ago, I came here with my best friend and our girlfriends. We were touring the state, a fun little summer break after the hell of college finals. I was studying engineering at Cascadia State University and just needed a break. I'd never been here until that moment\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullshit!\" Keanu hissed, \"Your family has been around here all my life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just what you remember, kid\" Allison tossed back, before continuing on, \"Back then, my name was Bruce Cunnigham. My best friend Jason Knowles, and our girlfriends were Kathy McClane and Jessica Young\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a trans?\" You blurt out, and Allison fixed you with a evil look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, if you keep interrupting, you're never going to hear it. And you need to hear it, okay?\" Annoyance was creeping back into her voice. You apologized and told Keanu to keep his own mouth shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway. We made a unplanned stop here, the girls had to pee and we needed to stretch our legs, so we parked down at the trail head, it was close to getting dark but we wanted to try the trail. We took too long, the sun was going down by the time we got here, so we didn't waste anytime taking a few pictures and being disappointed by the dumbass plaque. I decided to break out the Mary on the walk back, it had been awhile and I felt the need for a hit. I was taking a drag when it happened, when we were attacked. You guys have heard of the Wackerknobs, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For fucks sake!\" Keanu cried out, \"Logan, let's get out of here man, she's just pissing around! We'll do the stupid dare another time, ok?\" Keanu stood up from his bench and walked over to the edge of the woods, \"C'mon, let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No dude, I want to hear this\" You said. You knew it had to be total bullshit, but there was just something about her voice, her looks, you were more than a little seduced and interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck me, seriously\" Was all your friend said before he marched back to his bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again. Every word is true. We were a little ways back down the trail when they just fell on us, one for each of us. They were about the size of dog, but they looked like...I don't know it was dark. They had devil like tails and webbed arms, like a flying squirrel, and they were gray with these red markings all over them with faces like a those grinning faces on a Indian totem pole. They were just all over us, hissing like a cat, and then the one of me bit me! It bit me right on the goddamn neck!\" Allison pulled her hair out of the way and revealed her neck, a finger pointing to a patch of flawless skin, \"And I passed out\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unbelievable...\" Keanu scoffed, crossing his arms and making the 'let's get out of here' eyes towards you, but you ignored him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I woke up\" Allison continued, her voice trembling a little bit, \"I was like this\" She gestured to her body. \"I went from six foot one to five foot four, breasts, pussy, everything. And I was surrounded by strangers. Where Jessica had been, there was a little boy, looked about four. Where Kathy had been there was a older man that looked like a lumberjack, and where Jason had been was a woman that I'd soon come to find out looked a lot like me. And they all woke up the moment I did. So on top of instant gender changes, the real scary thing was that they acted like it was completely normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People just don't change gender. Or age backwards\" Keanu said, rolling his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried explaining what happened but none of them remembered. I tried the whole rest of the walk back to our car, which had changed from a Nissan Sentry to a big Chevy SUV. I tried forever to try to see if any of them remembered, I even tried running back up here, but dear old 'dad' stopped me. And then we drove home. To a house I had never been in, in this podunk little armpit of a town I'd never heard of. And it was like we'd been here all of our lives!\" A tear rolled down Allison's cheek and she brushed it away with a sniffle. \"Instead of studying for engineering, I wasn't even enrolled! And when I tried calling all the numbers of our previous families, all I got was \"I don't know anybody by that name\" and a dialtone. My own mom hung up on me after telling me I didn't exist!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still not buying it, but this was one hell of a story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over time and constantly trying to convince this new family, my new parents, they screamed in my face that I had to stop because I was putting 'dangerous thoughts' into the mind of the little boy that used to be Jessica. I said I wasn't, that this was wrong and we were not supposed to be a family. So they kicked me out and told me to not come back until I stopped acting like a lunatic. Talk about judgemental, right?\" She sniffed again, \"So that's when I got the job at the gas station, I had a credit card that managed to get me a piece of shit trailer in the trailer court outside of town. So now my life is nothing but ass grabs and turning over my paycheck to the asshole landlord. Whatever I have left is for food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...If you used to be a man, now you're a woman...And your friends became your mom and dad with no memory of who they were...so why do you come out here?\" You asked, still curious despite the incredibly crazy story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only thing I can think of why I remember is maybe because of the marijuana. Maybe that one hit I got in saved me from completely turning into Allison Pricefield. That's the only thing I can think of. As for coming out here? It happened on a full moon, so every full moon I come out here and wait, hoping they'll grab me again. I hate being a woman. I hate this life! The only goddamn thing that helps anymore is the weed!\" Allison's voice broke and the tears started flowing freely, she wiped at her eyes and choked back a sob, \"Goddamn weepy ass emotions...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is such bullshit, Logan. You can stay if you want but I'm getting out of here!\" Keanu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't go back down the trail. They're already out there, probably tracking you since you entered the woods\" Allison said, her composure returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so suddenly you're the expert?\" KEanu shot back. You were caught in the middle. The reasonable part of you told you to leave, get up and just go. But that reasonable part was outnumbered by the more intoxicated part of your brain. This was making for one hell of a little adventure.</span></div></div>",

You're stoned out of your mind, Wackerknobs are not real, people don't just change gender, reality doesn't rewrite itself! This is fucking nonsense! Logan, we have got to get out of here!\" Keanu was losing it, but this was just too good to pass up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ke, just go. I'm gonna stay here with Allison and finish the dare. I'll see you tomorrow, okay?\" You said, and you saw his mouth fall open in disbelief. There was a few heartbeats of silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck it! Just fuck it. Fine!\" He yelled, and crashed back on the far bench, \"I'm not leaving you out here alone with some Druggie, dude. Even if this is the most bullshit story I have ever heard in my life! WEll, go on then Ms. Bruce Cunningham. Regale us with your knowledge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little shithead. Fucking trying to save you and this is the thanks I get. Fucking asshole\" Allison mumbled, her hands sliding inside her coat pockets and pulling out another rolled joint, lighting it and taking a drag before handing it over to you once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks, but I think I better just stick to one...\" You started, but the look in her eyes...There was just this intensity that made you partly believe what she was saying. You shrugged and took the roll, giving it a quick, shorter puff before handing it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better. Listen, I know it's wrong, but I'm the only 'Druggie' anymore that actually cares about any of this. The rest have just given up on turning back, or are into the really heavy shit. All I want is to turn back into Bruce and if I can keep you two numbskulls from this, then all the better.\" Allison leaned back and took a longer drag, staring up at the star for a moment before pulling back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So. Wackerknobs ARE real. I'm proof of that. I've done some digging, whenever I get a chance. That hole in the wall you call a town library has no answers and I'm clearly not getting onto the high school campus, so most of this I've had to pull together from going to the archives in Big Tree, and some pretty heavy duty Internet surfing. The other 'Druggies' don't like to talk about their shit and they really hate people that pry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Oh, Internet knowledge. Clearly you are font of all wisdom from that truthful place\" Keanu sneered, but Allison ignored him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Wackerknobs are actually called 'Wa'Acha Nobe', demons from local Indian mythology. They seek out people with strong destinies and change the victim's destiny to something else. Clearly they prefer the modern variety of profitable career futures, since I went from engineering student to working at a goddamn gas station and living in a fucking trailer park\" The bitterness in Allison's voice was so strong you could almost taste it, though that could have just been the drugs. You both shared another puff before she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's literally all I could find out. The tribe that lived around here got wiped out, so there's like a paragraph's worth of information about them. Everything else is just urban legends that we 'Druggies' have created, because we're the only ones that remember getting changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How convenient\" Came the heckle from your best friend. \"Only Druggies remember any of this while the rest of us poor normal people go on oblivious to the fact that these powerful, mythical animals are just running around in the woods every full moon. Seems legit\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't have anything good to say, Ke, do you mind shutting up?\" You snapped, his negative attitude finally getting on your nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man, you're too busy 'living the dream' and can't see she's just gonna try to get you to buy drugs when she's done. To keep you safe, of course.\" He gave Allison a smug look, \"After all, the drugs will keep us safe. Not to mention for someone that wants to 'turn back' so badly, why is she getting high? Bit of a hole in your story there, babe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison bent down and picked up a small rock and threw it at Keanu, \"Hey shitfucker, you ever think about the fact that it's 3:30AM and I have no idea if they only come out on full moons? I'm fucking grasping at any straw I have here and your shit doesn't help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when you heard it. A branch snapping overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck me!\" Allison screamed, her eyes going wide at the sound.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Allison screamed as something large charged out of the black wall of darkness that was the treeline. You and Keanu leap to your feet and out of the corner of your eye you can see your friend's hand slide back towards the magnum he hid in his waist. Your adrenaline spiked, was it a wolf, a bear, a moose or...was what Allison saying true? Either way you were terrified, and the pot you had had been smoking for the past few minutes didn't exactly help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised and immensely relieved when the familiar form of Jason tumbled out of the treeline and falling hard on the concrete of the observation deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason!? What the hell are you doing out here?\" You exclaim, rushing forward to help your friend up. You reached down for him, not expecting him to violently bat your hand out of the way before clumsily pulling himself to his feet. That's when the intense smell of too much alcohol washed over you, and you saw his eyes, enraged but slightly glazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was very, very drunk. \"Finly\" He slurred, \"Found you two asholes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason, what are you doing out here?\" You repeated, and you were very uncomfortable in the zombie like stare he gave you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you Logun! Came out here t'beat your ash fer touchin' my girl!\" His hands balled into fists and he stalked towards you, only for Keanu to leap in his path, hands splayed apart in a plantive gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason, dude, he didn't mean anything by it, it was just-\" Keanu was cut off as JAson shoved against him, his attention focusing on the new target in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you! You sthole my g'damn tickets! S'pposed t'be me goin' to Ohio! Now I gotta stay her and rot!\" Jason roared, taking a swing at Keanu, he leapt backwards directly into you. The two of you crashed to the ground and you felt the immediate pain of a foot flying into your abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get up! Both o'you get up! Gonna pay fer evrything!\" He reeled back for another kick but from the tangle of your bodies Keanu's leg shot out, nailing Jason in the shin and sending him toppling backwards, howling in pain. The two of you untangle yourselves and you painfully scamper over towards Allison, who just rolled her eyes at the spectacle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither you or Keanu had noticed that in the fall, your friend's firearm had become dislodged, sliding across the pavement and vanishing as Allison grabbed it in lightning quick flash of movement while the three of you were distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't know there was going to be a Fight Club convention here tonight. I would have worn my cheerleader costume\" The Druggie replied, her voice full of snark as she took a disinterested drag on her joint. You glanced up from heaving in pain to see her roll her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you were too busy watching your best friend and someone who you had clearly misjudged as a friend beat the living shit out of each other. It wasn't much of a contest, Jason was just too drunk to do much more than swing wildly at Keanu, who had the immediate benefit of being mostly sober. But that didn't keep his opponent from landing a few heavy blows. Both boys had already split open each other's lips and blood was pouring freely from Jason's nose, but the larger boy simply didn't seem to notice. You were just glad that for now, his attention was focused on someone that stood of a chance of winning; you were fairly certain that Jason would have mopped the floor with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when it all changed. When the barely lit trees seemed to come alive as three child sized creatures leapt out of the darkness and into the dull light of the blood splattered concrete. They were gray, covered in what looked to be red tattoos and had long twitching tales and terrifyingly large mouths with blunt teeth. Their white on black eyes started unblinkingly at each of you for a moment before they charged with a screech that made your ears feel like they'd start gushing blood. Two of them tackled Keanu and Jason, the two boys yelling in pain as the otherworldly beasts bit them. The third one raced past it's compatriots in a beeline for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" Allison screamed from beside you, and to your surprise she jumped in front of the creature right as it sprung forward on it's powerful hind legs towards you. You wasted no time and diving behind the bench Allison had been sitting on, watching as she was attempting to...hug the creature? Her arms were wrapped tight around it's smaller form as she fell to her knees, pinning it momentarily with her weight. She was screaming something, but your brain just couldn't process it with everything else. It lookedl ike she was crying? But then with a screech the creature tossed her to the side like she weighed nothing and fixed it's eyes upon you once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another screech it charged you again and you ducked behind the bench, praying that it would somehow protect you from whatever the hell this nightmare was. You clenched your eyes closed as you felt something hard and wiry slid around your ankle and  a powerful, clawed hand slid around the back of your neck...</span></div></div>",

You open your eyes and look down at where you felt the creature's tail sliding around your ankle only to see a cloud of ash-like smoke fading into nothing. Then you feel a much smaller, softer but still strong hand grab you by the scruff of your neck and haul you to your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon kid we gotta get out of here!\" Allison screams in your face as she pulls you around the side of the bench. In her other hand you see the dull glint of Keanu's revolver in her hand, smoking wisping from the long barrel. You catch a glimpse of Keanu and Jason laying motionless on the concrete, the two other creatures hunched over them. The bodies of your two freinds appear to be...changing? YOu don't have time to get a closer look before a fresh screech draws your eyes to the treeline, where another nightmarish creature is bounding out of the darkness towards you. There's no way of knowing if it's a different creature or the one Allison just dispatched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUCK!\" Allison screams and fires the gun once more, but the shot goes wide and she screams in pain as the recoil knocks her backwards. The creature pauses only for a brief moment before continuing it's pursuit, but Allison recovers and pushes you forward towards a small flight of stairs you hadn't noticed before, just off to the side of the observation deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GO! JUST FUCKING GO!\" Your rescuer screamed as she pushed you forward, sending you almost tumbling down the steep, narrow and unlit stairs. Forward momentum and sheer luck is all that keeps you from falling and breaking your neck. You feet pound hard against a mixture of concrete and flat rocks as you seem to descend forever into the darkness, the setting moon providing very little light as it slips beyond the far treeline. You don't try to stop and think, you can hear something scrabbling in the darkness behind you. It doesn't sound human so you simply keep moving forward as fast as you can, knowing that somewhere below is the tiny rocky beach next to the lake. You hear Allison calling your name but you just don't risk turning to look or even reply, your heart pounding in your ears and your lungs gasping for breath, all your senses firing at maximum all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what feels like an eternity of descent you hit uneven, but mostly flat ground. You don't pause to look though, all you can tell is ahead of you is deep inky blackness that divides the rocky, less dark strip of beach where you stand. Seeing no other place to go you simply peel off at a dead run towards the waterline, the breath of something nightmarish caressing the back of your neck...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Right as you feel the unnatural claws on your shoulders, your feet hit the cold water of the lake. You don't stop, slogging forward and kicking up a massive spray of water until you finally dive under, submerging yourself in the frigid water. YOu stay under for as long as you can, your clothes weighing you down dangerously, but eventually you are forced to come up for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sharp inhale as you break the surface cuts through the night and you flail in the darkness, your soaked hair in your eyes and your body stinging from the cold. You fling your hair out of your eyes and take a panicked look around, though there's not much you can see in the darkness, just the dim light from the observation deck above you and the bright light making it's way down the steps, shining out at you but too far away to truly illuminate you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Logan! Kid! Are you okay? Are you, you?\" Allison's voice calls out from the direction of the smaller light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Yeah I'm here!\" You shout back, your voice echoing off the tall walls of the canyon as ou start the laborous process of swimming back to shore while fully clothed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO STAY THERE!\" Your rescuer screamed back, shining the light of her phone forward onto the rocky shore of the lake. You immediately freeze. There there in the harsh light, is the creature. It's white on black eyes staring at you, never blinking as it paces across the rocks, moving not unlike a gorilla, it's long tipped tail curling freakishly. \"Just...just stay there! I don't think it can touch the water!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo there you stay, eventually having to closer to shore as your body begins to give out from fatigue as the cold seeps into you. YOu come in, despite Allison's cries, close enough so that you're able to fully stand, the black water lapping around your knees as you pull your shirt off and tie it around your waist as you begin rubbing your chest furiously attempting to warm your body back up. Allison stands guard on the beach, the light of her phone locked on the creature, who in turn stays locked on you. Eventually you hear a dual screech from above as the two creatures apparently finish feeding on Keanu and Jason, mounting the railing of the observation deck and staring down at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour and half pass in silence as you try to keep your body warm. Allison's phone eventually goes dark as the battery runs out, the flashlight having drained it, ensconcing the creature in darkness once more. You can still feel it out there, stalking you, waiting for you to make the mistake of coming to shore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is the longest night of your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all nights end, and eventually the dark sky begins to brighten, the earliest birds chirping as they awaken. You hear a low growl from the direction of the shore and the intense scrabbling of something disappearing up the cliff face. You look up at the observation deck and the two creatures that were there have vanished. You may be in the clear, but you're not taking that chance, not until you can see for sure. Eventually the sky lightens enough to illuminate the shadowed wall. The sun won't be directly on it for hours more, but it's enough light to show that the creature is gone. Allison even patrols the thing strip of rocks herself to make sure before eventually giving you the all clear to come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally reach dry land, you nearly collapse. It's only Allison that keeps you upright, your eyes meeting hers with an exhausted stare, which she just returns with a knowing look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know the questions that you want to ask, but you're too tired, and too scared, to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, the two of you make the long climb back up the stairs to the observation deck. Step after step until finally you're there on the  landing, staring at two adult women cuddled asleep on a large quilt that covers most of the concrete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne, in a yellow sweater, in stunningly beautiful, with long, black, silky hair framing a soft round face with plump, perfectly kissable lips. Her sweater hardly hides the two large breasts that strain against the fabric, and her tight jeans are equally strained holding in two womanly hips and plump rear. Two long legs that end in tiny sneakers finish her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other woman is a blonde. Platinum. Her face is angular and Nordic and framed by the illusion of endless golden curls that run to the small of her back. Her top is constrained by two breasts that are even larger than the first woman's, held in check by a red tank top. Her arms are fit and toned, and the tank top is short enough to show her firm and toned midrift. Her rear is not as prminent as the first woman's but her legs seems to just go on forever in a pair of black tights terminating in pink jogging shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women are cuddled together in what is clearly a lover's embrace. A single white and pink backpack lays nearby, mostly deflated. Your back still lays where you had put it, but there's no blood, no sign of anyone else having ever been there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, kid\" Allison begins, \"What happened to me happened to them\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure if it's your soaking wet pans making you numb, or just utter shock.</span></div></div>",

Your friends were gone, instead replaced by two women that looked extremely attractive and were obviously a few years older than Keanu and Peter had been. They actually looked the same age as Allison (who while you had yet to ask, looked to be around twenty-four). Both women are wrapped in each other's arms, the blonde's face buried near the brunette's expansive chest beneath slightly curled locks while the brunette in yellow began to stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit!\" Allison hissed and began moving backward, pulling you with her. You both manage to not tumble backwards over the narrow stairs as you move just out of line of sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" You whispered, your brow furrowing, \"I need to get to Keanu!\" Your struggle ends as soon as it begins, as Allison delivers a swift punch to your side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your friend is gone. He wasn't smoking so he's been transformed body and mind. The only ones who will remember him is anyone that was high. That means us, my friends, and anyone else. No one else in the entire world will remember him. That's what the Wackerknobs do.\" Allison's voice was barely above a whisper, her eyes locked on the precipice of the stairs, \"And I'm not getting tazed by a couple of braindead lesbians because we spooked them\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\" You begin but your words are stolen by an elbow to your side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove you were the signs of life, the woman in yellow slowly moving around, stretching. There's a light, almost inaudible whisper that you can't make out and then the soft trampling of underbrush. You can't take it. You pull free of Allison's grip and quickly, but quietly make your way back up the stairs to the landing. The busty woman in the yellow sweater is gone, leaving the very attractive blonde curled on the quilt. Her mostly covered face held a hidden, sleeping scowl and her smaller body began to stir before her eyelids flashed open, revealing twin pools of blue. She bolts upright, her frantic breathing sending her not insignificant chest heaving in her red tank top while her blonde hair flashes across her face as she spins around trying to take in her surroundings. Then her face whips downward and her toned arms and slender hairs fly up, grabbing her breasts before recoiling away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god..\" You hear her whisper in a sofy, airy voice that seems on the verge of hysteria. A hand clasps around her throat as she chokes back a sob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait' You think to yourself, 'She doesn't know what's happening...What if..'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde is clearly attempting not to hyperventilate as her hands slowly venture forward again, and you decide to make your presence known by scrapping your sole on the concrete. Her head flies up, her hair everywhere, her blue eyes wide and full of fear and barely restrained tears. But then you see the recognition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Logan?\" She stutters, \"I-I don't...What...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keanu, is that you?\" You ask, taking a cautious step forward, \"Or are you Peter?\" There was simply no way to tell which of your friends it was, literally all trace of who they had been were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me! I'm Keanu!\" She sobs loudly, her new voice echoing off the canyon walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christina, are you all right?\" Another female voice from not too far off in the forest calls back. Framed by canopy shadow and the shafts of morning light, you can see the top heavy form of the woman that used to be Peter rise up some distance away from behind a large bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" Allison says, her suddenly very close voice making you jump. You turn to look at her but her eyes are completely focused on Keanu, or rather, Christina. \"I guess sticking it under his nose was enough...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Logan, what's happening!?\" Keanu/Christina sobs, \"I'm a chick! I've got tits! Hair! This can't be happening!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of hastily trampled underbrush and Keanu's now crying eyes demand a response.</span></div></div>",

Meet us at the town park at noon, we'll figure it out!\" Allison hisses again before grabbing you by the arm and giving you a painful pinch, your small yelp of pain blasting away any sort of reply you may have had. You glare down at her...And find her wrapped around your arm, her own large breasts pressing up against your flesh in a way that is incredibly pleasant. Her face seemed transformed, where once had been a dark, brooding, intense scowl there was now a chipper, almost happy look on her smiling face as she slid one hand down to slip in between your fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny words of anger you had died before that had even formulated, and any question you might have had vanished in panic as the brunette tore from the underbrush like an angry, pretty attractive, bear, glaring at the both of you. Keanu's new face turned to stare at the new arrival as she struggled to get her waterworks under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you?\" The woman that had been Peter asked icily, her brown eyed stare boring into you and Allison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, like, good morning!\" Allison said, her voice was high pitched and very girly, so different from the smoky, almost gruff voice you had grown used to hearing, \"Sorry if we totally scared your! Me and my boyfriend just showed up a few minutes ago and were down by the water! SO romantic! I'm glad you, like, convinced me to get up early, babe!\" A very girlish giggle erupted from her lips and she stared up at you, her eyes wide and twinkling, but you could see the message behind them: Play along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cough and turn to face the woman that had been Peter. \"Uh...Yeah!\" You look down at Allison, \"Glad you enjoyed it, honey!\" You turn back to Peter, whose guard seemed to be lowering, \"Yeah you were both still, ugh, asleep when we got here...Hope we didn't wake you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Peter' looked you over and crossed her sweater covered arms across the yellow expanse of her breasts, \"Did you go swimming while you were down there? You're soaking wet!\" A long, almost accusing finger pointed outward towards your still dripping clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh..\" You began, blanking. You were never much good at improvising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, L.O.L.!\" Allison's voice chimed up, spelling out all three letters of Laugh Out Loud, \"He tripped and totally fell in!\" Her face turned from mirth to concern, \"If you guys go down there be suuuper careful! It's totally rocky and stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" The woman that was Peter said before quickly striding over to Keanu and covering the smaller woman with her arms, her large rack mere centimeters from th former boy's face, which was now much calmer but it was clear the panic was still there, just under the surface. \"Aee you all right, Christina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeanu/Christina looked at Peter's changed face, then to you and Allison, and then back, \"Y-yeah. They just, um, spooked me right as I was, um, waking up is all!\" You could tell your changed friend was trying very hard to keep his raging emotions in check as he tried to play it cool. 'Peter smiled and then leaned in, giving Keanu a very unexpected kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're okay, that's all that matters. Next time I suggest something like this, just tell me to book a cruise!\" 'Peter' stood up and gave you and Allison a much friendly, apologetic half smile, extending a slender, manicured hand out, \"Sorry about that. I'm Danielle, and this is my girlfriend Christina. We came out last night for a date\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at her hand for a moment before you feel a nail dig into your hand, and you quickly take Danielle's hand with your free hand and give it a shake. It's strange, your hand almost engulfs hers, the soft, smooth, creamy skin had, only an hour and a half ago, been much larger and flying at your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'This is so weird I can't even'</i> You think before Danielle releases your hand and gives Allison a much shorter one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was SO nice to meet you! Like we're really sorry for the scare!\" Allison said, completing the greeting before turning to look at you, \"Babe, you ready to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance at Keanu, who is still on the quilt behind Danielle, and she gives you a quick shake of her head no. It's clear she doesn't want to be abandoned here with someone who is a complete stranger to her. You wait for a moment, then nod your head dramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we're done, let's get going\" You half mutter, \"Sorry again about the scare, yeah\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No harm done!\" Danielle smiles, \"It was nice to meet you, have a nice day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a parting nod to Keanu, who simply stares back like a dog left on the side of the road, you and Allison leave to begin the long walk back to civilization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, we're still going to the park for lunch, right babe?\" Allison asks, though when you look down her face isn't cheerful anymore, instead back to it's original intense scowl, She motions backwards towards Keanu and Danielle with her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Yeah! Yeah, we'll go right at noon and have a picnic!\" You say loudly, and grimace silently in pain as Allison's eyes tell you to not over-sell it. You do your best to apologize with your own eyes. She remains on your arms until you've vanished from line of sight from the observation platform, immediately removing her arm and body from you and quickly fishing out another roll of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus! Haven't you ever faked before? Like seriously kid, that was pathetic!\" Her voice is back to it's smoky, snarky original tone as she flicked out her lighter and lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder if she's permanently high, and realize that you actually miss the feeling of her on your arm before replying, \"Well forgive me for being tired, wet, and still in shock from being attacked by monsters and watching my friends get turned into women. Unlike you, I don't have a lot of experience at any of this, miss Punk Barbie\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison pauses and gives you a long, very dark look, \"It was the quickest way to get out of there. And if you ever call me that again, I'll kick your fucking ass and put one of these out in your fucking eye, prick\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shiver runs down your spine. Usually verbal threats of violence rolled off your back, but you could see it in her eyes. She was absolutely dead serious. You feel like moving would be a bad thing in this moment, so you choose to defuse the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. I'm just...Really tired. And, uh, thanks I guess for saving me. And for sharing. At least Keanu won't be totally alone now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison's face softens and she walks past you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...Don't thank me too much. Part of me did want to see what kind of a chick you'd turn into. Better angels, I guess.\" Her voice was very matter of fact as you began walking as well, quickly catching up to her shorter frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously!?\" You said incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I mean the only reason I was out here was to try to change back anyway. Which clearly is never going to happen. Was stupid to hope there was a loophole.\" The bitterness had returned, and you recalled how she had intercepted the Wackerknob right as it had jumped for you, and how it had tossed her aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit. I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kid. It's almost six, it was a rough night, and there's a lot more to do do today. Let's just not talk for a little while, okay?\" Her voice was almost pleading, you could hear that same desperation that had crept into her voice while she was telling her story start to return. Allison was clearly tough as shit, but it was clear that the night's events had taken a toll on her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Okay.\" You reply, and the two of you hike the rest of the trail in complete silence, both locked in your own dramatic internal thought processes. The Wackerknobs were real! And if they were real, what else out there existed with the power to reshape reality? Could the changes be reversed, somehow? Or was Keanu truly stuck as Christina forever? And if even memories were untouched...How many people in Owl Creek had been changed? Who was truly who they were born as and outside people like Allison, who truly remembered who they were?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind did somersaults over itself as you struggled to process the information, it was so busy that before you knew it, you and Allison had reached the head of the trail, and the parking lot. There on the pavement, half shrouded in the early morning fog, sat two cars. One, a Chevy cavalier, had clearly seen better days. The paint was faded, even missing in some spots. The tires were in dire need of replacement. The other was a modern and clearly new white sedan, complete with pink pin-striping down the sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Allison's and Keanu's'</i> You think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Without stopping the two of you make your way to Allison's junker, pausing only long enough for Allison to manually unlock the driver side door, slide in and lean over to unlock the passenger door. You brace yourself for the inevitable stench of a smoke stained interior, of garbage piled around your feet...But the interior is surprisingly clean and barely smells at all. The only thing truly negative that you can pick out is that it's just old and worn out like the vehicle's exterior. The look on your face must have been obvious as Allison rolls her eyes and reaches for her seatbelt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really have to stop letting go of stereotypes, kid\" Is all she says as she slides the key into the ignition, the engine groaning to life and a burst of black carbon shooting out of the muffler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\" You say, lowering yourself into the car. A very small part of your mind asks what you're doing, getting into a vehicle with a woman that, despite all the shared experiences of the last few hours, is still very much a stranger to you, but you push it away, staring quietly out at the forest as the car lurches forward out of the parking lot and down the quiet road. It all looked so different now, before it was just trees stretching as far as you could see, covering the hills before bark gave way to stone as the mountains rose upwards. Where once was just the every day scenery you had grown up with, now there was just the deep unknown. What else lurked in the trees, especially where man did not tread?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, so we need to make a plan\" Allison's voice jerks you from your thoughts, \"You can come crash at my place for a few hours until we head to the park\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, \"First you gotta swing by my house. If I don't let my parents know what I'm doing it'll just cause a freak out\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't just call them?\" She asks, glancing away from the road and then quickly away as you pull your dead cellphone out of your still damp jeans, \"Right. So where do you live?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe forest walls begin to thin out as you get closer to the edge of town. Homes begin to appear through the thinning treeline, and past Allison's head you can see the clear hillside and Stacy's house where the madness all started. You don't even register that your remaining friends are most likely getting ready to hike out to the Point to meet you, a plan that feels like it happened a million years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a few more miles up the road\" You say as you settle back in the seat, getting as comfortable as you can. Your body feels like lead as exhaustion begins to quickly erode the layer of adrenaline and shock that had kept you moving the past few hours. If you knew what time it was, you'd guess that it was quickly approaching 9AM, when you had gotten up yesterday. Your eyes slip closed for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAKE UP!\" Allison's voice calls out loudly, and you jerk yourself upright, head pounding and eyes blurry. You're sitting at the first major intersection of town where this road crossed the main highway; you had clearly fallen asleep for just the smallest amount of time since Stacy's house was ten minutes away from this point. \"Kid, you're not the only one piss-ass tired but you've gotta tell me where to drop you off\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked a few times and point down the road, \"It's the third house on the right\" You say, and Allison's car creaks forwards before picking up speed once more. Just a few seconds pass before she stops in front of your house. Everything looked normal as always; and dad had already gone to work, his black sedan missing from the driveway while mom's Nissan sat in it's usual spot. Your own vehicle was in the garage where you had left it, when Keanu had picked you up. Your mind started to wander down the road of what-ifs once more, but Allison gives you a hard whack on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll wait right down the road and you can follow me to my place. Now go on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and climb out of her car, Allison barely waiting for you to shut the door before taking off. You're really just too tired to care about the rudeness and you march the short distance across the lawn and pull your keys out of your pocket, unlocking the front door and sliding in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOM, I'M JUST HOME FOR A SECOND\" You call out, kicking off your damp sneakers and treading across the hardwood floor of your home as silently as you can as you head for the stairs, trudging up as quickly as you can. You make it to the top without incident and head for your room, stripping off your clothes along the way. You dash into your bedroom and finish stripping, tossing your old clothes to the floor and pulling on clean, dry ones as fast as you can. You reach into your closet and pull out a pair of old sneakers that you mostly just use for beating around in. Satisfied, you dash back out and almost knock over your mom, who was walking down the upper hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" She cries out, \"Logan, how many times have I told you to slow down!? You could have hurt me!\" Your mother fixes you with a disappointed look, her hands resting on her hips. For her mid-forties, mom is still pretty fit, though there's no denying that she's been slacking on her diet. Her black hair is tied back in a bun and she's wearing her housework clothes; a pale blue t-shirt and sweatpants. Her look of disappointment vanishes when she sees your exhausted face. \"Honey, are you all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Oh,yeah!\" You give your mom your best smile to ease her worry, \"Just hung out by the fire too long. Me and Keanu were gonna go grab some breakfast-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" She asks, confused. It takes you a moment to realize that in this reality, there is no Keanu. He's an adult woman now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I meant Stacy, brain fart. We watched John Wick last night so mind on Keanu Reeves\" You say, pushing the lie out and ignoring how awful you felt about everything. \"She's kinda waiting on me to go back and pick her up, mom\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou desperately want to get out of there without tipping your mom off. She eyes you for a moment before sighing and sliding past you, heading down the hall to your parents bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, just be back by six, all right? Have a good day, love you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, got it. Love you too, mom\" You say, suppressing a huge sigh of relief as you bounce down the stairs and make your way through the house and into the garage. You hit the garage door switch and the sheet of metal begins to squeal open, the bright morning light lancing in and illuminating your red Ford truck. You pull your keys out and climb in, waiting just a moment for the garage door to fully ascend before pulling out and taking off down the street where Allison's junker is waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou honk your horn once as you approach and she honks back, pulling out in front of you and the two of you make the small convoy back to the highway. Your nerves are alert now but you can still feel yourself fading as the low growl of the engine, the motion of driving starts to relax you again, but you fight off the lure of sleep. A few more minutes pass before you reach your destination, following Allison's blinker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere it was. The infamous Owl Creek Estates. Row after row of trashy single wide trailers stacked almost on top of one another, all in various states of disrepair. You creep behind Allison down the narrow access road the runs the length of the trailer park, eventually pulling to a stop near the end as Allison pulls into the single small driveway of a faded yellow trailer with a ramshackle front porch. You park in front of the trailer and turn your truck off, getting out and walking over to Allison. You feel eyes all over you but you don't look, just beelining for the woman in front of you, who is busy unlocking the front door to her trailer. The door opens, and you follow her in, your eyes taking a moment to adjust to the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, you fall victim to what you believed was the Druggie stereotype. You expected a trashy interior to match the outside, a pig-sty befitting someone who spent their days and nights high on some drug or another. But it, much like Allison's car, is largely clean; the largest problem is just the sheer age and the very dated interior or something that had been built in the late 70s or very early 1980s. A long, low couch that may have once had flowers decorating it sat across from a small television, a single threadbare recliner sitting next to it. A cheap fold out table and three plastic lawn chairs sat around it. The windows were covered in black trashbags and curtains, blocking out almost all light. The carpet was a almost non-existent gray affair that may have once been a different color and longer, but no longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's you\" Allison said, pointing to the couch before pulling you inside and locking the door behind you. \"We're gonna get about two hours of sleep so make it count. I'm setting my alarm. Bathroom is the first door down the hall. Stay out of the other two rooms or I'll kick your ass\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in the low light you could see that utterly serious look on her face, and you nod. You kick off your shoes and roll onto the couch, shifting around on it's ancient cushions trying to get comfortable as Allison disappears down the darkened hallway. There's only a few sounds of movement and the creak of a mattress before everything goes silent, with only the soft ambiance of a mostly empty trailer park outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fall asleep almost instantly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Wake up, kid\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a hand rocking your body roughly, and your eyes snap open. Everything is dark, blurry...This isn't your room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wuh...Where am I?\" You moan, pulling yourself up. And then, along with a massively pounding headache, your mind begins to think coherently once more. You're in Allison's trailer. And everything that you had hoped was a bad dream is still very much real. \"Fuck...\" You mutter, your eyes glancing up into Allison's covered breasts for a moment before you roll back on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, fucker, get up. Quicker we do this the quicker we can get back to sleep!\" Your host snarls and this time drags you up by the collar of your shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christ! I'm up! Jesus!\" You yell, flailing your arms and knocking hers off of you. You stagger for a moment and rub the sleep out of your eyes. \"Okay, lets...do whatever it is we're going to do?\" You stagger over and start slipping your worn out sneakers on while Allison unlocks and opens the door, the bright light making your headache worse and your eyes clench shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get over it, pussy. We'll take your truck, she'll recognize it. C'mon\" Is all Allison says as she pulls you out of her home and slams the door shut behind you, locking it. You squint through your eyelids as your eyes slowly begin to adjust to the light of day. On the extremely short walk you glance at Allison. She's had a change of clothes, much like you. Now she's wearing a black Punisher t-shirt turned tank top; the sleeves had been cut away, and her mid-rift was showing. Her pants looked a bit newer, a more deeper blue. Her coat was gone, but given the heat of mid-day that was understandable. Her breasts bounced just right beneath the messy white skull and you realize how much this woman turned you on, though you will your member to stop stiffening as you reach your truck. You both climb in and quickly leave the trailer park, heading back into town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you going to do for Keanu?\" You ask, blinking the last remnants of sleep away. You're still exhausted but at least you were somewhat recharged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off, I'm gonna tell you to not use that name anymore. She's Christina now and forever, and to the rest of the world, always has been. The quicker you and her get on that page, easier things will be. The rest? Just talking, and I hate repeating myself. So just listen when we get there and don't ask questions\" Allison said with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just forget he was ever my friend? Call him by a name he got literally...\" You look at the clock on your truck dashboard; 11:55AM, \"Seven hours ago? I don't think so\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's your choice, but you'll just make her life harder. Not exactly what she needs right now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And soul crushing 'truth' is? Tell me now, what are you going to tell him?\" You press, anger rising in your stomach. But Allison just ignores you, and the rest of the short trip lasts in silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTown is somewhat busy as workers go to and from lunch, but small town traffic is nothing that poses a threat. You easily make it through town and find an open spot at the park. You don't see the white pink pin-striped car anywhere, but you can see Keanu. It would be hard to miss the awkward looking woman sitting on a bench under one of the park's trees. She clearly hasn't changed clothes like you or Allison. You park and the two of you get out of your truck and walk over. You only make it halfway before the woman leaps up and races across the grass to you, her breasts bouncing messily from the motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Logan!\" Keanu shouts, nearly knocking you over from momentum as she grabs you, \"Oh god, you have to fix this! I can't stand it! Everything feels wrong!\" She turned to Allison, her eyes wide with panic, \"Please tell me you know how to fix this! I can't be a woman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your fucking voice down!\" Allison hissed, pulling away and heading towards the bench Keanu had been sitting on, \"Last thing we need is for people to start staring\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHate and anger flashed across Keanu's pretty face, tears already welling in her eyes as she turns back to you. You shrug and motion forward with your arm, and the two of you walk back to the bench where Allison is waiting. You both take a seat, and for the first time you notice how much shorter Keanu is now. You didn't realize how you towered over her standing, but now she's barely the same height as you just sitting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, and you're not gonna like it. You're a woman, now and forever. No way back unless you can magic up th money for a sex change operation. Even then, still this body\" Allison's voice was flat, almost bored, \"Second, you're Christina now. No one else but us remembers the old you. You have to realize that and accept it. Otherwise you're gonna have a very tough life\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you!\" Keanu screamed, shooting up to her feet and pointing a delicate, feminine finger in Allison's scowling face, \"I'm not just giving up who I was!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then don't. Don't listen to the advice of someone that went through the EXACT same thing as you are going through right now, but was stranded in a town she didn't know and no one knew her at all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeanu's accusing finger curled back and she took a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I suggest that you sit the fuck back down and listen to me, because the next time you interrupt me, bitch, I will walk out of here and leave you and Logan to figure all this out yourselves\" Allison's voice was cold again, and you reached out to grab Keanu's...Christina's arm. Her skin was soft and smooth even though she recoiled at your sudden touch, turning to stare at you with wide, open, tear-filled eyes. You guide her back down to the bench as she begins sniffling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Third\" Allison continued, \"Don't think about it so hard. Whatever changed us, even if we were immune to the brain wipe, it still reprograms us to know our bodies. Don't focus on trying to act like who you were, that just makes you look like a freak. Just act normal, ignore all the feelings, you'll pick it up quick\" Allison paused as two older women, joggers, passed by the bench, giving your small group a strange look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here's the big one\" The Druggie stated once the two women were out of earshot, \"You've got to get high every now and then, if you want to remember who you were\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Christina screamed, and you felt your jaw go limp. You weren't expecting that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you think there's a unusually high collection of drug addicts in town, hell, in this county? Those things change us, and i we're lucky enough to remember, the magic or whatever it is will eventually shove it all out, make it less important. You start becoming who they changed you into and everything you were will start to feel like a very distant dream. You'll /like/ what you've become. You'll embrace it. Don't believe me? There's a stripper in Big Tree that loves dancing. She used to be a fourteen year old boy. Barely remembers any of it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" Christina started, her head drooping down and staring into her cleavage, then her hands. \"This...This isn't fair!\" She whispered before she broke down into quiet sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison stood and stretched, \"It sucks. It sucks ASS. But at least you've got a support system. You may annoy the shit out of me but I'll show you the ropes of how to do all the female bullshit\" She turned to you, \"Kid, I'm gonna go get a sandwich. Give you guys a chance to talk\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Allison walked away across the park, leaving you and your changed, crying friend alone. After a few minutes of uncomfortable near silence, Christina finally composed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just can't fucking believe this is happening...I just can't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, dude\" It feels weird calling this attractive woman a dude, but it's still your friend under all that womanly flesh. Even if oyu are forcing your brain to accept her name as Christina and not Keanu. \"Are you okay at least setup wise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a derisive snort Christina shoots you a dark look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you can call...\"</span></div></div>",

And then she simply got up and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean anything by it. Good luck, boys!\" She said wit ha backwards wave of her hand as she vanished back down the trail. You and Keanu shared a look of confusion before he gave you a cartoonishly large shrug before dumping his backpack at the foot of one of the benches before sprawling across the bench itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was weird\" You said, sliding your backpack off and taking a seat, staring back down the trail, \"But not gonna lie, pretty damn hot\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeanu smiled \"Yeah, she was totally playing with you, dude. But I wouldn't touch her. She's a Druggie, got kicked out of her house and she lives in that trashy trailer court outside of town. My mom and her mom go to church together, story is that she was telling a bunch of weird stories and traumatizing her little brother. She wouldn't stop so they kicked her out, then she just fell in with the other Druggies\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Druggies, of course, were all outsiders in your small, conservative town. They just kept to themselves for the most part, working jobs to fuel their habits. Their territory was the trailer court that Allison supposedly lived in and it drew a pretty rough crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn\" You said, \"But I don't know dude...Her tits were huge!\" It was no real secret to Keanu that you were a breast man. You appreciated the entirety of the female form, but the larger the boobs, the better. Until they became like abnormal looking. There was certainly a limit to what actually looked attractive and what was just disturbing, but yeah, Allison's had turned you on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are we gonna do for the remaining...\" You checked you watch, which read 3:30AM. Stacy and the others were supposed to meet you here at 8, \"Next five hours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I mean I brought my iPod so I'm gonna listen to some tunes. You bring anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head, you'd left the house with just your half charged phone. In case there was an emergency you didn't want to risk running ti dead just to alleviate some boredom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess you're shit out of luck then!\" Keanu grinned as you flipped him the finger good naturedly. The two of you settled in for the night, talking and just hanging out. In all honestly it was pretty fun, but exhaustion started to take it's toll within the next hour as the moon dipped beneath the treeline. Before either of you knew it, you were both asleep on the benches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were also a little damp from a coating of dew and you could tell that several mosquitos had dined on you while you slept. As you blinked the sleep from your eyes and stretched, you gave your surroundings a quick, if a little blurry, check. The morning sky was a light blue and dotted with a few lumpy clouds, the sun had yet to creep above the horizon and the entire observation deck was still shrouded in the shadows cast by the forest, though now you could see down through the trees as opposed to last night when it had simply been a wall of utter darkness. Satisfied with your saftey, you looked over to your companion, your roomate, college compatriot, best friend and lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiana Young was stretched out across her own bench, her backpack propped up beneath her head as a makeshift pillow while the wires to her iPod earbuds snaked through the zippers into the compartment where she always kept her valuables when the two of you would go hiking. Your eyes wandered across her pretty round face that was framed by luxurious, silky black hair. Even when she slept her lips looked delicious and you fought the urge to kiss her. Instead your eyes headed downward, tracing their way across her yellow sweater and the twin peaks that pressed heavily against the fabric before sloping down towards a flat, yellow plain that hid her toned midriff. Not content with ogling her torso your eyes made their way past her wide, mature hips and down the lengthy, slender legs that her hiking jeans hugged perfectly all the way down to her tiny feet that were currently hidden in a pair of worn sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, sending your own not insignificant mountains jiggling beneath your red tank top. You finally pushed your own auburn hair out of your face and quickly tied it into a loose ponytail, while not as long as Kiana's it was long enough to get in the way and you had taken it out when you laid down on the bench to sleep. You wanted to get it cut but your girlfriend loved shoulder length hair, and you loved feeling sexy for her. Then, as your body fully awakened, you felt it. That undeniable urge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you made sure no one was nearby and you darted into the woods as fast and as quietly as your own sneakers would carry you until you found a sufficiently sized bush. You take another glance around and dart behind it, unbuttoning your own jeans and sliding them and your panties down your slender legs. You do your best while squatting not to get them wet, and you immediately regret letting Kiana talk you into a romantic late night rendevous without at least packing some napkins. You shudder to think what you'd have to do if you'd had to do more than just piss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved, you stand and make yourself decent before making your way back to the observation point, grinning as you see Kiana slowly awakening. You pause in the woods for a moment just to take in the undisturbed beauty that is your girlfriend's bountiful breasts shake as she stretched, before quickly striding over and giving her a quick peck on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning sleepyhead!\" You said with a grin, thinking that the grumpy look on her face was absolutely adorable, \"Did you sleep well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiana responded with a huge yawn that showed off her perfect set of pearly white before rubbing her eyes, \"Next time I want to do something romantic Christina, just tell me to get a hotel room. Woman was not meant to sleep in the elements\" She gave you a small kiss on your lips as you took a seat beside her. Dual morning breath aside, it was a good breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, your lust for adventure sated? Ready to head back?\" You asked with a twinkle in your eye. There was just something about Kiana that drove you absolutely wild. Being with her was exhilarating, fulfilling, even when your body ached from lack of proper sleeping conditions. She completed you, and you felt yourself grow warm and wet staring into the deep blue pools that stared back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe for adventure...\" She purred, and the two of you shared a longer, deeper kiss. You don't stifle a moan as she squeezes your tits and setting your body on fire. You slide a slender hand around and cup her bountiful ass in your palm while your other snakes it's way under her sweater...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she pulls away, a coy grin on her beautiful face. There was the reason she was the lead in the relationship. The confidence. You were sometimes jealous of her job as a model and that you'd never gotten farther than a yoga instructor in Big Tree. But you could never stay mad at Kiana for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tease!\" You pout, feeling every gallon of blood pump through your veins and your panties grow damp as she sticks her tonuge out at you before collecting her backpack. You want to be mad but you just can't help it, she knows how to turn you on in just the right ways. You'll be craving her until you both return home to your shared apartment in town. It takes every urge in your slender body not to push her back down on the bench and straddle her. But you resist, collect your own backpack, and you both wander back down the trail, your fingers sliding between her's as you begin the long walk back to the parking lot where your car was waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of you, two gorgeous women caught in the throes of lust and love, see the silhouette of two strange creatures bound off towards the deepest parts of the forest. Or the woman sitting in her own car at the far edge of the parking lot, a cigarette in her hand a look of sad amusement on her face as the two of you emerged, laughing, from the trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your lesbian lover drive away into the morning sun, completely unaware that only hours ago you had both been teenage boys on a dare. Now you were just two adult women, living your lives your lives together, whatever that may entail. If there was any part of the old you left in Christina's soul, you would have regretted ever going into the forest for some stupid, childish dare.</span></div></div>",

War never changes.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the year 2077, the great trial of Humanity was concluded when the verdict was delivered with the gavel of nuclear armageddon. Humanity had become it's own judge, jury and executioner as the need for resources on a suffering world led to each major power on Earth launching their entire stockpiles of nuclear weapons at each other, nearly wiping the face of the planet clean of life. Those on the surface that survived were changed, left in a world charred by irradiated hellfires, forced to survive by any means necessary. And the animal life, once abundant and relatively benign, mutated into monstrous creatures from the stuff of nightmares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever not all of humanity was doomed to annihilation by nuclear fire or the long, slow struggle of trying to survive the impossible. Buried, deep beneath ground, were a vast serious of Vaults: Massive bunkers where humanity could survive pure and unchanged, waiting for the day when the surface would finally prove habitable again. But these Vaults were not free for everyone, only those chosen by Vault-Tec Corporation were allowed to join. Many did, but many more perished, banging on the heavy Vault doors for a rescue that in many cases, never came. For this initiative, the Vault-Tec Corporation were seen as heroes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to nearly everyone, nearly all of the Vaults were built for much more sinister purposes. Vaults are designed to keep you safe from the ravages of the Great War that kill the world. But in truth, they are all part of a vast social experiment carried out by Vault-Tec Corporation and the United States government in secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this Vault, Vault 63, hidden away in the forested expanse of northern New York state, carried a very special brand of Forced Evolutionary Virus, or FEV. Where in the future, FEV gives rise to the horrible scourge upon humanity known as the Super Mutants, but here, in this Vault, things are tuned just a little bit differently. Instead of changing you into a Super Mutant, instead the purpose of this experiment is to deal with seemingly spontaneous gender reassignment. Using the specially modified FEV and the air filtration system, all residents of the Vault will change into the opposite sex, sex organs, voice and all. The Vault's secrete research team have also made several items that could even speed the process up, becoming instantaneous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo monitor the effects of the FEV strain on relationships between family members and peers without disruption, Vault 63 is set up with two sectors divided into specific gender: all males inhabit the western dorms and work on the power and industrial facilities, while the females inhabit the eastern dorm and are in charge of logistic, such as farming, cooking, teaching the children of the Vault. The two genders are only allowed to meet during the final meal of the day for three hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the Overseer, the unquestionable tyrant ruling the Vault, knows more than what he is saying.<br>\r\n____________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst things first, what time period does this story take place in? Does it take place immediately after the bombs drop and sentence the entire planet to death by intense nuclear bombardment, or does this take place in the far off future or 2188? Or are you one of the very few who have been in the Vault since before the bombs dropped?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were walking down the boardwalk, one late summer Sunday. You were living the good life at the ripe age of twenty-three, fresh out of college with a degree that against all odds actually landed a job in the field you had studied for (accounting), a nice apartment in the cozy suburbs of San Mateo City, a decent car. a caring family and good, supportive friends...Yeah, life was good. Save for the looming specter of your student loan debt, but the job would eventually take care of that, so you were not too overly worried. Really the only thing you were lacking in your life was, well, romance. Despite your only slightly above average looks, you sadly never had much luck with members of the opposite sex all through high school and college. There had been flings, of course, plenty of one night stands, but you'd never truly experienced anything more than what amounted to lust. Any attempt to pursue a relationship simply fell flat on it's face, and it was, so far, the one thing you really regretted about your young life so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at least you were well off in almost all areas otherwise, so that had to count for something. Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been particularly bored this morning, waking up a little too early on the last day of the weekend, and after sitting on your butt in front of the computer monitor for a couple of hours you decided to get out and enjoy the fresh air of the beach. It was a little hot, but it beat sitting around waiting for your friends to wake up or get off work<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if I had someone...\" You muttered to yourself in your otherwise empty apartment. The darker thoughts of why you seemed to be so unlucky in love started to creep into your mind, but you pushed them away as best as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you showered, jumped into some casual beachwear and made your way to Pacific Beach, the long strip of golden sand that stretched for several miles across the California coast. After your fill of surf, sun and fun, you had made your way up to the boardwalk and pier as the sun began to creep closer to the horizon. Had your friends been with you, you might have partaken in the small amusement park on the pier, but riding the rides alone seemed a little embarassing, so you stuck to poking around the various shops on the boardwalk, a dizzying array of goods and services available at prices designed to steal as much cash from tourists as possible. As the lights of the boardwalk flickered to life as the sun vanished beyond the edge of the world, you were about to call it quits, go home and prepare for work the next day. Outside of the boardwalk's prices, though, you had actually really enjoyed yourself today, and were proud you pried yourself out of the chair to enjoy a little Californian summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that's when you saw it, hidden at the farthest end of the boardwalk where the wooden planks gave way to hotel barrier walls and parking lots. It was a...some kind of barber shop? Or some sort of novelty store? The inside was several walls filled with all sorts of items, herbal jars to normal jars to antique toys to modern comic paraphanelia, all surrounding the single barber chair that sat in the middle of the shop. For a moment, you thought it was closed, but then you spied the old, bespectacled Indian man sitting behind an almost invisible counter, itself buried until a rack of exotic looking candies and...was that butter? Weird. You stepped back, edging towards the beach and craned your neck, looking for the name of the shop, but there was only the slightly Japanese themed exterior on the store as it seemed to cling to the very edge of the boardwalk. You frowned at the lack of identification and turned to walk away when the old man seemed to spot you, slowly rising to his feet and inviting you in with a friendly wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why not?\" You mutter to yourself, and you walk inside, the door jingling loudly in the cramped confines of the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, welcome, welcome!\" The old man said with only a hint of an accent in his voice, \" I see you have found what you are looking for!\" The old man said as he rounded the counter and stuck his hand out. You shake it sheepishly as you look around at the enormous array of knick knacks and other items. It seemed like there was even more, now that you were inside, some of the shelves looked like they could collapse from the walls from the amount of weight on them! Yet the shelves never seemed cluttered, just full. Every item was arranged just so, a maximum use of space and efficiency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have? What am I looking for?\" You say as you stare in near sensory overload.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relaxation, of course!\" The old man chuckled as if he told some obvious joke, \"You come to the beach to relax, to get away from that which troubles you. But you don't come here searching for the short lasting effects of impulse shopping, no, you came to my shop in search of something that will change your life forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is that?\" You hope your tone of voice would make it clear your were determined not to be swindled out of you hard earned cash, but the old man simply gives you another smile and points to the chair that dominates the middle of the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, sit! A massage is what you need, something to complete your day and make that cloud of negative energy go back to where it belongs!\" His voice was warm, soothing, the strange 'just enough' exoticness in the accent that you couldn't help but be pulled in. The old man seemed to sense your hesitance, or maybe saw the look of disbelief on your face, and he quickly changed tactics. \"And, for the price of a massage, you may choose one item from the store to take with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a pretty good deal, and after scanning the shop for a moment you nodded, sliding into the chair as the old man smiled. Almost immediately he went to work, his old, leathery hands pulling a spray bottle out of seemingly nowhere and moisturizing your hair with a mist of H2O. When your hair was suitably wet, his hands slid beneath the strands and began working the tight skin of your scalp, back and forth, raising it, lowering it, and you had to admit that it felt absolutely incredible. It wasn't often that you even bothered rubbing your own head, so the movement was almost a cascade of relief you didn't know you needed flowing down your body. You felt yourself sink into the chair as you closed your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, what causes the negative energy in your body?\" The old man asked, and for some reason he sounded far away. Or maybe you were just REALLY relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing\" You say, but then you speak again, \"Well, something. Too many couples out on the beach today and I just felt left out\" You don't really know where it came from, but you don't question it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha\" Your masseuse says as he crumples your scalp together, thumbs resting on pressure points you didn't even know you had, \"Unlucky in love! Is this new?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N...no\" You mutter, drifting off, \"No it started...started back in igh school. Never could hook...up with anyone. Or college. Just gets old...being single\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can help with that\" The old man says, a chuckle in his voice and for a moment his hands stop moving the tight skin of your scalp, only to return with a new liquid that you don't see, but it smells absolutely amazing. You feel his hands return, this time to your face, a softer affair as the smell of whatever it is flooding your nose. \"This is a special oil from my homeland. Once it soaks into your skin, you will no longer be unlucky...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man says more, but between the massage and the smell, you simply drift into some sort of strange in-between state, like you were floating in a warm, soft, and gentle darkness. Your body tingles as the nerve endings seem to be firing off, and you simply allow yourself to enjoy this strange, unexpected but not unwelcome experience for as long as it lasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, it does end. And you sit there for a few moments, relishing the final wave of relaxation as it fades from your nervous system. But when you finally open your eyes, you immediately realize something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were no longer in the shop. Instead, you were sitting on a small wooden bench in the middle of a large, locker lined hallway. It was almost immaculately clean, featureless walls and glistening tile that seemed to catch the light of newly risen sun as a small crowd of various younger people in uniform hurried past. It was almost like they were...late to class? And what the hell were you doing here!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull yourself upwards and feel something wrong with your body immediately. You look down and see that you're also in a uniform! And there's a backpack next to your feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis isn't possible. Somehow, in that strange shop, you had either slipped into a meditative coma vision, or somehow had been transported and changed into a high school student! But that..that couldn't be possible, right? You look down at your uniform once again and realize that you're...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You blink twice, trying to get your bearings.  What the hell was going on?! The somewhat familiar dry boardwalk beneath your feet had been replaced with lacquered wood, slightly scuffed by countless shoes. Your casual clothes replaced with black slacks and a starched<br>\r\npolo shirt, complete with striped tie. And for some reason, your face was as smooth as the day you were born. You never had a particular fondness for your facial hair \u2014 you could never grow anything past 'scruffy \u2014 but the sudden absence of it was more perturbing than you would have ever expected. It was all of these small things adding up that were tipping you over, sending your breath into near hyperventilation. Nearby hallway pedestrians look askance at you, some weird boy having a panic attack on the hallway bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then your panic is interrupted by a; \"You alright there, sport?\" and a heavy hand clapping down on your shoulder. You look up into a man's bearded face that seems to ooze geniality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look a bit lost there, kiddo,\" he says, his eyes twinkling with mirth. You're about to rebuff him, but you realize that he honestly could be right about that right now. Were you? God, everything's so <i>weird.</i> You swallow down the roiling sea of emotions in your head and answer him with a simple nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the guidance counselor around here. Name's Dan Sandworth, but you can call me Sandy, Dan, or any variations thereof.\" He extends his hand that you take, expecting a handshake, but to your mild surprise, he hoists you up from your bench shaped sanctuary. he starts to amble away, but stops after a few steps and turns back to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the new transfer student, right? C'mon, follow me. We gotta get you oriented, or Ms. Mulberry'll have my ass.\u201d He jerks a thumb behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe talks the entire time you walk, winding your way through strange hallways and past unfamiliar rooms. You half listen, mostly catching half-phrases like, \u2018glad you transferred here\u2019<br>\r\nand the name \u2018Amai Academy\u2019. You\u2019re mostly distracted b the people you pass by. All kinds of shapes and sizes: A group of kids with pale skin and weird highlights, some hastily stubbing out their cigarettes when they see Sandworth pass; not that he seems to notice, a group of girls dressed in bubblegum-pink and skirts that were <i>clearly</i> below regulation length, a group of boys and girls in too-expensive clothing \u2014 and far more. You give your clothes a self-conscious tug \u2014 why were you the only one wearing the uniform?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make it to your apparent destination after a bit, Sandworth either ignoring or not catching a few student couples snogging in the stairwell. A black lacquered door with the code A14 stands in front of you. Dan opens the door for you, gesturing you in with a mock bow. Your entrance into the room is greeted by a woman. An astonishingly beautiful woman. Brown hair, bright brown eyes behind wire-rim glasses, smooth skin, and \u2014 well, you avoided looking at the obvious areas, but they were ample enough to draw your attention, given the tight clothing, but yet her classic blouse slash pencil skirt... The most impressive part about her, however, was the effort she put in. That is to say, practically none at all. Her hair was in a messy bun, tied around chewed pencils, her graded papers had smiley faces and frowny storm clouds in place of grades \u2014 but still, she looked like something out of a storybook. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at her a bit before you\u2019re interrupted by Sandworth. \u201cShe\u2019s a looker, ain\u2019t she, squirt?\u201d he mutters to you. As per his norm, he doesn\u2019t wait for an answer, leaning in to whisper to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, she\u2019s spoken for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe strides across the room and cups his hand onto her face, tilting her head up. She lets out a surprised squeak before he presses their mouths into a kiss. She reciprocates it for six seconds before breaking away hurriedly, face red as a tomato. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-Dan, we can\u2019t \u2014 I-I mean\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gesticulates wildly, sending papers flying everywhere, causing more panic, all the while Dan just laughs. Grabbing a sheaf of papers, she swats him with it mercilessly. He laughs all the while, however. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter calming down, she turns to you and greets you with an outstretched hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello there, you must be the new transfer student I\u2019ve heard all about!\u201d  You take her proffered hand and she shakes your hand vigorously. \u201cI\u2019m Ms. Mulberry - it\u2019s lovely to meet you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scrabbles through the mess of papers in the room for a good twenty seconds before you cut in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Bryan. Bryan Shaw.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmidst her cleaning of the scattered forms, she shoots you a bright smile. \u201cAh, well I\u2019ll be your homeroom teacher this year! Let me just\u2026\u201d She rustles around in her desk before emerging with a card. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour student ID!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, there\u2019s a brightly smiling picture of you on it, if not a bit younger than you\u2019re used to. Your birthdate matches your newly changed appearance, having shifted by five years to render you eighteen. In the slightly shiny plastic, you catch a glimpse of your reflection \u2014 the picture does seem to ring true. A chill runs down your back \u2014 was this some sort of weird coma dream?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour small existential crisis is interrupted by your new teacher. \u201cBe sure to hold on to that! We scan it to check your meal plan at the cafeteria, let you into clubs and let you into your dorm! The club fair is Wednesday evening in the gym, so be sure to be there to make some friends!\u201d <br>\r\nShe ruffles around for another paper on her desk, eventually picking up four with one manicured hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOh, also you\u2019re rooming with\u2026\u201d She scours over one of them.  \u201cOh. Nicholas Dower.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff in the corner, you can see Sandworth\u2019s regular smile fall by a few notches. \u201cOh boy, you really put the new kid in the same room as <i>him</i>, Lexi?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Mulberry\u2019s smile turns to an angry pout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good kid, Dan, just a bit\u2026 misguided. And don\u2019t call me that when we\u2019re working!.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan\u2019s face returns to its usual foxlike smirk as snakes an arm around her waist. \u201cBut school is out right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulls her in a little closer, before turning to you on a second thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, kid, take a right out of the gate and keep walking \u2018till you see a gloomy house on your left. That\u2019s your new digs.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to the door to leave them to their privacy, as one last comment follows you out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Chester? Try to have yourself some fun out there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attempt to find the exit in the school before finding a convenient map, but you do catch a weird sight before you finally make your way to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spy a cavalcade of girls led by a boy amble through the hall, looking from side to side. The girls were all similar: pendulous breasts suspended by front-tie tops, their lacy bras exposed by the miniscule garment. Their long legs extend from scandalously short skirts, which are covered by stockings that only belong in Halloween costumes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy who leads them looks like a parody himself. He stands a couple inches taller than you, and his height is further helped by the blonde mohawk. He has two of the girls on either side of him, almost prostrating themselves for attention. There\u2019s a redhead, a blonde, a black haired girl, and some alt chick with a mohawk just like him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>I knew that this place was bullshit, but <b>this</b> is some bullshit,</i>\u2019 you think to yourself. Was this some sort of hell reserved for people slightly unhappy with their love life. You try to ignore the sight, but you notice something peculiar as the five turn into a classroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey\u2019re hauling a small boy wearing glasses behind them, with frizzy brown hair and a panicked look on his face. The mohawk kid slings him in first, and his harem of girls follow behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re no hero, but you\u2019d be damned if you were gonna let someone get the shit kicked outta them, even if it was in this bizarro world. You run over to the door and try the doorknob. It\u2019s locked tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start kicking at the door. It\u2019s pretty solid, though, so you don\u2019t accomplish much other than making a ruckus. You\u2019re about to shout to someone, anyone, but the door bursts open before you can say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mohawked guy looks down at you, a slightly annoyed smile on his face. \u201cCan I help you there, bud?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly winded, you point a finger inside. \u201cYou\u2026. Another guy\u2026 In there\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sneers at you, opening the door further. Revealed inside are the four\u2026 no, five girls that followed him. You didn\u2019t catch the short brunette girl following them in. She\u2019s about a head and a half shorter than you, and she wears the same sexy schoolgirl outfit as the rest. All of the girls are looking at you with the most withering gazes you\u2019ve ever seen. The brunette\u2019s trying to look withering, but it honestly looks a bit cute if anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy gives a snort. \u201cOnly me and the girls in here, dude. People told us to get a room, but I guess the econ classroom wasn\u2019t good enough.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flips his hand towards the door, and all of the girls start moving. They crowd around him again: one girl to each arm, the brunette trying to grab hold of either arm, but being lightly pushed away by the taller ones. The guy looks at you before he leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re new around here, right?\u201d He flashes a toothy grin. \u201cSee you around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look in the room one last time \u2014 nope, no little nerd in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a seat in the hallway, you rub your temples. Before you do anything, you need a fucking break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do next?</span></div></div>",

Little did you know that by the end of it all, you'd be missing the old, tired routine...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"HEY. YEAH, YOU! HELP!

Just a cornucopia of disappointment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaz Harwick, 24 years old, only two years out of college and already in a dead-end job. Your boss was an asshole, your girlfriend broke up with you \u2014 and the shacked up with one of your close friends \u2014 and you had to walk two miles from work every day after your car died last month.

Odds are that your boss or Trevor would make the trip unbearable \u2014 Sam'd be talking about how he'd been to a <i><b>much better</b></i> one a long time ago, and Trevor would probably try to hit on any lady employees until they caved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of hypothetical annoyances, your day seemed like it was going great so far. You had a full tank of gas, and a potentially relaxing day ahead of you \u2014 provided that the place wasn't stuffed with other flyer-bearers. You tap your fingers on the wheel as you drive, partially from the tinny sounds of your radio, and partially nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your relief, however, there are no other cars parked in the lot as you arrive. You find it a bit odd \u2014 besides the kitschy 'Grand Opening!' banner hanging from the establishment, the entire building looks quite impressive. All smooth white walls, and no corners, giving the impression of an upside-down bowl. The only entrance is an unbefitting set of wooden doors, with the stark black word 'SPA' over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lack of ornaments combined with the uncommon architecture unsettles you a bit \u2014 especially considering the ostentatious flyer, but the promise of a free treatment lures you through the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight that greets you is a refreshingly typical waiting room \u2014 a blonde receptionist sitting at a desk, surrounded by comfy chairs to await your appointment in. She perks up upon seeing you enter and quickly turns away from her deskwork to greet you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to Madame Magnifique\u2019s Spa Emporium!\u201d She beams. \u201cMy name is Alizon, with a Z. How can I help you, sir?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before you have a second to answer her, a burst of inspiration hits her and she picks up a form lying on her desk. \u201cAh, reserving an appointment for your spouse? I can arrange that for you in a flash,<br>\r\nI just your wife to sign the Alteration waiv\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cut her off with an embarrassed wave of your hands, and stutter out an 'N-no, miss, I'm here to redeem this,\" You produce the rumpled flyer from your pocket. \"For myself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlizon is stock still for a second, before resuming her bubbly countenance. \"Let me check that for a second sir, I need to see what offer this flyer qualifies for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes the piece of paper and quickly spins around in her chair. You can hear her mumble some things under her breath, but only manage to catch \"<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">some kind of failure in the female-only enchantment...</font>\" and \"<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">oh my god he even got the lonely girl offer</font>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brush it off as some kind of Wiccan nonsense. Someone with a name like Alizon would probably pick up some weird stuff somewhere down the line. She turns back to you with the same professional cheerfulness as before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sir, I can assure you that our treatments will be just as transformative on men as they are on women!\" She stands up from her desk with a jaunty hop and walks over to a nearby corkboard. After you tentatively follow her, she leaps into a practiced spiel.<br>\r\n\u201cHere at Madame Magnifique\u2019s, we aim to make you the person we want to be! We have four main methods of achieving this: Firstly, we have our BodyPods, a revolutionary combination of science and spiritual techniques! After a short predetermined survey, the Pod will give you what it deems to be the best makeover for you!\u201d She gestures to a picture on the board, that looks like a combination between a coffin and an iPhone. \u2018<i>It\u2019s a good thing I\u2019m not claustrophobic.</i>\u2019 you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving you a second to soak it in, she resumes her speech. \u201cOur other two options are more personal than the Pods. We have our Soul Massages, where we use special herbal and floral oils to coax a new you out. And of course, our other option is a regular makeover \u2014 but with a Magnifique flair!~\" After an incredibly brief pause, she stares at you with her typical genial smile, but with some sort of pleading in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what service can we offer you today, sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving it a minute of thought, you reply with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You're a perfectly normal, functioning human being outside of the fact that you hate all forms of music (which eventually bled over into a hate for music videos).  It had even affected your ability to get a job, as few employers were actually willing to accommodate to your rather specific needs, but you'd managed to find one. It was a cubicle drone job but so long as you could tolerate rushing through the lobby and limit your bathroom breaks as much as possible you were actually pretty happy. You'd even finally made a friend, Maxine, who you'd hit it off with and had yet to bombard you with questions about music, unlike everyone else in the office had apparently decided to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it had been especially hard today. Some young pop star girl had released a new hot single and it was ALL anyone could talk about, playing it on their phones or computers to their friends, the company radio playing it on what seemed like repeat every time you had to go into the staff break room or bathroom. It was so much that you felt your patience begin to frazzle as a stress migraine began to form. After suffering through your supervisor playing the song in his office, you managed to take a couple hours of sick time and leave work early. You just needed to get home to the small house you were renting and enjoy the rest of the night in silence. You marched down the sidewalk towards the entrance to the parking garage the company owned, but you make it about all of three steps away from the lobby door when you see the next problem in your very bad day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, sitting in the shade of the office building, was a young man with shaggy hair, a dirty red shirt and khaki shorts standing at what looked to be an old turntable with a tiny children's keyboard and a pair of small speakers attached to it. The squelching sounds clawed at your ear drums as the small speakers were easily pushed into distortion by the street musician's frantic pounding of the keyboard as he clearly trawled for charity. But despite his clear technical limitations and your distaste for music, you could tell that the man was good. There was a small crowd blocking the sidewalk and the tip jar was already full of dollars and coins. You saw the looks of amazement on the crowd of people, cellphones out and a look of pure enjoyment on their faces, it was clear they were enjoying the man's performance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you were not. All you wanted to do was get to the garage and the crowd was currently blocking you, forcing you to suffer the assault on your ears as you tried to push your way through. That's when you realized the man was playing a very improvisational cover of the pop song that forced you to leave work in the first place. You spin around and charge the street musician, knocking over his set-up in one fluid motion of your arms. The old equipment was clearly in worse shape than it had all appeared, the turn-table shattering as it hit the concrete, the keyboard flying into the street and disappearing under the wheels of a large truck and the speakers falling to pieces. The street musician simply backed up against the wall of your former office building though he looked remarkably unperturbed by the sequence of events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" You scream in rage, \"I'M TIRED OF HAVING TO DEAL WITH THIS! MUSIC IS TERRIBLE, DON'T YOU IDIOTS SEE THAT!? JUST GET OUT OF MY WAY SO I CAN GO HOME!\" You were met with the outraged boos and profanities from the crowd, and you try to shove your way through the collected bodies once more before you feel a hand on your shoulder. You spin around, fists raised, expecting a fight from a particularly outraged member of the crowd, but you blinked in surprise when you see that it's the street musician, his eyes full of...sorrow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about that\" He said, his voice low and calm, before he pulls you into a tight embrace. Your nose wrinkles at the smell of several days unwashed clothing and hair, and you push him away. Anger and the massive invisible chip on your shoulder prevents you from just running away to your car, forcing your body through the crowd. Instead you shove him away. Instead you feel the old hate burning up inside you, but as you open your mouth to spit out an insult, the anger flips over on itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no you don't get to be sorry! You don't know what it's like! I can't do anything without having a fucking song blasted into my ear. I can't even go to my goddamn car! I hate music and yet day after fucking day I have to be BOMBARDED BY IT!\" You say, throwing a wild hand around and pointing at the entrance to the parking garage whose entrance sits waiting behind the collected crowd. Part of you looks for sympathy, someone who just understands what you're going through, but they're all more interested in capturing a grown man having a tantrum on their phones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to hear that\" The musician says again, and it's almost as if you can feel that he means it. There's something very off about this entire situation. It was way too quiet for the heart of the city, even the traffic sounded more muted than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to give you something. A gift. THE gift. I hope that it can change your life for the better. Like it did mine\" The man says again as he reaches down and grabs something out of his grubby jacket that had been laying on the sidewalk next to the rest of his few possessions. You take a step back as does the rest of the small crowd as you fear he's going for a gun, but your fears are assuaged somewhat as he pulls out an old iPod and hands it to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't want to take it. It's white surface is covered in scuffs and dirt marks, but the strange musician shoves it into your hands anyway. As soon as the plastic touches your hands a strange haze enters your mind that keeps you from just throwing the music player into the nearby wall. Instead you just stand there and stare down into your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on, my friend. It'll help you with your problem, I promise. You'll see music differently after the battery runs out\" He says and releases his grip, turning back to the mess you had made of his display. The crowd around the two of you waits for a moment to see if the confrontation will continue, but soon dissipates as the street musician goes about his business and you just stare at the grungy old device in your hands. Eventually you turn and wander to your car to begin your commute home, iPod still in your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the overpowering urge listen to power it up and start listening to it, crusty earpods and all as you start your car, but some part of you manages to tell you to wait until you get home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, you really REALLY feel the need to listen to it now...</span></div></div>",

Because of course she was, she's a teenage girl in 2019. If a her face wasn't glued to a screen, <i>then</i> there would be something wrong with her, so he mostly let the indignity go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she wasn't wearing headphones, Alex could hear that the clerk was listening to some faggoty New York comedian on JewTube tell jokes about cannibalistic apartment neighbors and the horrors of avocado toast. Yeesh. He'd never step foot in that city if they paid him to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the male clerk who was standing next to her seemed more concerned by his right hand, as the boy had been staring at it ever since Alex had entered this little podunk convenience store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy eye's belied intense fascination with the ring encased on his fourth digit. In Alex's own parlance, he was in freaking <i>awe</i> of the thing, as if it were a caterpillar that had decided to crawl up on his finger and take a nap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was fancy looking to be sure, even ostentatious. A silver band(To Alex's eagle eye, <i>pure</i> silver) carved with weird looking occult symbols capped by a giant black onyx gemstone? Hoo boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did someone this far out of the way come into possession of a piece of jewelry like that? Alex could only speculate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe the kid had stolen it. Teenagers still like to steal things, right? As part of their little \"rebellious phase\"? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe the kid was just high? He seemed the type to get high. His sandy brown hair did look a bit shaggy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKids still got high, right? It had been so long since Alex had been a teenager himself that he honestly didn't know anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention that whatever brain cells he had were slowly getting fried from working out in the sweltering heat every day out on his ranch. He swore that the weather in Texas was getting worse and worse every year.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr better yet, maybe the kid was nervous because he was having some late night jitters. It was almost 11:00 P.M, and Alex knew enough to know that convenience store robberies tended to peak around this hour. Yeah, that was probably it. Poor kid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, at least he's got a pretty dark haired girl to keep him company. If she'd get off her damn phone that is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was getting sick of waiting, so Alex coughed \"Ahem\" in his deepest Texan accent. Both heads immediately shot up like stars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough a rush of apologies, the Afro-Latina girl turned off her phone and hip pocketed the device inside the pair of capri pants she was wearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sir!\" the female clerk croaked out. \"I didn't realize you were standing there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex gave a polite laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK, Miss. I know that your generation is obsessed with that stuff\" he said as he laid his six pack of Yellow Rose on top of the counter, impulsively grabbing a pack of cherry Twizzlers near the register to add to his purchase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled slightly, because she seemed genuinely surprised to see him there, judging by the spooked look in her eyes. Offhand, he wondered if anyone shoplifters had come in here earlier and took advantage of the two clerk's lack of attentiveness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so much\" replied the attractive girl as she spoke through a yawn. \"I'm just bored. It's the night shift, and you're the only customer we've had for hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not surprised. The only reason that I stopped here in Sawyer was to visit my elderly mother. I live out in Wimberley. You ever been to Wimberley?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure have. Nice town. Really pretty this time of year\" replied the clerk, already an expert at the art of small talk as she got through ringing this rando up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure is. Nice than here, to be perfectly honest. Right about now is probably the busiest this place has been all night, I reckon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You reckon correct, sir, and no offense taken. I don't like it much myself. That'll be $8.25, hun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man took out his buckskin wallet and pulled out a crisp twenty dollar bill from it, handing it casually to the clerk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced at the name tag affixed to her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby. That's my mother's name! Ruby Carlson. Do you know her? About yay high, white hair, lives off of LBJ Boulevard?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I can't say that I do. Here's your change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" Alex muttered in his thick drawl, slowly arranging the slower bills back into his wallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can keep the quarters and dimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Appreciate it\" Ruby Keeley muttered, dropping them in the charity jar, secretly enjoying the cacophonous noise they made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of plain curiosity, Alex swiveled his head towards the second clerk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son, you look a little young to be up this late at night. Aren't your parents worried about you having enough sleep for school tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brown haired boy, whose name tag said Justin, looked up timidly at the older man, distressed and glassy eyed, seemingly lost in his own world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm emancipated, sir. I don't have any parents to worry about me. I take care of myself. As for sleep, we're closing in a few minutes anyway. I can manage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can hold down a job and go to school on only a few hours of sleep?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only been doing it for a year and a half.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe late middle aged cowboy nodded in approval.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin Carmichael nodded back. He let the silence linger uncomfortably, and his eyes once again reverted back to the mysterious ring propped up comfortably on his finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get that in a Cracker Jack box?\" chuckled Alex as he pointed towards it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. I found it laying out in the middle of the parking lot earlier today. Have no idea where it came from or who it belongs to, so I decided to keep it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finders keepers. Can't argue with those rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother long, lingering, uncomfortable silence. Once again, Alex was the one to break the ice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, long days and pleasant nights to the both of you youngsters\" he said jovially as he affixed his cowboy hat to his head and grabbed his purchases with one of his thick, meaty hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G'night!\" replied Justin and Ruby in unison, with disingenuous sugar in their voices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex chuckled once again<br>\r\n He turned around and walked out the front door of the balmy Southern night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Ruby and Justin saw Alex Carlson's headlights pull out of the dark, tiny parking lot, which only had five spaces which Rigby's shared with the local tackle shop next door, the two eighteen year olds turned to look at one another with baited breath. The clock had just struck 11:00 P.M thirty seconds ago, meaning the indoor closed circuit cameras would be shutting off soon. Slowly, a grin formed across Ruby's splendid face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought he'd never leave. So tell me again what that ring does\" she asked excitedly, pointing towards the fourth digit on Justin's right hand. Her body language suddenly became much more relaxed. She practically had to stop herself from dancing right in the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can shapeshift\" answered Justin proudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how did you find this out?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is like the fifth time I've told you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it gets funnier every time! Tell me again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, after I found this ring\" he explained, holding up his hand, \"I had to go take a piss. When I was doing my business was...I was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking of Zoey Deutch. I was...I started jerking off to her, just a little bit. Not enough to cum, but enough to get me hard. When I was washing my hands, I looked in the mirror, and I saw her reflection staring back at me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby gave the biggest, heartiest laugh Justin had ever heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit! You literally <i>became</i> her, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. I looked down, and I was wearing her clothes, I had her pair of tits, her blonde hair, that little homemade bracelet she always has on. I WAS her. Nearly gave me a heart attack. Then I wished to everyone I don't believe in that I was me again. The ring started tingling, and my body began shimmering. Then I was me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Justin. Do you know what this means!? We can use this ring for so much. We can rob banks and impersonate people and, and...we could become animals! I mean, I'm not a furry or anything, but haven't you ever wanted to see what it's like? Because I have!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin grinned as he heard the telltale clicking sound letting him know the cameras were now off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I've got a better idea.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Justin shifts into Ruby's ideal partner. They head to his house, and after a wild night of passion, he awakens to find that he can't turn back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Justin shows off by shifting into multiple people and characters while they finish closing up the gas station. The two of them clock out, and Justin suddenly finds himself unable to shift back to his original form!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Something Else Happens</span></div></div>",

Tom had really wanted to check out John Wick Chapter 3 instead, and Bill had wanted to go see Avengers: Endgame even though he had already seen it four times, but Judy had insisted on Brightburn, and since whatever Judy wanted Peter went along with like Toto follows Dorothy, the two childhood friends were outvoted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha, very funny\" said Bill sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, seriously\" said Peter, still smirking. \"You two have great chemistry together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop\" Bill insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When's the wedding?\" snarked Judy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, it's really no big deal even if you two are really gay for one another. My family has an old saying...\" said Peter before he was rudely cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bill here is just my good buddy\" said Tom with an easy smile, slapping Bill on the shoulder platonically. \"No, I think I'm taking a break from the dating scene for a while. I've already told you all what happened with my last girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who, the bitch?\" asked Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She preferred being called Gloria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I remember what you told me\" said Peter. \"She dumped you in front of the whole school two weeks before graduation. Geez, what the hell was her problem? Did she have a condition where she was never <b>not</b> on her period?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder that sometimes myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a sweetheart, Tom! What could you have possibly done to have deserved being tortured for two years like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want my best guess? Shermer's a small town, and small towns make people crazy. You know, cabin fever. Like what happened to the Donner Party. People in small towns got nothing to do but play football and get drunk, so when that gets boring, they turn on each other. Almost all of the cheerleaders at our high school were bitches. Gloria was just the head bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This Gloria was like the Medusa. The second she opens her eyes, everyone around her turns to stone\" said Peter jokingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>wish</i> that that I had been turned to stone during some of her rages\" replied the blonde haired Tom wistfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Hey!\" cut in Judy, the normally chill goth girl becoming seriously indignant. \"My minor is in mythology, and Medusa was <i>not</i> a bitch. She was the farthest thing *from* a bitch. I take offense to that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter sighed and touched his temple casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, honey. You know how I am. I didn't get into Stanford for my brains.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just realize that poor Medusa was raped by Poseidon while she was praying in the temple of Athena, and the very goddess she was praying to turned her into a monster for having the *gasp* audacity to be beautiful. The very definition of victim blaming. Then, later on she gets decapitated for her troubles, for just <i>existing</i>, and the man who did it is worshipped through the ages as a hero. Sorry, but my feminine pride gets in such a rage by that goddamn legend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter turned to Bill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is all that true, Big Brain? Is Medusa really misunderstood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill nodded his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, at least according to one version of the myth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter's eyes widened theatrically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Motherfucker. I never knew that! I thought Medusa was an evil old hag who got what was coming to her and that Perseus was a good guy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you're Greek! You should know this shit!\" chuckled Bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I am from Modesto. My parents are Greek. They came from Istanbul to here thirty years ago. Almost the only Greeks there, so they know very little about those legends. Hence, neither do I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, it's a common myth. You should have known at the least through pop culture osmosis. Didn't you ever play Age of Gods?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not everyone is a nerd like you, Bill. Some people like to read and play games all day, and some people...\"..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter casually lifted the 5'8 Judy into his arms and kissed her passionately. He then let her down, Judy giggling all the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...some people like to go out and pick up girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the first day that Bill Strasserman had moved into his dorm at Stanford, having commuted halfway across the country from Shermer, Illinois along with Tom, he had been seriously worried that the giant down the hallway was going to be another Big Jon Ingerman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at home, the similarly sized Big Jon had made Bill's life a living hell for four years, the sadistic bully taking every opportunity to punish Bill for...for nothing really, just because Jon didn't like the look of his face. And Bill couldn't do a damn thing about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich, come to think about it, is probably a good reason why he was out here in California right now, to give himself a wide berth between himself and the probable future serial killer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, despite Peter Tzimeros being close to 7'0 feet tall and muscled like Hercules, he was nothing like Ingerman or Bill's other bully, Rob Bolstrum. Peter was friendly and boisterous, humble about the fact that he was only here on a sports scholarship, and had taken an immediate liking to Bill, finding the nerdy freshman amusing and offering to take him to his first kegger party the same night they had met(Despite Bill being underage). Since Tom was on the same college basketball team as Peter, the three had almost immediately become fabulous friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill liked Peter's girlfriend too. Unlike the high school nightmare that was Gloria Vanapoulous, Judy Ross was perhaps the coolest chick that Bill had ever met, almost a mirror image of Gloria in every way. He wasn't sure if he was attracted to goths, but he couldn't deny that the dramatic looking black girl was very beautiful and had a sparkling personality. Maybe she could introduce him to one of her friends...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa whoa, what's this place?\" yelled out Judy, causing the quartet to immediately stop in their tracks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn between a Hot Topic and an Auntie Anne's was a strange store none of the four teens had ever seen in this mall before, as if it had just appeared the moment they had approached. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Third Wish?\" asked Tom. \"Never heard of it\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a magic shop or something\" said Bill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at those boots!\" squealed Judy, pointing towards a pair of knee high stacked Sabrina's displayed in the window. She walked up to look at them, her skirt swishing along with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys, want to come in and take a look around?\" she asked with excited eyes, turning to look at her trio of guy friends, none of whom seemed overly enthused.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy began to develop sad puppy dog eyes at Peter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puh-leez?! We got over a half over until the movie start!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The large man chuckled and looked at Bill and Tom with a sheepish grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we're going in here for a while, guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Judy paid for the boots, holding onto Peter's arm the entire time as she gabbed away with the fellow goth girl at the register, Bill and Tom looked around this strange store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of theme are they trying to set up here?\" asked Bill, noticing that there wasn't a consistent tone to the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, pick something and go with it\" agreed Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne section seemed set up just for fanboy nerds just like Bill. A whole wall of Funko Pops sat next to a rack containing a vast collection of classic console games and various classic \"geek\" movies. Next to that was a table filled with more unique items, mostly artwork, all of which were obviously handmade, but still well done(And very expensive). Next to that, and even more expensive, was a table filled with various movie and TV props, some claiming to be the original such and such from the The Empire Strikes Back or scripts from classic Doctor Who and Star Trek episodes. Bill was seriously tempted at purchasing one of the model ships of the Nostromo used in the original <i>Alien</i> but passed how much money it would set him back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front of the store was filled with Gothic apparel and things that Judy was into, and wadp obviously targeted at a female demographic, so Bill nor Tom had taken a close look at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe back of the store, meanwhile, seemed more like a flea market. All different kinds of antique items littered this section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mom would go crazy in this place\" muttered Bill as he examined some very fine looking china filling a handsome looking cabinet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine too\" said Tom as he played around with a very old cuckoo clock. He picked up a bag of golf clubs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a shelf filled with jewelry, watches, bracelets and so on, Bill briefly picked up a fine looking teardrop shaped emerald with a small golden core. It seemed to refract the light of the overhead fixtures against Bill's chest, which seemed incredibly odd yet somehow familiar to the young man. Creeped out, he put it back down where he found it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Bill!\" he heard Tom yell from a few rows down. Bill followed the source Tom's voice until he found his best friend holding up a well used old board game in front of his chest. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The vessels of the Great Powers, scoundrels and adventurer alike plow the waters of Antillia, the vast archipelago of islands large and small, charted and uncharted and all of them ever mysterious with the ruins of lost civilizations and artifacts of unknown power. You find yourself on one of these ships on an expedition to lay claim to a vast and ancient treasure. But the powers of the sea are known to change those that brave it's waters...Will you still be the same, once you finally return to dry land?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Recipe Book: Your great, great grandmother has passed away at the age of 113 years old. She was a flighty old bird, and it seemed like she'd never succumb to death, only showing her age in the last few years of her life when she lost her ability to cook for herself. After the funeral and during the reading of the will, her belongings of her estate are parceled off to various members of your family, and you find yourself receiving an odd item: Her recipe book. Months later, looking to impress your girlfriend, you decide to try one of her recipes...Only to find out what the so called 'special ingredient' actually does!</span></div></div>",

Love you babe, bye.\"  You hung up the phone after talking to your girlfriend Trish Copeland and cursed yourself, \"Damn, why did I promise I'd cook her a nice dinner?  I've never cooked anything in my life.\"  Well, you knew exactly why you were doing this, you had just finished lying to your girlfriend telling her you totally remembered your 1 year anniversary since you started dating, but instead of getting a reservation at a fancy restaurant which you'd never get at the last second, you told her you'd cook her a nice dinner on your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aiden Dallas what have you gotten yourself into.\"   You said to yourself aimlessly walking into the kitchen.  The only thing you had in your refrigerator that wasn't something microwavable junk was a chicken you'd gotten on a whim because you heard you could cook it with a beer can in it, but got bored before you could start that.  \"I bet beer can chicken isn't going to impress Trish for the anniversary dinner...so what the heck am I supposed to do with this thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you remembered, the cook book.  Your great great grandmother Martha had died about a month ago at the ripe old age of 113 and she had been a bit...eccentric in how she did her will.  Her living kids and grandkids got the house and money and such, but you hadn't been forgotten.  You had gotten something the guy reading the will called one of her 'prized possessions'.  A cook book.  Although you weren't sure how 'prized' this thing was.  A bunch of people got random 'prized possessions'.  One distant relative apparently even got a toolbox of all things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing that out of your mind you opened up the old musty book.  Even thought the book looked to be a century old, it seemed Martha had kept it in really good shape.  The pages were browned but felt and turned as good as new.  You skimmed the pages and saw that each thing had a weird name like 'Switching Spaghetti' and 'Buxom Bon Bons' but you didn't find what you needed until you found something called 'Childhood Chicken'.  The ingredient list seemed super simple, just chicken, lemon, salt, and pepper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing a sigh of relief you said, \"Thank goodness, I can actually cook this.  And it's so simple, what could possibly go wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><i>One Hour Later</i></font></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on!  How is there so much smoke!\"  You screamed opening the over which had smoke and a bit of fire pouring out of it.  You pulled the burned chicken out of the oven and put it under the vent to let out all the smoke.  Taking a moment you went to the bathroom to make sure you didn't burn your eyebrows or something.  Thankfully your face was still in tact including your pride and joy, your red handlebar mustache which you made sure to give a twirl of pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made your way back to the kitchen and felt your phone buzz.  It was a message from Trish, <i>Be there in 15.  See you soon.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap, I don't even have time to grab some burgers and pass it off as something I cooked.\"  You groaned, well, maybe you could save the chicken.  Back in the kitchen the chicken still looked black as ever, desperately you went to the Cookbook.  At the bottom you saw some notes written by your great-great-grandma.  <i>After you inevitably burn the chicken, make sure to say the magic words and add some love as you put some salt over it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed as you read this, you suddenly had a flashback to when you were a kid and would visit your Grams she'd always sing and stuff as she cooked, she'd even written a little rhyme for the Childhood Chicken.  \"Why the hell not.\"  You said as you pulled out the salt and read from the Cookbook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Chicken chicken Day or Night,<br>\r\nGive youth to those who eat the white.<br>\r\nIf age and wisdom is your lark,<br>\r\nGo ahead and try the dark.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave the weird poem thing a look, \"Well, Grams wasn't exactly a poet, but whatever.\"  You looked down at your pathetic excuse of a chawed chicken but almost fainted from shock.  Instead of the mass of blacken meat now laid a perfectly golden brown chicken that looked like it could be from a tv show.  You rubbed your eyes to make sure you weren't dreaming, but sure enough, the chicken was still there and perfect looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll never say anything bad about salt again.\"  You said to yourself as you cut off some white meat and took a bite.  It was perfect and juicy and you'd never had anything like it.  Happy with what you'd done, you set the chicken on the dinner table with some wine.  Just in time too because the doorbell rang at that moment.  You ran to the door to let in your beautiful brunette girlfriend Trish in.  \"Hey babe.\"  You said giving her a kiss which felt...a little different somehow on your upper lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh baby, you actually did it, you shaved that silly mustache for me, this is the best anniversary gift I could have asked for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  I didn't sha....wait.  You don't like my mustache!?\"  You said trying to process what Trish just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aiden, I love you, but that thing made you look like a 1920's bad guy.  Not your best look.  I mean without that mustache you look like 5 years younger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I have my...\"  You touched your upper lip to twirl your mustache, but sure enough, there was nothing there.  \"Be right back.\"  You said as you rushed to the bathroom.  It couldn't be gone!  It had just been there a minute ago!  But as you looked in the mirror, sure enough your mustache was no longer there.  In fact...it was weird.  You did look a few years younger.  You looked like you'd definitely get carded at a bar, and your id might not work because you look younger than your id does.  \"But why...?\"  You said when you were hit by inspiration.  \"This chicken, that poem.\"  As crazy as it was, it was the only thing that explained your mustache.  The Cookbook had magic to it and you had just made some sort of...age changing chicken or something.  Quickly you leave the bathroom to head to the dining room and the magic chicken you'd made.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To your surprise and slight horror you saw that your girlfriend had already made her plate, full of white meat chicken breast, and was ready to dig in.  \"Sorry Aiden, but I just had to start eat, it just looked and smelled so good!  And work was a pain in the ass, go ahead and sit down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm,\"  You thought about warning Trish...but curiosity was getting the better of you.  \"You go ahead and keep eating.  I need to clean up the kitchen a little bit and I'll be right out here.\"  And so off to the kitchen you went, you'd clean up your mess there for a few seconds before peeking your head out to check in on Trish.  Sure enough, the magic of the chicken didn't just work on your now gone glorious mustache, it was affecting Trish as well and not just with hair.  She had entered the house in her work uniform, a dark blue skirt suit and her brunette hair which she normally kept really short.  But after clearing about a forth of her plate she'd already changed thanks to the magic.  Her hair was much longer, and the magic had been good enough to give her a ponytail.  And her suit had turned into a blue and white cheerleader uniform you hadn't seen Trish wear since hight school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the kitchen you went to scrub some dirty dishes, but this only last a minute, you had to see what the Childhood Chicken was doing.  You peeked back in and Trish looked years younger, maybe 14 years old.  Her hair had shortened up again and she was now wearing a white tennis dress the you recognized from when she was in middle school. And what's more Trish was so taken in by the chicken that she didn't seem to even notice the changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne more time you went back to the kitchen, you didn't even clean this time.  You just paced back and forth for a few seconds before you couldn't take it anymore, you had to see what was going on again.  This time when you went out to check on Trish, something was different about her.</span></div></div>",

The now 13-14 year old was standing and looking down at her body.  \"What happened to me?  I look like I just started puberty.  This is a dream.  Yeah it has to be.  That explains why Aiden was such a good cook and why he got rid of that mustache of his.\"  Trish seemed to be rambling to try and calm herself down.  Feeling playful you walked up to her and lightly pinched her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\"  Trish said in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, this isn't a dream believe it or not.\"  You said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...but what happened to me Aiden?\"  Trish asked about to freak out.  So you took the time to explain to her about the chicken and your Gram's cookbook which seemed to actually be magic.  \"And so if we eat the dark meat, we'll age back up...I think...hope.\"  You said not super confident in this plan.  But you were going to be a gentleman and test this out yourself, so you grabbed a big bite of. dark meat and ate it.  A few seconds later you heard Trish gasp and point at your face.  Afraid that you'd eaten too much and turned into an old man, you grabbed at your face, and to your relief you felt your glorious red handlebar mustache was back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness.\"  You breathed a sigh of relief.  You seemed to be back to your original age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least it worked,\"  Trish said unable to hide the disappointment at your mustache was back.  She looked at the dark meat on the chicken and reached for some.</span></div></div>",

It took a few bites, but sure enough Trish went from being an early teen back to her adult body once again including her clothes.  \"I can't believe that actually happened, Aiden, you actually made a freaking magic age changing chicken in your oven!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All thanks to grandma,\"  You said holding up the old Cookbook.  \"But after watching you grow and bloom into a woman, I gotta say I'm already thinking of desert...if you know what I mean.\"  You said trying to be subtly not subtle at all with your desires and you hoped Trish felt the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Desert?  Oh that's a great idea!\"  Trish said giving you a quick kiss that stopped before you could even enjoy it.  \"Let's see what that Cookbook as desert wise,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, really?  You want to me to cook something magical again after you just lost and gained 10 years in a matter of minutes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I turned back, and this is the craziest thing that's ever happened to me, so why wouldn't I want to make more magic food?\"  Trish asked, and you had to admit she had a point.  Oh well, maybe you could find something in the book that might help put her in the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put the Cookbook on the kitchen table and Trish went to your cabinet to grab what few ingredients you had.  She got some butter, flower, sugar, and chocolate along with a few other everyday kitchen food stuffs you never used for yourself.  Scanning the Cookbook for deserts you came across a few interesting choices.  'Buxom Bon Bons' seemed like a sexy thing to eat, it sounded like a fancy chocolate dish that Trish and hopefully you would love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more page flips later you saw 'Fantasy Fondue'.  \"Ooo, that sounds kind of sexy and exotic,\"  You said to yourself but deciding you keep checking your options you came across another interesting sounding choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty Pudding also caught your eye, your girlfriend was already beautiful, but if she can magically look any better then why the hell not.  Finally you went to the kitchen and began cooking your next magical dish.</span></div></div>",

Page after page of large boobs.  \"Very glad safe search was off.  Oh yeah, I'm definitely making Trish this.\"  Your girlfriend didn't have a small chest by any means, but if a piece of chocolate could bump her up a cup size or two, well, you weren't going to complain.  You looked at your Gram's recipe and began to get to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany meanwhile had left the house to go get some groceries as you made those Buxom Bon Bons.  Working with chocolate in the kitchen was messy to say the least.  Somehow you managed to get it on the counter, floor, your clothes, and your hair, but after a while you managed to have a plate full of chocolate balls.  Although they looked like a mess that were falling apart just sitting on the plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, forgot Gran's magic words.\"  You opened up the book again, the instructions insisted you rub some chocolate on your chest before you say the magic words.  Fortunanlty you already accidentally done that to yourself cutting out a step leaving you free to read the spell over the bon bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Orbs of chocolate, orbs of lust<br>\r\neat you up, increase the bust.</i>\". You had a hard time seeing how some silly rhyme was supposed to finish off the magic, but sure enough you looked down and the Buxom Bon Bons had solidified into a bunch of perfect delectable looking orbs.  They looked so delicious you were about to have a bite, but thankfully you remembered their purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith perfect timing as soon as you had finished making your magical dish, Trish came in the door with some groceries.  \"All right Aiden, I've got enough food to last for a month, but I'm sure we'll cook it all in less than a week thanks to that magic cookbook of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great Trish, you did a great job shopping, how about you reward yourself with a nice, fresh, bon bon.\"  You said offering your girlfriend the plate of bust enhancing treats.  Trish eyed the candies suspiciously as she probably should and asked, \"What's the catch?  Am I going to grow cat ears or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I promise, I'm pretty sure you'll like them.\"  You said slyly not wanting to spoil the surprise, after all, that was part of the excitement.  And Trish seemed to agree as she couldn't stop herself.  She grabbed one of the Buxom Bon Bons and ate it.  A matter of seconds after she swallowed it, you saw the bon bon lived up to their name.  Trish's breasts grew one size for one bon bon, and she definitely noticed.  \"Oh wow!\"  Trish said seeming pretty excited to now be a C cup, but you probably had a big dumb grin on as she looked at you and said, \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just shrugged as though you had no other choice in the matter.  Trish turned away from you and looked down her shirt, \"Yeah, this one changed my clothes too.  It gave me a C cup bra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And D cup breasts are just another Buxom Bon Bon away.\"  You said waving the trey under her nose.  She seemed to be considering it, but gave you a smile.  \"Ok Aiden, I have a proposition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm listening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have another of these Bon Bons on one condition.\"  She said with a grin.</span></div></div>",

Crazy awesome!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...for each one I eat.  YOU have to eat 2.\"  This request seemed odd.  Was she afraid you wouldn't do it?  Because you totally would.  You weren't a chicken!  Plus it might be cool to mess with a pair of your own boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure about that?  You'll still love me even if I get bigger boobs than you?\"  You asked making sure Trish knew what she was asking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only one way to find out, that's part of the risk Aiden baby.\"  Trish held a Buxom Bon Bon up to her lips and tantalized you by just rubbing it around her lips.  It was driving you wild to see your girlfriend with the food foreplay.  Something you had a feeling she was going to be getting very good at if you keep that magic cookbook around.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, you're on.\"  You said as you picked up two Bon Bons.  Smiling she held out her's for a toast.  You tapped the chocolate treats together and downed them.  They were the most delicous desert you had ever tasted.  The flavors of the chocolate were the perfect mix of sweet and salty.  The texture was like velvet that seemed to bounce in your mouth as you chewed it.  And it was a pleasure to chew, you kept the treat in your mouth for as long as you could to keep enjoying the feeling before it dissolved into mush that you swallowed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince you knew what to look for, the changes were obvious.  Your pecks, which weren't exactly pure muscle, jutted out turning from relatively flat, to mood shaped, to full on undeniable boobs.  The magic of the Buxom Bon Bons was even good enough to give you a black bra to go with your new breasts.  One peek at the bra confirmed what you thought, \"I'm a B cup now, if that magic kept your old bras, you think I can borrow them?\"  You asked in a joking not joking way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish seemed to be distracted looking in her own shirt, \"And I'm a D cup now.  This magic sure is something.\"  Trish looked at your breasts and smiled, she certainly didn't seem to hate that you had breasts now so that was good.  \"Eyes up here.\"  You joked and Trish leaned over the table to kiss you.  You were thinking it was about to get hot and heavy but she stoped pretty quickly and held up another Bon Bon to her lips.  \"You up for another pair?\"  She asked as she pushed two more Buxom Bon Bons to you. </span></div></div>",

The disease is so contagious and deadly that people now can't even leave their homes even for groceries! There are no more television shows, only constant information about relief efforts underway, such as government supplied food deliveries and mandated medical checks. The Internet is largely the same, being taken over for government use, and overall what little entertainment there is to be found is only what people have on hand.

Facing expulsion (and worse, losing your money due to your parents being collectively outraged), you and your friends agree.

Choose below, or make your own!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreative Writing: You were studying at the local library, taking notes for tomorrow's big test like any good student, when disaster struck. Your pen ran out of ink. Desperate to finish your notes you search the library and find a strange, antique looking pen sitting on a nearby table. You grab it and quickly discover that whatever you write with it becomes reality! Do you use this power responsibly or do you decide to do some creative 'editing' to the word around you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime Travel Insanity: You're working on a secret project you hope to present during your final university presentation. You're hoping that it'll impress and convince a wealthy benefactor to hire you, and pay off your crippling debt. On the day before the presentation you're doing some last minute modifications in your family's basement/your laboratory when an accident that you don't fully understand has turned your secret project into a actual time machine! With just a few inputs you, or anyone can travel to any moment in history! But getting back, on the other hand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ultimate Vacation: Everyone knows that Paradise Island is the place to go for a memorable vacation. It has crystal clear water, golden beaches, lush tropical jungles filled with life, and the best resorts and nightlife on the planet! It's a well known fact that trips to Paradise will change your life forever. The only downside? It's once in a lifetime trips are ludicrously expensive. You and your college friends have pooled enough cash (and called in a few favors) to get a full week in one of the resorts there, and it'll be a week that you'll never forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Killer App: Well, you've done it this time. You picked a fight with the weirdo neighbor across the hall, absolutely tired of his blaring anime and other obnoxious science fiction music and shows at 3AM. Things got heated when he pulled out his smartphone and started trying to take your picture while threatening to 'fix' you. You threw a punch, he threw a punch and in the ensuing struggle his phone took a picture of one of you by accident! Just when you thought your late night couldn't get any weirder, it does. It really, really does.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Flex Combobulator was pulsing again, and Rick was afraid it would start smoking again. If it did, his mother would kick him out of the house for sure. She\u2019d had a go at him while his father, Tim, opened as many windows as he could find. Rick was amazed at how much she\u2019d been able to complain about, and so loudly too. He was afraid the fumes would knock her out, with the amount of enraged huffs and sharp breaths she\u2019d took, but they never did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne Church was built sturdier than that, as was the rest of her family. It was just Rick\u2019s luck that he\u2019d picked up the strength of character and intelligence while his brother Charlie got physical strength, charisma, and enough good looks to make a movie star jealous. All the things his parents and everyone else on Earth respected. Rick rolled his eyes, and reached for his blowtorch. Hopefully the flames would discharge the combobulator and cool it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey dude, I think your robot\u2019s getting high.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick shot the voice, owned by Bruce Dilman, an angry glare. He hoped his pitch black welding goggles emphasized it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did I tell you about weed jokes at my house, man? My mom\u2019ll make sure you never step foot in here again if she hears you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce was Rick\u2019s roommate in freshman year. The two young men were almost twins, with the same pale skin, green eyes, and brown hair. The only thing separating the two was their hair. Rick\u2019s was blond, thin, and neatly cut; Bruce\u2019s was black, thick, and nearly touched his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying man, I don\u2019t think the first robo-historian needs to bring weed to Rome, or Egypt, or wherever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor the last time, the Historotron doesn\u2019t travel through time. It creates a simulation of time periods and explores them thoroughly in the time it takes to ask a question. It can\u2019t open a smoke shop in Mesopotamia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick fired up his blowtorch to cut off Bruce\u2019s response. He stuck the tool into the Historotron\u2019s chest, and the Flex Combobulator. The Historotron was built like the kind of Hollywood robot seen in cheesy B-movies. Every part of it was blocky, and moved on a single axis. It had two red Christmas lights for eyes, and a decades old walkie-talkie in place of a mouth. It was entirely obvious that Rick was working on a budget, but purpose mattered more than presentation. It was true for him, with his matted clothes and patchy peach fuzz, and it was true for the Historotron. He hoped it was, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey man,\u201d Bruce said, with the same inquisitive tone he used for every sentence. Rick ignored him, and continued to focus on the Combobulator. He couldn\u2019t tell from behind his goggles, but it seemed like it was getting brighter, as were the wires surrounding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude!\u201d That got Rick\u2019s attention. Bruce almost never raised his voice. He shut off the blowtorch, and spun around to face him.his eyebrows raised over his goggles when he saw Bruce\u2019s face frozen in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Bruce raised his hand, and pointed at the Historotron. Rick looked up, into a pair of bright red lights. He shut his eyes, half from the light, and half out of annoyance. \u201cDude, did you just interrupt me because the lights were on? Christ, dude, i know you\u2019re like a perpetual stoner, but this is a new low. Or would it be a new high?\u201d Bruce moved his hand down, and Rick followed it to a plug sitting next to an empty socket. The plug powering the Historotron. Then, there was a horrible cracking noise, and a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello. Where would you like to go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth men screamed, and ran out of the basement. They came to a crashing halt halfway up the stairs, when they ran into Rick\u2019s brother, Charlie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you two dickweeds stop making so much noise? Mom\u2019s getting annoyed and I don\u2019t want to deal with that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCharlie, you need to come downstairs,\u201d Rick said through pained breaths. Just running up the stairs was more exersice than he\u2019d gotten in the past year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome to your freaky lab? I thought I was banned when I squeezed your Franken-gerbil to death.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce pushed Rick to the side and came to the forefront. \u201cYou gotta beat up our robot, man! You\u2019re the only one who can stop it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick shot Bruce a look for using the word \u2018our\u2019, but held his tongue. Instead, he talked to a skeptical Charlie. \u201cHe\u2019s telling the truth. I think my robot is sentient, and you need to stop it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie looked between the two, confusion lining his every feature. Then he shrugged and barreled last them. Nick and Bruce followed behind him, though they were in no hurry to return to the basement. The trio entered the laboratory, and came face to face with the Historotron. Charlie\u2019s eyebrows shot up, and the younger men cowered behind him. Charlie barely managed to hide his own fear by raising his fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello,\u201d the Historotron greeted. \u201cWhere would you like to go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBro, once I beat this thing up, we\u2019re gonna have a real long talk, cool?\u201d Nick just nodded, and pushed his brother forwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCommand not recognized. Sending you to -time period not designated-. Prepare to experience history!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce barely had time to get out a \u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\u201d, before he, Nick, and Charlie were swallowed whole by a flash of white light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did the Historotron send the trio?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rick was expecting a thud, or a bang, or some indicator that he\u2019d landed when and wherever the Historotron had sent him, Bruce, and Charlie. He was not expecting an ear-splitting scream to cue the arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck!?\u201d a girl screamed, and Rick assumed it came from someone who\u2019d just seen three young men appear from nowhere. Then he heard the girl scream again, louder this time. \u201cI have tits! Why do I have tits!? Where the fuck is my dick!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick turned around, and saw a woman around his age furiously pawing at her red polka-dot dress. Next to her was Bruce, dressed in jeans, a stained shirt, and a leather jacket. He too was pawing, but at his hair. It was cut short and slicked back with enough grease to make a fry cook faint. Behind them both was a diner, with a few similarly dressed occupants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBruce?\u201d Rick asked, and he nodded before returning to his hair. Rick looked over to the woman, who was now groping herself, and quickly realized what was happening. He mentally prepared himself for the beating to come, and forced himself to say, \u201cCharlie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman, Charlie, came to a dead stop, and slowly turned her head to look at her brother. An excess of lipstick made her sneer blood-red, which did little to ease Rick\u2019s mind. His only defense was to put on a nervous smile and apologize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie lunged before Rick could get a word out. She slammed her fist into Rick\u2019s nose, and screamed almost as loud as he did. Apparently her female form didn\u2019t get into nearly as many fights as modern day Charlie. She shook her hand in the air, and fought back tears as Rick recovered from the punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d he shouted, waving to keep Charlie from getting too close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell happened!? Why\u2019d I turn into a girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why\u2019d I lose my hair?\u201d Bruce complained. \u201cHow come you get a suit and we get screwed over?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick glanced down, and saw that he was in fact wearing a nice charcoal suit. He quickly shook off the revelation, and returned to his companions. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d Bruce and Charlie looked unimpressed at best. \u201cI don\u2019t! The Historotron did this to us! It\u2019s not like I chose to go to... the 1950s?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick looked around to confirm what he\u2019d just said. The diner and greaser fashion added to his theory. The hot rod cars parked around them and passing by on freshly tarred streets did too. He stuffed his hands in his pockets and nodded. \u201cOkay, Yeah, we\u2019re in the 50s. Or a simulation of them, at least.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie charged towards her brother and pushed her breasts up. \u201cFeel these man! Do these feel like a simulation to you!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick pushed her away, trying his absolute best not to touch a breast in the process. \u201cStop that! It\u2019s a simulation, no matter what it feels like. The Historotron must have put us into a complex virtual reality program with its zaps. God, I wish there was a more scientific term for \u2018zaps\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe point, Rick, please!\u201d Bruce groaned. He ran a hand through his short hair, then scrunched up his face and rubbed grease on his jeans. \u201cWhen do we get back to the present?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick racked his brain for a moment, his expression becoming more and more annoyed by the second. Eventually he threw his hands up, and sighed. \u201cI genuinely don\u2019t know. My best guess is that we have to wait out the simulation. We either get to the end of the 50s, back to the moment we entered the simulation, or to the moment we die.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019ll take forever!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie tugged on his eyebrows, making his eyes seem even more manic than they were. \u201cI like this \u2018until we die\u2019 idea. Wasn\u2019t gun control was a lot more lax back then? Or right now, I guess. Either way, I say we go down to a gun shop and shoot ourselves. Bang! We\u2019re back in the present!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick shook his head so fast it could have unscrewed itself. \u201cDon\u2019t do that! That\u2019s the exact opposite of what we want to do! I don\u2019t know what will happen if we\u2019re killed in the simulation! Dying naturally might get us out, but blowing our heads off could screw with our real brains in a really, really bad way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie tried folding her arms, but found her breasts got in the way. She huffed and put her hands an her hips, in a way far cuter than she intended. \u201cFine. So if we don\u2019t go to the gun store, where do we go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick tapped his foot and thought for a moment. \u201cWe could go into the diner,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Historotron dropped us here, so it may want us to go inside. Maybe it\u2019s simulated a story for us to fully experience the 50s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce furrowed his brow. \u201cWhat does that even mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Historotron is meant to accurately simulate a time period to derive information about it. Think of Westworld, but it\u2019s greasers instead of cowboys. Not that I didn\u2019t program an 1870s simulation...\u201d Rick proudly thought of his programming skills for a moment before catching himself. \u201cAnyways,\u201d He hurriedly continued, \u201cmaybe it wants us to do certain things to learn more about the 50s. Maybe doing them could get us out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce wrestled with the idea for a few moments before giving up on it entirely. \u201cI don\u2019t like it. The Histo-thing gave us these new identities, I say we figure out who they are. Maybe playing the part will get us out. Like that movie Pleasantville! Like I have to fix cars, and you have to go to some school, and Charlie has to become a housewife!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie slapped Bruce\u2019s arm, and hated how much easier it felt compared to punching. \u201cI still say gun shop. It\u2019s quick, and it\u2019s easy, and even if I die for real, at least I won\u2019t have to be a chick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick shook his head. \u201cOkay, first off, Bruce, that\u2019s the exact opposite of what Pleasantville is about. Second, no. Just no. No gun shops, ever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie stuck out a fist. Rick reflexively jumped back and cowered. He peeked an eye open, and saw Charlie shaking her head and Bruce barely containing his laughter. \u201cIt\u2019s rock-paper-scissors, you numbskull. We do what whoever wins wants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat isn\u2019t the most scientifically sound method\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust throw your fist in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick raised his fist, putting it across from Bruce and Charlie\u2019s. They bounced them in the air and chanted, \u201cRock, paper, scissors, shoot!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Scissors always wins!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick and Bruce sagged in disappointment as Charlie let out a particularly vulgar victory cry, heed. On a nearby sidewalk, a simulated mother hurried her simulated son away, shooting quite the simulated reproachful glare over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDammit,\u201d muttered Bruce, sullenly shoving his hands into his jacket pockets. \u201cWhydja have to throw paper too, Rick?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Statistically</i>, it has the best winrate,\u201d huffed the geek. \u201cCharlie\u2019s just\u2026 an anomaly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn right I am!\u201d crowed Charlie. \u201cHottest Church, and the goddamn <i>best</i> at rock-paper-scissors.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the biggest bitch\u2026\u201d mumbled Bruce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightly curled blonde hair flashed in the air as Charlie whirled around and strode to the former stoner, sunny smile on her pretty face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust \u2018cuz I\u2019m in a good mood, I\u2019ll only beat you <i>half</i> to death when we\u2019re outta here,\u201d cooed the blonde bobbysoxer. The red-painted smile remained fixed on her lips as she took off down the street. \u201cC\u2019mon, dickweeds, let\u2019s get a\u2019 shooting!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick strode over to his friend, who was standing stock-still, a bemused expression frozen on his face. \u201cYou alright there, Bruce?\u201d There was no response.  \u201cLook, if this doesn\u2019t turn us into drooling vegetables, I\u2019ll hold him off for as long as I can. So that\u2019s like, three seconds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce finally moved, turning his slack-jawed face slowly to meet Rick\u2019s gaze. \u201cIs it me\u2026 or was that actually kinda hot?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b><i>Dude!</i></b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce raised his hands defensively. \u201cHey, \u2018s not my fault Charlie makes a good chick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick grimaced. \u201cChrist, now <b>I</b> want to shoot myself.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI calls \u2018em like I sees \u2018em.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Rick\u2019s dismay, a gun store was only a few blocks away \u2014 Charlie\u2019s eagle eye spotted it, and upon its sighting, she kicked off her mary janes and set off sprinting, mumbling something about \u2018fuckin\u2019 Barbie shoes\u2019 in a bitter soprano.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick marveled at the reaction of the nearby pedestrians. Sure, everything was procedurally generated \u2014 with generous reference to period pieces and Wikipedia entries \u2014 but he never expected this kind of, well, <i>reactivity</i>. People - or, uh, programs - eyed Charlie with varying expressions of contempt, disgust, and plain ol\u2019 bile curiosity! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the Historotron could simulate preconceptions towards certain types of folks, the applications were even more limitless than before \u2014 contradictory as that was. It could be used to eliminate prejudices, foster empathy, bring in a new era of world peace \u2014 alright, maybe that was stretching it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, well, to do that, he needed to make sure that Charlie didn\u2019t beat the everloving shit out of the contraption, a possibility that was becoming harder and harder to prevent with every muttered \u2018crazy broad\u2019 from passerbys. Bruce took it upon himself to go into the gun store, on the (very well-founded) assumption that the owner would deny Charlie service, which would probably result in quite a lot of hell being raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick, meanwhile, stood near the shaded corner of the brick-and-mortar store with his brother-turned-sister, trying <i>very</i> hard to not question her about what this experience had <i>taught</i> her, lest his simulated teeth take a one-way-trip to his stomach when Bruce exited the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey guy- er, both of you, check it out!\u201d he crowed, twirling a rather large nickel-plated revolver on his ring finger. \u201cI\u2019m Revolver Ocelot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds like nerd shit. I bet it\u2019s nerd shit,\u201d grumbled Charlie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019d you \u2014 <i>jesus don\u2019t point that thing at me</i> \u2014 pay for it?\u201d asked Rick, ducking his head as the gun turned to face him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno dude,  I just pointed at it, asked the store guy if I could get it, then a real slick wallet just <i>poof</i>ed itself into my pocket.\u201d Bruce shrugged. \u201cKinda neat. Wonder if I could buy something bigger with it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit!\u201d announced Charlie as she wrenched the gun off of the greaser\u2019s finger, drawing a small yelp out of him. With a bit of difficulty, she pulled back the hammer, put the muzzle in her mouth, and <i><b>CLICK</b></i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhaa th\u2019 faah,\u201d slurred Charlie, brains still very much snugly nestled in her skull. With her nth grimace that day, she extracted the metal barrel from her mouth, glaring at Bruce. \u201cWhat kinda <b>pussy</b> doesn\u2019t load a gun?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sizeable amount of people had begun to gather around the gun shop, a few pointing at the obviously suicidal housewife, the poor thing, and how her milksop husband couldn't even protect her from that <i>wicked</i> greaser! Rick quickly put a hand on either shoulder of his nearly-bickering compatriots and directed-slash-shoved them into the recesses of a nearby, hissing \u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d on loop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them stood awkwardly in the grassy backroad, Rick having sequestered himself in a corner, knock-kneed in from anxiety, and Charlie\u2019s red-tipped finger still around the trigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie broke the silence with a \u201cWell, are we fuckin\u2019 doing this or not?\u201d, and a petulant plant of her gun-free hand on her hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, there is no goddamn way that I\u2019m shooting myself,\u201d said Bruce. Before Rick could interject with a reiteration of his <i>very serious</i> health concern, Bruce fished a small red box out of his pockets and tossed it Charlie\u2019s direction. \u201cHere, shoot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe events that ensued did so <i>extraordiarily</i> quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce\u2019s face broke into a large smile at his unintentional pun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie caught the box, opened it, and with instincts honed from manifold Call of Duty matches, slotted a bullet into the first chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick struggled to a proper standing position and started to dash to the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Charlie, with a victorious smirk upon her face, pressed the gun against her temple, cocked the hammer, and pulled the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one really heard the bang as the entire world seemed to dissolve into quadrilateral green, red, and blue particulate matter, a klaxonesque \u2018ERROR DETECTED: PASSENGER AT RISK\u2019 boring through their ears and into their brains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen light once again graced the time-travellers' eyes....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Charlie seemed very much alive with no ragged hole in the side of her skull. But, even though she\u2019s definitely <i>pissed</i>, she seems less sweary and more, uh, Stepfordy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: The trio are still in the 1950s, merely another scenario. And, adding to Charlie\u2019s immeasurable rage, <i>she\u2019s</i> still a girl!</span></div></div>",

Your long time girlfriend Alicia who you planned to propose to and even planned on taking here for your honeymoon had broken up with after confessing that she had been cheating on you for months. This trip was supposed to help you forget about her and help you rediscover yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTraveling with you was your best friend Derek and his girlfriend Sarah. You had been friends with Derek since high school and while he has been know to be wild party type of guy, he always has your back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis girlfriend Sarah you have know for the last three years since she has been dating Derek. At first you didn\u2019t really really like her. While she was hot, she seemed shallow and uninteresting to you. However over the years you have found she isn\u2019t so bad. She has a great sense of humor and actually helped plan some of the best birthdays you have ever had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTraveling with them is Sarah\u2019s younger sister Lisa. Derek used to joke about her saying Sarah got all the hot genes and there wasn\u2019t much left for Lisa. While that was somewhat true, it didn\u2019t mean Lisa was any less a nice person. She was kind, gentle, but definitely shy. Sarah was a sexy blonde with the body of a cheerleader, meanwhile Lisa was a short and skinny brunette, with large glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t know Lisa very well, only meeting her at birthday parties a couple times. She seemed really nice but her shyness made it hard to get to know her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis trip was planned mostly by Derek and Sarah. Derek told you he plans to propose to Sarah here. Meanwhile you need to focus on getting over your Ex and meeting someone new. Lisa needs to finally grow and get out of her shell and experiment with life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of you soon pulled up to the luxury resort ready to enjoy what was supposed to be an amazing week of fun and excitement. </span></div></div>",

It is a huge milestone for me and this Interactive, and I'd like to just talk a little about it and acknowledge the other hard working authors that helped this project come to life and take on a life of it's own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA year ago, on April 19th, 2018 I embarked upon a project to restore several of the stories originally created by Sandyseeker, and had been unfortunately lost when Sandyseeker deleted their account. Those stories were:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Grellstone: Angry Transformations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark's Morphin' Machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive Characters in Search of Change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a daunting task as I had no way of re-posting the original chapters of the story, and to bring the stories into a more modern era of Interactive TG/TF. I knew that a complete restoration was going to be impossible and instead opted for making these stories and Interactive into more of a spiritual successor, similar but different, one that could take on a life of it's own and be an overall hub for original stories to start from. It started with the introductory overview which was (and still is) a bit wordy, but I also wanted to lay down some more rules to ensure a higher overall quality and keep out the content which can be viewed as distasteful to outright illegal. I wanted to treat this project and the stories within with the respect that they deserved and give fans of the original longer length chapters and higher quality stories to enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the year since, this project has grown beyond my wildest expectations at the time, and that is entirely due to the hard work and dedication of my fellow writers helping to drive the story forward, to recreate what was lost when Sandyseeker deleted their account here. While Mark's Morphin' Machine and Five Characters in Search of Change (now known as Magical Transformations) have sort of fell by the wayside, the Ahn'Ger Stone and several side stories have been going strong, thanks to the help of these talented authors. Their dedication to this project helped keep my own interest, and I can easily say this is the largest online project that I have ever been part of. And I'm honored to be a part of it, as it is one of the high points of my day to log in and see new chapters posted, or an email talking about new ideas for this Interactive, and even just reading these chapters as a fan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such I'd like to take this moment to thank the following authors for their invaluable contributions to this story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFitzroy Clement: Someone whose knowledge of the old Grellstone chapters and understanding of it's characters helped propel this spiritual successor forward by such leaps and bounds. From recreating the old chapters, bringing back characters I had forgotten about entirely, to helping push into new arcs and filling out the world in a way that the original story never did, the Ahn'Ger Stone is now so much more than just a simple TF/TG story with a relatively small cast. Their contributions have been utterly invaluable in the success of this Interactive and it simply would not have survived without you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardio: Someone who has helped me build an absolutely wonderful side-story with The Toolbox. With little more than two opening chapters, Cardio leaped in and grabbed hold of the concept, helping to flesh it and the characters into such a great grab-bag of transformations from both the expected to the wildly unexpected, from shrinking to TF/TG and just overall delightfully goofy characters. Thank you for exploring that world with me, and I look forward to many more chapters to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomethingnew: Somethingnew was someone who stepped in at the start of the project, working alongside Fitzroy Clements to bring back the old chapters from the Grellstone and helped give this project the early push in interest it needed to get going. Your contributions were great and I look forward to see your return to this Interactive one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComiccow6: Comiccow6's contributions to the Interactive have always been of excellent quality, often opening up routes that I had never considered, and seizing the initiative with one of the secondary story prompts to create something that I would have never expected. And their support for this project has been something that has always brought a smile to my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorphology: While Morphology has not been an active contributor to this project, they did, however, post a large chunk of chapters from The Grellstone, helping give the Ahn'Ger Stone some of it's original history back. Thank you for providing these chapters, and if you're still out there reading, please feel free to add more, or post your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. George: Thank you for your contributions, specifically the opening chapters of Mark's Morphin' Machine! It was great to see your take on the opening chapters of what was honestly my first exposure to Sandyseeker's Interactives! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Awesome and Guyman: Thank you both for launching two of the side-stories! It is always a thrill to see other writers take on the story prompts and their interpretation of them! I have greatly enjoyed your chapters and hope to see more from you guys in the future!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo anyone that I might have missed, thank you for your own contributions to this project!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd last but certainly not least, I'd like to thank everyone that has been a fan of this Interactive and has come here to read the chapters we've ALL worked so hard on. As much as we may do this for ourselves, we also do this to entertain you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere's to many more stories, chapters and characters, and I'll see you all again at the 1000th chapter milestone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Mr.Domino</span></div></div>",

It has found it's way to Earth and has found it's way onto the doorstep of Bill Strasserman, a high school Senior in the American town of Shermer, Illinois. Bill is enamored by it's unique shape and strange beauty; a teardrop emerald with a golden core that seems to pull the light of the morning sun into it  Through a series of strange events, Bill discovers that the stone is magical and grants wishes! ...But only when whoever is holding it is angry! And to make matters worse, Bill is surrounded by a cast of friends and enemies and all of them seem compelled to use the Ahn'Ger Stone! With the wishes capable of permanently altering not just bodies, but the entire fabric of reality and the minds of everyone within it, can Bill discover the truth behind the Stone without getting transformed by an angry wish?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>-Cast of Characters-</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill Strasserman is your average 18 year old High School senior. He has a small group of friends and has average grades, and is a bit of a geek, though he has a interest in baseball and doesn't mind physical activity. His life is comfortably middle of the road, with one younger sister, a mom and dad and a dog and lives in a nice house in a quiet section of small town America. He's enjoying his final year of school and looking forward to college, and maybe finally getting a girlfriend. His only problem? A bully with a bone to pick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly Strasserman is Bill's younger, twelve year old sister. The baby of the Strasserman family, Kimberly can be a bit of a brat and is not above using her spoiled status as a means to get what she wants. She is jealous that Bill is older than her, and thinks that he is still a smelly boy. She does not enjoy school and would rather spend her time goofing off with friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom Ackerton Is Bill's best friend. The two have known each other since Kindergarten, and over the years Tom and Bill have gotten into all sorts of hijinks and adventures. In middle school ,Tom joined the school basketball team and quickly became one of the stars of the team, landing him a girlfriend named Gloria Vanapolous. They've recently gone through a nasty break-up, and Tom has been taking his frustration out on Bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria Vanapolous is Tom's recently ex-girlfriend, and one of the school's prettiest girls. One of the most popular girls in school and a cheerleader, Gloria's break-up with Tom has been the talk of the gossip circles recently and Gloria is not above exaggerating the truth in order to punish Tom further for breaking her heart. Gloria is an only child, and due to her mother Ariadne being a massive control freak, Gloria has taken her frustrations out on those that cross her, though underneath she still considers herself to be a good person at heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan Ingerman, or 'Big Jon' is the bully of Bill's high school. A massive, constantly angry muscle headed jerk that is known to hold grudges and is not afraid to get physical in order to get what he wants, Jonathan makes life a special brand of Hell for those unfortunate to cross him and his gang of lackeys. Several years ago, Bill caused Big Jon to get suspended by tricking him into a fight with a teacher nearby. Jonathan has not forgotten, nor has he forgiven Bill for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob Bolstrum is the former leader of the high school bullies, now disgraced after losing a fight for dominance to Big Jon. Rob is now nothing more than Ingerman's lackey, and harbors a deep, burning hate for him. Rob does what he's told, but the big man is smarter than anyone gives him credit for, and is looking for a way to take his revenge on Big Jon and get his old title of King of the Bullies back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd many more characters!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Other Stories you might enjoy!</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\">The Toolbox</div></b> Two roommates living in the city of Redford Hills California, the summer before their freshman year in college, experience a minor earthquake that knocks a cabinet off the wall!
