She had short orange hair adorned with a blue hairclip on her top left bang, small blue earrings on her ears, and a blue shirt with a light blue center area with a cat logo in the middle. On her legs were a pair of white Capris pants that went down to just qbove her ankles. On her feet were a pair of white shoes. Looking closely you can see she was barefoot in her shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, summer is here, better try and make the most of it\" she said to herself. It was gonna be her summer and here alone. Her Grandpa Max had offered to her parents to take her with him on a summer road trip with her cousin Ben. She refused however as she wanted this summer to herself and not with her dorky doofus cousin. Her parents respected her wish as well as her grandpa. Now she had time to do things she wanted, like go get her nails done and get some new books from the library. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked down the street thinking over what she would do this summer. It was fairly empty as she walked through the park with no one around. While walking along she heard a whirling noise, as if something was falling. <br>\r\n  Looking up she saw the source of the sound. A shooting star...coming right for her. <br>\r\n  \"AAAH\" she went as she jumped the other way in time as the star crashed behind her. On the ground, she looked on at the star crashed into a crater in front of her. <br>\r\n  \"...Woooah\" she said amazed at the wreckage left behind by the crash and the smoke coming from it.<br>\r\n  \"Getting up she walked toward the crater as she looked at what was there. It wasn't a star...but instead some kind of pod. Opening up, the pod revealed some sort of...watch? It had a thick black strap as the main part of it, with white tubes running from the bottom of it to the top, where they all pointed to a green dial shaped like an hourglass by 2 black triangles. A green button was on the side of the strap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A watch?\" Said Gwen. \"Whats a watch doing in outer space\" she asked as she slid down the crater and walked toward the pod containing the watch. It was strange but its as if the watch was calling to her, asking her to pick it up. Thats the feeling she had anyway. <br>\r\n  She reached for the watch with her hand when suddenly, it sprung up by itself and opened its strap in two, latching onto her wrist. <br>\r\n  \"AAAAH, get off me get off me!!!\" Gwen screamed, panicking as the device was stuck on her wrist. No matter how hard she pulled it would not come off..</span></div></div>",

Suddenly the watch started beeping. Its lights began to blink green and blue. The dial blinked blue while the side button and 4 faceplate buttons blinked green. \"Huh\" Gwen said confused as to what was going on with the watch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden the dial began spinning wildly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New host detected, beginning scan\" said the watch in a monotone voice as the dial blinked blue each time it spoke. \"WHAA-did it just talk?\" Gwen asked in surprise. Afterwards a blue light began projecting itself onto her from the side button. It went over the top and bottom of her body like a scanner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scan complete\" said the watch. \"Species: Human. Blood health and pressure normal. Temperature normal. Skin condition healthy. Host is of normal health and of prepubescent age\" the watch explained giving her its health checkup and diagnosis of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen was confused as to what just happened. She then decided to touch the ring dial with her right hand since it seemed to have stopped moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um..hello? Watch?\" Gwen asked thinking the watch would respond as she turned the ring dial a couple of times to the right. \"Hello host human\" the watch replied back as it startled Gwen with its response. \"Um, my name is Gwen if you wouldn't mind\" she said a bit annoyed at being called a host. \"Changing host idenitification: Gwen\" the watch responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a wierd watch\" she said noting how it spoke in a robotic tone, but appeared to be self aware. \"I am not a watch, I am the omnitrix\" the watch said as Gwen turned its dial left and right experimenting with it. If it did have self awareness it didn't seem to mind being twisted and turned. She looked on at it as she listened. \"I am a genetic modification device. My purpose is to carry the genetic samples of all sentient life in the known galaxy\" It explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So..you're an alien watch, er..omnitrix,  that carries alien dna?\" Gwen asked. \"Correct. My primary function however, is to allow my host to turn into said species\" it said. Gwen was intrigued by this last part. \"Cool, how do i do that\" she asked excitedly. \"Select the button on the strap\" it said. Gwen looked down at the strap and pressed her thumb against the green button. All of a sudden the ring dial had popped up with an activation sound. The hourglass shape turned into a diamond as the triangles crossed an showed a silhouette of a  creature. <br>\r\n\"So now what?\" Gwen asked. \"Press the button down\" said the omnitrix. Gwen pressed down the dial with her finger and in an instant blue light began shining from the watch. She soon felt herself changing inside and out. She had turned into...</span></div></div>",

Immediately after that the dial and watch started sinking into her skin as a special energy enveloped her arm before moving up to the rest of her body. She was completely enveloped in green light as she began feeling like she was changing. She felt a tickling feeling inside her like she was being tickled down to her molecules as her arms, legs, head and body began shifting and contorting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the light died down Gwen opened her eyes. She found that she was back in the park again....but something was off with her perspective. Was she taller? Gwen wondered this in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at herself she screamed. \"AAAAH\" she went in a voice that sounded deeper and more womanly. She observed that her entire body was now yellow while covered with red charcoal like rocks. The rocks covered her from head to toe. The only parts not covered were her head, hands and feet. Her hands were yellow and looked like molten lava was flowing across them as her fingers were dainty and girly. Her feet were yellow and had two toes that curved to each other, making an O shape between each toe. The biggest change Gwen noticed was her surprisingly well developed chest. She had 2 D-cup breasts covered in charcoal red rocks. Above them was the omnitrix symbol. Gwen was blushing when she saw this, her face a round red shape with two yellow eyes and a mouth with yellow lips. Her head in its entirety was in a constant fire emanating from her thin charcoal rock neck, the flames spreading to the back of her head in a line of flame reaching to where her upper arms were, mimicking her human form's short red hair's style. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm on fire, I'M ON FIRE\" she continued to scream in a panic as she flailed around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down Miss Gwen, calm down, you are unharmed\" said the omnitrix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh\" she said calming down. \"Hey I'm ok, I don't feel like I'm burning\" she said looking at her yellow flaming hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not. You have transformed into a pyronite, a species made of fire. You have control over all things fire related and can project it yourself\" the omnitrix said, blinking green from its place on her chest each time it spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A..pyronite\" Gwen asked looking down at the symbol \"Indeed\" the watch replied. <br>\r\nOne thing she noticed immediately after calming down and looking at herself is that..<br>\r\n \"AAAAAH\" she screamed. \"What is it\" the omnitrix said. \"Why am I NAKED\" Gwen shouted in her deeper womanly voice. She looked herself over head to toe. Besides her large breasts which already caused her to blush, she noticed she had a curvy flaming body. Her hips were wide and her more...private areas were unclothed but still covered with her magma like rocks. Her feet had no shoes on them and as she looked behind her she saw her magma rock covered butt was huge and round. Gwen didn't say anything but she secretly enjoyed her new features, even if she wasn't human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I naked though, where are my clothes\" Gwen said with her molten magma like hands on her rock covered curvy hips looking down at the symbol in frustration. <br>\r\n\"Pyronites usually do not wear clothes. Their species lives on a sun so clothing would not even survive there and they have no need for them either. The rocks on their bodies protects their modesty\" the omnitrix said. \"The omnitrix transforms the user's clothing into a form fitting the species they turn into, otherwise they are stored as nanites inside the omnitrix, when you change back your clothing will be restored\" the watch finished its explanation.<br>\r\n\"Can't you make it so I have clothes on this alien\" Gwen asked. The watch replied with..</span></div></div>",

She was gonna have to get used to being naked in this form for now. <br>\r\n\"Fine, so...what can I do with this alien, something with fire I'm guessing?\" Gwen asked while looking at her yellow magma- like hand. \"Try to focus on conjuring a flame\" The omnitrix blinked and said. Gwen attemped to do just that. She held out her hand and focused on it, stressing her head as she focused on making the flame. In an instant her hand ignited with a small fire rising from it. \"Cool\" she said with her deeper voice. \"Or should I say hot hehe\" she said jokingly. <br>\r\n \"Perhaps you shouldn't practice over here\" said the omnitrix. Gwen turned and realized she was still in the park. The large quantity of trees made it risky to summon fire. \"Oh..right\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then...</span></div></div>",

As she walked she felt her bare firey feet touch the cement ground. She could feel every step she took with her new body so her being a fire alien felt more legit. It sort of grossed her out her feet were touching the ground but then she also remembered this wasn't exactly her normal body so she just went with it. Looking back she saw her footsteps slightly charred the ground she walked on. She hoped no one would notice.<br>\r\n As she went into the bushes she made sure not to let her fire covered head touching any of the leaves. She decided to sit down in a clearing where no one would see her or was around. She sat down crossed legged, crossing her long firey legs together. She took a moment to take in her form. Looking at her dainty womanly magma hands, she felt like herself strangely, but she also felt like someone else. She felt fire coursing through her body but it didn't hurt. She wondered how long she would stay like this. It was fun and all but she would really like to turn back to human form again...and not be naked too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\" Gwen said to the omnitrix. \"How long am i gonna be this fire alien anyway\" Gwen said tapping the symbol.<br>\r\n\"A transformation usually lasts about 5 to 10 minutes. This is a precautionary measure to protect the users DNA. Estimated time before de-transformation; 3:39 minutes\" the watch said. Gwen sighed. She was going to have to wait until the watch ran out of power to turn her back to normal. Looking down at her flaming charcoal covered body She still couldn't help but look at her large breasts. She was only 10 but this form gave her a mature teen girl figure. She blushed as she looked at them and turned away. She could definitely feel that they were a part of her with a curious touch of her hand. <br>\r\n  She passed the time by seeing what she could do with her powers. She saw that she could fire a stream of flames from her hands as well as even breathe fire from her mouth. She took a deep breath and blasted a large blast of fire from her mouth. She was amazed at her power...although she incinerated a tree in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oops hehe\" Gwen said with her finger on her mouth. Thankfully the tree didn't stay on fire and spread it or things would have gotten much worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she heard a beeping noise. Looking down she saw the watch symbol blink red. Then she was blinded by a flash of light. In an instant Gwen was her regular human self again. Looking at<br>\r\nherself she saw her normal human arms and legs as she was back in her shirt, pants and shoes. \"Yes, I'm me again\" Gwen said. She liked being all firey but she missed being her normal self too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omnitrix in recharge mode\" the watch said as Gwen looked at it. The faceplate was now glowing red. \"Recharge in progress\". Gwen decided that there wasn't anything more she could do just hanging around at the park so she decided to grab her bag that she left on the ground and leave for home. Fascinated by this alien watch, she wanted to find out more about it.</span></div></div>",

Taking a step inside she closed the door behind her without a word. Her parents weren't home. In fact they were hardly ever home. Both were out on long hour jobs all day. Gwen learned to be independent as she came home and learned to cook and make food for herself all the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, time to see how this watch works\" she said. Taking off her shoes, she walked into the kitchen and grabbed some pop tarts from the cupboard. In another universe she would be more caring about what she ate, but this Gwen didn't care and ate whatever sugary was around. Thankfully she had a high metabolism so she didn't put on pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning on the TV she watched her favorite cop show, CSI Miami. As she settled herself she brought the big alien watch to her face and examined it closely. It was fully recharged and green. She remembered pressing the button below the faceplate and the faceplate popped up, so she did it again. With one push of the button the circle in the middle with the hourglass popped up and the hourglass crossed with each of its sides to make a diamond, showing the silhouette of that fire alien again. She figured she could try turning into her again, the feeling of transforming into a different being was exhilarating. Then she decided to play with the dial and turn it. She saw more Silhouettes of different shapes and sizes, one looking like a dog, a bird, a bug, a fairy, and some sort of small big headed creature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm let's try this one\" she said as she pressed down the dial. Instantly she felt waves of energy go throughout her body as she morphed and twisted her shape. She had turned into...</span></div></div>",

It felt exciting and wild as her body was encased in a bright green light and she felt her arms, legs, head and body shake and change their shape. This time the sensation felt different from before. Instead of feeling like she was getting bigger and with more energy, she felt most of the energy go to her head. She felt as if her head was expanding with her eyes getting bigger too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the light died down Gwen found that she was sitting in the same place on the couch as before but something was different. For some reason everything seemed...bigger? The tv remote was on the table but the table was far away from her. Moreover it looked like the remote was bigger too. \"Uh...what's going on\" Gwen said but then covered her mouth as she heard her voice be tiny and squeaky. She then looked at her hands. They were comically bigger and grey with 3 large fingers and a thumb instead of 4 fingers. She also noticed as she was blinking her eyelids closed sideways. She stood up and looked herself over. Her body was slim and now less than 6 inches tall. She was now wearing clothes. She wore a blue tight looking one piece jumpsuit stylized after her shirt that stopped at her upper legs, which were now grey as well as 2 big three toed frog feet. Gwen looked behind herself and saw that the couch was now as big as a house to her. \"W-waaaa, the couch is huge...no wait, I'm just really small now!\" Gwen said in her squeaky voice. Walking forward with her big frog feet, she looked at the reflection on the table, which was clean enough to have a reflection show off of it, she saw that her head was now huge. Her eyes were big bright green bug eyes half the size of her face with sideways slits for pupils as well as whiskers on her cheeks. She did notice however, that her hair was still on her head, although shorter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey, what am I now\" she said to the omnitrix...but then noticed looking down it wasn't on her chest like before. Feeling her front but seeing it wasn't there, she searched her back and felt the metallic dial planted on her back. Pressing on the button she said \"hey watch, what am i now, and why am i small\"? The omnitrix calmly said \"You are now a galvan. This species is naturally very small and don't usually grow over a foot\" it said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting her giant hands on her hips Gwen said \"well what good is this form then?\" Blinking green, the omnitrix responded with \"while not excelling in size, the galvan are known as one of the smartest species in the known galaxy. They have great wisdom and knowledge as well as large lifespans\". Gwen took in what it said. It was right, she felt as if she knew a lot. Putting her fingers on her large head she concentrated. She knew things that felt like they were on a high school, or even college level. She didn't exactly understand all of it but instinctually she knew what they meant. Formulas, equations and whatnot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Wooooow, its like i had an enlightenment moment. So much knowledge and i don't even know how i know it\" Gwen said. \"Indeed, the Galvan are renowned for their intelligence\" the omnitrix said. Gwen walked over to the table. Looking forward she decided to jump. She surprisingly jumped very high. She looked down and saw the table below her as she was flying across it, though not really. Seeing it go behind her she realized she jumped too far. \"Waaaaah\" Gwen said as she fell face first onto the carpet. \"She pulled herself off the rug and rubbed her head. \"Ugh that wasn't fun' she said..but realized she wasn't too hurt. \"Hey what do you know, the smaller they are the lighter they fall\" she said happily. She felt her face and squished her cheek. It was squishy, very squishy compared to her as a human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The galvan can leap somewhat great distances. They are also built to withstand falls as high as a human's normal height because of their soft frog-like composition. They are also amphibious and can breathe underwater\" the watch said. Taking this information in Gwen got up and ran under the table. She liked the point of view of such a small being. the table was like a house to her at this size. She blinked sideways as her single eyelash green eyes sparkled at the wonder of being so small. \"Haha yeah\" she said as she ran across the rug. It took a while but she managed to get to a shelf with books in it. Climbing it she pulled a book out as it fell and she jumped onto it. She opened it and read. She had the sudden urge to read. Absorbing the knowledge she was fascinated by how smart she was. She read and understood the book in minutes. Deciding she was done she pondered what to do next, and about this device in general. That fire alien was tough and this small smart alien is creative. With power like this she could be a hero, saving the day from villians. On the other hand she has this device all to herself. She could use it for her own needs. She found this device and she could use it as she pleases. <br>\r\nWhat will she do...</span></div></div>",

Why should she have to be a hero and in debt herself to everyone? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I can use this device how I want. I did find it so I can use it for myself' she thought. The only issue was the timer. As long as she had to time out all the time she couldn't make the most of this omnitrix or whatever it was called. She thought this to herself then came up with an idea. With help from the a.i. she could fix this timer issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey omnitrix\" Gwen/grey matter said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Miss Gwen\" it asked politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there an option to modify the timer on this device\"?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That function is not available currently. Furthermore, it is recommended that you keep the timer on for safety. The omnitrix keeps you transformed for 10 minutes at most to protect your DNA\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn't fly well with Gwen. She wanted to be an alien forever. Then she thought of another question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, but, how would you be able to unlock the limiter removal function?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A series of command codes manipulating the faceplate may unlock new functions and aliens\" it said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the tip\" Gwen said. She jumped off the book and decided to fiddle with the faceplate on her back. Turning it every which way she wanted to unlock the time removal feature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Gwen, what are you doing\" the omnitrix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, I'm gonna unlock every feature on this thing and be an alien queen\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please cease your actions. You must ease into the device or you may hurt yourself\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure\" she said sarcastically.
