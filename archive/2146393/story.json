It had been a long drive to the small town, surviving only on a diet of cigarettes and energy drinks.    <br>\r\nShe walked into the convenience store. A bored, twenty something clerk sat behind bullet-proof glass watching a small television. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiana walked around the store, and grabbed some essential supplies for the unfurnished apartment, including a local map of the area from a stand.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter pricing the items, the clerk asked \"Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please, Sarah\" said Tiana, referring to the name badge on the clerk. \"A pack of Marlboro Lights.\u201d Sarah put the cigarettes and lighter on the counter. Tiana took a twenty out of her purse and paid for her purchase. Sarah took the bill and gave Tiana the change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiana unwrapped the pack, tore it open and extracted a cigarette. She went to spark the lighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't smoke in here!\"\u009d said Sarah, agitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I can.\"\u009d said Tiana. She sparked the lighter and lit the cigarette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Tiana\u2019s eyes began glowing, and the clerk felt herself powerless to resist.  Tiana had special powers of mind control, and spent years harnessing its power throughout her teenage years.  Once Sarah\u2019s eyes were locked, she was putty in Tiana\u2019s hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you can.\"\u009dSarah droned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiana took a hard drag. The smoke hit her lungs. Tiana felt a surge of power as the nicotine hit her brain. She sucked on the cigarette again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you smoke?\"\u009d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\"\u009d Sarah replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do now,\"\u009d said Tiana. \"You absolutely love cigarettes. You smoke at least a pack a day.\"\u009d She hesitated. \"Help yourself.\"\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah pulled a pack from the display, awkwardly opened it, extracted a cigarette and lit it with a lighter from the display on the counter. She took a deep drag and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiana left the store with her groceries and got back in the car, cigarette dangling from her lips. Smoke soon filled the interior. The ash on her cigarette grew long. Tiana nonchalantly flicked it onto the carpet. She took drag and after drag, gulping the smoke down greedily, before crushing the cigarette out in the once unused ash tray. She immediately lit another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah emerged from the store, pulled out her cigarettes, and lit up. She smoked hungrily, as any pack a day smoker would. She stuck the cigarettes back in the apron of her uniform. She took drag after drag. Tiana, watching from the car, smoked in unison. <br>\r\nThe clerk sucked hard on her cigarette one last time, dropped the spent filter to the ground, crushed it with her shoe and went back inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tiana lit up a new cigarette, she drove off\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The specials sign was empty, the napkins and relish still stashed behind the counter. The place looked homely, but they clearly were not expecting a lot of business. A girl was sitting on a stool, taking occasional sips from her coffee while inspecting her phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon.\" She said, glancing up from her phone. \"Coffee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Tiana smiled, already liking her laid-back attitude. She sat down in one of the booths, looking around for some indication of the type of food they served here. Moments later the waitress returned with a steaming cup of coffee, accompanied by a menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Oh, and could you bring me an ash-tray?\" She said, taking the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sorry we're a non-smoking establishment.\" The waitress droned her reply like she was talking about cannibalism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. That's too bad...\" Tiana mused. Shame, she was just starting to like the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. And if you know what's good for you you'd knock off with that filthy habit. Gives you bad breath. Anyway if you're ready to order just holler.\" She swayed back to her stool and sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiana took a gulp of her coffee, staring at the empty seat in front of her. Bad breath... Fuck, that's what mints were for. Maybe it was time to make her see it wasn't such a filthy habit after all.</span></div></div>",

Smokers are the most interesting people, and you find yourself liking their company very much.\" She finished with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...aroused by people smoking.\" The waitress repeated monotonously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now. About that ashtray... What's your name, by the way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh- it's Simone.\" She snapped out of her trance, putting away the menu as if nothing had happened. \"And I'll get you an ashtray right away miss...\" She beamed a smile, the question lingering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiana, nice to meet you.\" She answered, smiling back. Wasn't she just the best at making new friends... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone disappeared in the back. When she returned, Tiana had unfolded the map of Taylor County she had picked up in the store. She put down the club sandwich and the ashtray, just in time to catch the first ash off her already burning cigarette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" She gave the waitress an appreciative not then went back to studying the map.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you with anything else.\" Simone said, eagerly taking in the second hand smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, you know your way around here?\" Tiana said, taking a bite of the sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I was raised here.\" Simone shot out. She flopped down opposite her. \"What are you looking for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiana blew a column of steam across the table, making Simone's eyes water.

She pointed to the location with her red nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.  What else can you tell me about Taylor County?\" Tiana asked as she took a small bite from the sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone briefed Tiana on the major figures in the town including; Yvonne the soccer mom who empowered the local schoolgirls, Hailey, the bored housewife addicted to daytime TV and neighborhood watch and Annette the local vicar whom the locals relied upon.  Taylor County was a small town, and gossip travelled quick.  As Simone disclaimed rumours, Tiana inhaled and exhaled casually from her cigarette.  With her hypnotic abilities, Tiana knew each would fall prey to her charm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she took a final drag off her cigarette, she exhaled directly in the face of the waitress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I gotta go for now, thanks for the information.  Anyway, give me your number and we can have drinks later tonight.\" Tiana insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that would be great.\" Simone smiled as she wrote down her number on the map.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tiana walked out of the diner, customers walked in and complained vehemently about the smell of smoke lingering inside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She new an authentic when she saw one, and the book was practically screaming it at her. She picked it up and ringed it off without even opening it. A nice trophy for her first day. She'd give it a good spot somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the car she studied it's contents, carefully turning over each page. It was made of genuine parchment. It was written by an Englishman, although she gathered he was mostly just a mouth-piece for a shaman from Madagascar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man had been nearing retirement and deemed none of the younger tribesman fit to inherit his knowledge of the art of hypnosis. Over the years he had watched as his people had become dependent on the ways of westerners, soft and clumsy. Afraid the knowledge would be lost forever, he had convinced an English zoologist to write this book for him. The shaman would be relieved of carrying the burden, and the knowledge would be kept somewhere safe. The full writing had taken a total of 5 years, during which the zoologist was forced to live under abominable conditions. A few pleas for help were scribbled in the margin, along with descriptions of the lousy weather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe skipped over a few pages, doubting the whole thing had gone down fairly. Although... if this hypnosis was real, maybe the zoologist wasn't really forced to do anything. At least, not in the conventional sense. The first few chapters were aimed at the hypnosis of animals. Basic stuff, like what movements to make not to spook an animal, but also things like making sure an animal could not break your gaze even if it wanted to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last chapters was more interesting to her. They concerned the actual modification of the human psyche, as the zoologist called it. How to put a person in trance, how to give them instructions, how to change everything about them with nothing but eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still skeptical, though. Either way, she was eager to try it out. She did a few of the mind-exercises described in the book. They were like meditation, but with a few twists. For one, she needed to empty her mind as much as possible, while staring at a pattern on the page. Focusing on the edges of a shape while staring at it's center. After a while she started feeling dizzy, but something forced her to keep watching. Like a truth that would not be forgotten any longer, it blossomed in front of her. Reaching into her mind. Then it all went black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wakes up, several hours later...</span></div></div>",

Walking into the shop, she noticed that it was empty, the only other person inside was the employee stocking the shelves.  That suited her just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, were you looking for something today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiana smiled at the girl, her eyes glowing, \"No, but you can Ariel naked for me while I decide,\" she paused to read the girls nametag, \"Emily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily nodded, \"Of course ma'am.\"  And Tiana watched with a wide smile as the blonde removed her apron, shirt, skirt, bra and panties, and her shoes and socks.  Looking the now naked employee over, Tiana smiled, a wonderful idea in her head on what to do with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you have gorgeous breasts,\" she said, cupping the girl's breasts in her hands, easily C cup, \"and you work in a flower shop.  So from now on you're a cow.\"  Tiana smiled as the girls eyes grew duller, unfocused, and slowly became wall-eyed, looking in opposite directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will feel the urge to eat plants, starting with your flowers, and behave totally like a cow in all aspects, even when others are here.\"  She watched as Emily plopped onto her naked butt before crawling around on her hands and knees, her breasts swinging beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiana laughed as Emily began to munch on some daisies, mooing occasionally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor good measure, she ripped Emily's panties and clipped her name tag to them before sliding them down onto her neck, an impromptu collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling she started to leave when the door opened, more victims, or leave and cause chaos elsewhere?</span></div></div>",

Though to be fair, it's not what someone usually expects when going into a store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily?!\" She said,quickly running up to the hypnotized girl, \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mooooo.\"  Emily said back, a daisy sticking out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on!\"  She said, digging through her purse, \"I'll call the police, or a hospital, or someone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Tiana made herself known, grabbing Stacy's arm, quickly using her eyes to subdue the new victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your name?\"  Tiana asked, smirking at the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stacy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh.\"  Tiana took the purse away, tossing it over her shoulder, \"That was a really bitchy move there, almost interrupting my fun.\" She bobbed her head in the direction of Emily, who had moved onto grazing on the petunias.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry!\"  Stacy cried, getting on her knees, how could she make it up to this wonderful woman?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiana smiled, \"That's ok, here's how we'll be even: strip naked,\". She'd barely finished that part when Stacy began ripping her clothes off herself, tearing her shirt in half. \"And from now on, you're a bitch.  You'll always bark, crawl around on all fours, and be a complete dog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled as Stacy lowered herself onto all fours, before looking up at her and smiling, lolling her tongue out and panting, shaking her butt to simulate a tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you'll hump darn near everything that moves as well, starting with Emily here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiana laughed as Stacy eagerly bounded over to her friend, before mounting her doggy style, grinding up against her friends naked butt, Stacy was really enjoying it, while Emily seemed to either not notice, or not care, casually eating her flowers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the store, Tiana looked around the street to see where she could go next, the police station?  That'd certainly get rid of some fun-killers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe the community center, they were advertising the PTA meeting was being held there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDescisions, descisions.</span></div></div>",
