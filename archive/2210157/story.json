As I stood and began stumbling to the bathroom to brush my teeth and get ready for the day it took me a moment to shake the fog of sleep from my mind but once I did I remembered why I subjected myself to the torture of waking up at 6 in the morning. After I brushed my teeth and took my shower I fixed my hair and looked in the mirror. I was greeted by my rather <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://farm8.static.flickr.com/7154/6758137693_a89098ac38_b.jpg/\">average</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://farm8.static.flickr.com/7154/6758137693_a89098ac38_b.jpg/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a> looking face.

After parking and walking up to see what's there I saw a chest filled with a bunch of stuff, as I looked through it I found a folded piece of paper with some strange writing on it. I always liked history and ancient languages so I folded it up, slipped it into my pocket, and headed back to my car. The rest of the day went reasonably as I found a couple of pieces of decent furniture, and met a few cute neighbors, but all I could think about the entire day was that little slip of paper. When I got home I went straight to my room and sat down at my computer to try to see what the words meant. However, no matter how many different languages I researched, the words on that paper belonged to none of them. Frustrated, I looked down at the words and, as if a dam suddenly broke, the pronunciation of the words popped into my head. As I spoke them aloud, the paper suddenly caught on fire and I felt the urge to speak them.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
