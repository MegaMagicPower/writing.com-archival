            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A small crowd had gathered around a picnic table at the Forest Meadows public park that morning for a special celebration. Several parents were there, along with a few teenagers. Everyone was in a festive mood, and for a good reason. It was a hot, muggy day and there was a tremendous need to get wet or drink a lot of fluids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe parents brought plenty of bags of sandwiches, bottles of soda and juices, and bags of ice in the cooler. It was a hot, Saturday morning following the last day of school. Summer vacation had arrived, and the teens were very happy about that!  No class, no homework, no books, no essays, and no tests! There was nothing but fun times and summer camps and time to relax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince it was so hot, the place, time and location was the ideal setting for a small, private birthday party. A teenage boy named Allen Andersen, thirteen years old and about to turn fourteen that day, was enjoying the fun with three of his friends at the park. His mother had picked up Tom Mason, Alice Morris and Damian Peters at their homes before driving everyone to the public park. Since there was a small swimming pool located at the park, it was just the ideal location for the party. Large wooden picnic tables were set up just several yards away from the pool, and there were locker rooms with showers available as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen, Tom, Alice and Damian changed and jumped into the pool as soon as they arrived while Allen\u2019s mother prepared the snacks, the sandwiches, and she placed the fourteen candles on the small chocolate birthday cake. <br>\r\nHer son had been very particular about blowing out the candles at the exact time when he was born, fourteen years earlier. This magical moment was around 12:30 in the afternoon. Since everyone was still swimming, it worked out well for his mom.  She prepared the food and waited till about noon. Then, she asked everyone to get out of the pool and dry off, so they could surround the table and watch as Allen blew out the candles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from Allen\u2019s mother, his younger sister was also there, so it was a truly great little party for everyone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it got close to noon, Allen\u2019s mother, Mrs. Anderson walked up to the edge of the pool and called out to all the teens to come out and to take time to dry off, change, shower, and to put on some dry clothes. Everyone had done that, and about fifteen minutes later, all four kids were sitting on the wooden bench at the picnic table. Allen\u2019s mother had already lit all the candles, so it was just a matter of waiting for the right moment to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was about 12:29pm, she asked everyone to stand up and to circle around the table. Allen came to the front, facing the cake, as his mom announced that it was almost that exact time, fourteen years ago, that her son was born. <br>\r\nWhen her watch turned 12:30pm, she said \u201cNow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen took a deep breath and blew out all the candles with one mighty blow. While he did this, he quietly thought to himself, \u201cI wish I could go on a life-long adventure!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as all fourteen candles were extinguished, Allen felt funny\u2026 He began to feel weak for a brief moment\u2026 He felt a bit faint, like he was getting sick. Something strange was about to happen\u2026<br>\r\n\u201cMan\u2026 I feel\u2026 weird\u2026\u201d Allen said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he started growing taller! Allen wasn\u2019t a big kid to begin with. In fact, Damian was an inch or so taller than him! His legs continued to stretch out, making him taller and taller. He was just over 4 feet tall, and he had suddenly passed 5 feet\u2026 6 feet\u2026 7 feet\u2026 the growth finally stopped when he reached the astonishing height of eight feet! Allen looked like a giant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his height wasn\u2019t the only thing that changed about him! His arms grew longer and his torso grew bigger and wider as well. In fact, his entire body grew in proportion to his amazing height! Within seconds, Allen was suddenly the biggest kid at the park, towering over everyone who was there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was growing bigger and taller, another transformation took place: His muscles increased as well! Allen had always been a scrawny kid. Well, that all changed when the birthday boy blew out the candles!<br>\r\nHis muscles started expanding at an exponential rate! The scrawny kid suddenly transformed into a giant, massive muscle man, right before everyone\u2019s eyes! His arms exploded with huge muscle, sporting bowling ball biceps and triceps. His calves, his glutes and his quads grew bigger and thicker and wider than anything that the kids had ever imagined! Allen\u2019s pectorals became giant mounds of steel! Finally, his flat stomach was now totally covered with washboard abs! He was totally ripped! Not to mention, his incredible growth spurt caused him to totally demolish his khaki shorts and his t-shirt to shreds! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen must have weighed about 675 pounds by now! Not only was he covered in muscle, but he was incredibly strong! He was probably strong enough to easily lift cars, trucks, and even buses with his bare hands!!<br>\r\nFinally, Allen\u2019s skin color began to change! It darkened a bit, indicating that his fair skin had hardened! His entire body now took on a completely different tone! His body now looked like it was made of concrete! He had in fact turned into a giant man of stone!  When his head cleared and he looked down, he realized what had happened to his body! He was HUGE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Allen\u2019s amazing growth spurt had stopped, one last change took place! Allen\u2019s fingernails quickly changed into hard diamonds, each and every one of them! His toenails turned into sparkling diamonds as well, sparkling in the bright sunlight. His dark brown hair followed suit and transformed into a big massive diamond, fastened to his head. It was the same color as his nails, but it was of an organic variation. The pupils in his eyes also turned into diamonds, giving him a very sinister but cool look. His eye balls became Eton blue while the iris turned electric blue. Lastly, four large diamond spikes emerge from his back and shoulders, casting his shredded shirt off his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the entire transformation, Alice, Damian, Tom, Lily, his little sister, and his mother just watched everything in shock and in complete silence. Once it became clear that Allen wasn\u2019t changing anymore, Lily was the first one to speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! Allen! You look so cool! And you\u2019re so BIG!\u201d she said.<br>\r\n\u201cHoly crap! Allen! How did you do THAT?\u201d Damian gasped.<br>\r\n\u201cWell what do you know? Allen\u2019s a mutant!\u201d Alice exclaimed.<br>\r\n\u201cAmazing!\u201d Tom shouted. \u201cLook at my best friend\u2026 and he\u2019s HUGE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only person who wasn\u2019t impressed was Allen\u2019s mother. Somehow, she knew in the back of her mind that her son was a mutant, and that his mutated form would show up on his birthday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Allen\u2019s diamond spikes shrunk back, his nails turned to normal, and his huge muscles receded. Very quickly, Allen\u2019s body reverted back to normal and he dwindled back to his normal size, like nothing happened. Only his shorts and shirt were completely destroyed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen\u2019s mother quickly found out that she needed to buy a whole new wardrobe for her son, now that he had discovered his new mutation abilities. The teen had spent the first few weeks of the summer vacation experimenting with his cool new powers, growing into the large diamond-covered muscle man, and then reverting back to his normal self again. His mom had bought hundreds of Dollars\u2019 worth in clothes, since Allen ended up ripping clothes all over the place! Luckily, she had a great job and she was able to afford it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen also began to experiment what his diamond form can do. So far, he has been able to shoot diamond shards from his hands. He was also able to make blade-like diamond constructs come out from the side of his wrists. He was also able to make claws out of the diamond nails he had in his alternate form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a month or so, his mom found out about Xavier School for Gifted Children. She signed up Allen to go there right away, since this was where all the gifted and talented kids were sent. They had a special program over the summer, and Allen was eager to go there just to check it out. This was a small public school, located just outside of the city, so Allen needed to ride a special bus in order to get there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen walked over to the bus stop with a feeling of excitement flowing through his body. It was a new beginning. It was like his wish was about to come true after all. He was going to embark on that life-long adventure that he had always wanted\u2026</span></div></div>",

He had a 16-year-old brother (Eric) and completely normal parents. His brown hair was kinda long and in his face. He had gone to a dance at his middle school. He was hanging out with his friends. He was sitting right next to one of the speakers playing the music, and that's when it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rested his hand on the side of the speaker and after 2 minutes, he felt a shock. It was like in the winter when you touch a door and feel some static. But it was a lot more than that. The whole speaker went dead, unable to play anything. Zack yelled when he noticed: his whole body glowed! His hair turned blond and spiked itself up. A pulse of electricity went through the whole room and everyone yelled but no one was hurt. When he opened his eyes they were still blue but... now they were glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow everyone was staring at him... then running, scared of him. He moved his hands trying to say it's okay, but every movement he made just sent out more sparks, which only scared them more. He ran out and tried to call his parents, but when he touched his cell phone he felt more static and the battery instantly went from full to dead. He had drained the power from it. The MRD was called and took him away in a rubber vest which blocked out the electricity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis parents went and payed to get him out. They were told he had to be put in a mutant research lab or else stay with the MRD. His parents couldn't even touch him: knowing what he was, it... it made them scared both for him... and of him. He couldn't even ride in the car for fear he might drain the car battery. He overheard his parents talking about sending him away, even when they told him they wouldn't. He cried and felt the tears shock his face... but he tried so hard to make himself think that didn't care, that his parents didn't care about him once they found out what he was. All of his friends were just so scared when they found out. The only person who still seemed to care was his Eric, but he was always hanging out with his friends so he wasn't around much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a few days and his parents hardly spoke to him. After about a week he packed his things and decided to run away. He climbed out his window and left them a note saying he was sorry for being a mutant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only he had been there a little longer; when he overheard his parents talking about sending him away... he only heard little bites of it... he was only half-right.<br>\r\nHis father, Brody, wanted what was best for his children and thought he could find some sort of school for his son. His mother, Emma... she was one of those anti-mutant sort of people; she saw her son as a freak, a freak that she wanted to send him straight back into the MRD. Eventually when the two, along with Eric, saw the note, Brody was outraged; he immediately blamed Emma for Zack's misfortune, and kicked her out of the house. He then called a place that he has heard was built to help people like his son learn more about what he is, what he can do, and whats next in life for him: the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning. He called them and asked them to find his son, tell him all that has happened since his absence, and to accept him as a new student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, on the streets, Zack ran across the last person he'd thought he'd meet: Wolverine. After telling him what Brody needed him to hear, Zack was asked by Wolverine if he wanted \u201can actual life again.\u201d Curious, Zack said \u201cOkay.\u201d The next day, he was walking past the gates of the X-Mansion. He was a little shy being in an entirely different place, with new people in his life. He walked past the Phoenix Memorial Statue, towards the front doors (The front doors lead to the Atrium) and stepped inside...</span></div></div>",

The door to the mansion was not far, but Jason was not a fan of being out in the sun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe melted into the shadow of a tree, letting the darkness cover his body, shrouding him in a deep embrace. He closed his eyes for a moment, completely relaxed. When they opened he was outside the mansion door. He smiled as he grabbed the golden door handle.</span></div></div>",

Out of the corner of his black eyes he saw a woman leading a younger teen out of the room. In front of him a door closed as a burly man entered the room. His muscles bulged out of his clothing and he had a stubbly, unshaven chin. He leaned against the heavy oak desk in the center of the room, were another man was standing.<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou must be Shade,\u201d the strong, but short man started, pulling a cigar out of his jean pocket, \u201cGambit, got a light?\u201d He turned to the taller man next to him, who touched the end of the cigar, causing the end to erupt into flame for a second, before settling down to a calm glow. \u201cThanks, Bub,\u201d the smoker grunted in his gristly voice. \u201cSmoking\u2019s poison,\u201d Jason spat. The smoker chuckled in his deep voice. \u201cYou see mon ami, Wolverine don\u2019t much care for his health concerns,\u201d Gambit laughed as he walked away, twirling his metal Bo staff.<br>\r\n\t\u201cAlright, med student, I\u2019ll show ye to your room,\u201d Wolverine said, billowing clouds of smoke rising from his lips. Jason forced the air out of his nose loudly, keeping the smell of tobacco and rat poison from his lungs. \u201cThis way, Bub,\u201d Wolverine turned and began leading Jason to his room. <br>\r\n\tThe door was wood, dark against the tan wall. Wolverine opened it casually, \u201cBathroom\u2019s down the hall, Kid.\u201d \u201cThanks,\u201d Jason said, walking into his room. Wolverine went to turn on the lights, but Jason pushed his hand away, \u201cBetter like this.\u201d Wolverine met the kid\u2019s eyes and nodded. \u201cThe room is smoke free if I recall correctly,\u201d Jason commented. Wolverine chuckled as he shut the door. \u201cJust let me know if you need anything, \u2018doctorate,\u2019\u201d Jason heard the tough voice through the thick door. <br>\r\n\tIn the darkness of the room, Jason found calm, peace. He walked over to the bed, a pamphlet sat open on it with a schedule taped to the inside page. Jason sat cross legged on the bed, thumbing through it. 8:00 am: Orientation, great, an early start to the day, Jason shook his head, tossing the pamphlet on the floor. Not ready for sleep he put his hands on his crossed knees, closed his eyes and opened his awareness. Meditation was always best at night, when the smooth caress of darkness touched him coolly. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The X-Mansion, located outside of Salem Center, Westchester County, New York; originally called Xavier\u2019s School for Gifted Youngsters, and now called The Jean Grey School for Higher Learning beckoned from just beyond the courtyard. Sarah Juran stepped out of the car and stared in awe at the distant statue dedicated to Jean Grey, erected in the center of the courtyard. Sarah turned and leaned in through the passenger side window. Letting out a deep breath, she said, \u201cThank you for bringing me here Auntie Kate\u201d. Aunt Kate had raised Sarah since Sarah was two years old. Sarah\u2019s father had been a fisherman and he and his wife were both lost at sea off the coast of Maine; during a storm. Aunt Kate was the only family that Sarah had known. Aunt Kate had been dreading this moment ever since Sarah had received the invitation to enroll at The Jean Grey School. Aunt Kate looked up at Sarah, her eyes welling up with tears and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be silly. Are you sure you don\u2019t want me to come in with you and help get you settled?\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019ll be fine\u201d said Sarah. \u201cOkay then I\u2019ll be on my way. Remember call me if you need anything. Call me any time you want. I love you, Sarah\u201d Aunt Kate said, no longer able to hold back her tears. Aunt Kate put the car into drive and slowly drove away. Sarah stood there waving until the car was out of sight. Sarah wiped her eyes with the sleeve of her t-shirt, picked up her bag and started walking towards the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah had been looking forward to this day for weeks now. She was glad to be going to a place where she wouldn\u2019t be considered a freak, a place where she could be herself without being gawked at and without hearing the thoughts of the townies back in Machiasport whenever she walked by them. Sarah was self-confident, strong willed and never backed down from a challenge; she was thrilled to have these powers/abilities awakening in her and couldn\u2019t wait to explore them further. She stopped at the statue of Jean Grey and looked up, smiling she thought about all the possibilities that were about to unfold. Sarah continued to walk towards the mansion. She arrived at the door and with a quick exhale opened it and walked through into a large foyer. The foyer opened up to several rooms. In the room closest to the entrance, Sarah could see a man and a woman engaged in what seemed to be an intense conversation. The sound of Sarah closing the front door to the mansion caused the woman to stop speaking and look over at Sarah. Sarah recognized the woman from a few articles she had seen concerning the X-Men in the local Machiasport newspaper. It was Kitty Pryde, Head Mistress of the Jean Gray School. The man looked over, but Sarah didn\u2019t recognize him. Kitty walked over and smiling offered her hand to Sarah. \u201cHey, you must be Sarah Juran. Welcome! We\u2019ve been expecting you\u201d Kitty said, warmly. \u201cYes, I am Sarah and thanks!\u201d Sarah said, as she shook Kitty\u2019s hand. Kitty turned to the man who had come up behind her and introduced him to Sarah. \u201cRemy I would like you to meet Sarah\u201d, Kitty said. \u201cSarah this is Remy LeBeau, otherwise known as Gambit\u201d, she continued turning toward Sarah. \u201cHey\u201d, Sarah said. \u201cHey yourself\u201d, Gambit returned her greeting. Sarah could feel a slight niggle in her mind as her eyes met Gambit's, but she couldn't seem to read him at all. Kitty turned back to Gambit and said, \u201cWe can continue our talk later, right now I want to get Sarah settled in\u201d. Gambit smiled, turned and walked away without saying anything. \u201cRight then, let me show you your room and then I\u2019ll show you around the place\u201d, Kitty said, as she started walking towards the stairs. Sarah followed Kitty, still thinking about Gambit and how she couldn't quite probe his thoughts, as if there was some kind of interference protecting his mind. The fact that she was able to feel Gambit exert a brief bit of sway over her thoughts bothered her. She would have to work on that, both getting into Gambit's mind and keeping him out of hers. \u201cHmm, my first challenge\u201d, Sarah said to herself as she started up the stairs.</span></div></div>",

If she were back in Maine that sound would encourage her to close her eyes and go back to sleep. However, this was the start of her first full day at the X-Mansion and she wasn\u2019t going to waste a minute. Besides Sarah was a Mainer and a little bit of weather wasn\u2019t going to dampen her spirit. She had plenty of time for a run, shower and breakfast before she had to report for the orientation that was scheduled that morning. Sarah put on her running clothes and headed down the stairs and out the front door. She headed towards the rear of the mansion. She ran past the Olympic-sized pool, basketball court and continued along one of the carriage trails that intertwine around Breakstone Lake. She didn\u2019t see anyone else out and about, but that suited her fine, as she enjoyed the solitude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast Sarah and a few other new students drifted out of the cafeteria and headed for the classroom where their orientation was being held. Sarah found herself walking alongside two boys. \u201cHi\u201d, she said, \u201cI\u2019m Sarah\u201d. The boy on her right said, \u201cHi, I\u2019m Allen and this is Zack\u201d. \u201cHow long have you guys been here?\u201d Sarah asked. \u201cWe both got here yesterday afternoon\u201d, Zack answered, \u201chow about you?\u201d \u201cI got here late yesterday afternoon.\u201d Sarah said. The three of them continued down the hall when suddenly the air around them erupted with the sound of three Bamfs materializing immediately in front of them. The Bamfs were infatuated with Sarah. \u201cWhoa, what do we have here!\u201d the closest Bamf said, lewdly. Another one of the Bamfs chortled, \u201cI love the arrival of newbies. This one can give Kitty a ride for her money. I think I\u2019m in love.\u201d The third little blue creature reached out and grabbed the hat Sarah had on her head and then \u201cBamf\u201d he was gone. The other two Bamfs were laughing hysterically. It all happened so fast the three new students were dumbfounded. A small group of students stopped to watch the antics of the Bamfs, when Wolverine came charging through yelling furiously, \u201cDamn you Beast for opening that portal letting these little blue buggers in!\u201d At the sight of Wolverine bearing down on them the remaining two Bamfs disappeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell just happened?\u201d Sarah said to Allen and Zack. \u201cI have no idea!\u201d they both said simultaneously. \u201cI have a feeling we\u2019ll find out at orientation,\u201d Allen said, as they entered the classroom. Standing at the front of the classroom was Kitty Pryde, Wolverine, Storm and Iceman. \u201cEverybody grab a seat and let\u2019s get started\u201d, Wolverine rumbled. As everyone grabbed a seat and then quieted down, Krakoa, taking the form of a tree, tapped frantically on the window with one of its limbs. \u201cAh, guys I hate to interrupt, but I think you need to get out here now!\u201d he boomed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was the infamous Cyclops from the Phoenix Five vs Avengers.  The very man that now lead the Brotherhood of Mutants.  He was accompanied by a man that was about his height with black hair.  The man's eyes were blue with his hair neck long and in the form of hundreds of bangs.  He wore a quiver on his back with several arrows inside.  He carried a bow in his right hand and walked in only a pair of black pants.  Beside the man walked a Grizzly bear that was a male judged by it's size and weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolverine growled as he ran outside with Ice Man behind him.  Storm said to the students, \"Please, remain calm.  I'd like you to follow the teachers to safe locations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolverine had his claws slide out as he made a pair of fists.  Ice Man iced up as he saw Cyclops and was prepared to take on his former friend, now enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyclops said to the man beside him, \"Brother Bear, you and Bear Claw take Wolverine.  Your powers plus number will give you better odds against him.  I'll take Bobby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrother Bear nodded as his eyes became sharper like his bear's eyes.  He grabbed an arrow with a special arrow head on top.  He knotched the arrow as he took aim as Bear Claw ran into battle.  Wolverine charged as his short stature leaped into the air to meet the bear.  An arrow wizzed by his head that had a small speaker on it.  The arrow's speaker pinged as Wolverine roared having his ears hurt and falling to the ground.  Bear Claw swiped at him smacking him to the left.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrother Bear said to Wolverine as he took another arrow, \"Not only am I an expert marksman, but my mutation of taking on traits of animals that I've tamed allows me to be just as dangerous as any wild animal.  Bear Claw hug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBear Claw rose up as it roared and 'hugged' Wolverine as it then heard it's master tell it to release.  Wolverine shook his head and tried to attack, but was hit by another arrow.  This arrow's head broke upon impact and had a foam that hit some of Wolverine's chest and feet.  His shoes were cemented to the ground soon enough thanks to the foam drying up into a cement like substance.  His chest was strained of breathing as he looked and saw Bear Claw smack him out of his place.  Wolverine flew back as he slid on the ground the concrete broken off of him into pieces. </span></div></div>",

Possibly help end this madness, she had to do something.  She began to go out as she thought cast an image of herself still going with the other students.  As she got outside she saw that Cyclops was blasting at Ice Man as the latter threw up ice shields and tossed ice orbs at Cyclops.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mutant that was challenging Wolverine was playing with him.  He shot arrows at Wolverine as the bear hugged and smacked the mutant around.  Sarah was about to attack when a hand tapped her shoulder.  She turned to see Allen and his blue hair still pulled back.  He smiled at her as he said with glowing blue eyes, \"You didn't think you were going to leave us out of this, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah saw Zack walk up as he smiled at her wit his blonde bangs were in the way of his eyes.  His green t-shirt had a yellow ring on the front.  His shorts were baggy with several cargo pockets with a pair of flip flops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack said to Sarah as his cocky nature flared up, \u201cTime to get my beach on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah asked Allen so she could know what powers she'd be working with, \u201cSo, what can you do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen move his hands into open plams showing blue electricity appearing in his right hand, blue stone on his right foot, blue fire on his left foot and blue tinted glowing wind in his left hand.  His elements really matched his blue button up short sleeve shirt.  Allen said as his brows rose to his comment, \u201cTo create blue elements in small amounts.  I have a definite range though with my attacks before they go wild on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack said to Sarah as his skin turned pink while he took off his wig, \u201cI become the most terrifying sea monster in the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack's legs fused together as ten tentacles sprouted from his feet.  A shell began to develop under his feet as he now stood on a clam shell.  The back of his shirt had a hole in it where his skin grew out and had a top shell grow from it.  By the end of his transformation he looked like a were clam.  He grinned saying to her as he made a fist with his right hand, \u201cLike I said before, let's get our beach on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiled as she had her Psychokinesis float her into the air.  She flew in as Allen ran behind her wit his blue wind feet.  He flew into the air as his hands had blue fire appear.  He flew in at the mutant that fought with the bear.  Punching the mutant's jaw the archer mutant flew into the air as he hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack's shell moved driving up a dust storm.  He closed his shell as Cyclops laser hit the shell.The laser dug into the shell, but barely made a dent.  A small opening was soon made as the shell opened just the tiniest bit.  Two tentacles flew out as they wrapped around Cyclops's ankles.  Cyclops looked down as he was pulled and flew up into the air.  His laser was off course as it flew wildly and was soon shut off as Cyclops didn't want to hurt his comrade.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah flew at the bear as she thought casted a elephant in front of it.  The giant illusion made the animal pull back as Wolverine slashed off one of it's arms.  The bear roared as it hit the ground bled out with squirts here and there.</span></div></div>",

His hands became claw like and his height was grown by a few inches.  He roared as he leaped at Allen slapping him across the face.  Allen flew back as he had long gashes on his cheek now.  Allen impacted into the ground as his head drove into the grass kicking it up.  His eyes partially closed as he tried to stay awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolverine said to Sarah with battle lust still fueling him, \u201cGet your boyfriend and get to safety.

He then put his hands together and said to Cyclops, \u201cI've got you now Scott!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA beam of ice flew at the ex-friend as the target tried to move out of the way.  His left side was hit as he was frozen in place.  Magik appeared from a flash of light as she pulled out his magic sword.  She then heard Cyclops say to her, \u201cWe need an out, get Bear Claw first.  He need medical attention.\u201d<br>\r\nCyclops fired his laser at Iceman who threw up a shield to block the attack.  The ice shattered from impact with the laser but still absorbed enough to not hurt Iceman.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagik transported Bear Claw and Cyclops as she moved towards Wolverine and Brother Bear.  Brother Bear slashed Wolverine's midsection as Wolverine slashed at Brother Bear.  Brother Bear ducked under the arms as he moved to Wolverine's neck biting down on the throat.  Wolverine choked as he felt the pain crushing his wind pipe.  His eyes rolled to the back of his head as then kneed Brother Bear in the groin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrother Bear released his bite with pain coarsing through him.  His mouth was full of blood as he hit the ground.  He was swallowed by Magik's energy Magik soon vanished herself leaving the campus with the destruction that her team had left from the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolverine stood up as he coughed out some blood as his throat healed up.  His claws retracted as he walked towards Sarah and Allen.  He looked at Zack as he shifted back to his human form.  He said pointing at Sarah and her new friend, \u201cWhat the hell were you kids thinking?  You could have been killed or worse!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack walked over as he put on his wig to hide his bald head.  His skin became dry as he had red skin from dehydration.  Iceman gave him an ice cube as the boy put it in his mouth.  Wolverine looked at the kids as he then said giving up with a sigh, \u201cWell aside the fact that you guys broke a few rules.  I'd say you guys were pretty good at using some of your powers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIceman said with a humorous smile, \u201cWow, that's a compliment, and coming from Logan of all people.  You kids should feel lucky.  This is a momentous occasion for you kids.  But, I have to agree, don't do anything like that again.  It could be fatal for you next time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three students smiled as they felt proud of their little battle.  Sarah felt her blood coarse through her as she couldn't believe how adrenaline rushing that fight was.

As she opened them she could see that it was night and she was at the beach with the waves washing over her legs. She slowly sat up and looked down at herself. The first thing that she noticed was that she was naked. She wondered how she came to be naked on the beach but couldn't remember a thing. However when she looked at her crotch she had this eerie feeling that there had been something different there before. She shook her head deciding not to dwell on that feeling. \"I'd better get some clothes before someone sees me,\" she said looking around. She thought that a bikini would be appropriate for the beach. Suddenly a bikini appeared on her body. She looked at it with wide eyes. It looked and felt like a real bikini but she knew that it was an illusion. \"Did I do that?\" she asked herself. As an experiment she thought about wearing a dress and just like that she was wearing what appeared to be a dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few days she wandered around testing out her new power. She found that other people could experience her illusions and she could limit who could experience them. She had a bit of fun with a guy who was cheating on his wife. On one of the days she sensed something weird nearby. Going over she couldn't see anything but she knew there was something there. She knew she should be cautious but she just walked right to the spot and she suddenly found herself in the air and falling. She was quite a ways up and as she fell she saw that she was going to land on a wrought iron fence. \"Way to go Emma,\" she berated herself before landing on the fence with one of the spikes piercing her heart. As darkness took her she heard several horrified screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly started coming back to consciousness and the first thing she thought was that she wasn't dead but should be. She slowly opened her eyes and saw a blurred figure. As her vision cleared she saw that it was...</span></div></div>",

She wore a pair of jean daisy dukes and a flowy tank top that is yellow and red striped. A pair of cloth flowers are on the back of the tank top by the spaghetti straps. The tank top had a name tag that read Courtney Hara.  A line was visible on her midriff that was the line to a flesh pouch.  Sticking out of the pouch was a baby human.  It was only a few weeks to a couple of months old with the same tanned skin as it's assumed mother.  Only it had tuffs of brown hair while it's eyes were closed.  The baby's head was a few times smaller than the average human baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe baby yawned as it crawled up with it's two hands.  It pulled it's upper half of the body under her shirt where it began to feed.  Courtney seemed slightly uncomfortable with this, but she was getting used to it.  Her powers had always been odd to her.  On her 17th birthday her powers had manifested in the form of enhanced climbing and enhanced leaping.  She also had enhanced senses and healed faster from a bruise from her abusive brother.  But, when she had sex with her boyfriend who looked at her with acceptance, she got pregnant.  About three weeks later she had developed a bulge like pouch on her midriff.  She had discovered at she had a baby human now that treated her like a kangaroo.  That's when Courtney truly realized her situation and told her ex-boyfriend.  Who ran out on her on their son because he wasn't ready to be a dad.  Not wanting to live in a house with absent minded parents and an abusive brother, she had to make a choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney had limited options left to her as she then decided to call the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning.  She packed up after a talk with Ms. Pryde and got onto a greyhound bus.  When she got to Salem Center she called a cab to get to the school.  Where she'd be taught proper use of her powers and hopefully to live at.  She opened the door as the cabbie said to her expecting his fare, \"That'll be $67.85.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid someone pay the fare for her or does she pay it?</span></div></div>",
