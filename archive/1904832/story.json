I squinted to see if I could spot a exit. Failing, I extended my arms and felt my surroundings. I grabbed the side of a table and let it lead me until I spotted the red glow of a exit sign. I quietly questioned what was happening. I couldn't remember how I got where I was, or why. I needed to concentrate on getting out of the building before I suffocated more than anything else right now. I reached the door and pushed it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The bright sun blinded me as I stepped outside. I shielded my eyes with a bloody hand as a light breeze blew on my face. The fire department of Contel county were screaming and running towards me with a stretcher. I turned around to see my family business. flames were coming out of every window, an intense heat was emanating. I slowly fell to my knees as the emergency crew reached me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"His vitals look okay, Sheriff McCoy,\" I faintly heard a high pitched voice say. I gradually opened my eyes to the sight of a nurse standing over me on one side, and Sheriff McCoy on the other. His white hair and mustache matched the faded white of the walls, and his dull brown eyes were staring into mine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Welcome back, son,\" he said in a strong southern accent. I tried to sit up, but failed as cords painfully pulled me back. They were attached to every part of my body. I sighed, hoping someone would tell me what the hell was going on. I glanced over to the chair next to me, expecting to see the blond hair of my mother.Surprisingly , she wasn't there. The sheriff noticed my confused looked and explained. \"Your mothers missin'. I've sent every man I have, we'll find her, son. Get some rest now,\" he nodded his head, a grave expression rested on his face. My heart dropped, or my BPM went up, according to the machine. The nurse grabbed my hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Calm down, Sam.\" she said, patting my arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Calm down, you expect me to calm down?\" I yelled before thinking. \"What the hell is going on?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She sighed, \"I'm sorry, Sam, I'll explain later.\" I felt a sharp pain in my thigh, then everything went black.

Cameron, after awkwardly waiting for a few seconds, regretted her decision. She waited a while longer, and then said, \"Hello, Sam, are you there? Samuel,\" she desperately cried for an answer. No answer. <br>\r\n     \"You can't be serious,\" Her surprised boyfriend finally laughed. Exactly what she was afriad of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Of course I'm serious!\" She screamed, then cringed, afraid that she had woke her sleeping parents.

Cameron placed the bowl of popcorn on the oak coffee table and stood. The room was poorly lite, the only light coming from the muted T.V, and Cameron felt around for the staircase. She ran to her room, finally gathering the idea to use her phone as a dim flashlight. As she reached the double doors, she heard a voice calling her name. She had completely forgot her boyfriend was still waiting on the phone. She closed the doors as held the phone to her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"I'm coming with you,\" Cameron stated, removing her night clothes and replacing them with a blouse, a black leather jacket, dark blue jeans and black high heels. She peered to the full  length mirror. She grabbed a comb and combed her golden hair as close to perfect as she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Cam, I can't,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"It's not your choice, Sam.\" she cut in, somewhat rudely. \"I just have to find a way to tell my parents...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So what should I say.\" She ignored his protest and pulled out a blue ball-point pen and a peace of notebook paper. \"Hello,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't know, I'll be over in ten minutes...\" he sighed as his voice slowly faded and the buzz of nothing on the other line forced her to hang up the phone. \"Okay,\" she thought to herself. \"What should I write?\" She finally got it! She started to write and explains her decision. In the letter, she writes thats she needed to see the real world and not be supported by her parents money. It really was true. Cameron has always felt bad for the kids in her school who are \"less fortunate\" than her. She re-read the paper time after time, perfecting every last word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Dear mom and dad,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel terrible for having so much money, when other's have nothing.

Goodbye,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cameron sighed as she hung the note on the refrigerator door. She felt a tear roll down her eye, knowing this could be the last time she saw this place, saw her family. \"Goodbye,\" she said while kissing her eight year old brothers head, and slowly made the descent down the stairs to the garage, where Samuel always picks her up. She sat on the bench until the lights of her boyfriends new truck cut through the snow. She sauntered to his truck,momentarily glancing  to the giant house she had called home for seventeen years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 She lifted herself into the vehicle and asked where they were going. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
