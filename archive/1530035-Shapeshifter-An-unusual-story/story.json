Unfortunately, it just seems to roll off him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop joking around,\" says Quincy. \"This is serious.\" There's a worried tone in his voice, and he is quite pale; you're relieved that he seems as vexed as you. He peers at you closely. \"I think we should get you to a doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words are like a slap in the face. \"I'm not going to tell anyone about this,\" you retort. You glare at Jeremy. \"I'm kinda sorry I told you guys about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you don't know if this is, like, a stable condition or something,\" Quincy protests. \"What if you start melting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll go see a doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I touch them again?\" Jeremy asks. You swing around to gape at him, and he points at your globe-like breasts. \"They are ... magnificent!\" There is an ache in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pervert!\" You slap him, and much to your dismay find yourself haughtily tilting your chin, just like\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou catch sight of your reflection in Quincy's bedroom mirror, and bemusedly note that the expression is perfect. Maybe it shouldn't be a surprise: It is Elisabeth Winninger's face and body you're wearing, and you are giving Jeremy the exact same look she gave Karl Anderson the time he asked her, in the middle of biology class, if he could give her a \"pussyectomy\" and keep the excised body parts to masturbate with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh heavily through your nose, and close your eyes and concentrate. You're glad that your nerves go dead when you do this; it would probably hurt like fuck if you could feel it as your face and body and clothes shifted form. You start to turn back into yourself, but then wryly change your mind at the last minute, and shift into the form that got you into your present predicament. \"If you wanna touch my breasts now, go ahead,\" you say in Joe Purdell's dull, nasty, nasally voice. \"You can suck my cock while you're at it.\" Jeremy winces and gives you a dirty look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor his part, Quincy shudders. \"Why would you ever turn yourself into him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just to fuck around with him and the rest of that bunch,\" you shrug. \"How was I supposed to know they were gonna try robbing a liquor store the night I decided to punk 'em?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At any rate, the whole business seems to have started that afternoon on the school bus, with him slapping you on the back of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Quit it, asshole,\" you'd shouted. But he'd just smirked when you'd turned around to glare at him. As well he might. He's a corn-fed, beef-stuffed, farm-bred behemoth: six-feet-and-four-inches of fat and muscle, most of it between his ears. Ugly, too, but he's strong and he's on the football team, so the girls flutter around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis friend Kenny sniggered. \"Whyncha kick his ass?\" he'd said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not worth the trouble,\" Joe had sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't talking to you, dipshit,\" Kenny had retorted. He'd held your eye, and jerked his head toward Joe. \"Why don't you kick his ass, Barron?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd stared back evenly. \"I would, but I don't want to make him look bad in front of his boyfriends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenny's eyes froze. \"What was that, smartmouth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom another seat Ivan Budnik guffawed. \"You heard him. He called you a homo, bro. What are you gonna do about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too late to back down, so you'd decided you might as well escalate matters. \"I called you a homo too, Budnik. Boyfriendzzzz. 'Cept you're so ugly, Igor, I doubt even a queen like Purdell could get it up long enough to give you a good fuck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was all over, you'd reflected that Budnik might have kept his temper if only you hadn't used that nickname he hates so much. As it was, only your very quick reflexes saved your face from being smashed open by the meaty fist Budnik threw your way without warning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there had been a lot of cursing and shouting, and screaming from the girls when the driver slammed the bus to a stop and came charging down the aisle. By that time you were on the floor near the back, and quietly used the emergency exit to slip off the bus. It was only half a kilometer across some open fields to your house, and you'd actually felt pretty good as you trudged along. There might be hell to pay tomorrow, but you'd be on your feet then instead of trapped in a bus seat, and your martial arts training could probably see you through the worst of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an unseasonably warm day for early March, but it had been unseasonably warm all week long. The weather was so nice you'd soon stopped keeping an eye out for cow shit and just let your mind drift lazily along. You knew these fields well\u2014they belonged to the nearby agricultural college, but no one had ever stopped you from crossing them\u2014and your curiosity was mildly piqued to see some new machinery near a spot your path would take you. It appeared to be a couple of trucks with some pumps on the back, clanking quietly away. You'd watched them with some slight curiosity as you approached, but they seemed to have been quietly abandoned, to work without supervision, and you'd soon lost interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure why Budnik and his friends seemed to have it in for you. It's not like you were a real rival for any of them, in any arena. On the one hand, you were tall enough and strong enough and athletic enough that you couldn't be classified with weak prey like the guys who played chess every afternoon in the library. At the same time, you weren't tall enough for the basketball team or fast enough for the soccer team or big enough for the football team, so you weren't a rival on the field. You had had a few girlfriends in your time, but they had girls of their own, so you doubted there was any romantic jealousy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I think it is sexual jealousy,\" your friend Quincy had said one day when you'd broached the subject with him. (He was receptive to complaints about Budnik and his crowd; \"Queenie,\" they liked to call him.) \"You're pretty good looking, and with your shirt off ...\" He'd suddenly stopped short, and turned very red. \"Anyway, I bet there's a lot of girls they like who've talked about how cute you are,\" he'd said in a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd ignored his discomfiture, and just glanced at yourself in the bedroom mirror: short, messy brown hair; sky blue eyes; well-defined lips and chin. Yeah, you were good looking. As for the \"shirtless\" remark ... Yes, you were nicely toned, though not absurdly buffed. Actually, you'd often wondered what you'd look like if you did some serious weight training, just as you'd wondered what you'd look like with a goatee, or with longer, shoulder-length hair. But it hardly seemed worth worrying about. It would take a long time to get results like those, and if you didn't like them you'd either be stuck with them or have to get rid of them and return to scratch. Not for the first time, you'd reflected on the sad fact that you can't \"hack\" and alter your physical appearance like you can in some of your games\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of your games waiting for you at home had cheered you up, and pulled your thoughts away from Budnik and on the fight on the bus. Yeah, maybe you'd start up a new game of Call of Duty 5. You were tired of your old character, and you'd started thinking about how to design a new one. You'd snickered at the thought that maybe for the new game you'd play a girl, and then actually gotten excited by the thought. Yeah, a new character would be good ... it would be fun designing a new one ... you might not even get to the game itself before supper ... you wished the choices in the game were a little more fine-grained, so that you could tweak things exactly as you wished. Your heart was pumping away with excitement and anticipation as you went, and your feet felt very light on the ground\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then suddenly there was no ground for your feet to lightly touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWherever you were, it was cold and black and thick, and even your thoughts seemed slow and smothered. Muzzily, you'd wondered where you'd got to, and how you'd got there; and it was only after you'd realized that you couldn't feel air and hadn't felt air for quite a long time that you'd begun to panic. You'd tried taking a breath, but nothing had happened, and the horrible thought \"I'm going to suffocate\" formed in your head. It had been followed by the even more horrible thought \"I've already suffocated, and now I'm dead,\" and for some time you could only stare into inky blackness with a feeling of stark horror<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the strange thing is, a person can contemplate the \"fact\" of his or her own death for only so long before getting bored. You have such a short attention span that it actually wasn't long before you'd muttered \"Fuck this\" and decided to try finding a way out of whatever you'd gotten yourself into. It was hard work, but you'd fought your way through what felt like sludge, and then felt yourself breaking through what felt like a surface, and with a sense of vast relief you'd pulled yourself onto long, bristly grass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was much closer to the horizon\u2014it was very late afternoon by this point\u2014and in the slanting light you'd seen you were about fifty yards from the trucks you'd glimpsed earlier. You looked around, and saw that you must have fallen into some kind of pit of quicksand. But the stuff was black, like tar, and thick, and when you'd reached out to touch it, you'd seen that your own hands and arms\u2014and everything else, it looked like\u2014was completely coated in the stuff. With a silent groan, you'd heaved yourself to your feet and set off again for your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell happened to you?\" Helen had said as you'd walked up to the front door. Your sister had been in the front yard, digging in the flower beds, and stared at you in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to talk about it,\" you'd grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom'll kill you if you track that shit inside the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom'll kill you if she hears you cussing like a whore,\" you'd retorted. Helen was two years older than you, but still lived at home, and your mother insisted on certain standards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, stay there and I'll get the garden hose,\" she replied. Mutely, you'd stopped and stood patiently, like a whipped dog, as she unreeled the hose and fiddled with the nozzle and turned the faucet on. A jet of water shot into your mouth, and you'd forgotten your early caution and blistered the early evening air with several Anglo-Saxon obscenities; Helen had ignored you and just kept spraying you with water. Then she'd lowered the nozzle and frowned. \"It's not coming off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll just scrub it off in the shower,\" you'd said, and brushed past her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll clog the drain,\" she'd said, and reached out to grab you. \"Ouch! Shit!\" she'd exclaimed, and pulled her hand back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That stuff!\" She peered at you. \"Doesn't it hurt?\" You shrugged and shook your head. \"Well, it stings and burns when I touch it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So don't touch it. Just leave me the fuck alone.\" And with that, you'd passed into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, the stuff didn't come off in the shower, no matter how you pulled and scrubbed at it. But it did change color and texture. It started off black and sludgy, but then turned an off-white color, and eventually took on a fleshy tone; it also thickened and hardened, becoming rubbery, before softening and taking on fleshy feeling. Beneath this \"skin\" you could feel something like bones and tendons and even a tracery of veins. You were puzzled, and even a little alarmed by this, and wondered if the stuff had seeped like poison through your skin. But that alarm was as nothing when you'd glanced down and seen your masculine pectorals suddenly begin to droop and form into globe-like breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd gasped and grabbed them, out of a sudden and maybe not irrational fear that they were about to fall off, and were startled by how soft and sensitive they were. Gently you'd cradled them, and gently you'd felt the nipples harden as you'd delicately touched them. You'd stood like that in a daze for some time, until your own stroking and the hot running water set off a vibration lower down. It didn't feel like an erection, though, which is what you would have expected to happen. So it was with a sense of dread that you'd slowly let your right hand slide down a soft stomach to a patch of tightly curled pubic hair\u2014and to the slit between your legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point you'd carefully shut off the water and pulled back the shower curtain and stepped from the tub and looked in the mirror. It was Helen's face that stared back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd swallowed and made sure the door was locked, and then you'd pulled down a towel and very carefully dried yourself off. There was no doubt that you were now your sister's twin. It wasn't just the large breasts and the pussy and the hips. It was the mole on your left forearm and the light blue eyes and the long brown hair (still damp and tousled). You'd lightly touched your new lips and your throat and murmured \"Oh my God,\" and recognized her voice coming out of your mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were voices coming from downstairs by this point, and footsteps on the stairs, and Davey, your eight-year-old brother, bawled out that it was time for supper. You'd grunted something in what you'd hoped was a deep, masculine voice, and when he was gone you'd snuck into Helen's bedroom. You wanted clothes, and since you now had her body it seemed only logical that you should grab some of her things. You were digging quietly through her closet, trying to figure out if you should take a frock or a skirt and blouse or shorts and a t-shirt, when with a gasp you'd felt something ripple over your torso. You'd looked down, and found that you were now wearing one of her blue dresses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA check in the mirror confirmed it wasn't your imagination. And a glance told you that that very dress was still hanging in her closet. You'd looked back in the mirror and concentrated with a frown, and watched as the dress turned red. You concentrated again: the dress seemed to split and to flow, turning into a halter top and a pair of cutoffs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour nostrils had flared as you gazed excitedly at yourself. This. Was. Cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you'd felt even better after you'd returned to your own room and found that, with a little more concentration, you could turn yourself back into Max Barron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now that you have a better of idea of what is going on, perhaps you should hit the \"back\" button on your browser, and pick one of the other choices.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now that you have become a sexy girl, you want to try life as a girl. So you wonder if the shapeshifting powers that allowed you to turn into this girl would also allow you to change your clothes, since your loose male t-shirt starts to look like a nightgown with your 36EE breasts pushing it up. And your shorts are way too loose in the crotch area now, so that\u2019ll have to change too. Plus, your formerly fitting shoes are now too large to fit your feet properly. So you start visualizing a makeover, starting at the feet. <br>\r\nWithin seconds you feel a pleasant tingling on your feet. You watch and see a layer of black forming on your feet, slowly enveloping your feet and travelling upwards. It has only just covered your feet (turning into socks) when the feeling starts again at the bottom of your foot. When you take a look you notice that soles are forming on your feet, slowly spreading out. As soon as the socks have reached up to your knee, you notice that the soles start to spread onto your feet, but the parts that flow onto your feet are black in color, and turn into leather while enveloping your foot. As soon as your feet are enveloped, you notice that the black leather liquid flows up your leg, stopping just a centimeter short of your knee. Before they harden, the heels grow into two stiletto high heels, pushing your heels up until your foot is angled about 65\u00b0 downwards. They then harden, turning into smooth, skintight black leather boots. Those were just the boots that you imagined when thinking about the perfect outfit, so you wonder what will happen next. <br>\r\nFrom underneath the boot shafts comes a bluish fluid, that wraps itself around your leg, and you watch it crawl upwards where it forms itself into a comfortable pair of jeans. When you take a look underneath the jeans, you notice the last bits of a white liquid shaping itself in the shape of some underpants. As they harden, you find that they feel just like regular underpants, just silkier. You decide you like that feeling.<br>\r\nAs you still admire your new body and clothes, a new blob of white emerges from the underpants and moves towards your chest. As it crawls onto your breasts, you feel a very pleasant tingle you\u2019ve never felt before, and it makes you gasp for breath. It then shapes itself into two cups, with bands between them to hold them in place. You notice right away that it\u2019s a bra, as you saw all three of your teenage sisters wearing them (although your youngest sister Christine secretly tries them on when she thinks no-one\u2019s looking) and the oldest of your two little brothers sometimes steals one and wears it on his head whenever he turns into \u201cCaptain Doo doo\u201d (don\u2019t ask). As soon as the blob/bra is in place, it hardens and then softens into a silky bra, which pushes your breasts up and holds them in place. From the bra then flows a new blob that forms itself into a tight-fitting tank top. With a final tingle the change is complete, and you look like a complete knockout. With one last after-tingle, an iPhone appears in your pocket. You check it and see that several of the hottest and most popular boys and girls in school are in your phone book. \u201cYes!\u201d, you think, \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for this for my entire life!\u201d<br>\r\nWhat do you do now?<br>\r\n1.\tCall a hot boy and experiment<br>\r\n2.\tCall a hot girl and chat<br>\r\n3.\tGo walk around the neighborhood<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You have been unhappy with the fact that you can't change your body. Not that you're ugly, not at all. You've got short, messy brown hair, and your eyes are sky blue. You're an average Joe, with a length of 1.80 meters you are pretty tall, and you weigh 75 Kg. Combined with your toned body from years of Kung Fu, that makes you a healthy boy. The one thing you hate though, is that you aren't free to experiment, to live life as someone else, to see how a goatee would look on your chin without letting the hair grow for months. You pretty much hate the fact that you can't hack life. Or can you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFamily:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Davy: your 8-year old brother. He's cute, and gets along with you very well. Although sometimes he annoys you by sneaking into your room and changing your signature to something girly, you love him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Kara: your 12-year old sister. She's already quite handsome, and likes to experiment with clothing a lot. She just left the Birckenstock phase, and is now experimenting with kneehigh, skintight leather boots with a basic heel. So far she seems to like it, though there's no telling what she'll like next month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen: your 18-year old sister. She likes you most of the time, but isn't always easy to live with. Likes to dress sexy, with a lot of (mini)skirts, high heeled boots and tops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill: Your mother, she's 40 years old and a real optimist, always seeing the silver lining on the dark stormclouds. She's a work-at-home interior designer and housewife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt: your father, he's 45 years old. He works in the Marine Corps Base Quantico (information found here: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Corps_Base_Quantico\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Corps_Base_Quantico</a>) as a trainer for the young, soon-to-be Marine officers, after being in the field himself for over 20 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther people:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Elisabeth Winninger: a popular 16-year old girl, with long, brown hair and large,  C-cup breasts. She's slim and hot, and she knows it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Joe Purdell: one of the school bullies. He's a corn-fed, beef-stuffed, farm-bred behemoth: six-feet-and-four-inches of fat and muscle, most of it between his ears. Ugly, too, but he's strong and he's on the football team, so the girls flutter around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Karl Anderson: a creepy, nerdy boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Quincy Brown: An unusually silent boy at first, he changed much after you befriended him in your freshman year. He used to be very meek, a true 'turn-the-other-cheek'-person until you and Jeremy managed to convince him to join your Kung Fu group. He quickly became an adept at it, and now rivals you and Jeremy in skill despite you both having been on the group for almost six times longer than him. Like Jeremy, he's a true friend that would go through fire for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Jeremy Timber: your other best friend. Jeremy was the one who got you into Kung Fu, and you're still grateful for that. A little bit perverted and very crazy, he's a very likable person, quick to make friends everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOTICE:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI want everybody to write good chapters, ten sentences at the very, very least. If you write chapters like \"You turn into Elisabeth Winninger. You feel good. What do you do now?\" I will delete the chapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel free to add characters as the story progresses, but NO new powers. Try to go easy on adding new family members as well, the parents are no baby-making machines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun!</td>",
