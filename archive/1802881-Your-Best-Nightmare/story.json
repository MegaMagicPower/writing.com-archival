            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>8:15. Greg was late. This wasn't a surprise to you, but this just meant more time for you to lay silently on your bed in helpless trepidation. You had rehearsed everything that you would say and do, and envisioned every possible outcome. And even then, no matter how well you knew Greg, you simply couldn't imagine what his actual reaction would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, a knock at your door. Your heart began racing, and tentatively you crawled out of bed and made your way to greet your guest. Sure enough, standing before you was your best friend since high school. Greg gave a curt nod and walked in, plopping himself down on the chair by your desk. \"So what's up?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed the door and sit on your bed directly across from him. You were lucky enough to have a single dorm room all to yourself. For this event you needed to be sure that no one else could see what you were about to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's something about me you should know,\" you began. A wry smile cracked across your face. Those were the exact same words you began with when you came out to Greg as bi in sophomore year. But this was different. Way different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Greg had absentmindedly grabbed a water bottle from your desk and was tossing it back and forth between his hands. You knew that it would be faster to show him first before explaining. \"Promise me you won't freak out,\" you muttered, and without waiting for his response you took a deep breath and focused. Greg jumped in his seat just as you felt yourself become lighter. And then the transformation was complete. You were nothing but a fine white mist floating above the bed where you were sitting. You stayed this way for at least a minute, flying all around the room as Greg looked on in shock. It had to be this way to reduce the chances of him trying to write it off as some sort of trick. When you finally decided he had spent enough time in your mist form you reverted back to your normal appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" you began to explain, \"I knew that would never believe me unless I actually did something, but what I am about to say is the truth, I swear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay,\" Greg stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I'm human. Well, I guess that much is for sure. I've been looking things up and the closest thing that fits my description is some cross between an incubus and demon or a vampire and an alp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know what an incubus is. What's an alp?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's kind of like an incubus. It's what you just saw. I read that they can turn into mist and crawl into people's mouths while they sleep, except they do that to give people nightmares. When I get inside someone I can actually take over their body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I know, you've always been telling me that I've been sleeping around way too much, but ever since middle school- I'm pretty sure that's when I... Awoke- I find that if I don't have sex for awhile I start to get really sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, is that part actually true?\" Greg interrupted with a slight smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious! If I don't bang someone then I'll die!\" Suddenly all tension in the room broke and the two of us burst into a fit of laughter at how ridiculous that sounded, even if it was indeed true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry dude, this is a lot to take in all at once,\" Greg said after the laughter had died down. You nodded. It certainly would be an odd situation for anyone. \"I guess just give it time for it to sink in,\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that the two of you hugged and Greg left your room. A sigh of relief escaped your lips. You had just lifted a heavy burden off of your chest by revealing your true identity to someone. Not even your family seemed to be aware of your abilities. And Greg's reaction could definitely be described as positive, so you knew this wouldn't change your friendship at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now 8:30. You ran through your agenda in your head and deduced that you had done all of your homework, at least whatever was due tomorrow anyway. Tonight was a free night. It was then that you remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt has been a week since your last \"meal.\" Now that you knew what your evening was going to consist of, it's just a matter of deciding how to carry it out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You always thought the idea of possessing people was fun, even if it was a risky endeavor.. It was certainly a treat whenever you decided to hop around from body to body and jack off in each one, leading to nearly a dozen orgasms per hour. But while such an act did provide sustenance, it was too little truly satisfy your need. You would have to have sex in someone else's body to truly hit the jackpot, which was no easy task. Nevertheless, you decided to take a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight came. It was time to head out. As you left Kruger Hall the night air made you shiver a little. There was still plenty of people roaming the campus; it's always like this in the city of Carina. After a 5-minute walk you arrived at your destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKappa Sigma. The fraternity that partied pretty much every single night. This would be the place where you would have the best chance. Quickly you crept around to the back of the house. Under the cover of darkness, no one saw you transform into mist and seep through an open window into the din of chatter and loud music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was fortunate that the walls and ceilings were painted white. You blended in perfectly as you floated against the ceiling, and no one would look up anyway. Now it was just a matter of waiting. There were people everywhere with red cups. Some were just talking casually while others were shouting and running around and even hooking up in plain sight. A rhythmic thump could be heard from upstairs. At least the atmosphere was right for what you were about to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloating out of the room you were in, you went upstairs and roamed the halls a little. You seeped into one room and found a guy and a girl going at it. You had several more encounters, but no such luck finding a body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was when you went back downstairs that you saw your opportunity. A rather stocky guy with brown crew cut hair was stumbling about when he suddenly collapsed on the floor. \"Someone get Kyle on the couch,\" a voice came from nearby. Two of the partiers obediently lifted up the unconscious man and placed him on the brown leather couch in the corner of the room. Then everyone else went back to their business as if nothing had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing out from alcohol was just the same as being asleep, so you seized your chance by slowly floating over to Kyle. No one was paying attention to him at all. When you were absolutely sure that no one was looking in your direction, you dived down right into Kyle's open mouth. The first thing you felt was warmth, Kyle's flesh wrapped all around you. Then, as you gained control, you found that you once more had a corporeal form, although it was a borrowed one, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buzz of alcohol washed over you and you felt that your entire face was red. It was time for the next step. With a smile on your face you sat up in the couch and looked around. Meanwhile, your hand reached underneath your white shirt as you fondled a solid pair of abs with a thin trail of hair running down the middle crevice. You always thought it was cool to be in a body with a happy trail since you yourself lacked one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle's memories began to filter through and you almost laughed out loud when it was revealed to you that this beefcake has been confused and frustrated about his sexuality for quite some time. Throughout the night he had been checking out the girls, but he had also been discreetly eyeing a cute, thin blond guy who was loud, popular, and most importantly, gay. And there he was, across the room, shirtless around a circle of guys funneling beer into his mouth. His name was Nate.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was all a matter of waiting for Nate to separate himself from the crowd of men to get drink for you to approach him. You introduced yourself and his responses seemed friendly enough. What the hell am I doing, you thought. With this kind of approach you'd might as well have gone to a club. What if he wasn't even the type that hooked up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately enough, Nate seemed quite interested in Kyle, and at your suggestion the two of you slipped away from the party and up the stairs. Making your way into the first unoccupied room and locking the door, the two of you sat next to each other on one of the two twin sized beds. Nate made the first move, running his hand along your thigh right under a pair of black athletic shorts. You returned the same motion and went in for the kiss. His face brushed against some of your chin stubble, an experience that was almost foreign to you since you always shaved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time for the clothes to come off. You were relieved to see Nate hand you a condom. First, you were worried that if there had been no protection your options would have been limited. Second, you were going to be on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe condom slid on and you slid into Nate. Your motions were steady but fierce, and you had to keep a tight grip on his thighs. Gradually though your hands started to make their way along Nate's arms and back. His skin was smooth to the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gaze fell on a mirror to your right, reflecting Nate the pretty-boy twink, and you, or rather, Kyle. You looked in wonder at your reflection, with Kyle's thick muscles, square face, and a decent tan. He was certainly a fine catch, and now your hands moved away from Nate's body as you made Kyle's reflection slap his own ass and play with his own nipples. This was turning you on a lot, and you could have sworn by then that the sexual energy in the atmosphere had suddenly multiplied. Your attention turned back to Nate, and when it was time to cum you pushed yourself all the way into him. Nate moaned in ecstasy as he felt your cock throbbing inside him, and he turned around, pumping his own dick furiously. You brought your face in close and felt the warm liquid splash all over you, then wiped as much as you could with your hand and licking it off. It tasted sweet. Then, you slipped the condom off of your dick and poured its contents into your mouth. Definitely saltier than Nate's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your experience done the two of you got dressed and made your way back to the party. Since you were finished with Kyle, it was just a matter of drinking some beer and pretending to pass out again before leaving his body and floating out of Kappa Sigma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough your time with Kyle and Nate left you refreshed and invigorated, it still didn't prevent you from sleeping through your alarm. You were running as fast as you could down 34 Avenue to your morning class. It was bad enough that you had already established a reputation with Dr. Heinrich for slacking off in his class, and now he was really going to chew you out. Still, it was fortunate that you had went on your little venture last night, because due to your replenished energy you had been sprinting for five minutes straight without even breaking a sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you turned a corner and BAM! You smacked right into someone else. It was a guy, definitely a student, with mid-length surfer hair and a plaid cap. He must have been in the middle of reaching for something in his backpack because it was on the ground beside him with several books pouring out. </span></div></div>",

Immediately you knelt down and started picking up his books for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" he said, rubbing his forehead. \"But damn, that hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gaze fell on one of the books you had picked up. In large gold print, the front cover read \"THE LESSER KEY OF SOLOMON.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon noticing the man immediately snatched the book away from you. \"That's mine, thanks,\" he mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, hold on!\" You definitely knew that title. It had come up a few times during your research into demons and supernatural beings. \"Are you into that kind of stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What do you mean?\" he stammered, obviously flustered and embarrassed. He quickly shoved his books into his backpack, slung it over his shoulder, and began walking away, but you were following him. \"I am too, you know!\" you exclaimed. He stopped. \"You're joking, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat were you doing? Were you really going to take your chances with someone you just bumped into on the street who just happened to have one occult book in his backpack? Come on, Christian, pull yourself together, you thought. After taking a deep breath you continued. \"Look, if you're an expert on... That... I think I could really use your help. I'm serious.\" You looked eyes with him, allowing him to scan over you hoping that he would detect the sincerity in your request. \"I... Maybe...\" he began. \"I wouldn't go so far as to call myself an expert...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I have to go to class, but take my number and text me whenever you're free.\" He obediently took out his phone and entered the number you gave him. \"Actually, would tonight be good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so,\" he responded. \"Uh, what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christian.\" He put your name into his contacts and saved it onto his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I'm Blake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be seeing you later then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an uneventful lecture with Dr. Heinrich, you and Greg decided to meet for lunch at the park on 5th street. The two of you were running on a budget this month, so you were content to settle on hot dogs and soda from the vendors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how's the whole knowing that I'm an incubus-alp-demon-vampire thing going for you?\" you asked Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not gonna lie dude, I was a bit delirious when I got back to my dorm. It just kinda sunk in and I was like, 'holy shit, my best friend isn't human,'\" he declared. \"But I mean, even if I am still in disbelief about this whole thing, it doesn't change anything, between the two of us. In fact, I guess it's kind of cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just had to tell you because, you know, sometimes it bothers me. When I first became aware of my abilities I asked my brother about it and he had no idea what I was talking about. I tried hinting it to my parents and I didn't get a response from them either. So my guess is that they're all normal human beings and I might not even be related to them at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know if you were adopted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember asking my parents that before, and they said no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it really a problem, not knowing? Even if you knew for sure that you were some half-demon half-incubus or whatever, would that really change anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I just want a peace of mind, that's all,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man, if there's any way I can help just let me know,\" Greg said, patting you on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, that time when you turned into smoke. I still can't believe that actually happened. Do it again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! I'm not gonna transform when we're out in public!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, but you said you can take over people's bodies right? Ever gotten a girl that way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face became red. \"Well, yeah, just to try it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious? What was it like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Different. Awkward. Anyways, did you do your philosophy homework yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs agreed, Blake had texted you later that day and arranged a meeting in the library. The two of you were situated all the way in the corner of the reference section, where people rarely went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not some sort of satanic devil-worshiper, you know,\" he explained. \"I just have an interest in these things, and, well, I guess I know a thing or two about magic and summoning and all that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever actually done any of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing major, just some protective spells. Anyways, what is it exactly do you need help with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held your breath for a moment. How should you do this?</span></div></div>",

You explained to him your powers and even transformed halfway into mist. It seemed that was enough to convince him. \"That's definitely nothing I've ever heard of, although my guess is that you're either some sort of demon or some sort of fairy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there any way you can find out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake closed his eyes for a moment and thought. Then he said, \"I guess we could try contacting a demon. Not a malevolent one, of course.\" You agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe faint, glowing outline of a leopard could be seen emerging from the brass pot that Blake had brought into your room. \"What do you want?\" it asked rather irritably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to know where I came from,\" you declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leopard drew closer and sniffed you out. Then it furrowed its nose and said, \"Interesting. You don't carry the scent of a human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, I'm not human at all?!\" you exclaimed. The demon shook its head. This was a shock. All this time you had been certain that at the very least you were a quarter human. Now it seems that you weren't of this world at all. And your family... Definitely is not your biological family. You looked over at Blake, who just nodded as if that had been his suspicion all along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your scent is familiar though,\" the demon continued. \"But I'm afraid I can't remember at the moment. Give me a few days and I may be able to properly recall-\" suddenly it began to snarl, crouching low with its tail raised as if ready to pounce. \"There is an intruder! You!\" it shouted at Blake. \"Did you do the invocation properly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm pretty sure I did,\" Blake stammered, but he certainly didn't sound sure of himself. Just then one of the shadows on the wall started to move. Then it flew out of the wall and lunged. You and Blake nearly hit the roof as the two of you jumped back, but the leopard quickly tackled the shadow and ripped it apart with its claws. The leopard then turned back to you and Blake. \"You must not leave this room tonight. That way you will be under my protection. Normally I wouldn't be interested in wasting my time babysitting humans, so you're lucky that this particular case is of interest to me.\" And with that it disappeared in a puff of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour bed was a mere twin size so you and Blake had to sleep in rather close proximity, which was awkward because the only times other people had slept in your bed with you had been sexual in nature. He had his back to you, and you weren't sure whether or not he was asleep. The best you could do was to try to make as little movement as possible, even though it always took you a while to get into a comfortable position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou became aware of a pleasant smell coming from Blake. As you slowly inched your face closer to him you wondered what kind of deodorant or bodywash he used. How strange this all was. You had only just met this guy, revealed your whole identity to him, summoned a demon with him, and now you were sleeping in the same bed with him, all in one day. And it wasn't even a hookup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts of Blake continued even as you drifted to sleep, and suddenly you saw him fighting off a horde of demons using some sort of magic. You must have entered his dream. Deciding to give him a hand you jumped to his side and made it so that the demons were all easily vanquished within seconds. \"Thanks,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What got you into the whole deal with demons anyway?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was attacked by one when I was little,\" he explained, and with that single statement it was as if he transferred an entire memory of a being that had haunted his attic in his old house in Ohio. Suddenly your lips met, which threw you off enough to almost wake you up. But just as quickly as the moment had come it had gone and the two of you were on 32 Street with some of his classmates surrounding him. You had faded into the background, so you decided to go back to your own dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a single hour went by the next day without you wondering about Blake's dream. Was it him or you that had influenced that kiss to happen? He didn't seem to act uncomfortable or strange that morning when the two of you had woken up, and people are not very likely to forget a sex dream that they had. He had a morning class today so he  had left early, but you wondered if maybe you should spend some time with him today to get to know him better. Just then you got a text. It was your friend Danielle asking if you had any plans tonight. It looked like she and her friends were going to the club.</span></div></div>",

You had a good idea of where you wanted to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ's Bar was the place to go on campus when people just wanted have a place to relax and have a drink rather than party. You and Blake ordered your drinks at the bar and played a game of pool amidst the chatter of the other patrons and the blaring of a baseball game being shown on television. You talked about many things as your game progressed and found out quite a bit about Blake. He was born in Ohio close to Lake Erie where he would go swimming all the time. He had a family of five, two sisters and parents that were separated. He was a freshman at Fuseli University and was planning on majoring in engineering. You revealed a little about your own personal life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake managed to beat you three times in a row at the pool table. When the two of you decided that you had had enough, you both left AJ's and took a walk in Hopkirk Park. It was pretty well-lit at night and had a large field of grass to sit down in. All around you were other students looking for a quiet reprieve from the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is weird,\" you suddenly say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not even human at all, and yet here I am living a pretty normal life. And you know that I'm not human but you're still treating me like one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake smiled. \"It's not a big deal. I used to try to befriend the demons I evoked, you know. But then they'd just get irritated when I didn't have anything important that I wanted them to do.\" He noticed that you were staring at him and laughed. \"Okay, I know, that sounds pathetic.\" Then he attempted to change the subject. \"You said you can go into people's dreams, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh oh, you know where this was going. \"Yeah,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you can influence them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny, I think I had a dream about you last night.\"</span></div></div>",

Nervously he took off his glasses and started wiping them with his shirt tail. \"Anyways, so, uh, when you asked me to hang out tonight, is this actually a...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoldly you scooted closer to him and placed a hand on his shoulder. \"Do you want to go back to my room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the door had closed the two of you were already making out. He had a little chin scruff on him, and whenever your face brushed against it your spine would tingle. After falling over on to your bed, you stopped to delicately remove Blake's glasses and place it on your nightstand. Moments later your clothes and his lay in a mixed heap on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering his rather average frame you were a little surprised to see that he had a faint cover of blonde hair running between his pecs. His pubes were closely trimmed, a contrast to his not shaving any other body hair of his, but it made his manhood look quite long. While his muscles weren't entirely toned or pumped up it wasn't anything to complain about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake told you that he had never had anal sex before. More than willing to be the one to introduce him, you got out your lube and lathered it on your right index finger. Blake got on his hands and knees, and you played with the rim of his anus a little with your finger before taking the plunge. Indeed, it was a pretty tight fit, and you had to remind Blake multiple times to relax, but in time you managed to slip a second and then a third finger inside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he was ready for the real deal. In your excitement you had almost forgotten the condom. Once it was on you lubed up you got Blake to turn onto his back as you got off the bed. With his legs resting on your shoulders you eagerly inserted yourself into him. At first sharp, painful grunts came out of him, but they soon turned into moans as his anus became accustomed to the penetration. You could feel the sexual energy accumulating, and once that point was reached there was no stopping you. You tilted your head to the side, feeling his leg against your cheek, all the while looking down into his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was the first to cum. As he moaned in ecstasy you could feel his energy funneling itself into you, spreading all over your body and putting you in your own state of bliss. That was enough to make you ejaculate, and you fell on top of him while covering his whole body in kisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like last night you slept in bed with Blake, although the circumstances were definitely different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you opened your eyes again the sun was shining brightly through the window. You saw that the clock read 11:32. Figuring that you'd might as well get up, you got dressed and went over to the bathrooms. While in the shower you noticed something. Had your arms always been this muscular? The moment you got out of the shower you took a look at yourself in the mirror. Since no one else was present you felt inclined to do some flexing for a little bit. You could swear that your muscles had more tone in them than they had before. Well, it sure isn't anything to complain about, you thought as you brushed your teeth. By the time you got back to your room Blake was awake and in his clothes as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning,\" he greeted with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm gonna go back to my dorm to change and get breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll see you later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore going through the doorway he stopped and turned back to you. \"Um, so I just wanted to make sure,\" he began. \"This whole thing... It was just... us having fun... right?\" There was a level of uncertainty in his voice.</span></div></div>",

Having Blake, someone who understood your nature, as a fuck buddy would remove all the stress of having to find someone to hook up with. Despite all your debauchery you had never been able to maintain a solid relationship before, and it was for that reason that you were unaccustomed to even thinking about commitment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make up for not going to the club with Danielle last night, you decided to go out to lunch with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, do you wanna join one of the sports club with me?\" Danielle suddenly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a bite out of a ham and cheese sandwich. \"Uh, sure.\" You replied. \"I haven't really been working out lately.\" You weren't sure if you really wanted to, but it wouldn't hurt to try it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know!\" she exclaimed. \"Sometimes it gets really boring going to the gym.

Though it had been a while since you had played ultimate, your skill with the frisbee had not diminished and you could send it spinning wherever you wanted to with little trouble.

In fact, I guess it's kind of cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just had to tell you because, you know, sometimes it bothers me. When I first became aware of my abilities I asked my brother about it and he had no idea what I was talking about. I tried hinting it to my parents and I didn't get a response from them either.

Anyways, did you do your philosophy homework yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hanging out with a few people from your dorm you finally retired to your room. It was getting late so you decided it would be best to go straight to bed. You fell into a deep sleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was here, in this state where you could sense the consciousnesses of all of the people around you. You could freely travel in and out of their dreams with ease. One of your hall mates was dreaming about failing his exam on Monday. You were feeling particularly nice and made it so that he got the highest mark and the hot girl in his class gave him a blow job. Then you found yourself in the subconscious of someone you didn't particularly get along with. You decided to give him a terrifying nightmare of being chased by monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, your shenanigans were halted as you awoke with a start. You gasped and your eyes flung wide open, but you found it impossible to move the rest of your body. It seemed like there was a heavy weight on top of you. That's when you noticed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the girl that you ran into today! She had somehow stripped you completely naked and was now riding you. When she saw that you were awake she just smiled and held a finger to your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnacceptable. With all the strength you could muster you broke free from whatever had caused your paralysis and pushed her rather violently off the bed. This certainly threw her off guard as she let out a shriek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell do you think you're doing?!\" you yelled. \"And how did you get in here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice was smooth and sultry. \"Oh, hun, I was just trying to have a little fun. I need it, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm calling the cops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just chuckled. \"I'll be long gone by then. Do you even know who I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a succubus, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first her eyes widened in surprised, but then she gave that playful chuckle once more. \"My, my, first you break free from my grasp and now this. I knew you were something special.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you could say that.\" You thought for a moment. This was your first encounter with a succubus ever.

You began to put your clothes back on to prove your point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I will not answer your questions,\" Tesla countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew you were passing up an opportunity to gather some valuable information, but you also had your dignity, even if she was pretty hot. In addition, you had no idea what would happen if you engaged in intercourse with someone who also drained sexual energy from others. It sounded a little exciting, but also a little dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll come back another time,\" she suddenly said with a wink. \"But mark my words, you are quite the decadent specimen, and I will do anything to get a taste of that.\" And then she was gone in a puff of black smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSleep was an impossibility for the next hour or so. You weren't scared, just preoccupied. Even if you were different, you had never even imagined that you would encounter other beings like you. And there was no way Tesla was the only supernatural creature roaming about. There had to be more of them, and you had a feeling that it wouldn't be long before you got to know them all. Suddenly, it was like the part of your life that you had been hiding for so long was now leaking out. First you revealed yourself to Greg, and now you actually almost got raped by a succubus!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was the future going to hold for you? This question plagued your mind until you finally managed to drift off into sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFilm history. It was just one of those classes that you thought would be fun to take, and one of the few classes that you had with Greg. Dr. Hardigan was renowned for being one of the easiest professors to get along with on campus, always ready to crack a joke with the class without getting too condescending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and it looks like we have a newcomer joining us today, are any of the guys enough of a gentleman to share his notes with her so she can catch up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't even noticed that there had been an extra person in the room. You turned to take a look at her... And almost had a heart attack. It was her, sitting right next to Greg. Tesla, the succubus. No doubt about it. Of all the cliches she would pull off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg was the first to volunteer his notes to Tesla. She thanked him with a smile and began copying them into her own notebook. All you could do was watch as the two occasionally exchanged flirty glances at each other. At one point she looked over at you and winked. This was not good. This was not good at all. The class would carry on for another hour before you could finally make your move.</span></div></div>",

With a start, you realize the girl is the same one you saw banging a totally different guy shortly after your arrival. Apparently she has a healthy sexual appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are about to move on, when she looks up and sees you.

The guy moans and reaches over to grope the girl's breasts, but she pushes his hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to try something,\" she purs in his ear. \"Do you want to get a little kinky?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy's face is flushed from alcohol and general horniness. He'd probably agree to anything at this point, just to get in Tesla's pants. Wordlessly, he nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl pulls his shirt off while straddling him. His hips buck up and down, enjoying the proximity of their still-clothed crotches. Then, seductively and deliberately, Tesla folds the t-shirt into a blindfold and places it over the boy's eyes. Once assured that he can't see a thing, she begins working her way down his chest with her lips and tongue, as she unfastens his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are very much aroused by what you see and look forward to the show when Tesla looks up with a mischievous gleam in her eyes and motions for you to enter the room. Quietly, you enter, making sure the blindfolded stud remains unaware of your presence. You stand next to them as Tesla pulls his pants off, releasing the guy's hard erection. Taking it with one hand, she uses the other to rub your hard crotch. Leaning down so her breath touched his penis, Tesla purred, \"You're really going to love this.\" The boy responded with a moan, but she was looking at you as she spoke, so you aren't sure who she was addressing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTesla looks at the hard cock in front of her, and then looks invitingly at you.

The guy moans as you kiss his balls, being careful that you don't rub your scratchy chin onto his skin, giving things away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you slowly lick the underside of his shaft, Tesla removes your pants and begins doing the same thing to your cock. It feels so good, and you have to fight to keep from making any noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wrap your lips around the guy's penis, Tesla slips out of her jeans. She positions herself so you can reach between her legs with your right hand. The cock in your mouth is starting to leak precum, so you take a generous amount of it, mixed with your saliva, on your fingers and use it to lube Tesla up well. Not that she needs it... she is VERY wet already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is a master at giving head, and you are close to blowing. The way her hips are moving frantically as you finger fuck her, you sense she is close, too. Certainly the blindfolded boy is close, because he is breathing so hard and fast, you fear he will hyperventilate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you feel your balls begin to contract and the first waves of orgasm begin to hit, you are rewarded with a surprisingly full mouthful of hot, salty cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTesla's twat contracts powerfully on your fingers, and you feel yourself unloading your jizz (well, Kyle's jizz, anyway) into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when everything went nuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt as if a million volts of energy was being pulled out of the guy's dick, and at least as much was flowing through yours. Tesla cried out in shock and alarm and pulled away from your cock with great effort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything went black and next thing you knew, you were ejected forcibly from Kyle's body. You were drained of energy like never before, so it took a moment before you noticed the condition of Kyle and the other guy. They were alive, but just barely. Their skin was grey, and their breath was very shallow. Either was conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTesla was awake, but appeared to be as drained as you.

He does this by \"feeding\" off of the sexual tension that is released by his partner(s). Depending on the quality of his last encounter he can go on for a few weeks to only a day. It is important to note that one person having sex with Christian too much will eventually have detrimental effects on their health.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristian can turn into a fine mist, allowing him to travel with great freedom and stealth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo avoid having a reputation Christian will sometimes keep a low profile by possessing other people and having sex through them. He will receive energy from both his sex partner and the body he is inhabiting. Christian can also receive energy by masturbating in a body he is possessing, but the amount is meager and does very little to provide sustenance. Christian can only possess people while he is in mist form, and only when the person is asleep. Yes, he has access to the memories of the body he is possessing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he himself is asleep he can enter other people's dreams and influence them. Though he can willfully make dreams take a turn for the erotic, it does not provide him with energy. He can also give people sleep paralysis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether it is a supernatural power or just his charm, Christian does not seem to have much trouble attracting anyone he wants to have sex with. Even straight guys or lesbians can suddenly find themselves drawn to him, though it might take more work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>Setting</b></font><br>\r\nChristian attends Fuseli University, in the enormous city of Carina. You can find almost anything from parks to restaurants to clubs to a pristine beach on the west side. He lives by himself in a single-dorm room at Kruger Hall. Surprisingly, crime is not a huge problem. People usually get around by bus or metro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>List of major characters</b></font><br>\r\n<b>Christian Senner</b> - Self-described as quarter human, quarter demon, quarter incubus, quarter alp, pseudo sex vampire. An attractive sophomore in college with brown hair, blue eyes, and an athletic body. Bisexual.<br>\r\n<b>Greg Ackerman</b> - Christian's best friend since high school. By default the only one who knows Christian's true identity so far.<br>\r\n<b>Blake Eckhart</b> - At first he seems like your average student, but he actually has an interest in the occult. <br>\r\n<b>Danielle Marian</b> A close friend of Christian. She likes to party but is kind and compassionate on the inside.<br>\r\n<b>Tesla Chaplan</b> - A succubus. Like many of her kind she is sexy and irresistible. She has connections with other supernatural beings and as such can be useful to Christian in finding out who he is. Otherwise she can be an antagonistic seductress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>Creatures</b></font><br>\r\n<b>Incubus</b> - A demon who has sex with human beings usually while they sleep in order to feed off of their energy. Sometimes they prey on humans in order to father children. They can not possess people.<br>\r\n<b>Succubus</b> - The female equivalent of an incubus<br>\r\n<b>Alp</b> - A creature that can control dreams. They can turn into a fine mist and enter through the mouth or nostrils in order to administer nightmares from within, but can not actual possess people. They also have long tongues to feed on dreams. Unlike the incubus, attacks by an alp are rarely sexual. They can also shapeshift.<br>\r\n<b>Demon</b> - Umbrella term for a wide array of otherworldly creatures that are usually malevolent. Most notable are the ones capable of possession.<br>\r\n<b>Vampire</b> - Beings that can only survive by feeding on the essence of others. Traditionally they feed on blood, but there are also psychic vampires and sexual vampires.</span></div></div>",
