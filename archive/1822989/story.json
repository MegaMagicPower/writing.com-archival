Rain meant a lessor crowd for the Avengers press conference, which was meant to celebrate the world premiere of the movie based on their exploits.  It would be far easier for him to get into position to enact his plan.  He chuckled out loud, laughing at the absurd simplicity of it.  For the past 6 months he had pain-stakingly disassembled the gamma-siphoning gun from the government lab that he worked at.  It was a weapon meant for the past, one where the Hulk was chased down as a fugitive by the Hulk-Busters.  Now, the Hulk was a hero.  Part of the most powerful collection of heroes ever assembled, The Avengers.  He came across it quite innocently six months ago, and as he realized the weapon's implications, he formulated his most brilliant idea.  No one at the lab knew who had created it, but as it sat unused for over a decade, it was seemingly forgotten about.  He had approached the lab supervisor about studying it, with a fail-safe ruse in mind.  He would attempt to reverse engineer it to siphon radiation sickness from victims of potential terrorist attacks.  Piece by piece he had deconstructed it, and replaced the parts with plastic replicas.  Sometimes he would allow weeks to go by without ever going near it, even though it consumed his every thought. He didn't want anyone to suspect what he was doing. But now the day was finally here. He knew that this event had been planned for months, and it was the perfect opportunity to get near the Hulk. The gun's beam would seek out the source of the gamma radiation, so the Professor could be at a safe enough distance to not get caught.  Once he had the gamma radiation stored within his gun, all it would take is the flip of a switch to reverse it's beam to him, and he would become the most powerful man on the planet.  He looked over his thin, frail frame, and smiled.  Soon, he would not only be brilliant, but his body would finally match, no, it would exceed his mental capabilities. <br>\r\n         <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Keller's plan was intricate, and it would have to be carried out with pinpoint accuracy. Early on the day of the press conference, he had booked a room in the Holiday Inn that stood directly overlooking the podium. Keller had had to spend a few extra weeks building a telescopic sight onto the gamma gun so that he could position the beam with total accuracy, and also some time trying to find which hotel room was best placed to shoot the siphoning beam from. Now though, everything was in readiness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was risk involved in this venture, of course. The beam had to be invisible, and at a low frequency-- anything higher and the Avengers highly sensitive recording devices would pick up the electromagnetic emanations of the device. Subjecting the Hulk to a full blast on the beam's highest frequency would be a bad move-- both the Hulk and  the Avengers would respond swiftly and mercilessly to such a brazen attack long before the beam had collected enough gamma energy. The only option was to have the device drain Dr Banner's power slowly over the course of the press conference. With any luck the big green brute would just think he was feeling unwell, and subcomb to the effects of the siphoning device in good time. There was always a danger that the Hulk could move away before the beam had finished it's work, however-- but it was a gamble Keller just had to take. There would be no other opportunity to get close to the Hulk, and this was his best hope. Wiping his sweating palms on his hands, he peered down the gunsights and watched the gathering crowds, waiting for the arrival of his quarry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about fifteen minutes delay (which made Keller nervous-- had he been detected and the copnverence called off? Would he shortly be interrupted by the sound of Captain America pummelling his hotel room door open?)-- they came. Warbird came first, floating down from an uncomfortably close distance to Keller, who froze as she drifted past. Her arms were outstretched and one muscular leg was bent forward at the knee, like a balet dancer performing Swan Lake. Her back was to Keller, so she couldn't have noticed the barrel of his Gamma-Siphoner, covered as it was by a dark cloth and aimed from well within the hotel room. She landed on the podium to great applause, and raised her arms in greeting to the fans. Next was Justice and Firestar-- the flame-haired woman streaking down from the sky like a falling meteor, a firey trail behind her. She came down at such speed that many of the crowd made an uneasy sound, but soon broke out into rapturous applause when Firestar came to a halt just above the podium and turned off her fire aura, landing as gracefully as a cat on the stage. Justice followed behind, encased in a glowing bubble of powerful psychic energy, his hair and cape floating dreamily in it's weightless embrace. He came to land beside his girlfriend Firestar, and raised a fist in salute to the crowd whilst placing the other arm around Firestar's slender waist. The Bombastic Beast was next, and as the furry blue mutant tumbled down from the roof of a coffee bar and leapt onto the stage, Keller frowned. Where was the Hulk? Had he pulled out at the last minute? Keller looked nervously behind him, expecting the door to come crashing down at any second. Keller returned his gaze to the stage and watched the next Avenger ariving. A ghostly outline of a cape wearing man suddenly appeared suspended over the heads of the other Avengers. Complex circuitry became visible, then organic looking but entirely synthetic muscle tissue. A yellow, green and red epidermis solidified to reveal the unmistakable form of the Vision. Keller cursed his luck-- the Vision might be able to detect his beam, even at this low frequency. This didn't bode well. His despair at this turn of events melted away quickly as he felt a slight tremor pass through the room. Looking down onto an empty patch of the square behind the crowd, Keller grinned as he saw the Hulk dressed in nothing but a pair of knee-length purple trunks. Keller clasped his gamma-siphoning gun eagerly, waiting for the Hulk to make his way to the podium. Instead though, the Hulk knealt, and the crowd parted before him. Frowning at the oddity of this, the sound of a motorbike  filled the air, and then suddenly a shape lifted off from the Hulk's powerful back. It was Captain America on a motorbike! The jump took him high into the air, and with an astonishing speed and nimbleness that belied his imposing bulk, the Hulk sped forward to the stage and waited as Cap's bike descended. Effortlessly, the green goliath caught both the bike and it's rider, and Captain America somersaulted from his ride and onto the podium. The crowd went wild, and even Keller had to shake his head in astonishment at this. <br>\r\nCaptain America waved for silence, and began to speak.<br>\r\n\"Friends,\" he began, the sound of his voice reducing all to an awed hush, \"We're here today to celebrate not just a movie, but to honour those people without whom none of us would be standing here today--you.\"<br>\r\nThunderous applause. The Hulk had taken his place beside Captain America. It was time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeller finished aiming the weapon from the back of  of his hotel room and out the open window. He flicked off the safety catch, and with a trembling finger, fired the device. An invisible stream of gamma-absorbing particles streaked down towards the stage and hit the Hulk square in his back. He peered back through the infra-red telescopic sights, which showed the beam as an etherial glowing strand which arced downward, and grinned. Success! The readings from his device were telling him that Dr Banner's gamma energy was slowly but surely being siphoned, but Banner himself did not appear to notice what was happening to him at all. The Vision too remained impassive as Captain America continued his speech. Rubbing his hands together with glee, Doctor Benjamin Keller grabbed his suit jacket and made his way out of the hotel room. He would now make his way down to the crowds gathered outside, and once there meet his wife, Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate Keller had idolised the Avengers since their initial battle with the Hulk and Loki, many years ago. Her workplace was close by, so she was able to attend the press launch for the Avengers movie during her lunch break. It was also affording her the opportunity to spend a little time with her husband Ben, who had been very absorbed in his work of late. He'd never really shared Kate's interest in the Avengers, but for some reason had insisted on making this press conference a date. She watched him approach now, looking happier than he had done in months. Kissing her on the cheek, Ben took his side at his wife's place.<br>\r\n\"Well, look at you so happy all of a sudden!\" Kate laughed. <br>\r\n\"This is going to be a momentous occaision, Kate. I can feel it...\"</span></div></div>",

His wife Elizabeth was running late, and if she didn't get here soon he would have to leave without her.  He didn't want to, he really wanted her to witness his moment of triumph first-hand, but he couldn't wait much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      As he got to the front door, his wife came racing up the driveway in their other car, and who she had inside with her infuriated Ben.  He saw both his mother in-law and sister in-law, and both of them got on his nerves equally.  His mother in-law, Joyce, she of the 3 failed marriages, was always instructing Elizabeth on ways Ben could be a better husband.  He had a million ways that she could be a better mother in-law, but he kept them to himself.  His sister in-law, Jackie, was so snobby that he was surprised to even see her sitting in the back-seat of their SUV.  She was used to driving around in her BMW, as her husband's very succesful investment firm afforded them an incredibly priveleged lifestyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Liz, what the hell are you thinking?  I don't have time for this right now!\" He yelled at her like she was a 10 year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I would never allow my husband to speak to me in such a disrespectful manner.\" Joyce interjected.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Elizabeth sighed, she knew this wasn't the best idea, but her sister and mother both wanted to come to the Avenger's mansion, in fact they had insisted on it, but she had hoped it wouldn't be such a big deal to Ben. \"Ben honey, they wanted to come, I hope you don't mind.  It would mean a lot to me if you let them come.\"<br>\r\nShe looked at him with her sweet face, it was the look that both she and Ben knew that he couldn't resist.  She only used it when it meant a lot to her to get her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"It's your car also Elizabeth, so you have a say in this.\"<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \"Jackie please, not now!\" Elizabeth turned back towards her husband and saw his annoyance with this unforseen intrusion.  But she also saw the look of compassion for her knowing that she was in an uncomfortable situation herself.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n     \"Alright, Dweedle-Dee and Dweedle-Dum can come.\"   Besides, he thought to himself, he couldn't wait to see the look on both of their faces when he got the Hulk's powers and transformed right in front of their smug faces.  \"We'll take this car, just let me grab something.\"  Elizabeth smiled.  It was going to turn out okay after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       Ben opened the trunk back up and grabbed the case that was holding the precious cargo.  He looked at it again and smiled.  He looked over at his other car, Elizabeth had slid over to the passenger seat and she was engaged in a heated discussion with her mother and sister.  How the hell did she turn out so sweet when the other 2 were such pain the asses.  He slammed the trunk closed, pressed the remote to open the hatch on the back of the Tahoe, and he carefully placed the case in the rear.  He hurridly walked over to the front of the SUV and hopped in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"What was in the case honey?\"<br>\r\n       \"Oh, just a special camera that I borrowed from work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"It figures that he has to borrow a camera and doesn't have one of his own.\"  Jackie remarked, which drew a chuckle from Joyce.  Elizabeth reached over and placed her hand on top of his, letting him know whose side she was on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       Ben adjusted the rear-view mirror, pausing to look at the two hyenas yucking it up in the back at his expense.  Soon, he would be the one laughing at them. He put the car in reverse, backed out of the driveway, and he was on his way to a date with destiny. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Finally they arrived in the hotel parking lot and Ben checked in to a 3rd story hotel room that had a large outdoor patio overlooking the press conference. The view of the conference was amazing and even better then if they would have had front row seats. Ben could hear his in-laws mocking him him for not getting tickets up close but he was to busy setting up his camera to mind. As soon as the Hulk got on stage Been hit the siphon button and watched as the Hills power levels slowly we're siphoned to his machine. As the transfer completed 100% the Hulk gave way to Bruce Banner who collapsed on press conference stage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie who had been watching this jumped up and shouted \"what is wrong with the Hulk?\" As she did she knocked over the camera which came to a crash on the wood patio. As it bounced around for a few seconds Been watched with first relief as the machine showed 100% of the Hulks strength was still inside and then as it landed on its side it then showed 0% as the beam fired. Ben looked at the direction of of the beam and saw his wife walking towards him. She had just used the restroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it happened. The power of the hulk erupted ripping Elizabeth's clothes off as her body ballooned to the size of the hulk. Ben had to admit she looked hot but as he looked at his nude and insanely muscular wife he saw what was supposed to his muscles. Elizabeth finally said \"Ben what happened?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Ben broke down and told the truth and Elizabeth laughed as been, her sister, and mom all watched the muscle woman flex her new body. \"Well Ben I like my anniversary present.\" </span></div></div>",

Elizabeth noticed he was driving much more aggresively than normal, \"Are you racing someone honey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   He smiled at her, \"No, no.  I'm just trying to get out of the car as quick as possible.  I'm getting tired of hearing about all of my faults from those two in the backseat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I could go on and on Benjamin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Mother!  Could you try and be civil.  Ben was nice enough to drive you in with us so you could get a firsthand look at the Hulk and the rest of the Avengers, it's the least you can do to be polite to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Joyce blushed, she had long had a fascination with the Hulk and his overwhelmingly muscular and powerful physique.  Her attraction to powerful men had landed her 3 wealthy husbands, but unfortunately none of them had the physique that she preferred.  In fact all of them were in rather poor shape, but they made up for it in their bank accounts.  <br>\r\n    \"I just want to get a close-up look for myself of the most spectacular male specimen on earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Oh Mom, doesn't the green skin bother you at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Liz, your mother loves green. It's the color of money.\"  Ben chuckled at his own dig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Jackie came to her mother's defense, \"Don't pay attention to him mother.  Benny just has size envy.\"  Both she and her mother laughed again at Ben's expense.  Not for much longer, Ben thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Joyce, what would you do if the Hulk actually liked you, imagine that for a second.  He just might like 52 year old divorcees with fake boobs, a face full of botox, and hair with streaks of grey in it.  I mean, I know you're a maneater, but I don't think you'd be able to handle him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Enough children, we've arrived.\"  Elizabeth cut him off, happy that they were there before their bickering escalated any further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Ben hopped out of the car so fast, he felt like a kid on Christmas morning racing to get in front of the Christmas tree.  He went around to the back of the SUV and got the case out. \"You guys go ahead, I'm going to wait back here to get a few shots. I'll catch up with you in a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Joyce and Jackie made their way to the security checkpoint up ahead, but Elizabeth stayed back with Ben.  \"I'll wait for you honey.  Let them go up to see them by themselves.\"  Elizabeth wrapped her arms around his chest from behind, cradled up against him.  <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n      \"Alright, that sounds like a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Ben engaged his wife with small talk as he waited for his in-laws to make their way through the security, and the long line that had formed to go and meet the Avengers.  He saw them approaching the stage, it looked like a graduation ceremony as the attendees would walk up the small stairs on the righthand side and walk across the stage, passing each member of the Avengers along they way as they exited to the left.  \"Liz, look.  Your mom and sister are almost there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Elizabeth grabbed the binoculars that Ben had been looking through.  As she was distraced, Ben opened the case with the gamma-siphoning device. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As Joyce approached the stage, her heart fluttered as she saw the Hulk standing there.  He dwarfed everyone else on stage, including Thor.  She was surprised just how large he was, as sheer power literally just poured through his physique.  As she walked past the other Avengers in almost a trance-like state she approached the Hulk.  She barely came up to the top of his abdomen, when suddenly a beam of light came out of nowhere and struck the Hulk.  Instantly, his immense muscles shrank away to nothing as he withered down to a frail-looking husk of a man.  Joyce looked at him with disgust, she couldn't believe that this was what the Hulk looked like in his normal state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Panic ensued immediately as each Avenger went on alert to see if they were the next to be attacked.  Ironman took to the air and flew over the crowd to get a better view, looking for the source of the beam that had powered down the Hulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Ben couldn't believe it worked so well.  The look of horror on his mother in-laws face was priceless, but it would be nothing compared to what would happen next.  He quickly reversed the gun's settings, readying himself for the influx of power, when suddenly Elizabeth turned towards him, scared by what had just happened on stage.  She rushed towrds Ben causing him to accidentily fire the gun. The beam shot back in the direction of it's initial source, but instead of striking Bruce Banner, it hit Joyce as she stood in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Ben's heart almost burst through his chest as he realized that the beam went back to it's original power source.  He had been so close. <br>\r\n      Ironman saw the beam fire out again towards the stage and immediately fired at the source.  He swooped down and grabbed the person that had fired the gun, thankfully it was in pieces by his feet so it would no longer be able to harm anyone else.  Ben felt himself being pulled up by his armpits and was being flown towards the stage.  The security had cleared the front of the stage, but Joyce, Jackie, and a few others that had been on the stage remained.  The Avengers were huddled around Bruce Banner to make sure he was alright.  \"I'm fine, I'm fine he reassured them.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Joyce and Jackie didn't know what to do as there was chaos all around them.. Jackie looked up as she heard Ironamn approach the stage, \"Look mother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     They both looked up to see Ironman land while he was carrying Ben.  Joyce and Jackie were confused.  Everyone seemed to be confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"I saw this guy fire the gun that did this to the Hulk.  Luckily, I destroyed it before he could use it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Ben felt helpless as the Avengers circled him, he noticed a look of glee on his inlaw's faces. \"I was so close...so close to getting his powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Captain America approached Ben, \"what are you talking about?\"  Ben looked up at him, he figured that nothing other than the truth would suffice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I had stolen a gamma-siphoning device from the lab that I work at.  I wanted to take the Hulk's powers for myself.  And I was so close, but before I could shoot myself with it, I misfired and it shot back out again and hit Dr. Banner.  Everyone looked over at Bruce, relieved at how close it had come to someone else becoming the most powerful force on Earth.  It had taken years before Bruce had gotten the Hulk under control, where he was able to maintain his own mind when he transformed.  \"There's only one problem guys.  The beam didn't strike me again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Thor looked around puzzled, \"But if the power did not return to you, where did it go?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Joyce smiled as she heard this.  She couldn't believe her good fortune.  It was almost too good to be true.  Not only did she get hit with the beam, it was because of her insipid son in-law's mistake that she got it instead of him.  \"I know who got hit with it,\" she paused as everyone turned to look at her, including Ben, \"Me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Ben began to sweat profusely as his legs went out from underneath him.. He collapsed onstage as his worst fears began magnified. \"NO! NO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Jackie looked over at her mother worriedly, \"Mother, are you alright? How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Joyce's heart began racing with excitement, \"Let's find out.\"</span></div></div>",

She noticed that they all had a rather uncomfortable look on each one of their faces, as if they were unsure on exactly what they should do with her.  This made her feel quite important, that their discomfort centered on her.  As Thor drew closer to her and stopped only a few feet away from her, she realized that he was an extremely imposing man.  Maybe not as large as the Hulk was, but far bigger than anyone else she had ever been near.  One by one the rest of the Avengers surrounded her, and this began to irritate her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I don't know why you are all looking at me like I'VE done something wrong here, I was just here to meet all of you when my idiotic son-in-law pulled his boneheaded stunt.\"  She motioned towards Ben, who was slumped over on the ground, looking utterly defeated.  She looked up at each of The Avengers, and smirked, \"You all think that you're so high and mighty.  That you can try to intimidate a helpless middle-aged woman?  Well, I've got some news for you, it's not going to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     With that Joyce took a deep breath and began to concentrate.  She felt the gamma-fueled power welling up inside her like a volcano ready to explode. Mount Joyce was ready to be unleashed!  Her eyes turned green as the transformation began.  She felt her muscles inflating outward, surging larger and larger with rediculous ease.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"This feeeeels woooonderful....\" She said to noone imparticular, but she knew that it had to be killing Ben.  Seeing HER get the Hulk's powers, of all people her, had to make him feel horrible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The Avengers slowly backed away from her, giving her space to grow.  Her muscles were beginning to tear through her clothing, her thighs pulled her dress to the breaking point as the material stood no chance against them.  Huge green quads poured through, as the remnants of the dress crept up higher and higher. Her blouse was pulled tight against her growing upper body as it too exploded apart exposing huge muscles all over, and gigantic breasts that jutted out impossibly.  She was looking down at all of them now, including Thor.  This began to arouse her, and her nipples sprang forth proving that.  Captain America looked at her, his mouth wide-open from the shock of seeing a once frail, older woman transform into the giganticly muscled specimen in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"What's the matter Cap\"  she cupped her huge breasts in front of his face, \"Have you never seen tits this big before?\"  She chuckled as she saw his reaction.  He stumbled backwards like he was trying to avoid getting stung by a bee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    She began to twirl her long, thick, dark green hair between her fingers.  Everything about this felt amazing.  She looked down at her body.  It was hard to believe that this was her body now.  Muscles this size that just moments ago were on the Hulk, now covered her body from head to toe.  There would be no more marrying men for their money.  Now, she had the power to take whatever she wanted to, and no one could stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       Thor approached the newly-transformed Joyce.  He couldn't believe the size of the woman.<br>\r\n      \"Miss, you're going to have to come with us back to Avengers mansion.  We have quite a bit to discuss with you.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    He casually placed his hand on her immense arm, just to sort of guide her off the stage.  Joyce took this the wrong way and instinctively flung her elbow back at him.  Thor went flying back as if a bomb exploded, and a smile spread across Joyce's face as she realized what she had just done.  She had just sent a god flying twenty feet, with a slight bump of her elbow.  If she had any question to how strong she was, it was immediately answered.  She WAS the most powerful person on earth, and heaven help anyone that got in her way!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rest of the Avengers backed away for her, not sure of what to expect from her next. She had just tossed Thor aside like a rag-doll and he was their most powerful remaining member. She smiled as she saw the fear and uneasiness in their faces, but the Avengers didn't matter to her right now. Joyce looked down at Ben, way down at him in fact as he had slumped over in defeat, sitting on the stage with his head down. He looked like a child compared to her, and the fact that his mistake was the reason that this fortuitous turn of events took place made it even sweeter. She walked over towards him, and stood in front of him, each of her feet appeared to be the size of his torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Avengers, I'm not going to hurt anyone, I just need to speak to my son-in-law.\" She chuckled as she said it, knowing it was the last thing that he wanted to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh Benjamin....don't be so upset. Your plan was a success, you took away the Hulk's powers!\" She brought up her arm and flexed it, the muscles erupting forth, delighting her even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look how big it is, why I think it's the biggest muscle that I have ever seen. What do you think Benjamin, is it the biggest arm that you've ever seen?\" He didn't want to look, he couldn't look. His moment of triumph, his moment of redemption, was destroyed. If it had to be anyone else, why did it have to be his annoying, condescending mother-in-law. Anyone else would have been better, even his sister-in-law Jackie would have been better than Joyce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoyce extended her huge green foot towards his face, and put it under his chin, \"Benjamin, you will look at me when I address you\", and lifted his face up so he would be looking up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted you to see what you have done. Thanks to you, I have the Hulk's powers, and there's not a damn thing you, or anyone can do about it. One of my feet has more power in it than your entire body. Try and move it, please, I'm begging you. Try to move it an inch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth had enough, this was a total disaster for many reasons, but she wouldn't have her husband humiliated any further. She stood up to confront her, barely coming up to her muscle-plated stomach. She couldn't believe how big her mother was. The overall thickness of her muscles was astounding. If it wasn't her mother's face looking down at her, she wouldn't have believed it was her.  \"Mom leave him alone. Isn't it enough that you've gotten the Hulk's powers instead of Ben.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoyce smiled at her daughter, she was proud of her for coming to her husband's defense. It was foolish and a waste of time, but she was proud none the less. \"Elizabeth, I just wanted to give him an up-close view of what he has created. His incompetence has really come back to bite him in the ass this time, but  I'm eternally grateful. He's given me more than I could have possibly imagined I would ever get from him, but you really need to stay out of this, as Benjamin and I need to share this special moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoyce took her foot out from under his chin and placed it on the ground in front of him. She rotated her calf muscle towards him and flexed it. It was easily bigger than his entire head. <br>\r\n\"Feel my calf muscle. Go ahead and try and wrap your hands around it.\" Benjamin just stared up at her. \"I said, wrap your hands around my calf. Do it. Now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen reached out in front of him and slowly placed his hands around his mother-in-laws now enormous calf muscle. It felt like a bowling ball covered in flesh. His left hand touched the front portion of her shin and his right hand touched the inner portion of her calf muscle. \"How big do you think they are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to touch his thumbs together, but they couldn't reach and cover just the front portion of her calf. All he kept thinking about was that this power, these muscles, should have been his. He lost himself in his thoughts but found that he couldn't help but run his hands around the entire calf, as he was mesmerized by their sheer size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why Benjamin, are you feeling me up? Ohhh Elizabeth, I would watch him if I were you. He can't keep his hands off of me.\" Elizabeth looked at Ben as he was wrapping his hands around her mother's calf muscle. She could swear by the look in his eyes that he was actually enjoying it. She didn't know if she should be jealous or disgusted by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly came to his senses as he realized what he was doing, and quickly pulled his hands away. Joyce smirked, knowing that she had won another round.<br>\r\n\"Well Benjamin, that will be enough of that. It will be the last time you get to feel my muscles. Besides, I have bigger fish to to fry now. After all, you've given me everything you have to offer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped away from them and looked around, everyone was unsure of what she would do next. A thought came to her. She had seen on TV that the Hulk able to jump miles at a time, so she decided it was time for her to try out her new method of transportation, her own newly empowered leg muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take care everyone, I'm off to see an old friend.\" She crouched down, the quadricep muscles bunching together, and then she shot up in the air like a cannonball, off to pay someone a visit.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tabitha had been uncomfortable in her clothes all day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beautiful, ultra-buxom 30-year old teacher was looking down at the shelf of her chest, white fabric of a \"conservative\" blouse stretched egregiously over her 52-inch balloons, the many darts and extra stitching all tensing nearly to bursting around her heavy breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was looking down at a golden chain. Its little heart locket had fallen into one of the gaps separated between her buttons by her overabundant cleavage, poofing and popping up regularly as she breathed and shifted in her uncomfortable clothes, filled to the max with her ripe brown flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked positively indecent, she thought. \"But what are my alternatives except for looking like a bag lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, sealing the lockets fate as she tried to pull her royal-purple powersuit away from her waist, in order to de-emphasize the contrast between it's waspish dimensions and her phenomenally overdeveloped shelf of a chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those boys and their superheroes.\" She thought. \"It's so American. I just don't get it.\" But she was glad for the fact that every other male eye wasn't popping her way every five seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnobserved, she indulged in a little pride, wrapping her slim fingers almost all the way around her waist. \"Still in my twenties.\" she thought, with a little smirk. The position thrust out her chest and made her boobs wobble. She felt herself bounce in her seat a bit on her super-pneumatic ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord knows this body does wonders for the boys attention spans, but it's so hard to find clothes that fit.\" Tabitha's mind drifted to the simple shawls of her family back in Africa. She came from a line of women that were not easy to fit into American clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave up with her struggles, sighing again, which pressed out her industrial-strength bra into the stretched out and misaligned darts of her bulky blouse. She settled into her chair, feeling her thick, purple-clad rump and hips squeeze out into the dimensions of the cheap plastic shell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up just in time to see a beam of green light from somewhere on the other side of the auditorium shoot down and envelop the Hulk, standing sullenly at the back of the other superheroes arranged before the audience. The Hulk started to shrink, suddenly and rapidly, a confused look on his face as he wobbled and deflated like a balloon, eventually collapsing down into the feeble Bruce Banner as the large bubble of green light around him grew bright and then seemed to zip back along it's beam with a bright, retractive burst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the light caught on Tabitha's golden chain, spreading a scintillation of the hulk's energy out across her protruding front, popping a stitch in her bra and shoving her tits out an inch further, drawing the buttons below the balcony of her tits even tighter. She returned her attention to her uncomfortable clothes, staring down at the bulging brown mounds of her cleavage, now spreading out the gaps between her buttons, drawing stretch-marks like spider-webs across her balloon-taut front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was briefly aware of the increasing commotion in the room, a loud argument between what sounded like a scientist discussing something with, his wife?... and... she couldn't stop staring at her boobs, already gigantic, going larger, when ZAP! the beam shot off from Ben's gun, bounced off Thor's hammer, held high in the air in his confusion of Banner's predicament, and POP! one of the buttons trying to restrain Ms.Obunde's abundance went flying in the same direction of the oncoming beam, the tiny white button falling to the ground green, and the size of a saucer, as the ray slipped neatly into the ripe, bulging gap of brown cleavage that had been exposed by Tabitha's uncomfortable clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to grow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOP! POP! P-P-P-OP!! Went the rest of Tabitha's buttons as those gigantic, oversized brown breasts began to wobbble and shaaake within the confines of her purple-power suit and white blouse. The tails of her shirt unnecessarily untucked themselves from her tiny, purple-cinched waist, where the belt was starting to creak from big, brown bubbles of muscle pushing their way out of her abdomen, pulsing larger achingly one at a time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ass was bouncing around in the confining plastic chair like two purple, pumping balls, creaking the plastic as they inflated larger. and larger. and LARGER. Instantly cracking the chair in back, then on the sides as her thighs got in on the game and bloated out with huge chunks of smooth brown flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the casual, stunned observer however, it would seem like all this growth was merely to support her tits, which were shaking themselves larger and larger. Their bottoms slapping on her expanding thighs as they playfully bounced and inflated out two feet in front of her, then two and a half, then three, all in as many seconds, blowing up above her collarbone as her milky-chocolate skin started to darken to a deep shade of forest green. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACK! Went the chair, and RIP! went her purple power skirt as she collapsed unceremoniously on the floor, now shaking and wobbling all over, moaning loudly as she began to truly erupt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other heroes had gathered in a circle around her, expecting a new Hulk in their midst already, and the crowd also duly backed away to give the expanding teacher room to grow, her purple and white clothes now lying in tatters on her shuddering, expanding, prone form, having exploded off her body like balloons popping, not something that even happened to the hulk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor while they were expecting a hulk-like transformation, then couldn't have guessed the extent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne only had to look at the respective, untransformed bodies of Ms.Obunde and Mr.Banner to appreciate the eventual magnitude of the difference in their change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor what most people did think about was that gamma interacted with DNA. Ms.Obunde's DNA was obviously aligned to give her a generous, some would say over-generous body, and the growth she was receiving, the eventual size she would achieve, were equally over-generous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big, big, green boobs that grew onto the frame of the frail Jen Walters on Tabitha Obunde were going to become as large as weather balloons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamma interacted with DNA not like addition, but like multiplication. Few knew this, and as Bruce Banner quietly backed out of the auditorium, there were even fewer present that knew it, but Tabitha was figuring it out, she was a bright girl, and was enjoying the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was currently moaning, groaning, sighing and yelping. Her eyes clamped shut and her thick, thickening lips grinning, puckering and smirking, gasping wide in delight as her huge, forest-green body popped, bulged and grew in all directions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom many perspectives now, only her muscles, her tits, and her expanding, somehow intimidating, darker-than-the-darkest-forest-green afro could be seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut most eyes were focused on her tits, which were growing faster than the rest of her, a LOT, and were each about as big as her whole body, growing one side, then the other, pumping and bloating up and out with abandon. Huge, inflating watermelons bigger than those at a fair, hooked up to a gamma pump that were shooting them higher and higher with supernatural size, each green, sweating jug now about the size of a refrigerator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bellowing moan was heard as two ink-green, immense nipples popped into prominence atop them, her eyes suddenly went wide and she shot her huge, growing arms up against her gamma-boobs, grasping as much of them as she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my GOD!\" she cried. \"My TITS!!\" The bellow rattled panes of glass in the skylight up above and shoved many boners into the pants of all attendant that could achieve them through the fear of this uncontrolled, expanding, muscling-up beast of a woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing her now dark-green blobs as they blew up higher and higher, Tabitha felt her ass surge up off the floor, tilting her green, greasy, embiggening cunt up into the air and sucking her conservative white panties into the darkness there. She felt her back loose contact with the floor, but briefly, as her back involuntarily tensed and exploded with size, doubling in width and depth like a green power balloon and colliding back with the floor, cracking it as her tits just soared up higher in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shoulders were the size of Yoga balls now, and were clearing out chairs left and right as her tiny feet thickened and propped up into the air on beachball-sized green calves that squeaked as they bloated and dragged along the floor on her lengthening, tree-like legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This feels AMAZING!!\" Tabitha moaned through a feral grin. Her throbbing could be heard as she grinned and grabbed her tits, spreading out her elbows as her green flesh squeaked on the floor, flexing out her expanding mass and giving it room to grow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything started pumping up even more rapidly. Her bones could be heard cracking and groaning as her muscles collided with one another in her growth. She had to be eight feet tall now, her afro pressing into the stage and her feet nearing the edge of the heroes, who had backed up further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe \"Mmmphed\" and rippled her body. Then just spread eagled and let it expand. Her head disappearing as her afro pillowed into the stage and then crunched through it. Her body squeaking on the linoleum tile and the cracking of the wood heard as her head cracked into the bottom of the stage and it crumpled inward, further destroyed by her gigantic green traps. and wide, plug-like neck, thicker than her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow muffled, yet somehow amplified by the echoing box of the stage, could be heard hear booming, expanding laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer huge green tits with their attendant, ink-dark nipples were bouncing high above the stage. Her still petite-looking feet, now as big as dogs, were twelve feet out in the audience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to stand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tabitha was, in truth, collecting her thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew, and all the crowd and the heroes in the audience knew, that they were now looking at a creature much more powerful than the Hulk ever was. And that was pretttty goddamn powerful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha's unique genetics; those of her silently mesomorphic, humble yet cartoonishly curvy self, had expanded her into a massive mini-giantess of a 30-year old reborn gamma girl. <br>\r\nShe felt her rumbling chuckles begin to die away and began to examine her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let her elegant hands drift down to her gamma-thickened hips. She cooed and traced the immensity of her curvature there with her left while her right, other dark-green hand, shining with her black nails on the tips of her long, strong fingers, played amongst the hills and bubbles of her abs, pausing to feel the heavy pulse of her lust as they descended in size towards her sex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere her watermelon-like forearm arm was draped over a true red(green)wood of a thigh; she was forced, almost, by a little gamma spark in her mind to consider the unique way her genetics had shaped her transformation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs were abnormally long, her hips and lats abnormally wide. Her shoulders were equally broad and her ribcage deep and huge, meaning that there was an incredible amount of deep-sea-green ab muscle stormed into a very small (relatively small) space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven her giggles felt threatening to the audience as one hand had now returned to fondling her towering, over-fat left tit and the other brushed amogst the deep-green swells of the immense sea of muscle of her midsection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh! That tickles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice was a combination of oozing power, lust, and good-natured estrogen-fueled wholesomeness. There was none of the feral brutishness usually associated with Hulkification, as if her body just naturally slurped up the gamma energy and became enormous and stronger than strong beyond strong.<br>\r\nShe briefly pondered how much she could lift...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Planets?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shuddered in instant orgasm at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily Thor was standing in the way (sure Thor) and caught the blast of her emission, for a non-Asgardian would have been sent to the hospital. Thor would just have to take a shower, although inwardly in his mead-addled mind, \"methinks not sure how much of this I might never wash off...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, although she was not yet fully self-aware of it, her mind had been enhanced by the gamma energy as well. Neurons were larger and stronger and its mass had actually increased as her afro had grown and grown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had quickly calculated all the strategic ramifications of the situation, and her mind had recalled photographic memory from the past to know intimately her abilities and powers as the Hulk.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Those boys and their comic books she thought. So everyone out there is scared of me. Basically to the point of soiling their pants. It's power. Too much power almost. But it's mine and I might as well use it. MY LORD and it feels sooo good!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha's gamma-enhanced brain released a little pulse of satisfaction and she grew even the slightest bit more massive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of her jolly green giant tits would now fill the entire orchestra of the auditorium if laid on their side, and those threatening, thunderous thighs weren't getting any smaller as they groaned and expanded, Tabitha's deeply separated, deep green quads almost level with some of the heroes eyes as everyone backed up further almost unconsciously as she slowly swelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering all her options, she decided to play a prank that fooled no one and scared them all shitless at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TAB HULK ANGRY\" she boomed as the entire stage above her head broke up and split merely from the sound of her otherwise sweet voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne gigantic green fist burst up through stage left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA leftover black graduation cap that had been discarded in the skirmish of the growing Tab got caught on the top hump of her bicep as it too exploded through the stage and began to go up, and up. and up! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the right! BOOM! Another giant green bicep, this time hatless, ascending into the air, still lit by the lights of the stage, illuminating the surreal, throbbing shine of her immense, green forest of muscle-sex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the mass of ripped boards a wisps, and then skeins, o midnight-green afro expanded as Tab-Hulk expanded her head up into the smiling goddess presence of herself in front of the whole of the audience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any bright ideas Stark?\" asked Reed Richards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had a She-Hulk on your team for a while right Reed? Didn't you ever have to \"calm her down\" eh? Don't those stretchy powers come in hand?\" Anthony Stark was trying to keep his cool although the interior HOD only he could see displayed a \"urine recycling\" indicator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure I know what you're talking about. uh.. Tony.\" replied the reticent Richards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right, I forgot I was talking to the guy who has only ever dated an INVISIBLE WOMAN. Let's all just pray that your tongue can stretch more than your mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This tangent is really not appreciated Tony. Look, the whole time you've been talking she's beginning to stand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RRRAHHH\" Tabitha and her big bouncing green afro couldn't help but be cute as she tried to be threatening as she tore the stage apart where it constrained her, her everyone went flying at 2x4s were unknowingly thrown by her ferocious green form at hurricane speeds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSTOMP! One giant leg arched itself into a giant vaulted pillar, doubled over. Knee 5 feet up in the air now her giant green ass still on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSTOMP! Another dog-sized, black-nailed foot planted itself as the impossible sea of impossibly strong bulges that was Tabitha, achingly, slowly righted herself until her Afro was Jammed up against the 20-foot tall high-school auditorium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah I'm just kidding! I feel great though!\" Her voice was booming throughout the place casually, sensually, her still with her sweetness to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's that hat? I was really having fun with it.\" She leaned down, stunning almost everyone with the sight of her shoulder-spread and the sudden pooled, quivering sea of her cleavage, and plucked it up again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I REALLY cannot believe the size of my MUSCLES!\" She briefly flexed, doubling herself in size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bruce was never this big! Bruce Banner! Is he still here?! How do I know who he is? No matter. Watch this class! Remember everyone to stay in school!\" Flexed up her enormous bicep and placed the black cap on top, looking like it was sitting on top of a relaxed prize-winning watermelon. Then she flexed, and BUMP went the bicep, up into two, and then three, and four and five as she stared up and up and up at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black hat tightened and split as she watched, snug and high up above her fist, mid-level with her huge green hair on the top bump of her shining stack of muscles upon muscles, eight biceps high. In time it would come to be known as the \"Obunde Bicep\", watermelons stacked with forest-green bowling balls stacked with even bigger and smaller lumps and mounds of gamma-fueled she-muscle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe relaxed the stack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems appropriate.\" She grabbed a boob and smiled. \"As I've definitely graduated into goddess-hood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe peered down at the assembled crowd and pondered what to do next. They were already afraid of her so there was only one answer. Assert her dominance.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thor. Give me your hat.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He could barely see her face for her tits, and that was only because she was flexing her two big pillows of pectoral meat out in order to spread them. The relatively minuscule Norse god struggled to communicate with a vision of such power and... abs. So many abs\u2026 <br>\r\n\t\u201cMy Helm?\u201d He stared up at her now stern expression through the cavernous depths of gamma-cleavage, to either side were twin swells of heaven, or deeply shadowed hell. \u201cB-b-b-but my lady! Twas\u2019 forged in the depths of Nidavellir. \u2019Tis precious to me, and is nigh indestructible\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n\tTabitha ignored Thor. \u201cI\u2019ve done the math\u2026\u201d she said, churning and rolling the valley of her pecs at the man. She raised her eyebrows, \u201cI have a bigger brain now you know. As well as very big muscles, and I can feel every inch of my them.\u201d She stood in the classic \u201csuperhero\u201d pose, hands on her hips and lats spread out. She idly sent a few rippling waves of mass across herself for effect that made Reed Richards gasp. \u201cMy perfect genetics have allowed the gamma radiation to make me far larger and stronger than any Hulk you every knew, and by estimating from an intuitive understanding of my volume and mass, I\u2019d say I\u2019m approximately 8 times the size of the previous Hulk.\u201d She settled into her width and popped out the individual heads of her enormous delts and tris one by one as she spoke, \u201cThat makes me infinitely stronger than all of you put together.\u201d <br>\r\n\tThor had his hands clasped tightly around his winged helmet as if to stuff it onto his head, an insolent look on his face. \u201cNay Madam Hulk! \u2019Twas gifted to me by the all-father himself!\u201d <br>\r\n\tShe snarled down at relatively puny man. \u201cAre you sure you want to disobey me, little god? I\u2019m the strongest one there is.\u201d Tabitha raised an arm and it flexed up with a \u201cBloomp!.\u201d She started to expand her bicep towards the ceiling, pulling in her dark green fist and squeezing up a second mound on top of her first one. \u201cSince I\u2019m eight times the Hulk\u2019s size, and can flex up eight biceps on top of my biceps, I\u2019m going to give you till the count of eight to give up your helmet. It will make a good demonstration of my strength to burst apart your indestructible hat with my strength. I have a lesson in mind. Three.\u201d <br>\r\n\t\u201cBloomp!\u201d went her arm, bulging up with green mass to the height of her fist. She was only three peaks up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow big do you think that thing is Reed?\u201d Tony Stark asked Reed Richards. <br>\r\n\t\u201cHer bicep\u2026s?\u201d Reed replied. \u201cHard to say Tony, she looks about 16 feet tall, so\u2026\u201d he looked at Tony curiously, \u201cCan\u2019t you scan it? And why do you care?\u201d <br>\r\n\t\u201cI can\u2019t scan it.\u201d Tony replied, with mild irritation, \u201cAnd I\u2019m trying to figure out how powerful she is, obviously. Some aspect of the gamma rays she\u2019s emitting are messing with my equipment. Making it malfunction. Whenever she does that weird flexing thing with her bicep I get a huge spike. Adding peaks on top of peaks like that\u2026.\u201d <br>\r\n\tReed Richards gave Tony a sly look. Did he have a thing for muscles on girls? \u201cSince when do you have a thing for muscles on women Tony?\u201d Reed sometimes enjoyed just throwing the cards on the table. <br>\r\n\tStark blushed inside his suit. \u201cSince Jen Hulked out seriously a couple times. Just shut up about it Reed, shit I can\u2019t keep anything from you.\u201d <br>\r\n\tReed snorted. \u201cAren\u2019t you ignoring the elephant in the room Tony?\u201d <br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d He was staring up at the woman of his deepest dreams, the size of several elephants put together.  <br>\r\n\t\u201cThe device that powered her up?\u201d <br>\r\n\t\u201cOh that.\u201d said Tony, starting to drool, \u201cI already went to check and the device broke on the first shot. Typical amateur mad scientist stuff. How he managed to make it work we\u2019ll have to figure out. I\u2019ve got the Witch and Squirrel Girl detaining him right now. He seems particularly taken with Squirrel Girl. Probably a furry.\u201d <br>\r\n\t\u201cA What?\u201d said Richards.<br>\r\n\t\u201cInternet.\u201d said Stark. \u201cBut anyways. We going to stop this woman or what? You got any ideas?\u201d <br>\r\n\t\u201cI think it\u2019s best to wait and see Tony, she could be a valuable asset. She seems to have retained her full intelligence. And teachers are always good people.\u201d He looked at Tony with a concerned face, \u201cRight?\u201d  She was so ridiculously overpowered. <br>\r\n\tTony looked back at Reed and righted himself. \u201cKinda?\u201d he said. \u201cIn the meantime I\u2019m going to put in a call to Dr.Strange. Nothing you or I have here can stop a Hulk of that size. And she seems to be using her gamma energy to create mass extensively. I\u2019d like to have him here in case we need to portal her somewhere else to calm down or something.\u201d <br>\r\n\t\u201cFine Tony.\u201d replied Richards, \u201cbut I\u2019m going to wait and see what happens. Thor doesn\u2019t mind playing with green giantesses I assure you. Probably got his first erection at the sight of a nude frost giantess\u2026\u201d Reed\u2019s mind wandered as he observed the spectacle at hand, but Thor was definitely bulging in his costume, still covered with whatever he couldn\u2019t sluice off of Tabitha\u2019s juices. <br>\r\n\t</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\t\u201cSix\u2026\u201d Tabitha calmly stated, as she looked down to Thor, then back at her arm. \u201cFwoomp!\u201d went another peak, getting dangerously close to a part of the auditorium\u2019s ceiling structure. Thor was practically quivering at the sight. Her deep green sea of ab-muscle was rolling at him in waves, her thighs pumping out larger to either side of his still-soaked body like inflating green rubber trees, thicker than giant Sequoias. Her calves throbbed bigger directly in front of him as she shifted her multi-ton weight on dainty black-nailed toes that crunched into the floor.  <br>\r\n\t\u201cSeven!\u201d she called. A combined \u201cFwoomp!\u201d and \u201cSQUEeeaAaaL\u201d were heard as her bicep went molding up into a particularly thick girder. The top peak of her cartoon-like stack of strength was now mid-afro in height, or nearing the ceiling of the 20 foot building, far above her fist. She squeezed her fist. The girder groaned and a ripping sound was heard as her muscle exploded into the material, easily pushing it aside. The building shook slightly.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\t\u201cEIGHT!\u201d Tabitha had reached the end of her count, she looked down at Thor expectantly, not having to say a word. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\t\u201cHere!\u201d Thor\u2019s quivering hands extended his winged helmet to the sizable gamma-woman. \u201cTake it! \u2019Tis but a\u2026 hat. As you said. I can always obtain another.\u201d Tabitha grinned and reached down to pluck his helmet by one of its wings with her elegant, black-nailed fingers. <br>\r\n\t\u201cThank you Sir Thor.\u201d she chuckled in her somewhat deepened voice, still with her strong formal African accent,  \u201cYour generous donation to science will not go unrewarded.\u201d She turned to the crowd. \u201cObserve class. And all of you for that matter.\u201d She scanned the audience quickly with glowing eyes, looking for the telltale expressions of rebellious attitudes amongst the gathered superheroes and fellow teachers. \t\t<br>\r\n\tEveryone that wasn\u2019t a prude with shut eyes looked upwards at the now-nude, green, gigantic Ms.Obunde. It seemed like all of the inhibitions of the former shy teacher had been flung out the window. She smiled broadly and flexed her bicep back up, saying \u201cObserve,\u201d as if anyone wasn\u2019t looking at her muscle already. She then relaxed a few of her peaks, collapsing the wedding cake of her towering muscle back down by three or four notches so that she could place Thor\u2019s helmet on top of the bulging mass. The once-proud helm looked particularly silly and out of place, like a piece of Norse costumery placed on the head of a deep-green snowman made of too many mounds. <br>\r\n\t\u201cThis shall be a lesson in Materials Science. The first task is to bring Thor\u2019s helmet to its point of tension.\u201d Tabitha smiled and lifted her left pinky to expand up a particular segment of her gamma-infused arm. It neatly grew to the size of a head, filling up the inside, \u201cI\u2019m going to teach you all a lesson about, quote, \u201cindestructibility.\u201d\u201d She smiled down at them with a superior smirk, \u201cAaand for you advanced students, a lesson about the Modulus of Elasticity.\u201d Tabitha then pointed to Thor\u2019s helmet, or more appropriately to her own bicep filling it up, and started to tighten and loosen her fist. Otherworldly squeaking and whining noises were heard to emanate from the Nidavellierian forged helm. As her forearm throbbed, she expanded and contracted the muscle in and out, in and out, torturing the steel but just bending it. She began to instruct, her tone playful and stern at the same time. <br>\r\n\t\u201cAll metal can have varying degrees of elasticity, and you can see and hear how this particular, indestructible metal does as well.\u201d She pumped her fist and tightened it as bulging green flesh squeezed out from the faceplate and snapped the helmet tight with a \u201cCREAK!\u201d Tabitha continued her lecture, pointing and gesturing at her bicep as she did so. \u201cAll metals also have what is called a modulus. Just imagine a chart denoting the stress on this indestructible helmet here as I expand my muscle within it.\u201d She started to tighten her fist further, swelling her top bump up into the helmet and making it squeal and whine in Asgardian shock as it was slowly rent apart by her might. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re like me, more powerful than a dozen hulks put together, EVERYTHING has a modulus of elasticity, especially indestructible metals.\u201d The scorn and simultaneous glee in her voice were apparent as she continued her demonstration. \u201cEvery metal will stretch to a certain point, beyond which it cannot stretch anymore. This is called the point of deformation, and is determined along the modulus of elasticity by the brittleness of the material.\u201d <br>\r\n\t\u201cCRINK!\u201d With a slight burst of extra gamma power, she burst her arm up and out, filling the helmet to the brink of destruction. \u201cNow observe students, as I take Thor\u2019s helmet beyond the point of deformation, demonstrating the brittleness of this indestructible metal with my super-powered flesh.\u201d she bent her brow in concentration and stuck her cute green tongue out of her plump, pumped up lips, then slowly brought up the middle knuckle of her squeezing fist and watched, as with a horrendous \u201cSQUEEAK\u201d and then a \u201cCRACK!\u201d, her sixth head of bicep muscle exploded up through the crown of Thor\u2019s helmet, jolting its wings. Then with an \u201cMMFF\u201d she tightened her fist and the thing cracked altogether in half as her six peaks exploded. <br>\r\n\tThor gasped, as she obviously wasn\u2019t even using close to her full power. It clanked to the floor, rendered asunder.<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere!\u201d she laughed, \u201cClass dismissed!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMs.Obunde put her hand on her hip again before flexing up her other bicep for the students and superheroes. Infusing it with gamma might, she pushed up peak after peak on that muscle. She enjoyed showing off, she enjoyed destroying these \u201chats\u201d with her bulging arms. She had a brief image of herself as the ruler of the world, two enormous eightfold biceps flexed up with a crown atop each, framing her powerful, splendid mass of hair. \u201cQueen Tab-hulk Obunde\u201d she whispered to herself, and let loose a little moan at the sight of her towering flexed peaks, shining green and bulging obscenely. Then a thought came into her mind. \u201cHmm\u2026\u201d she pondered her bicep, but then suddenly shuddered as she forcibly shook the thought from her head. That wasn\u2019t her was it? She was a nice girl! A teacher! \u201cWhy am I acting like this?\u201d she asked herself, before looking back down at the crowd. \u201cI teach science\u201d she thought, casually examining her arms and wondering what to do next. \u201cAnd now her muscles are bulging out of my skin like an anatomy chart.\u201d Her gamma control allowed her to feel and flex each muscle individually. The audience saw her back surge and ebb from the front as she waved it like a flag.  She still wanted to display her power\u2026 how about a demonstration of anatomy? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t</span></div></div>",

The beef was crammed in between shoulders as wide as a car was long. A chorus of gasps was heard as her massive ass was displayed above their heads. Each bulging, segmented cheek was the size of a bale of hay, and quivered and shook like baby elephants going through tremors as she gently placed a fist on each, pumping out triceps bigger than horses as she began to spread her lats and pump up her back.<br>\r\n\t\u201cCall out the muscles as I flex them class.\u201d Two enormous organ pipes of green strength blew up along her spine as young nerd Billy Egbert cried, \u201cErectors! Spinal erectors!\u201c he paused, \u201cDeep group.\u201d The boy was experiencing a definitively deep non-spinal erection for his own part. <br>\r\n\t\u201cVery Good Billy.\u201c she cooed. Tabitha\u2019s deep rumbling voice seemed soothed. \u201cAnd these?\u201d Tabitha blew out her lats, one on a side, squeezing out her width to incredible levels and taking up all the room in the room, her elbows touching the walls.<br>\r\n\t \u201cLatissimus Dorsi!\u201d cried the nebbish Amanda, another of Tabitha\u2019s pets. \u201cGreat job Amanda! But what group are they in?\u201d \u201cSuperficial group!\u201d she called, eager to get the now super-powered teacher\u2019s approval even more than ever. \t\u201cExcellent.\u201d called Tabitha. \u201cLast group. Who can tell me what group of muscles these belong to?\u201d Tabitha kept blowing individual muscles out of her power-flung back with casual ease; two individual groups of bubbled muscles were pumped up and jammed in between her rhomboids and traps, waving at them, but the nerds were stumped. Seconds passed and Tabitha inflated even more muscles under the particular anatomical classification she was looking for, making crazy piles pop out and surge against one another down and out near her spine, another set of crazy bubbled ridges pushing aside her erectors and lower lats like there was not enough room for all the muscle in her body. She wiggled and fanned the four groups of muscles in a fluttering rhythm. \u201cNo one?\u201d her question lingered in the air. <br>\r\n\t\u201cS-s-s-serratus posterior inferior and s-s-s-serratus posterior s-s-superior\u2026 Intermediate group\u2026\u201d muttered Grant Jenkins, one of the most active muscle heads in the school gym. The jock didn\u2019t want to say anything, but the emasculating amount of strength on display swayed his mind, and his lustful soul.  \t\u201cIs that Grant Jenkins?\u201d her voiced dropped to a purr, \u201cOh, very good Grant. I thought you never paid attention in class.\u201d She kept her back lightly flexed but stopped waving her serratus around. \u201cBut now for some extra credit. Name the individual muscles as I flex them out for you.\u201d Two big wedges of beef popped and then slabbed out on top of her lats, dividing them into segmented bulges. Young Billy had this one. \u201cTeres Major!\u201d he cried. <br>\r\n\t\u201cVery good Billy, but give someone else a chance.\u201d She concentrated and heaved out two shoebox sized bulges that rounded off and split above the sea of muscle shapes around and below them. <br>\r\n\t\u201cRhomboideus Minor!\u201d Abigail Renwick from Monica\u2019s class got in on the action. <br>\r\n\t\u201cTwo points to you my dear!\u201d Tabitha continued to pump out her muscles as the students named them off. <br>\r\n\t\u201cExternal Obliques! Lumbar!\u201d She ticked off the list of muscles in her mind as she pumped them up and nodded in satisfaction when one of the many students in the crowd called them out. She would help out when no one came to the fore with answer.  \u201cNo one? Levator Scapulae.\u201d she wriggled some muscles near her neck, lapping and writhing over other muscles like oversized pythons swallowing prey, \u201cand these are the Sacrospinalis!\u201d from under the mass of boulders she had flexed even more rocks rose to the fore and pushed aside the muscles that were already bulging there. <br>\r\n\tWhen would she stop? Her back was so big now it was pushing her arms into the walls of the building, wider than she was tall. The top of it, her traps, had risen all the way up to her afro. Her lats were pushing out so thick and deep they had gone from a V, to U, to a W. Cracks and rumbling noises were heard inside the auditorium as Tabitha\u2019s anatomy lesson was expanding her too big for the building! Then, satisfied with the knowledge displayed, she relaxed her gigantic green back and the muscles collided and meshed back together. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief as the former teacher deflated to a more reasonable size. No one wanted to confront her.<br>\r\n\tShe turned around and was about to continue her display on the front side, priming up her legs with a quick pump, when suddenly a thought came to her mind. She had been ignoring the elephant in the room, and it wasn\u2019t her elephant-sized muscles! With heavy booming and crunching, Tabitha took a few steps over to where Dr.Keller was being restrained from tinkering with his machine again by Squirrel Girl and the Scarlet Witch. From her 16 foot height she said down to him, \u201cSo you\u2019re the little man who made me big.\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\t</span></div></div>",

In a situation like this, a futile, yet courageous assault might prove a welcome distraction. Or it just might make her mad. <br>\r\n\t\u201cNot yet.\u201d said Tony, \u201cI hope he\u2019s not off in another dimension where we can\u2019t reach him, as usual. This woman could become a situation\u2026\u201d He was stunned, however, by the display of sexiness and might before him. <br>\r\n\t\u201cThis is your machine huh?\u201d Tabitha slowly bent down to the amateur scientist and his captors, displaying an abundance of cleavage and chesty mass as she descended on them like a forest-green avalanche of muscle. The Scarlet Witch and Squirrel Girl both slackened their grip at the sight; stunned into feeling like little girls at the display of such abundant pulchritude and power. <br>\r\n\t\u201cYes it is!\u201d the rebellious Dr.Keller replied, \u201cAnd your power was meant to be mine!\u201d suddenly he bolted from the two girls grasp and slapped his hand down on a button of the machine. To everyone\u2019s surprise, the thing fired up again, hitting Tabitha straight in the tits! They watched the stunned woman as the green energy from the gun started to collect her gamma power, slightly diminishing the size of her mammoth boobs and turning them brown again where it was hitting. \t\tThat is, before Tabitha un-stunned herself. \u201cOh no you don\u2019t!\u201d she said, and neatly brought her foot down on the machine, crushing it completely in front of Dr.Keller and crushing his hopes and dreams. Her elegantly small, dog-sized foot wriggled its black-nailed toes in the wreckage of his machine as a calf bloated out above her sapling-thick girlish-looking ankle to the size of a Volkswagen Beetle. \u201cYou may kiss the muscle that destroyed your machine. You might as well worship the power you helped create, little scientist.\u201d <br>\r\n\tShe turned her calf to him and pressed down on her toes, expanding it towards him slowly, like a creaking wall of green flesh. He stood stock still until her luscious dark green skin practically touched his face. Dr.Keller\u2019s mind was broken by the sight of the huge mass of feminine muscle, and by the sheer size of the woman that towered over him by so many feet. Multiple copies of himself would easily fit curled up in her lower leg. She was keeping it casually flexed out for him, barely paying attention to his insignificant form as she inspected her tits for shrinkage. He looked up to her as he began to spread his hands as far out as they would go, sliding them along the calf muscle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGet Strange on the line.\u201d said Reed Richards. <br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m trying!\u201d said Tony Stark, \u201cBut he\u2019s got magical call blocking or something and it\u2019s not my strong suit!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m waiting\u2026\u201d Tabitha intoned. Dr.Keller also un-stunned himself at the urging of the green giantess and planted a kiss on her calf, then planted another, and another, leaving a dark trail of saliva on her flesh. She cooed and fondled her gigantic boobs in happiness; she could feel the sapped gamma energy being replaced by her own limitless internal batteries! <br>\r\n\tDr.Keller was briefly distracted from his task by the sound of rubbery flesh expanding. With a \u201cshoooop\u201d and another \u201cshoooop\u2019\u201d both of her slightly shrunken breasts blew out even bigger than before, overwhelming her hands and her big arms with their expanding mammary mass. He looked up in wonder, his machine had only made her stronger!  \u201cOh my god! Yeah! Come on back my lovely girls!\u201d her nipples strained against her hands at the ends of breasts sticking out so far she could hardly grasp them. <br>\r\n\t\u201cI am so.. so huge!!\u201d Tabitha couldn\u2019t help but blurt out her thoughts, as Dr.Keller ferociously returned to his task, even going so far as to lick and bite a throbbing vein pulsing with gamma energy, the thickness of his arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe\u2019s what??\u201d barked Tony Stark into his suit. \u201cHaving tea with an astral aspect of Agamotto?\u201d he was shouting at Wong, Dr.Strange\u2019s assistant. \t\t\tMeanwhile Mr.Fantastic was having a side conference with the Scarlet Witch while Squirrel Girl just looked on in wonder at Dr.Keller and his calf, idly holding her small, yet firm squirrely bicep and flexing it in and out. <br>\r\n\t\u201cI wish I could get guys to kiss my muscles like that\u2026\u201d she thought, her tail twitching back and forth as she craned her neck back to watched the super-hot Hulk fondle herself in pleasure at the worship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHa!\u201d Tabitha laughed at her own size as she juggled her bosom. \u201cThese tits are ludicrous! Where\u2019s Monica?\u201d she boomed. She singled out a pretty, black-haired woman from the crowd, shucking off the suddenly lovestruck Dr.Keller with a twitch of her leg. All the students backed away in awe from the two. Monica was rooted to the spot and her knees were starting to shake. \u201cMooonnnniiiiicaaaa\u2026. you always said my boobs were big enough to laugh at right? How come you're not laughing now huh?\"  She bent over and squeezed her breasts together, then grabbed Monica by the back of her head and pushed her inexorably into her otherworldly cleavage with one finger.  \u201cAre you going to say something about them now? Huh? These tits were 3 times bigger than your head just a little while ago\u2026\u201d she jiggled them heavily, \u201cNow they're three times the size of your whole body!\" Monica was trapped in a laughing earthquake of dark-green tit.<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnyone else feel like laughing at big, busty Tabitha Obunde?\u201d she asked, calmly standing back up and leaving the normally feisty Monica weak and speechless on the floor. She grinned and started pumping out her pecs for the crowd. The huge green things grew and grew, puffing out and out with mass and strength. Her big green chest muscles took her wobbling weather-balloons of breasts along for the ride, swelling the whole of her chest to absolutely massive dimensions. When she was done ballooning out her pecs she smiled at the crowd, looking down over dark-green lobes brushing up against her elegant chin on either side. The way that double-double bubble-bubble of boob-pec meat just exploded out in space was intoxicating to her. Tabitha moaned softly at the sight; filling the auditorium with her size and dominating the room with her womanly assets was getting her hot. <br>\r\n\tShe brought a big hand up and brushed it over her pecs, smoothly letting her fingers flow in and out of ridges as she followed it down to where it joined her breast. Then, pressing in slightly, she following the molten orb of her boob out to the limit of her arms extension, where she greeted her indestructible nipple with a pinch, then a squeeze, and a hard grasp and fondle. Her hips started to buck and swirl at the sheer power she felt, and a hand dipped down to fondle her sex. \t\u201cThor.\u201d A carnal grunt escaped her thick lips, \u201cgive me your Hammer.\u201d <br>\r\n\tThe blood drained from Thor\u2019s face for the second time that day, but his manhood was unflagging. \u201cSurely she cannot destroy Mjolnir.\u201d he thought. Thor tried to remain calm as he spoke up to Tabitha. \u201c\u2019Tis questionable if you could lift it Madam. Even at your size, only the worthiest\u2026.\u201d He paused; she would not stop molesting herself in front of him! <br>\r\n\t\u201cTHOR!\u201d she bellowed, blowing his and everyone else\u2019s hair back, \u201cI want it now!\u201d <br>\r\n\tThor meekly drew his hammer from his belt and held it up to Tabitha, handle extended with the head resting in his palm. She bent down to grasp it, one hand still fondling her sex, but found it would not so easily come! She applied a little more effort. Her monstrous traps humped up a little bit higher as she tugged and grunted, her dumpster-sized deltoid expanding and crunching into definition. She applied more gamma energy to her body with her mind, increasing her strength and size, determined to conquer this godly dildo.<br>\r\n\tWith a gasp, and a \u201cNay!\u201d Thor felt the hammer lift from his outstretched palm, the muscles of her tree-like arm above him swelling so large they threatened to block out the view of her gorgeous face. She was lifting it with one hand, chuckling, still fondling herself. Poor Mjolnir! <br>\r\n\tAs Tabitha\u2019s monstrous shoulders spread out and her upper-body filled with new mass and might, she was easily able to handle the impossible tool. The 30-year old teacher felt the power surging through her and deftly flipped the hammer above Thor\u2019s head before jamming its thick end into her crotch and yelling, \u201cBlow you sucker! Blow! Light me up baby!\u201d <br>\r\n\tMjolnir, half-sentient hammer that it was, responded to this demand by lighting up Tabitha\u2019s cunt with a burst of lightning that surged up over her wicked abs and swept out over her massive thighs and hips like webbed veins of electricity emanating from her crotch. Her moans began to get louder and a rumbling vibration could be heard as the massive Tab-Hulk shook and moaned with pleasure. <br>\r\n\tHer sexual endeavors sped up, her bellowing cries got louder and the building began to shake as she brought herself closer to the brink of orgasm. The teachers were covering what children\u2019s eyes they could while staring in wonder at their transformed co-worker. Tabitha meanwhile was very much aware of the absurd lewdness of her actions, but she didn\u2019t care. It was increasingly apparent that by virtue of her transition, she had lost all her inhibitions and gone from an overdeveloped doll of a shy conservative woman into this hulking mass of rampaging overpowered sex.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I think we can no longer wait for Strange.\u201d Reed was saying into the Scarlet Witch\u2019s ear. \u201cDo you think your hex power would have any affect on her?\u201d <br>\r\n\tWanda scrunched up her brow. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, you know? She\u2019d have to be doing something. And what can hurt the Hulk? Especially this one. I could try to just hit her with a big whammy of hex, but you saw what her boobs did right? They just grew back bigger!\u201d Wanda sadly touched her own, definitively less shelf-like chest. \u201cAnd anyways.. it\u2019s just.. HER. You know. The Hulk! There was hardly anything any of us could do to him before, and now it\u2019s her, and she looks so much more powerful than Bruce ever did. Why is that?\u201d <br>\r\n\tReed furrowed his brow. \u201cTony\u2019s been unable to get any good readings on her, so we can\u2019t be sure, but with the way she\u2019s kept her intelligence I\u2019m guessing that somehow she\u2019s able to willfully control the interaction of the gamma energy with her body, making the impossible anatomically possible.\u201d Reed couldn\u2019t help but ponder reality as he too was somewhat awestruck by Tab-Hulk\u2019s incredible display. Her tits were shaking all over like a pair of green steel weather-balloons containing a series of powerful explosions. Tabitha was moaning as she shot the lightning into herself again and again, working the hammer with speed as it stretched in and out of her hulkish cunt. <br>\r\n\tAn elaborate portal of glowing runes appeared to the left of the group and Dr.Stephen Strange stepped through in a hurry. \u201cThat aspect of Agamotto hasn\u2019t been heard from in ages, and you have to tear me away from\u2026 by the HOSTS!\u201d exclaimed the good doctor, as he craned his neck up to the monstrous sight of the Tab-Hulk having her way with Thor\u2019s hammer. <br>\r\n\tHer face in ecstasy, she had Dr.Keller was wrapped around one calf and Thor around the other, both licking the sensuous curves of muscle that even bulged out the front of her lower leg. They ran their hands over the cords of strength wrapping around her shin and tried to grasp onto the mammoth calves behind. Tabitha was thrusting poor Mjolnir in and out, in and out, her whoops and moans building into a storm of womanly sound. <br>\r\n\t\u201cHoary Haggoth that is a lot of Hulk!\u201d Dr.Strange yelled above the din. He turned to Mr.Fantastic. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan here Reed? She seems to be fast approaching orgasm.\u201d his fingers were twitching and sparking symbols could be seen to emit from his fingertips. \u201cAnd with poor Mjolnir in tow! I don\u2019t think we want to be around when that happens!\u201d <br>\r\n\tReed\u2019s hair barely quivered from the force of Tabitha\u2019s throaty emissions. Mr.Fantastic was always a cool customer. \u201cTry the bands Strange! Or something else! Just try to calm her down!\u201d <br>\r\n\tMeanwhile, the Scarlet Witch was speaking into the Squirrel Girl\u2019s ear, \u201cCan you believe what she\u2019s doing with that hammer?!\u201d Wanda asked. Squirrel Girl could only squeak an \u201cUh-uh.\u201d and shake her head at the sight. A tremor passed through her. She wanted to do that with Thor\u2019s hammer. She wanted men, especially Thor, wrapped around her calves like that. It wasn\u2019t fair!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWanda!\u201d barked Reed, \u201cDo you think you can help Strange?!\u201d \t<br>\r\n\t\u201cI can try!\u201d replied Wanda.<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen hit it you two!\u201d cried Reed.<br>\r\n\tStrange sprung into action. \u201cBy the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak!\u201d he cried, and sent brutal whips of glowing red energy from his gesturing fingers. Big, throbbing bands of crimson whipped over Tabitha\u2019s hulking form with the sound of ripping leather as more and more of the streaming magic bands flew from Strange\u2019s fingers and began to constrict themselves. <br>\r\n\tTabitha\u2019s eyes were shut, but she felt a light tug on the hand fondling her tit. Something was making it slightly harder to fully grasp her nipple. She opened her eyes and was startled to see the bands whipping around her form. \u201cUGHGH!! OH!\u201d she was still grinding the hammer in and out of herself mercilessly. \u201cWHAT DO YOU THINK YOU\u2019RE\u2026 HA HA! TRYING TO DO?!\u201d Tabitha\u2019s voice was abnormally loud, panting from the stimulation. She brought her arm up against the force of the bands, drawing them out like a spider\u2019s web. \u201cYOU\u2019RE GOING TO HAVE TO\u2026 HA HA! DO BETTER THAN THAT!!\u201d\u201d <br>\r\n\tBeads of sweat were gathering on the brow of the Sorcerer Supreme as he strained to unleash the full power of Cyttorak. Tabitha grunted as her body was now almost fully contained by the bands, but it seemed like every time they tried to tighten in one place, her muscles bulged out in another. She smiled down at Strange, lungs still bellowing like a hot air balloon, excess tit popping in and out of her bonds as they struggled to contain her. <br>\r\n\t\u201cWanda, now!\u201d cried Strange. <br>\r\n\tWith a big sweeping movement, Wanda gathered up all the hex energy she could find and sent it at the giant She-Hulk. The bands were instantly strengthened in their task as if by a stroke of good luck. Every time Tabitha shifted her incredible mass a new streak of crimson energy would wrap around whatever she shifted, drawing her arms in like a straight-jacket. The bands were still ripping out of the magician\u2019s fingers at warp speed as he started to shake. Dr.Strange couldn\u2019t remember when he had put this much energy into a spell. <br>\r\n\tStill, there was too much Tabitha for the bands to hold. She grinned as she shifted about, bulging out her mass between the now mummy-like wrapping that trapped her in glowing light from head to toe. The green flesh flowed out from between the crimson bands in rippling pulses. They did not look like they would contain her for long. \u201cHe he he\u2026\u201d she chuckled. \u201cPuny Mortals.\u201d She started to breathe in. <br>\r\n\tThis time even Reed Richard\u2019s perfect coif could not withstand the gale. \t\u201cAAAAAUUUHHHH!!\u201d <br>\r\n\tTabitha turned her gamma energy up to the max with her mind, then gulped in air and started expanding herself like a hot-air balloon hooked up to a volcano. <br>\r\n\t\u201cGet Back!\u201d shouted Ironman. The heroes all backpedaled away. <br>\r\n\tYou could now fit a truck in Tabitha\u2019s upper body, with space left over for a car parked in each breast. The crimson bands groaned as they separated and spread over her inflating mass. She settled her legs apart from one another and blew those out as well. The massive trunks burst into explosive definition. The bands stretched out like fishnets as bubbles and cords of muscle swelled through them into the lights of the auditorium. She then cocked her hips and inflated her ass while slooowly crunching down into a most-muscular pose. With a thousand scintillating bursts of light the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak snapped off like so much cheap rubber. <br>\r\n\t\u201cHow pitiful. And look at me now! I\u2019m the size of a house!\u201d the triumphant Tabitha laughed. She struggled to put her hands on her hips with so much size shoved into her upper body. Slowly, as she let out her breath and ruffled Reed\u2019s hair, her arms settled back down. She squeezed her hips when her hands landed, and giggled. \u201cSo ineffectual. So tiny!\u201d she boomed. <br>\r\n\t</span></div></div>",

Try anything you like.\u201d  <br>\r\n\tFrom bent knee Strange gasped and raised a hand, \u201cBy the Icy Tendrils of Ikthalon!\u201d From his extended hand, a huge cloud of ice and snow enveloped the massive Tabitha, freezing her solid.<br>\r\n\t It was mere seconds before the block of ice that surrounded her started to crack\u2026 <br>\r\n\t\u201cStrange you fool!\u201d cried Richards. <br>\r\n\t\u201cCRACKABOOM!\u201d Tabitha merely squeezed her fist and big chunks of ice exploded off her mass in a rain of icicle missiles. <br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019ve endangered the audience!\u201d Mr.Fantastic whipped himself up into a huge rubbery shield and bounced the icicles back, grimacing at their puncturing force against his supernatural flesh. <br>\r\n\t\u201cCRACKABOOM!\u201c Tabitha pulsed her other fist and the forearm, tricep and bicep of that arm got big so fast that a few icicles actually ricocheted off the walls around Mr.Fantastic and headed back towards the children. <br>\r\n\t\u201cGot it!\u201d Ironman said, and blasted them all out of the air simultaneously with repulsor rays.  <br>\r\n\t\u201cCRACK!\u201d She flexed her toes and out came one of her calves. Her fist punched her grinning face free and only smiled wider, baring her teeth. \u201cHa ha ha!\u201d her laughter boomed throughout the space. \u201cIce? You\u2019ve got to be kidding.\u201d  \u201cCRACK CRACK CRACK\u201d went the ice. Suddenly the other leg was completely loose. Tabitha took in a breath and the ice went everywhere with a \u201cKABOOM!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Sorcerer Supreme was almost running out of juice. \u201cWanda\u2026.\u201d he gasped, \u201cHelp me again.\u201d he raised a quivering hand, \u201cI SUMMON THE CONJURER\u2019S CONE!\u201d <br>\r\n\tThe Scarlet Witch obeyed the Sorcerer and blasted the ceiling with her hex magic, strengthening the spell\u2019s power. <br>\r\n\tMr.Fantastic was familiar with the words. They would transport the victim away to another dimension. \u201cNo Strange! Don\u2019t you remember? It\u2019s the Hulk! She\u2019ll just come back stronger and angrier!\u201d <br>\r\n\tTabitha looked up to see a dark void slowly descending from the ceiling, Dr.Strange had never seen the cone appear this slowly, like it was having trouble with her energy levels. Nevertheless her bouncing afro started to disappear. She reached out her hands to press the cone back, only to have them disappear. <br>\r\n\tSuddenly she came to her senses and was overtaken by a panic. \u201cNo, wait!\u201d She appeared to shrink down to avoid the gaze of the cone. \u201cI\u2019m not a bad person! I just got a little carried away!\u201d She shrunk down more, her skin starting to regain its cocoa hue. \u201cLook! I\u2019m doing this on purpose!\u201d she shrunk again, \u201cI can control it see?\u201d The cone was still descending, following her down as she dwindled to 10 feet tall, then 9, then 8, trying to avoid the snare of the spell. But it was right on top of her! With a supreme force of will Tabitha shrank herself back down as small as she could. She shrunk all the way down to her previous, normal, untransformed size, then ran, sprinting to the edge of the circle. She ducked out just in time to avoid the cone as it inexorably lowered to the ground. Then, with a \u201cZAP!,\u201d disappeared altogether. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTabitha stood stark naked in front of the assembled heroes. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, hands on her hips. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that happens every day. I\u2019m sorry. Like I said. I got a little carried away.\u201d She tried to cover her still overabundant bust with one arm and covered her sex with the other hand. \u201cDoes anyone have any clothes I could wear?\u201d she asked. <br>\r\n\tReed tossed something at her from his belt, and she gasped as a spare Fantastic Four uniform made of unstable molecules whipped around her overabundant body, highlighting her figure marvelously. She looked down at the blue fabric stretched around her chest and poked at the distended white oval with a distorted four in the center. \u201cSure you couldn\u2019t make this an eight?\u201d she asked. Reed ignored her. \t<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat should hold you at any size.\u201d he said. His mind was working again. It was possible that this woman could still be a more useful Hulk than the unstable Bruce. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d he asked. <br>\r\n\t\u201cFine,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m completely in control of my powers, but you probably figured that out already.\u201d She looked at her nails and turned them back to a solid black. \u201cI\u2019m a little angry though. I didn\u2019t actually get to get off.\u201d <br>\r\n\tThe heroes all coughed and looked away.<br>\r\n\tThor meanwhile had slung Mjolnir back in his belt and came striding up jauntily. <br>\r\n\t\u201c\u2019Twas quite the show fair Ms.Teacher.\u201d he said. \u201cEr.. what did you say your name was?\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cTabitha...\u201d she giggled and raised her hand to the attractive God of Thunder. \u201cTabitha Obunde.\u201d He kissed her hand gently. <br>\r\n\t\u201cSuch a gentleman!\u201d she squealed, drawing it back. \u201cHow come more of you don\u2019t know how to treat a lady?\u201d Tabitha then looked around at the assembled group. \u201cSo\u2026. Do I get to join the Avengers?\u201d <br>\r\n\tReed coughed again\u2026 He looked at Tony. Stark was suddenly over-enthusiastic. <br>\r\n\t\u201cSure! We\u2019ll\u2026 \u201c everyone was glaring at him. \u201ctalk about it\u2026 Why don\u2019t you come with us to the mansion for the time being though.\u201d He put a still-armored hand carefully on Tabitha\u2019s shoulder and began to lead her out of the building. She stopped to wave to her students.<br>\r\n\t\u201cBye former students! Bye former life!\u201d <br>\r\n\tWith a sharp laugh she let the Avengers follow her out of the building one by one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\t</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The professor arrived at Avengers Mansion meeting his assistant, Regina Powers, a few hundred yards from where the press conference was to be held.  Regina was a very striking woman with shoulder-length blond hair and a slight build.  She accepted a position with the professor mostly due to the fact that his ideas of gamma research were cutting edge second only to the famous Robert Bruce Banner himself.  She had no idea about the gun that he had found and was about to field test on the Hulk himself.  She just wanted to meet the man who was the Hulk.  There was just something alluring and visceral about a being that was larger than life and had the strength to crush just about anything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rain started to increase until it was almost a steady downpour making it very difficult to see.  For Professor Keller it was a minor inconvenience at best since he was so close in reaching his ambition.  He would not need to see his target, the Hulk, in order to siphon his gamma-spawned strength into the device.  The machine would automatically target the gamma source and expunge the radiation from the target into the gun.  The rain was delaying the festivities but only by a few minutes.  A canopy was set up to keep the Avengers dry from the inclement weather.  Though the professor could not see the Hulk, the gun's LED readouts indicated that the gamma levels near the podium were registering at a very high level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he did not realize was that Samuel Sterns, the evil Leader and the Hulk's arch-enemy, was planning a bit of revenge on the Hulk himself.  The very intelligent Leader had arrived early with some of his synthazoids, pink artificial beings that obeyed his every whim, that were going to spoil the press conference.  He had disguised himself as his large cranium which contained his vast mental abilities would've given himself away.  His plans for the green goliath were unknown at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his gun humming at full power, Professor Keller fired the gun in the direction of the gamma source.  A white beam struck the Leader in the chest and immediately began siphoning all of the Leader's gamma powers out of his body.  His mental might suddenly vanishing, Sterns returned to his normal human form as the beam suddenly became green and retracted the powers back into the gun.

When nothing happened Regina ran up to Professor Keller to see if he was alright as he was on his knees muttering. \"Professor are you OK,\" asked Regina in a concerned tone. She was stunned as the professor got to his feet and just started yelling at her. Finally after calming down he looked at Regina and said we need get out of here. Regina was confused and the look on her face made that crystal clear. As they left the conference and got back to the professor's lab Professor Keller explained everything to Regina. \"Well I do not think it worked as I am still little old me,\" Regina said with a laugh. As soon as she was done saying that the last of Professor Keller anger over what happened left him. After all what was the point of being angry about a plan that was going to fail no matter what? It was then that Regina felt hot all over as if the sun had locked on to her and her alone. Before she could sit down her Regina's skin started to turn to a solid Jade and her muscles begin to inflate. In 30 seconds Regina stood naked in the middle of the lab sporting muscle upon muscle her 8 foot frame. \"Well I take that back professor your plan worked perfect just not on you,\" Regina said with her hands on her hips.</span></div></div>",

Regina just smiled as the professor just hit her again and again. Finally Regina reached out with her right hand and back handed Professor Keller across the lab. The strength of the hulk was intoxicating to say the least for Regina. With the professor knocked out Regina started moving her hands across her body. It did not take long before she was masturbating. She was naked, powerful, and did not have a care in the world. As she finished pleasuring herself she reverted back to plain old Regina and went to take a shower. When she got out of the shower she looked at herself in the mirror and felt weak. She so desperately wanted to stay as the hulk but realized that was not practical. As she reentered the lab Professor Keller was still knocked out cold and then Regina saw the gun that had given her the power she know though was hers by birthright. She grabbed the gun and left the lab. She knew she was not the only gamma powered being on the planet and she also knew that was not right. With the gun in the trunk of her car Regina got out her phone and looked up the address for the law office of Jennifer Walters.

As she exited her car and grabbed the gun she saw a patch of trees where she set up the gun and waited in ambush. As a 2 hours passed Regina thought to herself \"I can wait all day for what I want.\" Finally as the sun was going down and the lights in the parking went on she Jennifer Walters walking out. With her target acquired Regina activated the gun and fired it straight at Jennifer Walters striking her straight in the chest. Within seconds Jennifer Walters shrunk just a little bit as the gamma radiation in her seeped from her body. With the loss of this energy Jennifer Walters collapsed on to pavement about 10 feet from her car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Regina was overjoyed. The power of the Hulk was inside her and it would only be a matter of time before the She-Hulk was hers. Despite her joy she managed to stay calm and drive to a clothing store long enough to pick up a Bikini that belonged on a female sumo wrestle more than a girl with regular frame like she had. Still once she morphed in to the hulk she planned to put it on just long enough to absorb the power that belonged to the former She-Hulk. She drove her car to a group of warehouses near a beach front that had long since been abandoned due to factories moving away from the region. To put it bluntly the warehouses looked like they had been shelled multiple times in a war zone. As she approached the warehouses she was reminded of the razor wire fence that surrounded the complex. \"Now matter\" Regina muttered to herself and she exited the car and thought of all the times she was passed over for an internship, or had was stood up on a date. It worked within seconds her anger triggered the her hulking out as her clothes came flying off. Not a single piece of clothing even gave a second of resistance as her muscles inflated with the power of the hulk. \"This is more like it\" she screamed and for a second Regina wanted to pleasure herself outside the warehouse. \"Business before pleasure girl\" Regina said as as she laughed to herself. With that she ripped off her trunk door and gently grabbed the gun and her bikini. Once the gun was out and laid carefully on the ground and her bikini pieces were on top of it Regina grabbed her car and threw it 300 feet in to the water. With that she decided it was time to get a little modest and put on her bikini which in her hulked out state was way to small. Still it showed off her breasts and she clearly looked sexy in it. With that she grabbed the gun and easily leaped over the razor wire fence. At this point Regina went to the first warehouse and easily ripped off a loading bay door throwing in it to the water as she laughed. \"This is to easy.\" As she walked in to the abandoned warehouse all the remained was a few empty crates, and shipping containers. She set up the gun and set up a 15 second delay as she walked 10 feet away from the barrel. Regina in an overly excited voice started the count down \"5,4,3,2,1,\" as the gun went off. The blast hit Regina and the feeling of having the power of another gamma powered being enter her body was the most orgasmic thing she ever felt and she had back to back orgasms. She quickly shot up to 11 feet in height and her muscles rapidly, doubled, and doubled in size again for a few seconds. Regina screamed the greatest scream of joy in history as the black bikini she had worn for the occasion was a few inches engraved in multiple shipping containers. The fact that a small piece of fabric could go through metal stood in testimony to the power that now surged through Regina. Regina was absolutely pleased with herself as she rubbed her hands all over herself. \"To think only a few days ago I was a weak little college girl hoping to pay for next semester without taking out a loan and now I am the most powerful being on the planet,\" as she laid down and began to finger herself. \"Business is complete for right now\" she said to herself as she continued to masturbate \"but there is one more gamma enhanced being on the planet.\" As she finished pleasing herself for a job well done she passed out. As she went to sleep she said tomorrow I can get the triple crown and absorb \" Abomination.\" </span></div></div>",

Captain America went to the position of attention the two officers who returned their salute and tried to address them before Tony Stark chimed in. Tony Stark grabbed his sunglasses and took them off placing them in the coat pocket of a very expensive suit he was wearing. \"Gentlemen as you are aware both the Hulk and She Hulk have had their powers drained from them. What I want to know is why has the security of Abomination not been transferred to SHIELD?\" The Major started to speak \"Mr. Stark\" before the General stopped him and said \"Mr Stark the military help to create Abomination which I admit was a mistake but since we and SHIELD created him he is our responsibility. Now if you both will follow me you will see that we are taking precautions and increasing our security.\" Captain America and Tony Stark followed the officers to a  waiting vehicle convoy and got in. The Convoy took off going past another checkpoint which had 4 tanks, 6 Humvee's with 50 caliber machine guns on top as well a platoon of Soldiers dug in around the area and manning the gate. A PVT came up saluted grabbed his radio said something and signaled the convoy forward. As the convoy got going again Tony Stark said \"Please tell me that is not the Army's plan to step up security General.\" The General gave a wry smile and said \"No Mr. Stark that is only a small piece of it.\" With the Generals remarks complete the convoy turned right passed another checkpoint with 2 machine gun nests on either side of the road. Once past the convoy came to a halt and everybody got out. The General tapped Captain America on the shoulder and said \"Tell your fellow Avenger here is our plan as he pointed to an air strip.\" On the flight line was close to 100 aircraft all attack planes. As Tony Stark and Captain viewed the impressive amount of air power that was assembled a transport plane was taxing off a runway. As it came to a halt the rear cargo door opened and 100 troops out with all their equipment  and were directed to an assembly area. As this was happening 2 more transports loaded and offloaded more tanks. As this was going on the General looked at Tony Stark and said \"As you can see the military does not need to have its hand held by SHIELD. We realize the situation and are taking preparations. You can tell Agent Fury we have the situation fully under control.\" As the General finished they looked up to see 24 F-16 flying overhead. The Major said \"They are heading to another air strip. An abandoned flight line from WW2 gentlemen. Captain America Sir you might remember since it was from your time but the military buildup after Pearl Harbor was huge. Well due to the unique security situation we are retrofitting every installation near the area.\" The General said follow me gentlemen and he led them a building with a lot of antennas coming out of it as well as satellite dishes all around. Once inside they walked passed a squad of Soldiers all holding their weapons the ready. After that the Major took out a key card and swiped it. After a green light he then entered an 8 digit code bringing them in to a conference room with with several flat screens. The General picked up a remote and turned on a TV. On the top of the screen the words Top Secret were everywhere. Well Mr. Stark \"2 brigade combat teams, several air wings of fighter and attack aircraft, additional helicopter gunships and several more squadrons of aircraft on alert we got this.\" As the General turned off the TV beaming with a certain smugness \"Tony Stark ripped in to him. \"You do not get it General. At best you could slow the Hulk down. Further how long do you intend to keep this level of security up?\" The General in an angry voice responded \"As long as it is deemed necessary.\" Tony Stark then said \"Great General you are ready to repulse an enemy Army but that is not the threat.\" Captain America then got between Iron Man and the General and said \"General we can both see the military is taking this seriously but if you feel you need help please give a call.\"  With that he handed him a cell phone with the latest in encryption. The General took the phone and put it in his pocked and then said \"We got this.\" With that done they headed back to the vehicles and headed back to the outer perimeter. Once they left the 2 Avengers took off and while flying back to SHIELD HQ \"Stark turned to Captain America and said we both know the hulk. He could could make it to Abomination's cell.\" Captain America said \"I know but it is a legal battle right now. Let our legal people do what they have to take jurisdiction of Abominations security. Until then the Army has it.\"  After a few hours they landed at SHIELD HQ and reported to Agent Fury who was furious that SHIELD did not yet have Abomination in their super max Brig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Meanwhile several hundred miles away Regina was closing in the military base and the cell that housed Abomination. She had seen a huge increase in both county and state law enforcement. Hell she had driven through several DUI checkpoints with no problem. Of course unlike the officers manning them she knew why they conducting DUI checkpoints in the afternoon. With that she laughed to herself. All over the radio were announcements proclaiming to not drink and drive and the military had a PR officer talking about an important military exercise going on in the area. In both cases they were asking for support from the public.  She pulled over to road stop to stretch. She was in no hurry now. Today, tomorrow, next week should we drain Abomination and add his strength to her own. As she looked up in the sky she could see contrails in the air from fighter patrols. With this she smiled and after 30 minutes she got back in her car and drove to within 2 miles of the security perimeter. She got out of the car and scanned the horizon. There were 2 main roads that headed to the installation that she knew of from her computer. Regina was very smart and she finally had the physical strength to match her intellect. From her hacking several government sites she knew the entire layout of the complex. What she was not expecting was the massive amount of firepower ringing the base. She was not worried about herself as she knew she could get to where she needed to. She was worried about the gamma radiation gun. With that she had to make a decision. Should she risk destroying the gamma radiation gun or not?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Regina was thinking about what to do when she looked again at one of the main entrances. Two tanks were pulling up and taking up defensive positions along a check point. It was then a light bulb went off in Regina's mind. Then in the next few seconds Regina transformed in to her now Ultra Hulk form. The clothes she was wearing did not rip off of her as much as they burst off. Several of the buttons on her blouse actually ended up stuck in several trees. Such was the power of her transformation. \"Being in my Hulk state always make me horny\" laughed Regina. She was totally naked showing off a muscular physique that was without equal. Her thighs were several feet thick with muscles piled upon muscles. Her abs were a 12 pack that were so defined and sculpted each ab could be a work of art. Her arms were had several beach balls just coming out of them for muscles. Her tits easily would have made even the largest porn stars rack look like a C cup at best. When she was done admiring the nice morning air on her naked body she put on a nice classy bikini. She knew it would not last because either it would be to small when she took the strength of Abomination or more likely it because it was not bullet proof like she was. As it was the material of the bikini was just strong enough to keep from ripping at the movements of Regina's  body in her hulked out state. Regina loved the power she now had running through her but she also knew it would never be enough. Gaining power had become her only goal in life and it is what drove her now. As she rubbed her tits she thought \"And to think not to long ago I was worried about my GPA and keeping my scholarships and grants.\" As she finished playing with her milk jugs she finally started to advance on the checkpoint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 2 Soldiers who were manning a machine gun aimed at the direction Regina was advancing from were not paying attention. Instead they were complaining about leave being cancelled. One of them sat down to eat his MRE when the ground started to shake. The shaking was Regina's footsteps. As Regina approached their position both the Soldiers stood up in time to be knocked back 100 feet. This alerted the Soldiers to what was going on just as an APC went flying overhead. \"What the hell is going.\" Finally the first group of 4 Soldiers saw Regina and started yelling at her as they aimed their weapons and fired. Regina put her hands on her hips and laughed as the bullets just bounced off of her chest. She walked up to each of them grabbed them 2 at a time and threw them in the air. By this time other Soldiers were manning heavy machine guns and the tanks were rotating the turret of their tank to open fire. The Humvee's were the next target for Regina. The Soldiers firing the heavy machine guns to their horror discovered that even their larger rounds were useless against Regina and her laughter quickly caused their courage to flee. Regina grabbed one Humvee and using 1 hand threw it at another 1 causing them both to explode. She repeated this until no Humvee's remained. Finally she went to the first tank and walked in front of the 120mm main gun and yelled \"Fire when ready.\" The tank crew fired and they might have as well have fired a spit ball at her. They fired 3 more times before Regina bored grabbed the main barrel and and twisted it like putty. Next she ripped the tracks off. The tank crew opened their hatches and jumped out. Next Regina ripped open the side of the tank and took out the tank rounds and threw one at the tank. It exploded. She then lobbed the rest of the rounds in to the base destroying targets up to a few miles away. Sirens broke out all over the military installation. Pilots scrambled to their aircraft, tank crews fired up their engines, artillery batteries were loaded, as grunts grabbed their personal weapons and ran to their posts. Regina now sauntered over to the other tank whose crew was to stunned to do anything. Had they been smart they would have retreated but seeing one young women just overwhelm an entire military unit caused them to be frozen. She jumped up on the tank causing the armor to press in and ripped off the hatches. \"Well boys now is your chance to leave.\" The tank crew did not need to be told twice as the exited their vehicle and ran. Regina laughed and she ripped off the turret and then using her hands reformed it and compacted it until it made a nice rifle case for her gamma strength draining gun. She walked back over to her car and took the gun out of her car one last time and placed it inside the tank armor she acquired for a case. Less than a minute after she finished the artillery shells began landing. A 155mm shell hit her car. \"I bet my AAA policy does not cover this\" Regina mused to herself. With the checkpoint defeated Regina began to advance towards her goal. She started singing \"Sticks and stones may break my bones but the military can never hurt me.\"   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Regina pressed forward with her assault. Defensive positions opened fire with everything they had but they might as well have been firing spit wads at her. Everything bounced off without any effect. Well almost no effect. Some Soldiers as they fell back swore some heavier caliber rounds that hit her tits caused them to bounce a little. Of course other Soldiers thought that was just Regina laughing. Either way none of their training prepared them to fight against a gamma powered chick that was completely naked. Some junior officers and seasoned NCO's did remark that at least all of the ordinance they had fired at this chick had destroyed her bikini. Finally some of the Soldiers still firing their weapons looked in the air and saw 50 aircraft  overhead. With air support their morale improved and they doubled their fire. Regina for her part let the first 15 aircraft complete their strafing runs firing their cannons and letting their rockets strike her body. After that she jumped in the air. On her ascent she went right through 4 aircraft. Their pilots never had a chance and their planes fell towards the earth. As soon as Regina landed she jumped in the air again this time grabbing 2 aircraft and throwing them at other planes. Despite their jet engines they could not overcome the force that Regina threw them with. After a few minutes all of the aircraft were swatted from the sky. The Soldiers out of ammo and out hope fell back from their position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n At the main command post the General ordered a drone in to the sky to survey the damage. As the drone gave a live video feed of tanks being smashed of aircraft burning on the flight line, of Soldiers falling back from their positions the General looked at ultra powerful Regina and shouted at the video screen \"You bitch.\" It was all for nothing. The General knew his position was useless. 30 minutes ago it was loud with tanks, artillery, machine guns, and rifles firing. As that gamma powered chick destroyed millions worth of equipment the noise got less and less. The General could do nothing but get on the radio and try and rally his troops. One of his aides a Major came up and said \"Sir Captain America gave you cell phone. Make the call Sir.\" The General turned to face the Major and said the Army can rally we do not need to give up control of our facilities to SHIELD. Now get out Major.\" The Major saluted and left. Alone in his command post the General looked at the latest video feed from the drone. It showed a huge blaze along a flight line. Further back a huge debris field of what once a barracks facility convinced the General his position was lost. He was out of options. He was not going to resort to nukes but his pride prevented him from making the call. He just sat down and put his head on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina was stoked. To think not that long ago she was a weak lab assistant. She was a college student hoping to avoid taking out student loans. Now she was the strongest being on the planet. Finally she made her way in to the mountain facility after ripping a blast door that was designed to survive nuclear weapons off its hinges and tossing it several miles. This was caught by a spy satellite and the General watched this. It was this act of amazing strength that made the General grab the cell phone and called SHIELD. As the Regina moved to the secure brig she finally reached the Adamantium cell the housed Abomination. Regina was stoked this was it. She unwrapped the tank armor from around the  gamma siphoning gun and set it. Inside the cell Abomination was going crazy but he was having no luck breaking his Adamantium chains. Regina laughed to herself and mocked him saying in a sexy voice \"Soon you will not need them big boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As soon as Regina set up the gun she fired and before long Abomination was now more and Emil Blonsky was left laying down unconscious in the cell. Regina quickly aimed Professor Keller's weapon at herself one last time and fired. The effect was instant. Regina shot up to 20 feet in height and her skin color turned from green to a nice California tan. Her tits inflated to twice the size of beach balls. She flexed her right arm and she made a conservative guess that her arms were 49\" inches around. Her abs were an amazing 12 pack with each ab stronger than tank armor. Her legs were easily over 60 inches thick loaded with more muscle than was humanly possible. As she flexed her other arm it looked like several kegs were packed in to her arms. Her back was easily several feet wide at it longest with bowling balls of muscles. Her rear again was solid armor from all the muscle packed on. When the transfer was complete Regina smashed the gun and molded it in to a ball. She juggled the ball around for a few minuted than as soon as she was bored she threw the ball several thousand feet through solid rock and earth. It eventually hit a satellite in low earth orbit. A cover story was quickly created by the military. With her mission at the base complete Regina squatted down and jumped through the mountain. In her exit from the brig she displaced hundreds of tons of rock, and earth. The mountain with the brig resembled a volcano with the opening a visual indicator of where Regina had exited from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Regina landed several miles away and her landing caused a small earthquake. She made her way back to the warehouse and quickly went about pleasuring herself as only she could. She had crushed several military units without breaking a sweat. While Regina was in total bliss SHIELD agents were arriving and relieving the Army of command at crushed base. The General announced his retirement after his crushing defeat. Regina came and as she laid there she thought to herself again about the strength she now had. She was now the only gamma powered being in the world and she was at least 3 times stronger than Hulk had ever been maybe stronger she thought. She could do anything. Who could stop her. Still as she laid there her body pulsing with power she was thinking that had to be a way to get even stronger. Then Regina figured it out. If she was not always go to wear clothes since she was more than willing to show off the new her the least she could do was wear some jewelry. Regina would find and kick the crap out of the Juggernaut.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>    Mary Jane stood off to the side of the podium, enjoying the event like the rest of the crowd.  Over the years she had been around almost all of these superheroes individually, but to see them all gathered together, was truly awe-inspiring.  Of course, being involved with Spider-man all of these years and enjoying his superhuman abilities from a rather intimate point of view, gave her a unique perspective that most of the crowd would not understand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n    She looked over at the assembled heroes, and she was surprised just how much bigger the Hulk was than everyone else, including Thor.  Thor was a god for goodness sake, and the Hulk made him look small, even though he was bigger than anyone else on the stage.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n    As she found herself staring at the Hulk, something truly bizarre began to happen.  At first, she thought that she was imagining it, but as the seconds went by there was no mistaken it.  The Hulk was shrinking down fairly rapidly to his human form, which was for a lack of a better word, puny.  The rest of the Avengers noticed this as well as they all began to mill about uneasily.  Judging by their reactions, Mary Jane knew that something was wrong, this was definitely not a planned event.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Did you see that Peter?\" she asked as she grabbed his arm with one hand while pointing in the direction of the Hulk with her other.  \"The Hulk just shrunk down to nothing, and now he's kneeling down.  You'd better go and check on him to make sure he's alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The assembled crowd began to sense that something was wrong as well, as a collective gasp went up.  People were shouting out random things.  Some yelled out that it might be a terrorist attack.  Spider-man began walking towards the Avengers and Mary Jane trailed a few steps behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Stay here!\" he yelled at her, himself unsure of what was going on.  Mary Jane froze in her tracks and at that precise moment a green beam struck her in the chest and knocked her backwards.  The force of the blow knocked her back at least four feet and she slammed into one of the support beams for the curtain.  Everyone on stage noticed the flash of light and looked at where it landed.  The crowd immediately began to panic, thinking it was an attack on the Avengers.  People started running around, triggering a stampede of sorts towards the exits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The Avengers immediately went into high alert looking for a further attack.  Thor stepped in front of Bruce Banner in a protective mode, as no one was sure as to what would happen next.  Captain America was kneeling down next to Bruce to make sure he was uninjured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"It's gone...it's gone....\" Bruce kept mumbling over and over to no one in particular.  \"What's gone Bruce...what are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Bruce looked up at Cap and weakly responded, \"The Hulk's powers.  I can't feel them inside of me anymore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well, if there not inside of you, where did they go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Spider-man, the Wasp, and a few other heroes rushed towards Mary Jane as they saw her slumped over on her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Mary Jane, are you alright?\" Spider-man asked, worried that something horrific might have happened to her.  He cursed himself for bringing her here in the first place and putting her in harm's way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I'm alright Tiger, take it easy,\" she replied, as a cute smile crept across her face.  She loved it when Peter worried about her.  Peter knelt down beside her, relieved that she was okay.  \"We have to get out of here.  Someone attacked the Hulk.  He's lost his powers, and who knows what will happen next.\"  At that moment, people began climbing up on stage to try and get away from the stampeding crowd.  They began rushing towards the heroes, looking for a way out, or perhaps protection.  The Avengers tried to calm them down, but there were too many people forcing their way towards them.  Spider-man was helping Mary Jane up when they both got knocked over by the rush of people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Spider-man got to his feet and immediately began to look for Mary Jane among the crowd of people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Mary Jane!\" Peter yelled out as he saw her on the ground.  She got to her knees, and began to tremble.  Her whole body shook, as her body began to tingle, and she began to feel light-headed.  Peter looked at her face, and thought that she was about to vomit as her face had turned a shade of green.  He knelt down beside her and placed one arm on her back, and the other on one of her arms.  He was shocked to feel how warm she felt, and even stranger, her entire body was pulsing! <br>\r\n    \"Mary Jane, are you all right?  You're burning up...you're body, it's, uh, it's growing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    He stepped back as her body began violently expanding outward, her muscles tearing through her jeans and blouse.<br>\r\nShe remained on her hands and knees, as her metamorphosis took place.  <br>\r\n     \"What's...happening...to...me....\" she managed to blurt out, as it was obvious to everyone there what was happening to her.  The question of where the Hulk's powers had gone was being answered right in front of the gathered heroes.  Her muscles swelled outward to absurd proportions as her arms, shoulders, and back muscles tore apart her blouse, growing greener with every passing second.  As she was still bent over, everyone had a perfect view of her ass as first her jeans burst apart, and then her panties snapped off, hitting Thor in the face, causing nervous laughter from everyone.  Her leather boots pealed back under the stress of her immense calf muscles that grew larger and larger with each passing second.  Her long red hair grew longer and longer as it spilled out across her widening back, as it turned a dark emerald green.  As she tensed her body she dug her fingers into the stage, tearing into it like tissue paper, as inhuman strength surged through her entire body.  Even kneeling she had grown larger than all of the Avengers with the exception of Thor.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Mary Jane....YOU'VE gotten the Hulk's powers!\"  Spider-man exclaimed as he appeared child-like before his now enormous girlfriend.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n     She turned her head and smiled at him, \"I think that's pretty obvious tiger.\"  She looked down at her breasts, which had grown enormously, and noticed that her nipples had become fully erect.  She wasn't the slightest bit embarrassed by this, as all of her clothing had ripped off of her during her transformation.  She stood up, and as she did everyone backed up to give her space.  She noticed how small everyone looked now, even Thor, as she slowly curled up one of her massive arms.  Her bicep muscle swelled up impossibly so, and she was quick to notice everyone's stunned look of expression.  <br>\r\n   <br>\r\n   Bruce Banner walked over to the now newly-hulked Mary Jane. He certainly wasn't used to this perspective, especially with the recipient of his powers being Spider-man's girlfriend.<br>\r\n    \"Remarkable\" he exclaimed as he reached out to touch Mary-Jane's thigh muscle, which was larger around than his entire body by a comfortable margin.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n    \"Absolutely remarkable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Mary Jane looked down at the scientist with a bemused look, she would certainly be getting that type of response from now on. <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    \"So Doc, I think your muscles look better on me than you.  What do you think?\"  She flexed her thigh muscle as hard as she could, which knocked his hand off of it.  She giggled as he stepped back from her, trying to make sense of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Spider-man walked up to her, his head came up to the underside of her enormous breasts, \"Mary-Jane...how do you feel...are you....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Mary-Jane leaned over and slid one of her long green fingers under his mask.  She lifted it up just past his lips, and then she reached down under his armpits and lifted him up like a child to her face.  His body slid between her breasts, and they on their own could have supported him. <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n      \"Let me show you how I feel\" she said and then kissed him as passionately as she ever had.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Captain America walked up to the kissing couple, \"A-hem....I hate to interrupt this, but I think the question everyone has is what happens next?\"       <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",
