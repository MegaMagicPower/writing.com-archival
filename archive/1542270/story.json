He'd heard many strange stories about this forest, but almost all of them had been proven to be stories alcoholics told in an attempt to get a free drink. He turned a corner around a group of trees and ran into something. Tom picked himself off the ground and saw what he ran into. It looked like a gigantic foot, the ankle coming up to about his waist. He looked upward and found himself gazing at a beautiful 70 foot tall giantess. She had long dark hair that reached to her shoulder blades, her eyes were a brown color. Her skin was slightly tanned, probably from living in the woods her whole life, her breasts and butt were slightly larger than a woman's proportionally smaller than her, and she kept her private parts barely covered by animal skins. She looked down noticing Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs she nice or evil?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thalia looked down at Tom as he repeated his question, \"Can you understand what Im saying?\" Thalia responded \"Yes, I can understand you\" Tom was glad to see that she spoke English, but was worried she may not be friendly, he asked her \"Your not going to hurt me are you?\" Thalia replied, \"No, of course not we only just met\" Tom let out a sigh of relieve that he was in the presence of a gentle giantess. Thalia saw his reaction and giggled, she asked him \"Who are you? What are you doing here?\" Tom replied, \"My name is Tom Wilcons, I'm 24 years old and I was hiking around here when I ran into you, can I ask who you are?\" Thalia said back \"My name is Thalia and I live here, I've heard so much about humans but every time one comes near, I quickly get away from them. They usually think me walking off is an earthquake and run off themselves. But anyway, you're probably the first human I've come into close contact with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom was amazed that he was the first human she spoke with in her whole life; considering the fact there was over 5,000 people who go hiking where he was nearly every year, however he considered the fact the route he took was not on the main trail and was more secluded. Tom tried to speak to Thalia but kept stammering in nervousness through out his sentence, \"Ssssoo, em is t t therrrre a aaa a whole em rr rr rrace of y yo you gia.....em uh\" Tom cut off there because he felt embarrassed calling her a giant considering she was normal size in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThalia giggled at Tom's stammering and found his nervousness cute, she bent down and picked him up with her right hand. This made Tom even more nervous as he was now looking straight into the eyes of a beautiful giantess and was feeling very awkward not saying anything. This was the first time Thalia had spoke to a human so she didn't know what to say, she thought that humans and giantesses thought differently. Thalia said the first thing that popped into her mind, \"You look very cute\", \"Sorry?\" Tom replied, Thalia felt embarrassed as judging from Tom's reaction she said something that would have embarrassed Tom, who then said, \"Um, thanks I guess, If you don't mind me saying I think your beautiful.\" Thalia smiled at Tom's comment and that made her think that he was even more cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThalia got carried away by Tom's comment and his cuteness, she kissed him, the kiss nearly engulfed Tom's upper body. Tom felt his face turned red but he also felt very happy to in the hand of a beautiful giantess that kissed him. Thalia herself felt embarrassed for going too far kissing him when they had only met. She quickly tried to change the subject, \"Are you hungry? Because I could get you some food if you wanted\", Tom replied, \"Weeelllll, are you hungry\" he said politely, he then heard loud gurgling and rumbling from below, he realized it was Thalia's stomach. \"I'll take that as a yes then.\" Tom laughed nervously. Thalia giggled and with Tom in her hand she decided to bring him back with her to her hollowed out tree which she used as a home. Tom had just realized that if Thalia was one of those stereo typical giantesses that ate men, then that kiss would have been a devouring, which would have silenced the gurgling and rumbling in her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way to Thalia's home, they told themselves about each other. Tom was a single guy living in an apartment on his own working as a rookie police officer at his local police station. He always enjoyed going hiking since he was a child when he and his dad would often go camping or hunting. Thalia (who's race of people never kept track of age, just height and puberty) had lived in this forest her whole life. Her mother died when she was young and was raised by her slightly older sister Bakkel who basically looked just enough like Thalia; or Thalia looked like her. Thalia never had a father as her race did not work that way, according to her there were no male giants, only giantesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(The Giantess reproduction system is hard to explain, what they do is they take a human and put them in their uterus, an umbilical chord is grown on the human in the giantesses body and then they are born as giantesses. The human, even if its a man, is born female, this is because the Giantesses are always trying to keep their numbers steady. Because there's so few of them left in the world they basically have to take a human's life so a giantess will be born, but they can't do it too much other wise the humans would get suspicious as to why so many people would go missing in the local forests. It's understandable if one or two humans go missing in the woods and the giantesses lay low until the search parties give up. When the Giantess is born they forget about their human life and think they were a giantess the whole time. To see more on this, go back to the choice of making a \"Nice\" or \"Evil\" giantess, choose evil and go to \"Other\" if you see one category which is labeled \"Shove him up her pussy\" go to that and follow the storyline and different choices you get.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thalia, with Tom still being gripped in her hand, arrived at a very tall, very round and very thick tree. Tom was wondering why she had stopped in front of this one particular tree, he then saw Thalia reach for a some bark that was sticking out of the tree's trunk. Thalia pulled at the bark and it peeled off till Thalia stopped it at a 90 degree angle. The bark acted as a door to inside the tree and it was too heavy and large for humans to pull it open. A wooden pattern with small lined edges around it (kinda like a door) appeared after the bark. Thalia with Tom still in her hand pushed the door way open, it looked difficult for her to push it open because she grunted and pushed hard against it, this was probably so no humans would be able to push it open if they managed to get passed the bark. She went in and closed the bark door and then the thick wood door, she then went around lighting torches and candles which were in protective covers, this way if one torch or candle was dropped or fell out of its place the tree wouldn't be set alight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the tree house there was a bed, a bedside night stand, a dining table with stools, a cooking pot, a rack dead animal skins lined up against it and a shelf with different animal meats and large plant like vegetables on it. Tom looked around at Thalia's home and thought on how perfectly sculpted the inside was for all of her stuff to fit fully inside. He knew that it would be like walking a quarter of a mile for him to get to one side of the home, but for Thalia it would only take her about 12 steps. Thalia set Tom down on the dining table and went over to the shelf of food and grabbed some small sized vegetables and took an entire dead cow and she cooked them in the large cooking pot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she waited for the meat and vegetables to cook and sat down on one of the stools by the dining table to talk to Tom. Thalia looked down on Tom and asked \"So what's it like as a human?\" she asked Tom looked surprised by this question, Thalia saw his responsive expression and said in an nonthreatening tone, \"I'm sorry I didn't mean....\", \"No, its Ok, really,\" Tom interrupted. Thalia felt annoyed that her question might of made Tom feel small but then Tom said \"Well being sma- human!\" Tom felt very embarrassed by his statement. Thalia said, \"No go on, continue\"  Before Tom could say anything, Thalia interrupted \"Wait, hold that thought\" she sniffed and walked up to the cooking pot. She grabbed a large spoon and lifted the pot's lid, she used the spoon to take out the food. She placed the small amount of vegetables on a wooden plate made for her size, she then took out the now well cooked cow and cut off a few small bits of beef and placed the bits of beef on the plate along with the vegetables, she then took the plate and set it in front of Tom, \"Sorry, this was the closest thing I had to a plate for you,\" the plate was nearly as tall as Tom, he had to climb up on the plate and eat the food with his hands. He then looked up at Thalia and saw her take the cow in one hand and then she impaled the cow on a large wooden pole with a spike at the end, (To Tom this like the size of a pole vaulting pole and it was more like a spear) Thalia then started eating the cow like it was a shish kebab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom finished his meal and Thalia finished eating all the meat off a cow which was now a bony carcass. It was now nighttime and Tom said \"Well this was great and all but I need to get home, I'll come up and visit again some time.\" Thalia quickly looked back at him then she grabbed him in her right hand and held him pretty hard. Tom nearly couldn't breathe. Thalia said, \"Listen, I'm really sorry to tell you this but you can't go until I can trust you enough. If I let you go back to your town, word could get out and soon we will have a bunch of hunters and scavengers looking around here for us. That is why I brought you here, I couldn't just let you go after seeing me. Why do you think we live in the deepest parts of the forest and in trees? Because we like to, no! Because we have to, understand. We do like nature, but that's not my point.\" Thalia said all this in a very strict tone. Tom then said, \"Yes, I understand, please let go of me your squeezing the life out of me,\" Thalia then realized that she may have scared Tom, \"Oh my Goddess, Tom I'm really sorry, I just overreacted when I heard you were going to go back. But still I can't let you go back yet, not until I can fully trust you,\" Thalia set Tom down and thought they should both go to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThalia set Tom down on her nightstand and gave him some cloth to use as a blanket while she lay down on her bed. Later on that night Tom was finding it difficult to sleep, he was too cold even though he was still fully clothed and wearing a large jacket. He put his hood up and covered his face with (except his eyes) with a face mask, he put on his gloves, but was still too cold. The only human flesh part of his body that was visible was his eyes, but because he was sleeping on wood it was uncomfortable for him to sleep on it. Thalia woke up to Tom rustling about on his makeshift bed and asked him what was wrong. When Tom told her, she wondered what she could do to make him warmer and more comfortable. Thalia knew what to do, she picked up Tom and placed him in between her breasts which were of course warm and comfortable. Tom felt so lost in pleasure he fell asleep very quickly. Thalia smiled at a sleeping Tom, she thought he looked very cute and kissed him softly while he slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the next morning and......</span></div></div>",

She looked down at her chest and saw Tom was still asleep, snoring softly between her breasts. \u201cAw, he looks so cute, all curled up like that. I don\u2019t get why some would want to harm humans like him. It\u2019s so sad that they have to fear us killing or enslaving them, and we have to fear them uniting together to kill or enslave us\u2026\u201d She thought. The unpleasant thoughts of humans and giantesses killing each other came to Thalia then, making her feel extremely uncomfortable. To calm herself she hummed the old giantess lullaby her sister Bakkel used to sing to her when she was young. The tune itself seemed to have a magical effect on her, almost instantly the unhappy thoughts were wiped clean from her mind, and only a few seconds into the song she was able to relax.<br>\r\nTom started waking up then. \u201cOh, good morning Tom. Did I wake you?\u201d Thalia asked.<br>\r\n\u201cKind of. What was that tune?\u201d Tom asked as he stretched.<br>\r\n\u201cIt was an old lullaby. It helps me relax when I\u2019m stressed.\u201d Thalia said as she gently lifted Tom from her breasts and got out of bed.<br>\r\n\u201cWere you stressed this morning or something?\u201d Tom asked.<br>\r\nThalia was touched by how his question was filled with a personal concern for her. \u201cA bit,\u201d She replied, \u201cBut it was nothing to worry about.\u201d She set tom down on the table before starting to prepare breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finished eating Thalia glanced at the area where she kept her food supplies, \u201cHmm, looks like I\u2019m getting low. Do you mind staying here while I go out?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d Tom replied, truthfully he never felt comfortable around dying animals or blood.<br>\r\n\u201cGreat. I\u2019ll be back in a few.\u201d Thalia said as she stood up and went out the doors.<br>\r\nTom noticed that Thalia left both the thick wood and bark doors open a bit, easily big enough for him to fit through. \u201cWas it an accident, or is it a test on how much she can trust me?\u201d Tom wondered. Whichever was the case, Tom stay well away from the doors. He really like Thalia and didn\u2019t want to upset her by leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom walked over to Thalia\u2019s bed to wait for her to return. It took him a while because of the distance. Shortly after he got there the doors opened and\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now she was hoping her mistake didn\u2019t wind up costing her a friend and possibly her life.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m over here Thalia!\u201d Tom called out by the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that Thalia decided she could trust Tom enough to let him go home, after making him swear not to tell anyone about Thalia or any other giantesses. As Tom promised he didn\u2019t tell anyone about Thalia and visited her often. After several months Thalia realized she was getting special feelings for Tom, and she decided that she\u2019d best make those feelings known to him soon.<br>\r\n\u201cHey Tom,\u201d Thalia said during his latest visit, \u201cThere\u2019s something I\u2019d like to say.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh?

With one hand she gently spread apart her vaginal lips, keeping her other hand free to help Tom into her uterus if need be.<br>\r\nTom gazed into the wet, fleshy tunnel in front of him and asked, \u201cShould I take my clothes off?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want to, I\u2019ve heard that human clothing dissolves in our sexual fluids so it doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201d Thalia replied.<br>\r\n\u201cJust one more question Thalia, you said to reproduce your people need to use a human. Does that mean\u2026?\u201d Tom asked as he started undressing. He didn\u2019t want Thalia to work more than she was already and secretly wanted to feel her vaginal juices and muscles on his body.<br>\r\n\u201cThat I was once a human like you. Probably. But I have no memory of being human\u2026\u201d Thalia finished for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Tom was ready and started crawling inside Thalia\u2019s vagina. He got covered in her juices as he crawled farther in and soon felt her muscles guiding and pushing him farther in. <br>\r\n\u201cOh wow\u2026 That feels so goooooooooooooood\u2026\u201d Thalia moaned as she leaned back and felt Tom crawling deeper inside her.<br>\r\nThalia kept moaning in pleasure the farther in Tom ventured. When the sensation stopped, Thalia knew Tom reached her uterus. She sighed as she got up and put her \u201cclothes\u201d back on and cleaned up her bed. She briefly considered keeping Tom\u2019s clothes, but shook her head and tossed them into her cooking fire. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter. By tomorrow we\u2019ll be connected and he\u2019ll have stopped being the Tom I knew\u2026\u201d she thought as she lay down on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThalia lay there for a while then whispered, \u201cGoodbye Tom, I know you\u2019ll make a wonderful daughter.\u201d and rubbed her belly around her uterus before going to sleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tom even swam up to the ovary glands but saw at how small the gland tunnel was and didn't want to get stuck in it. Tom just floated on his back on the vaginal juices and was amazed at how he was able breathe in Thalia's womb considering that there was very little oxygen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom floated around on the vaginal juices and thought on a lot of things like, how everyone back in town would react to his disappearance, what his family would do without him, what life as a giantess would be like and how Thalia was dealing being pregnant with Tom who would soon forget that name in his new giantess life. \"I really should have thought about this first rather than do it right away,\" but Tom knew that it was too late for that now, once he was in Thalia's uterus he couldn't get out. Later on that night Tom realized he was moving around a lot in the juices and realized that, seeing as how he was inside a giantesses reproductive organ, he would be able to feel all of Thalia's movements and hear what she was saying. All this time Tom forgot that he was inside a uterus and began getting turned on. He had never had such a bad sexual need before, but there was no way he would be able to do anything about it. This made Tom angry but not just to face the fact that he can't have sex with Thalia because he's inside her, but also the fact that he couldn't do anything at all. Tom just decided to go to sleep while floating on the vaginal juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom fell asleep that night and didn't wake till morning. He felt a large snake like tube attached itself to his body and pumping him full of nutrients, Tom immediately recognized that it was the umbilical cord. He rubbed it carefully and looked on at amazement at this beautiful snake of human flesh and could only marvel at how unbelievable it was. Suddenly Tom realized he was floating in the vaginal juices and because of the umbilical cord he was able to live without drowning since it was pumping him with oxygen as well. Tom heard Thalia say something in a soothing tone down to her belly. Thalia was actually singing a lullaby her sister Bakkel had sung to her when she was young, Tom couldn't make out the song but he could feel Thalia messaging her belly hoping Tom would feel it and hear the lullaby. Tom pressed himself against the walls of the womb and could feel Thalia's hands rubbing at her flesh and gently rubbing against him. Thalia could feel Tom press up against her flesh, she smiled while singing and continued messaging her belly. Tom felt very comforted by this, he then felt his eyes giving in to slumber for the pregnancy, he let go of the vagina's wall and fell into a sleep as the umbilical cord continued pumping him full of nutrients. Thalia could feel Tom settling in her womb and stopped singing, she sat there and thought on what Tom would be like as a daughter and what his giantess name would be.</span></div></div>",

Tom noticed that he now had a vagina and breasts, no longer able to be considered male anymore. Tom marveled at how she now looked like a woman about her age. It was incredible what Thalia\u2019s reproductive organs could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom took some time to think about what would likely happen. Most likely she would regress in age and mentality until she was an infant, or somewhere around that age, and grow to the size of a giantess baby. Tom took a quick look at her mother\u2019s womb, she figured it was more fitting to start calling Thalia her mother now, and noticed the uterine walls seemed closer to her than they were before. Tom took it as sign she was starting to accommodate the giantess size and that her re-birth was in full progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that evening Tom heard and felt Thalia singing and massaging her belly again. Tom was again comforted by the attention her mother was giving her and drifted to sleep once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThalia could feel Tom growing inside her and smiled, hoping that she\u2019d be a good mother and thinking about the name she would give to her daughter.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was cleaning some dust from one of the selves on the walls when there was a knock on the outer door. \u201cCome in!\u201d She called out. <br>\r\n\u201cHey Thalia, recognize me?\u201d A familiar voice asked.<br>\r\n\u201cBakkel! Oh it\u2019s great to see you again.\u201d Thalia exclaimed as she hugged her older sister, \u201cHey, you\u2019ve let your hair grow out some.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I figured long hair was more attractive to others. So how\u2019s my little sister been?\u201d Bakkel asked. Bakkel stood about a head taller than Thalia and looked quite similar, and often had a bag she kept slung over her shoulder to carry souvenirs from her travels.<br>\r\n\u201cOh pretty much the same. How was your trip?\u201d Thalia asked.<br>\r\n\u201cAh the jungles down south are beautiful, but so humid. I found myself needing to take everything off to keep cool and I still looked I just came out of a lake. Oh and get this, I came across a tribe of natives and they thought I was one of their goddesses.\u201d Bakkel laughed.<br>\r\nThalia laughed too, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think I can blame them.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat reminds me, I got you something.\u201d Bakkel said before reaching into her bag and pulling out a carved wooden statue about as tall as a man. \u201cThe natives believe this idol brings good luck by banishing the evil spirits that bring misfortune.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Bakkel. I\u2019m going to need all the good luck I can get.\u201d Thalia said as she placed the idol on a shelf.<br>\r\n\u201cOh? And why would that be?\u201d Bakkel asked with interest.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you\u2019re willing to wait a few minutes we can talk about it over lunch.\u201d Thalia teased as she started toward the kitchen.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, but this big secret of yours better be good.\u201d Bakkel said as she followed her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two giantesses ate, Thalia talked about how she met Tom, how she grew to care for him, and how he agreed to become her daughter.<br>\r\nBakkel leaned back in her seat and smiled, \u201cMy little sis is growing up.\u201d<br>\r\nThalia smiled embarrassedly before asking, \u201cDo you think Mom would have approved?\u201d<br>\r\nBakkel\u2019s expression dropped then as she leaned closer to Thalia, \u201cAbout you being pregnant? Sis, Mother wouldn\u2019t have given a damn about it. But if she were still alive she\u2019d have raised Hell about your feelings for the little guy before becoming pregnant with him.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Thalia asked.<br>\r\n\u201cTo put it kindly: Mother\u2019s views on humans were very different from ours. You know about Angela, right?\u201d Bakkel explained.<br>\r\n\u201cThat girl that\u2019s been trying to get the queen and elders to enslave or exterminate the human race? Yeah I\u2019ve heard of her.\u201d Thalia replied.<br>\r\n\u201cOur dear sweet mother made her look like one of those idealists that believe our two races are destined to live together in peace forever from the second they meet.\u201d Bakkel said shaking her head.<br>\r\nThalia was shocked about this revelation. \u201cWell, whatever my mother thought, I\u2019ll take my own path on humans.\u201d She thought before thinking about the idealists. Aside from extremists like Angela, the idealists were some of the most ridiculed giantesses. Thalia knew that there would be conflict, lots of bloody conflict before there\u2019d be peace between the two races. That was why they lived in secrecy.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, at least I have you to base my parenting off of.\u201d Thalia said smiling at her sister.<br>\r\n\u201cAw, you big suck up.\u201d Bakkel teased, \u201cAnyway, what kind of name you going to give the little bundle?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cActually, I was thinking along the lines of Vivian.\u201d Thalia said.<br>\r\n\u201cAh, the heroine that ended the Great War. A good choice.\u201d Bakkel said with approval.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tom then looked in amazement as he was able to see his watch because he thought that the torches and candles were keeping the place illuminated. He looked around to see tiny holes of light coming through, they were all fixed towards a mirror which reflected the light to small glass orbs that reflected the light all around making it seem like day on the inside of the tree house. Tom was amazed at this creation and how useful it proved, but he thought he'd look into it later. Tom could feel himself moving up and down and then noticed that he was still standing on Thalia's chest and that her breathing was what was making him go up and down. Tom felt reluctant to leave Thalia's large, warm and comfortable breasts but he didn't want to lay about all morning, he wanted to check out Thalia's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom climbed from Thalia's breasts and walked across her stomach, while doing so he saw how fit and muscular she was; this was clearly thanks the life time she spent in the forest. Tom walked to the edge of the bed and climbed down to the floor. He walked about while looking around Thalia's home, he then felt hungry and saw the large shelf of food, unfortunately he would need Thalia to cook the food for him and he didn't want to wake her up. Tom then heard a loud yawning sound and looked to see Thalia sitting up straight on her bed and with her feet to the ground. Tom was about to say good morning to Thalia but before he could say anything Thalia looked down at her breasts expecting to see Tom. But when she noticed he was not there she went into a panicky state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my Goddess no, he got up early to escape! Oh my Goddess, he's probably back at his town by now\" Thalia said this in a very panicky and worrying tone, she didn't even notice Tom standing on the floor a few feet away from her. Thalia assumed the worst and quickly got up to go find Tom. Tom tried to talking to her but in her haste she didn't hear him. She made it to the door when Tom shouted \"THALIA, I'M OVER HERE!\" Thalia let out a sigh of relief, then she turned to Tom and looked very embarrassed about what she just did. \"Em, were you standing there the whole time?\" Thalia asked in an embarrassed tone, Tom nodded and then laughed, but then he felt a little annoyed that she didn't trust him very much. Thalia then said \"Look, you must understand; we only met yesterday and I was afraid you didn't want to stay with me after what I said to you yesterday.\" Tom said back, \"Don't be so hard on yourself, you've got nothing to worry about. I like to think of us as friends, not strangers and I would never take off like that without telling you first. As I said you've got nothing to worry about.\" Thalia looked at Tom with a smile, she picked him up and hugged him gently and set him down on the table while she made breakfast.</span></div></div>",

She glanced around quickly, trying to think of a place to hide Tom. Eventually only one place seemed available: between her breasts. She hurriedly and carefully shoved Tom into her cleavage then adjusted her animal skin bra. \u201cTry not to move too much.\u201d She whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom was surprised, and a bit joyful, when Thalia shoved him into her cleavage to hide him. Though he couldn\u2019t see what was going on, because of how deep Thalia put him in and how she repositioned her bra, but he was able to hear everything over the beat of Thalia\u2019s heart. He heard three or four female voices getting louder as their owners came closer. Soon they stopped and he heard one voice say, \u201cLook who\u2019s here girls, its Thalia the Timid.\u201d The other voices giggled or laughed, obviously these giantesses weren\u2019t friends with Thalia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Thalia spoke it sounded like she was repressing how much the tease hurt, \u201cWhat do you want Zara?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI want you out of our way.\u201d One of them, likely the one named Zara, said before Tom felt Thalia being shoved. It took everything Tom had to keep from screaming as Thalia fell onto her back. He heard the other giantesses laugh again before their voice\u2019s eventually faded into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that.\u201d Thalia said as she pulled Tom from between her breasts, from which Tom was somewhat reluctant to leave. She was sitting up now, and it appeared that the fall didn\u2019t do her any harm. \u201cI had to do something to keep Zara and her gang from finding you. If they saw you they\u2019d want to, or want me to, do all sorts of awful things to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Thalia started taking Tom to her home again she explained about Zara and her friends Kalay, Yari, and Feyla. The four of them enjoyed bullying the other giantesses and thoroughly loved tormenting humans. They would often kidnap humans and make them worship them as goddesses. Those that refused, which were most if not all, were killed in numerous nasty ways; which included being sat on, eaten, stepped on, and even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they arrived at the hollowed out tree Thalia called home.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though she was walking, Tom still had to run to keep up with her. After a while she stopped at a large tree that had been hollowed out. 'Maybe this is her home or something.' Tom thought. The giantess scooped him up into her hand before calling out \"&lt;Bakkel, I need your help.&gt;\u201d Soon another giantess stepped out of the hollowed tree. She was very similar to the one that held Tom but she was a little taller, and was clearly a few years older too. \"&lt;Yes Thalia, what is it?&gt; she asked. \"&lt;I found this man in the forest, but I cannot understand his language. Can you?&gt;\" The giantess that held Tom asked the other. \"&lt;I\u2019ll try.&gt;\" the second giantess replied before turning her attention to Tom, \"&lt;Can you say something for me?&gt;\" she asked him, making a talking motion with her hand. \"You want me to say something? Is that it?\" Tom asked. \"Yes that's what I wanted.\" She said in perfect English. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! How did you-?\" Tom started to ask. \"I've learned a lot of languages in my travels. My name is Bakkel, the girl holding you is my younger sister Thalia. What's your name?\" Bakkel asked. \"I'm... Tom.\" He said, still confused that this giantess could easily speak English. \"&lt;His name is Tom.&gt;\" Bakkel said to Thalia. Thalia nodded with a smile, \"&lt;Hello Tom.&gt;\" She said waving her free hand. \u201cShe said \u2018hello\u2019.\u201d Bakkel translated. \u201cAh, um\u2026 Hi.\u201d Tom said, waving back. \u201c&lt;He\u2019s so cute. Bakkel, can I keep him?&gt;\u201d Thalia asked her sister. \u201c&lt;You know we have to. He seems trustworthy, but we can\u2019t take that chance. We should show him where he\u2019ll be living.&gt;\u201d Bakkel said, apparently not very pleased with something. \u201cWell Tom, let\u2019s show you our home. I\u2019m curious how it may be different and similar to your people\u2019s dwellings.\u201d Bakkel said before leading the way to the house in the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finished the tour in a few hours. \u201cWell, it looks like about time I got going.\u201d Tom said, somewhat reluctant to leave these two good-looking giantesses. \u201cUh\u2026 I don\u2019t think we can let you Tom.\u201d Bakkel said sort of glumly. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Tom asked. \u201cWell, you see\u2026 Thalia and I are some of the last of our kind, and your people tend to\u2026 overreact. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t trust you, it\u2019s that we can\u2019t afford to trust you that far. One of the only two solutions is to kill you.\u201d Bakkel said making a lazy motion across her throat. \u201c&lt;Bakkel! We cannot do that!&gt;\u201d Thalia burst out. \u201c&lt;I know Thalia, but he deserves the truth.&gt;\u201d Bakkel said before switching back to English, \u201cBut as Thalia said we could never do that to anyone, so we\u2019re stuck with the second solution of keeping you here with us.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t really like the idea too much but I can see where you\u2019re coming from.\u201d Tom admitted, \u201cWell if I\u2019m going to be living here, you think you could give me some lessons on your language.\u201d \u201cCertainly. I\u2019d be happy to\u201d Bakkel said before she started teaching Tom the language.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had a nice little bed and a cupboard next to it, a couch and a nice view out of his window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that evening, Bakkel came over and knocked on his door, as Tom walked out he was quickly picked up by a giant hand swooping down, clenching around him and soon he was carried off '' Hey, what's going on!? '' Tom protested, Bakkel only bothered to shush him as she entered a her own house, putting Tom down on the table next to her bed '' Tom, I need to ask you something '' Bakkel started off, with a serious tone. Tom decided to stay quiet, and listen. Bakkel continued on '' Do you find me attractive? '' she asked, raising a eyebrow at Tom, who was completely caught off guard by the question '' If I find you attractive? I- I suppose so '' Tom studderd, but quickly changed it before Bakkel could frown or look a tad sad '' Of course I do, I mean. You're a Giantess, and a very gorgeous one at that '' he added. Smiling, Bakkel suddenly stood up and peeled off her bra and panties, leaving her completely naked and exposed for Tom's eyes '' I have a confession Tom '' she said, as her slender hand reached down and picked Tom up. Tom tried to struggle a little bit, but it didn't get him anywhere '' A- and that is? '' he managed to studder. Bakkel pulled him directly up to her giant lips, where she whispered to him '' I've always wanted to try and stuff a tiny human up one of my holes '' she whispered, in a very seductive voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom looked shocked '' I- inside one of your holes? '' she studdered, gulping loudly '' Yup! '' Bakkel added cheerfully as she pulled him away from her, letting him get a good look at her breasts. It was the least she could do, concidering what she was about to do to him. Then she bagan lowering him down to wards her crotch area, shaven and tight she moved Tom closer dispite his loud protests until his head got muffled against one of her pussy lips. '' Mmmmm '' she moaned contently, but then pulled him away, again and bent over. Thus spreading her giant buttocks and holding Tom behind her ass, revealing her pink, clean pucker to him between the monsterous buttcheeks. Moving him closer and closer, stuffing his head against it again without any regards for Tom's protest<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Hmm.. Which hole to choose&gt; Bakkel thought to herself, continueing to rub Tom against her pucker as she was bent over, the tiny man being used to caress her pink pucker between the giant buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, which hole will Bekkel choose?</span></div></div>",

Tom then realized she was when she started stroking her belly and licking her lips. \"Wait, no you can't eat me. I never done anything to upset you.\" Selena replied, \"But you taste so nice, don't worry, if it helps any I won't bite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena then pushed Tom very slightly into her mouth, Tom used his two hands to push against her upper lip to try and push himself out, but then Selena used her other hand to grab Toms arms push them down while she pushed the rest of his body in. Tom's body was fully in Selena's mouth and his feet were already staring down her gullet, Selena closed her mouth and soon Tom could no longer see the light of day, he was in complete darkness.

Selena rubbed and patted her belly in satisfaction. She let out a small burp and wondered if there were any more to eat, she went of to find more to swallow into her hungry belly. Tom was now going around Selena's stomach, feeling around and pressing his ear against the stomach walls trying to listen at what he could hear. He pulled out a flashlight and saw that his hiking boots were already digested and his socks and bottom half of his trousers as well. He looked around with the flashlight and saw a couple of human and animal skeletons lying around, he could hear the Selena's hand patting away at her belly. Tom knew he was doomed he simply sat there and accepted his type of death: Eaten by a giant woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut could Tom escape?

While Tom thought on this, Selena continually rubbed her belly and hummed in satisfaction of her human meal. Tom then knew what he had to do, he turned on his flashlight and looked around for the opening to the small intestine. When he did find it he saw how small it was, but he knew that he had to try. He crawled in head first and slowly crawled further into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena could feel something crawling around inside of her, but she thought it was just Tom's remains going through the digestive process, she always felt this with every man she swallowed. But the giantess lacked the general knowledge humans would normally have, giantesses didn't know how to read or write and were only taught how to speak and survive in the wilderness. Tom descended deeper and deeper into the intestine. It was dark, wet and smelly but Tom kept going in. Tom's heart sank when he finds a human skeleton in the organic cave, he saw that if this poor soul didn't make it then there was a large chance he wasn't either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom continued to crawl onward and found a couple more human skeletons. This made Tom very sad, but then he heard a thumping noise and soon found out it was Selena patting her stomach and laughing evilly as she felt Tom going through her intestines, Selena thought that Tom was digested and that was why she was laughing. This made Tom furious that she was enjoying bringing suffering to others, he realized that he would probably have to be the one to stop her, but first he had to escape her bowels. Tom was still crawling through the small intestine and finally made it to the large intestine. It was easier for Tom crawl through here because there was more space to move around in, but before he could continue in he noticed that the smell was so bad he could die from it. Tom quickly pulled a fabric face mask over his face to get rid of the smell from his nose. It helped but it made it harder for Tom to breathe considering there was not a lot of oxygen down in Selena's intestines. He was amazed he made it that far without having to gasp for oxygen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom then made his way to the rectum, on the way he found two more human skeletons and thought that they would have definitely died from the stink. Tom crawled on and finally made it to the rectum now all he had to do was get out but unfortunately it was not going to be a very pleasant escape.</span></div></div>",

Tom then knew if he didn't roll off quickly he would be crushed under the large surface of a soft and pink rear end. Tom then gave it one last shot, he rolled over to the right twice and succeed in getting out of the way, but while rolling he hurt himself from his injuries and he wanted to let out a huge scream of pain but when he heard a loud impact sound to his left. He saw Selena's butt sitting perfectly on the ground. If Tom screamed now Selena would notice him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom was actually surprised that Selena hadn't noticed him when she sat down, she must still think that Tom was under her ass. Tom used this to his advantage and despite his injuries, he tried to crawl away.

None of them responded, and she continued, \"Do you have any water?\" At once one of the boys went into the tent.

While the third one was still rummaging in the tent, Selena positioned herself directly above the entrance. As he emerged from the tent, she flicked his legs knocking him flat. He looked up to see her ass descending upon him. The teen tried to escape, but was too slow and was pinned underneath her massive weight. He screamed for what seemed like hours until finally, with a crunch, he was smeared against Selena's rear. She laughed and ground her butt back and forth, further spreading his blood on the forest floor. When she stood up, the corpse dangled limply from her animal skins. The other two were petrified with fear.<br>\r\n          \"Now I tried this before, but my earlier friend escaped. One of you will be crushed between my beautiful breasts! I'll take any volunteers. No takers? Okay I choose you!\" Selena picked one of them and dropped him in her cleavage. Not making any of the embellishments as earlier, she just rammed her boobs together. The kid never had a prayer and was engulfed by the mounds of flesh. When she let them spread, he was just a red stain in between the biggest breasts on earth.</span></div></div>",

Then, she flung off her bra and issued her commands to the teens.<br>\r\n\"I am your goddess now! I need some people to pleasure me. You all fit the bill, so it falls to you. However if I'm not feeling satisfied in three minutes, you all die. Now go!\" Selena said with a devilish grin. Expectedly one of them ran, and she grabbed him. She tore off her animal skin underwear and lowered him to her butt. \"You get the best part, my sexy ass!\" she laughed, and placed his feet inside her butt hole and let it slowly suck him in. The rest, she split between her breasts and her pussy. The ones down south discovered Tom, who was now clinging on, hoping not to be remembered. Then Selena laid down and let the terrified get to work. She felt them scrambling over her bare boobs, trying to get a reaction from her. After a minute she was moaning in pleasure, and squirming from the pleasure. In two she felt amazing, and rolled over, crushing one of the people unfortunate enough to be touching her erect nipple. She was now yelling in ecstasy and thrashed, cracking trees and endangering everyone on her massive body. Finally, she climaxed and the juices sent the guys inside her flooding out between her legs. They scrambled back to her to avoid her deadly pillars of legs. Two of them weren't fast enough and were flattened by her beautiful legs.<br>\r\nSelena sat up, and collected the survivors. \"Did we do well enough?\" one of them asked, scared. In response she popped him into her mouth and chewed him up. One by one, the screaming tinies were consumed in a similar manner. Some she didn't kill immidately to enjoy the feeling of them strugglingnin her stomach. Finally, she was left with just Tom.<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well. You've certaintly been with me a long time. I think you can stay with me a little while longer, for being a good slave to me so far. But maybe I'll change my mind when I wake up.

Selena stood to her full height of 70 feet and prepared to tear these insignificant pests to shreds when suddenly she felt as if thousands of needles were stuck in her back. She whirled around and the feeling was repeated as many more darts were fired into her bare skin. Selena laughed, did they really think such tiny things would hurt her? It was then that the tranquilizers took effect and she fell face first to the ground.<br>\r\nWhen Selena awoke she found that a cage just large enough for her to lie down in, but not tall enough for her to stand, had been constructed around her, she raged against the bars, she screamed abuse at the soldiers that stood beyond the cage, but it was for nothing. Fuming Selena frantically searched her cage for a way out, the bars were easily far enough apart for a human to pass through but she couldn't even fit her arm through the gap. She saw that most of the small army that had captured her was camped nearby. The only hope she could find was some kind of control center that looked like it cold release the lock on the roof of her prison. As Selena tried to think her way out of her predicament she felt something wriggle in her cleavage, looking down she found that Tom was still there and had just woken up. Selena immediately moved to so the guards wouldn't see Tom, the corner of her mouth twisted into a grin as she looked at her own little captive.</span></div></div>",

Shots rang out, and some even hit her. They stung a little and lucky shots drew blood but they didn't damage her too bad. But then the helicopters opened up on the forest with their miniguns and rockets. Explosions rocked the forest and the bullets shredded the trees around her.

Selena brushed herself off, her evil mind considering the possibilities with so many tiny people. But then helicopters roared over the treetops and began gunning for the giantess. Selena leapt into the air, grabbing the helicopters with the adrenaline she got from now having hundreds of tinies to rule.

She held her head in her hand and her naked body laid sideways, exposed to anyone who happened to look that direction.

Selena stood up to see where they had disappeared to, and saw three cars and a few stains along her chest and stomach, and laughed at her stupidity. She strolled around suburbia, crushing a few houses and capturing a few people that had chosen not to flee her. These disappeared down her gullet as soon as she had them in hand, and then she felt something she had never felt in the woods: boredom.<br>\r\n           \"Darn, there's just too many of you guys around! It's no fun if I don't have to catch you in the forest! I'm just going to kill all of you now,\" Selena said, and proceeded to do just that. She slammed her feet down on houses, crushing them like boxes. She sat down and used her ass as a bulldozer, taking out entire blocks at a time. All the while, she was following a pattern of herding the survivors towards the center of town. Finally, when the surrounding towns were flattened, Selena strode into the masses of people. Her feet crushed dozens as she took a place in the middle of the crowds.<br>\r\n           \"No, don't run! I'll kill you all if you run. I'm going to go back to the forest for half an hour, and if you're still here then I'm using you all as toys. You've got that longnto clear out.\" After her ultimatum, Selena knocked over skyscrapers to seal the survivors by the bridge and docks. At this point, most people were crossing the bridge but Selena appeared to dislike this. In one blow, she leveled the structure leaving only boats as forms of escape.

She ran through the forest, toppling trees and encountering some of the park rangers she'dnleft behind. These she would have normally savored as treats, but had no time for anything other than crushing and the occasional snack. Finally, she reached the river. Selena could already see some of the boats in the distance, and took a deep breath. She slid into the water, and sank to the bottom. The river was not only deep but murky too, allowing her to remain hidden until it was too late. Selena sat in the depths, waiting for the first ship to encounter her.<br>\r\nThe captain of the Dauntless was never scared by anything, but he was scared by the giant girl who had massacred entire towns for fun. He was hoping to get as far away as possible from the city so she would have no reason to purse him. Suddenly, his ship ground to a halt. Cursing, he interrogated his crew as to why. No one knew, or could see the reason through the murky water. The flat boat suddenly jerked upwards as a hand drove through the middle, sending refugees flying and shakingnthe ship. The captain screamed as his ship began to bend in half, pouring people towards the hole in the deck. He could now see a mouth awaiting those who could find nothing to hang on to. Unfortunately, the ship was stripped of unnecessary items to accommodate the most passengers so there was very little to hang on to. In seconds, there were less than ten people who hadn't been consumed by the giantess. At this point, the boat folded the rest of the way, the two halves coming together with a squeal of metal and sinking into the water. The rest of the boats were stopped in shock. There was a slight ripple in the water heading towards a rowboat tied to the back of a ferry. It was overcrowded with people, all of whom panicked at the ripple, but didn't jump overboard.<br>\r\nSelena grinned in pleasure. This was even more fun than expected. Getting horny with her power over these people, she approached this next boat and used her fingers to spread the lips of her vagina as far as they would go. She centered her pussy underneath the boat, and brought it up. Soon, the rowboat was surrounded by Selena's womanhood, and then her fingers released the lips. They slapped against the tops of the people's heads and she gently pushed it deeper inside her until it disappeared from view completely. Selena moaned underwater from the pleasure of swallowing an entire boat inside her.</span></div></div>",

It had drifted away from the group and was clearly hoping to escape while she massacred the rest of the people. But they had no idea Selena had followed them down the river. She kept pace beneath it, hoping not to alert the people onboard. Finally, her breasts grazed the underside of the boat, and Selena pulled them apart in preparation of what was to come. She rose up while her jiggling mounds of flesh surrounded the middle of the sailboat. The terrified sailors screamed, shot her, and even pleaded with her, but she just laughed and slowly pushed her breasts closer together. After a few minutes of the two jugs getting closer excruciatingly slowly, there was a sound of splintering wood and the sides of the ship cracked and splintered. The mast fell, and then Selena's breasts squeezed the midsection of boat between them until it was nothing but wood chips. After this side-job, she swam back to the main section of the fleet, not wanting anyone to escape.<br>\r\n          Selena had just realized she was killing everyone on the boats. This brought a tear to her eye, not because of their pain but because no one would be left to play with. In the interest of conserving fun, she decided to destroy the craft in ways that would leave some alive. The boats had set off again, and she moved in front of the lead boat. Selena rose to her towering seventy feet in seconds like a gigantic water-spirit. Water fell from her in tons, inundating the boat. \"CANNONBALL!\" she yelled, and leapt into the air above the boat. She hung seemingly suspended in midair, then her rounded ass fell onto the bow and launched the rear into the air. Selena felt the part she had landed on crumple and swam off, her job done. The next boat found itself holed when Selena punched holes below the waterline and then broke it into splinters when it hit bottom. The third and final ship was a big cruise-liner, almost 100 feet long. It was a victim of a swan dive by Selena. Her gorgeous body crushed the flimsy construction beneath her and dragged it down to the bottom.<br>\r\n          The survivors floated around on pieces of timber and life-rafts. They had been sitting idly for half an hour with no attacks from the giantess, so they assumed the worst was over. But then, one man floating thought he felt something moving the water beneath him. He screamed, but nothing happened so he soon calmed. This was when a huge, pink, wall of flesh rose up and wrapped itself around the struggling man. The tongue squeezed him and there was a sound of bones cracking. At last, it dragged him back beneath waves. On a nearby lifeboat, a sudden jerk sent someone falling into the water. Everyone rushed to help him back in, and they grabbed his hands. He looked around panicked, and frantically tried to crawl onboard but ended up falling back in. Then as everyone heaved as one to pull him in, there was a flash of white and a spray of water that blinded everyone. When they wiped the water from their eyes, there was nothing left of the man but his two hands<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That was to be the signal for her to enter the scene. Mayor Davis had almost finished his speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In conclusion, I want all of you to keep in mind that Selena has no intention of harming anyone here. She is a gentle woman, and you have no need to fear her despite her size. Now, without further ado, SELENA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis then launched the signal flare. Selena spotted her cue, and started walking toward the city. She was terribly nervous about how the crowd would react when they actually saw her. She eventually reached the central plaza where the conference was taking place. She immediately noticed the scared looks on the people's faces, and began to worry if she really would be accepted. Yet so far, none of them had started to run away... Normally, a crowd like this would have scattered at the mere sight of her. They were clearly waiting to see what she did next. Selena did the only thing she could think of to ease their nerves: she introduced herself in a calm and civilized manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hello everyone. My name is Selena, and you can probably already tell that I'm a giantess... Please don't worry, though! I promise that I come in peace, and have no intention of harming anyone. <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Uh, what else can I say?</font> Well, I've had a bit of a rough life... I've never really been accepted by anyone, but I always wanted to have a place to call home. Until recently, I've been living in a nearby forest... I'm really glad that I've been given the opportunity to live here, and I hope that I can become friends with all of you eventually... I guess I can understand if your hesitant to trust me... But I really just want to live here peacefully, so I'll do what I can to help you all out if you need me to. Um, I think that's all... Thank you for your attention!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena then closed her eyes in anticipation. She expected the crowd to start rioting, or running away from her. She was pleasantly surprised when the entire crowd began cheering for her! She heard many people saying compliments such as \"Woohoo! Your awesome Selena!\", \"You're so beautiful! I wish I looked like you!\", and even \"How did you get to be so tall? You're so cool!\"... She was quickly overcome with joy, and had to cover her eyes with her arm to prevent her tears from flooding the area. Just then, Mayor Davis spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations, Selena! You are an official citizen of this fine city of ours! Now all that's left is for you to shake hands with me, and we can get started on finding a place for you to stay until your house is finished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena smiled and reached down with her index finger extended. Davis grabbed it with both hands and they shook. Several people in the crowd were laughing at the awkwardness of the handshake, but most of them were cheering for Selena and her acceptance into the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later, the crowd had broken up and resumed their regular business. Selena was holding Davis in the palm of her hand as they talked about what was to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Selena... About your temporary residence... Any place you'd like to stay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, sorry... I just don't think that any of your buildings will work for me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, you have a point there... I mean, your taller than a lot of them... And the ones that <i>are</i> bigger than you sure don't have you beaten by much... So where are you going to stay then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was thinking that I could just sleep in the forest like a always have. I'll come around here during the day, and I'll probably try to help out the workers so that my house gets built sooner. Is that okay with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why not... But won't you get lonely in that forest all by yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's okay... I've lived alone my entire life... I'm sure that I can handle a few more months of waiting for my new home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Why don't I stay with you until then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about your duties as the mayor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did say that you would only stay there at night, right?

As Selena was lying on her back the pair watched the stars emerge in the darkened sky.

Selena paused, she'd never really talked with a tiny more than taunting them before she disposed of them and she wasn't sure what she wanted to share with Tom.<br>\r\n\"Let's just say that some enterprising tinies are the reason I'm the only one of my kind in these woods\" Tom thought he heard genuine pain in Selena's voice, despite all he'd seen that day he felt a little sorry for her.<br>\r\n\"Please don't let a few assholes make you hate us all, where I'm from people would be glad to help you if they knew.\"<br>\r\n\"Well where are you from?\" Selena actually sounded thoughtful, the idea raced through Tom's head that he might actually survive this if he could convince Selena to change her views.<br>\r\n\"I came from a small town on the edge of the woods\" Tom said, looking up from his resting spot on Selena's bust to see a massive grin spread over her face.<br>\r\n\"Well then, I think that sounds like a lovely spot for breakfast tomorrow\" Selena casually remarked as she closed her eyes and laid her head back to sleep.<br>\r\n\"Wait what?\" Tom's mind raced as what she had just said sank into him. \"Selena ple-\"<br>\r\n\"Goodnight Tom\" Selena said as she leisurely yawned and proceeded to ignore Tom's pleas.

After what felt like hours he had nothing left to fight with, he looked towards Selena's sleeping face, Tom wondered why such a beautiful face had to belong to such a monster. Tom lay trapped against Selena's breast agonizing as he tried to think of a way to save his home town, he could think of nothing and eventually his exhaustion took its toll as he drifted off to sleep. \"Wake up Tom\" came the sweet voice of his captor, Tom opened his eyes to see the sun was up and Selena was looking down on him. He realized he wasn't in Selena's bra anymore but lying on the ground, Selena was sitting up a short distance away and holding her newly repaired panties \"look I repaired your original home\" Selena beamed. In his head Tom wondered how someone who just last night had threatened mass murder could be so cheery.<br>\r\n\"Please Selena\" Tom started, but Selena immediately rolled her eyes and tossed her primitive panties at him. Tom felt himself flattened to the ground, the deerskin panties were barely large enough to cover Selena's privates but that was more than enough to pin him to the ground. He started to crawl out from under them when he felt himself seized and lifted into the air. He was  raised to Selena's towering face.<br>\r\n\"Tom I have heard it all before so don't bother trying to make me leave that town alone\" Tom was about to respond but Selena tossed him into her mouth. Tom briefly forgot his fear for his home as he remembered the boy Selena had swallowed yesterday, he struggled to escape but Selena's tongue effortlessly pinned him against the side of her cheek. As the tongue rubbed against him Selena began to moan in pleasure, Tom realized not only was she tasting him but she loved how he tasted. Suddenly Selena spat Tom into her palm, he could see she'd stood up and put on her panties. \"How do you do it? such an energetic squirmier and such beautiful flavor, I'd swallow you down right now if you weren't so great down here\" Selena happily remarked as she patted her own groin.<br>\r\n\"Selena, please I'll do anything if you spare my home\" Tom sputtered through the saliva that covered him and to his surprise a thoughtful expression spread over Selena's face followed by the most terrible grin Tom had ever seen.<br>\r\n\"Alright my little hero, I think we can make a deal. Everyday I'll let you go into town for one hour, you can see family friends, whatever, but at the end of that hour you'll come back to me and you'll bring at least one other tiny out with you for me to do with as I please. And if you get any funny ideas about not coming back out after the hour I am so graciously giving you, know that if you don't come back not only will I go in after you but I will also leave no survivors in that little town. What do you say?\" Selena said gleefully. Tom was stunned, he could spare the town as a whole, but every day he'd have to choose someone from his home to die inside this horrible beauty.

She stared up at the stars as she felt Tom limply slide down her throat and into her stomach. With her belly full Selena closed her eyes and drifted off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

As the young woman walked she heard a loud \"hello\" from behind her. The woman turned and her jaw dropped as she saw the 70 foot tall nearly naked giantess laying on her stomach barely ten feet behind her. As the woman tried to puzzle out how both what she was looking at and how such a massive creature could've come upon here silently the giantess who had her chin resting on her folded hands began to speak \"It sounds like you're looking for someone, can I help?\" The young woman suddenly found her voice.<br>\r\n\"Um, y-yes I'm looking for someone, my name is Claire and I'm looking for my brother Tom, he went hiking here yesterday and no one's seen him since.\" Claire was beginning to recover from the shock of meeting the titanic figure.<br>\r\n\"You know\" Selena started \"I think I did see a man that bore some resemblance to you yesterday, I could show you were he went\" as she talked Selena lifted one of her hands and gently picked up Claire, she then began to stand to her full height.<br>\r\n\"You did?

Selena dangled Claire high over her own face.<br>\r\n\"I'll happily show you where he went, you won't have to worry about heights anymore either\" Selena ran her tongue over her lips.

After hours of crawling Tom felt his hand push against the lips of Selena's pussy, he could've laughed for joy at finally escaping. Tom pulled himself out of Selena and fell into her deerskin panties, his ears were met by the sounds of shouting, screaming, and the giantess laughing. He was jostled around in the primitive panties for several minutes until Selena's hand reached in and slowly pulled him out by his legs. Dangling upside down Tom was raised up, he could see below him a crushed car and the remains of several smashed bodies, as he was raised past Selena's stomach he thought he might have heard screams coming from inside her. Eventually Tom was raised to Selena's radiant face, there was a squirming bulge in her right cheek and as Tom watched helplessly Selena giggled and swallowed, the squirming bulge was visible as it traveled down her throat but Tom lost sight of it as it past her collarbone. \"Well my little pervert's back, I would've gotten to you sooner but I was in the middle of something when you came crawling out. Although I will say your struggles down there have made my day\" As Selena talked she rubbed her bare stomach and sat down on the car, reducing it from simply crushed to completely flattened.

Immediately Tom tried to crawl towards the exit, he clawed his way towards the daylight pouring through Selena's parted lips but just as he was about to make it Selena tilted her head back just enough to send Tom sliding towards her throat. Tom desperately grabbed at her teeth and stopped his descent. Heart hammering in his chest Tom began climbing up Selena's teeth towards her still parted lips and this time he made it. He placed his hand on Selena's lower lip and hoisted himself almost entirely out of her mouth, just as he was about to tumble to freedom Selena's lips closed on his ankles. Tom heard his massive tormenter giggling to herself as he dangled from her mouth by his feet. Then slowly she began to slurp Tom back inside her mouth like a piece of spaghetti. Tom broke down crying as his hope for escape was lost, he screamed, he pounded on her lip to try and stop the suction and then it did. Tom was now more than halfway in her mouth but she had stopped sucking him in, looking to either side Tom could see Selena's mouth curl into a devilish grin, Tom felt her tongue lift up and lick the base of his stomach, and then slowly, skillfully, the massive tongue actually pulled Tom's pants down. Tom was so shocked he ceased his struggles, it was then that the tongue plunged between his legs. Tom felt too many feelings all at once as the tongue licked between his legs. Just as Tom actually began to enjoy the sensation the suction returned tenfold, Tom was yanked the rest of the way inside Selena. He slammed against the back of her mouth, he barely had time to react as Selena tilted her head back and swallowed. The muscles in her throat grabbed Tom and kneaded Tom down wards. As he was pulled deeper into the giantess Tom felt Selena's hand push against her throat as it traced his trip down her. Eventually Tom plopped out of her esophagus into an open space. Tom sat practically shell shocked in Selena's stomach, suddenly everything trembled and Tom was knocked onto his side. Selena lay on her back, rubbing her bare stomach and feeling the fluttering of the tiny man trying to resettle after she'd laid down. Her eyes slowly closed as the titanic beauty prepared for a midday nap.</span></div></div>",

Tom immediately swam for the ovary glands, amazingly the juices were only up at a certain height in the uterus, (This doesn't happen in real life, in real life the juices take up the whole uterus, I'm just doing this for the story) Tom kept his position at the ovary gland exit and thought on how ironic it was that he came in to the world through a vagina and now he was going to meet his inside of one. He knew that he wasn't going to last long in there, he had a flashlight which he used to look around, unfortunately the batteries were not going to last forever.

Tom thought that this was definitely not the way he or any other man should die, he decided that he would have to escape. Tom decided not to wait, he had nothing to wait for anyway. With his flashlight on, he swam down the vaginal juices and straight to the vagina. Tom knew that when a woman was giving birth, the baby was pushed out the vagina so he would have to push as hard as he could until he could squeeze through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only unfortunate thing of Tom's plan was that in child birth the mother had to push as well, Selena was not likely to push when Tom tried to escape. Tom had to take his chances, it was do or die and he could only hold his breathe under water for about a minute, so he would only have a minute to push the vulva open. If he managed to get stuck on trying to get out of her vagina he would drown. Tom quickly dived straight down and used his flashlight to pinpoint exactly where he had to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom saw the vagina entrance and swam down. He came down upon it and pushed against it with all his strength . Tom pushed and pushed with all his might. Unfortunately he would probably have needed Selena to push as well if he were to get out quicker. Tom could feel his lungs starting to give in; he pushed and amazingly the vagina started to open. Tom could see a small light, but the hole was still too small, he quickly used his two hands to push at the opening until it was large enough to get out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena was asleep this whole time Tom was trying to escape but she woke up to the feeling of Tom pushing away at her vulva. Selena got up and realized what the feeling was quickly looked down at her vagina and Tom came sliding out, covered in Selena's vaginal juices and breathing very heavily, both in desperation for oxygen and to catch his breath from his escape efforts. Selena looked down in total shock at Tom and how he escaped, \"How did you get out of there?\"Selena asked in surprise. Tom felt as though he was going to collapse from exhaustion but saw Selena looking down upon him. He looked around quickly and saw he was on Selena's bed, in her house. He got up to try and run from Selena but she quickly rammed her hand down in front of him. Tom quickly ran to his left, but it was difficult to run fast as he was very tired. Selena saw him run for left edge of her bed, she took her left hand and was ready to ram it down in front of Tom, but before she could she saw him fall down flat on the bed due to exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena picked Tom up with her left hand and brought him up to her face. On his way there, Tom saw Selena's exposed breasts, he realized she was completed naked, now knowing how he managed to get out of her uterus without being blocked by her animal skin panties. Tom dreaded that Selena might shove him back up her pussy, but then Selena said \"You're just a little man of action aren't you? This could be fun.

We\u2019ll keep doing this every few days until I think you\u2019ve earned your freedom, or until I get bored with it.\u201d She explained before setting Tom down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instant she let go Tom ran frantically to find somewhere he could hide, maybe even a way to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere could he hide?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now that he was now a she, there was no telling what could happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena woke up that morning, queasy as she had been for the past few days. She grumbled to herself as she put on her animal skin bra and panties, then went outside. As she walked through the forest her mood lightened a bit, the fresh morning air and sunshine always made her feel better. After a short while she saw her two giantess friends, Aria and Lunara. Lunara was to the right, a head taller than Selena and Aria with dark hair that gave off a blue shine in the sunlight she kept in a long ponytail, and wore a skirt and bra made from black feathers. Aria was just a bit shorter than Selena and kept her blonde hair at shoulder length, and like most other giantesses preferred to completely forgo any sort of clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey girls.\u201d Selena called out as she approached her friends. <br>\r\n\u201cHey Selena, haven\u2019t seen you much lately.\u201d Aria said as she waved her welcome.<br>\r\n \u201cYeah, is something wrong kid?\u201d Lunara asked. <br>\r\n\u201cWell, not \u2018wrong\u2019 exactly\u2026\u201d Selena said. <br>\r\n\u201cWell then what\u2019s up?\u201d Lunara asked. <br>\r\nSelena was silent for a moment, then took a deep breath before saying, \u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCongratulations Selena! That\u2019s wonderful.\u201d Lunara exclaimed as she hugged her. Selena expected Lunara to react this way, and was actually glad for it. Lunara had given birth three times in her life, once to twins, so there was someone Selena could go to for advice and help. <br>\r\n\u201cDecided to have some special fun with a little human huh?\u201d Aria asked with a mischievous wink.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Selena sighed, \u201cBut I completely forgot that this could happen.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAh, don\u2019t be so sad Selena. Cheer up; you\u2019re helping our race continue on.\u201d Lunara said placing a comforting hand on Selena\u2019s shoulder.<br>\r\n\u201cTell that to my cousin. The way she thinks, using humans to reproduce is basically the same as murdering one of our own.\u201d Aria said.<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that depends on your view. At any rate it\u2019s a necessary evil. Not to mention nature\u2019s way; the strong survive and the weak perish. We\u2019re strong so we use the weak for our pleasures and needs. Besides, we do them a favor by making some of them into us. You know how ugly humans can look.\u201d Lunara said.<br>\r\nSelena didn\u2019t need to ponder on that. All giantesses were extraordinarily beautiful, some like Lunara more than others.<br>\r\n\u201cSo anyway Selena; tell us, was it a guy or gal?\u201d Lunara asked.<br>\r\n\u201cA man.\u201d Selena replied.<br>\r\n\u201cWas he good looking?\u201d Aria asked.<br>\r\nSelena thought for a moment, back when she decided to have fun with the little man she didn\u2019t pay much attention to his appearance. \u201cWell, I think he was\u2026 He was well muscled, had brown hair, and seemed intelligent enough. Um\u2026 Lunara, just how will she look when she\u2019s finally born?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s simple to determine. Was the guy past puberty?\u201d Lunara asked.<br>\r\n\u201cEasily past.\u201d Selena replied.<br>\r\n\u201cWell naturally she'll appear young at first, you know like how mine first was when you saw her, then after about five years she'll hit puberty, which will last about nine years, and finally she'll finish growing and maturing after about two years.\u201d Lunara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom still floated in Selena\u2019s uterus, unaware of whatever was happening outside of the womb. Whenever she tried to remember her life before all this, there was nothing. As time progressed the memories of Tom the man faded away into oblivion. And of course she started growing to better fit her mother\u2019s womb.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Aria and I were friends for some time before we met you, and before I was pregnant my first time. I was worried that my daughter would cause our friendship to dissolve. Before I was pregnant, Aria and I did the same things we do with you today. I\u2019ve had four children and I\u2019m still good friends with Aria, and now with you too.\u201d Lunara explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena sat there for a moment, thinking about what Lunara just said. After a while, she hugged Lunara and said, \u201cThanks Lunara, you always know what to say to make things seem less bleak. Hey, you think you could stay with me when it comes time for the kid\u2019s birth?\u201d She still wasn\u2019t thrilled that she would soon be a mother, but somehow Lunara\u2019s reassurance made it seem less frightening.<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing Selena. Heck, I\u2019ve still got the bed I made for the girls when they were newborns. I knew that old thing would come in handy.\u201d Lunara said as she hugged Selena back.<br>\r\n\u201cUnless you can fit in it you\u2019ll have to sleep on the floor.\u201d Selena said with a giggle.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the catch?

You can do it.\u201d Lunara encouraged as she sat between Selena\u2019s spread out legs, waiting to help the baby out of Selena\u2019s body.<br>\r\nSelena screeched out in pain as she gave that final push. She lay on her bed exhausted as she heard a little voice crying.<br>\r\n\u201cCongratulations Selena, you\u2019re a mother.\u201d Lunara said softly as she carefully handed Selena her new daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instant Selena gazed upon the newborn; all her regrets about impregnating herself and the memories of the pain vanished, overcome by awe and love. \u201cI\u2019m a mother, I have a daughter!\u201d she thought ecstatically for the first time. The new baby giantess appeared to be around five years of age; her hair was brown like it was when she first shoved that human into her uterus, only now it was longer and more feminine. <br>\r\nThe infant opened her eyes and gazed up at Selena, bright blue eyes like the sky above them. \u201cMomma\u201d the child said holding her hand up towards Selena. \u201cThat\u2019s right little one, I\u2019m your mommy.\u201d Selena said lovingly.<br>\r\n\u201cShe needs a name you know.\u201d Lunara said tenderly, remembering how she had felt when she went through this miracle so many years ago.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right\u2026\u201d Selena said before thinking of a name for her daughter, \u201cI think this name should do\u2026 Sirra sound like a good name to you?\u201d She asked her daughter, who just smiled and giggled.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She has been here for nearly a year now but never left the shelter of the woods. \"Where are we and where do you come from?\", she asked. \"We are in the great forest of Shelba. I come from a town a couple of hours from here.\" \"A town?\", Selena asked. Tom was a little confused by this question. \"A settlement of people\". \"So there are more of your kind\" Tom stopped massaging \"Are you not from here?\", he asked. Another kick sent him flying backwards. \"I ask the questions maggot\", she yelled. \"Now continue massaging before I get angry.\" And so he continued his work in even more pain. \"Answer my question!\" \"Yes Mistress. There are more of my 'kind'\" \"Good\", she sayed. \"I am fed up with beeing alone and doing everyhing by myself. You are small and helpless. Inferior I would say.

A gush of wind swept over his body and the tremor intensified the pain he was already feeling. Tom groaned in pain and could not answer. With a swift movement he was trapped beneath her foot. Her toe resting on his chest. \"You will tell me now. The faster you do it the less pain and the more bodyparts you may keep.

April had mischievous smile on her face then she picked him up \"What are you doing and why are you looking at me like that\" April licked her lip \"Has anyone ever told you you look tasty\" Tom remembered a couple times but kept it to himself \"No\" April smiled then tugged his shirt off then his pants. Tom came into realization of what she was gonna do then started struggling in her hand \"STOP DON'T EAT ME\" April looked at him \"I'm not gonna eat you at the moment anyway I just want to taste you\" Tom felt himself fly into the air then seen her her mouth waiting for him.

April moaned softly a few times while Tom rubbed her feet but it wasn't enough for her to give him the win, so he took it up a notch and leaned in and gave her foot a kiss, he kissed every inch of her sole, she even lowered her toes so he could kiss on and in between them, at one point she grabbed him with her toes while he had his body in between her toes kissing, she just teased him of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while April said \"That's enough\" and gave him her decision:</span></div></div>",

April suddenly spit me out and made it look like she was hugging me. I looked up to the newcomer. April was 7ft, but this girl was less than 4ft! Then he noticed the girl\u2019s companion. It had striped fur Andy four black eyes that reflected red. Four paws with four claws on each paw. A long rat-like tail with a split at the end. A mane of spikes ran down its back and it\u2019s mouth was wide and full of inward curved fangs. Its mouth had a grin that rivaled the Cheshire cat\u2019s grin. That\u2019s Tom realized it was 3ft tall, which made it just slightly shorter than its owner! The girl wore a black shirt with long sleeves and grey cuff sleeves, as well as black pants and a black skirt with a brown belt. Grey boots with black on the bottom. Her eyes and hair were black, and her hair had a silver stripe. Her eyes glanced at April with no emotion. \u201cWhat do you have in your hand?\u201d Her voice, although stringent, held a curious tone. April looked at her with an angry expression and snapped, \u201cNothing you need to know.<br>\r\n However, her confidence was short lived as the girl glared at her in silence. (Remember, April is sitting on the ground, so the girl is taller in the current scenario.) The girl spoke again, irritation lacing her voice. \u201cI\u2019ll ask again, what is in your hand?\u201d April looked down at me, then back at the girl \u201cIt\u2019s a human, happy now?\u201d The girl did not look satisfied, but said nothing. I noticed her companion sniffing the air, and before April or I could do anything, it launched itself forward and grabbed me in its mouth, then turned around and went back to the girl. I slid out of its mouth into the hand of the girl, who raised me to eye level. Her black eyes studied him before looking at April. \u201cI can tell you were about to eat him.\u201d April looked angry and guilty at the same time. \u201cSo what? He's mine, so I can do what I want. Now give him back.\u201d The girl had a smile tugging at the edge of her mouth. \u201cAfter what I just saw, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d April sprang to her feet, now towering over the girl. \u201cDo you want me to know you out?\u201d She shouted, causing Tom to recoil and cover his ears. The girl was unfazed and simply stated, \u201cI\u2019d like to see you try.\u201d With that, she set onto her companion\u2019s head, then turned on her heel and walked off. She barely went 500 feet when April grabbed the back of her shirt collar. The girl didn't miss a beat, spun around, and hooked her right in the cheek. April fell to the ground, and the girl sent her companion off. \u201cTry me, April.\u201d She spat, then turned and ran off.</span></div></div>",
