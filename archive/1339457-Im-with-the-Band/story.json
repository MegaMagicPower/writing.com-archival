You imagined how easy it would be for him to go to the Bass guitar sence the two are very similar to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then remembered your good friend Greg, a quite fat dragon with green scales and yellow underbelly with a smile so inocent that it was in a way creapy.  He played the drums so he could play in the school's jazz band, so he was pritty decent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then spat out the tooth paste and washed your face before putting some clothes on.  You thought about who your singer might be, but you decided that you needed to get your friends together so they have a say in it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time after you called Vio and Greg, you were driving in your used red scratched up van that had a newly remade apostery consisting of mostly Duck Tape.

Your name was Shelonkan Respute, but everyone called you Shela, and by everyone you mean every friend that you knew, which was many.  This was thanks from your very nice and comforting personality as most of your friends were old friends that you have known sence kindergarden, a few out casts because of their looks, and the few good people in this neighborhood.  Or in other words eight friends that you could pick for your band. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brushed off you scales with a towel before getting into a tank top as you thought of the options of who to include into your band.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one that came to your mind was Splotchy, a kid you met in Junior High and were friends ever sence.  He was a very good artist but not good at anything else because he was missing an arm after getting caught up in a very bad gang fight on accadent.  You specificly thought of him first because he had the best and most varied singing voice you have ever heard.  You only know this because he whent to your house to take a shower because his shower was being worked on, and he sung very loud in the shower both you and your parents knew about his tallent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother person came into your mind was Jessie, a naga girl that you knew for just about forever.  She was a very big girl, being a gaboon viper naga, and was your first choice as drummer when you played the video game Rock Band, so why not pick her as a drummer in a real band?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head to the phone to call one of them to see if they would join your new band, but who to call first.</span></div></div>",

He was certanly easy to spot, wearing a large ink stained robe along with ink stained bell bottoms, a thick scarf wrapped around his neck, covering anything below his noes, and a beret on top of his head.  Well of course he was missing his right arm and what was left of that sleeve was ripped up and covered in dried blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie on the other hand slithered from the other side, her long snake body filling up both the front seat and the back seats.

You have emerald green eyes and are fairly skinny.  As you look at your reflection, you realize you look a bit out of it..<br>\r\n     \"That's what you get when police sirens keep you up half the night, I guess,\" You say to yourself.<br>\r\n     You let out a big yawn and head to the bathroom, where you take a quick shower and brush your teeth. As you brush you watch the usual bristles fall from the toothbrush. That happens often, seeing as how your toothbrush isn't designed for fangs as sharp as yours. After you spit your toothpaste out you go into your bedroom to pick out some clothes. You decide on a pair of denim jeans, a Led Zeppelin T-shirt, and a pair of Vans Off the Wall shoes.<br>\r\n     As you walk downstairs to grab some breakfast, you hear a ringing; your phone. You look at the caller ID and see that it's your friend, Chase.<br>\r\n     \"Hey, man, what's up?\" you greet him as you pick up the receiver.<br>\r\n     You've known chase for pretty much as long as you can remember. He's an average sized human with long, brown hair that comes down to his shoulders. He's practically obsessed with the Ramones, owning all of their albums and watching nearly every concert by them that was ever taped. But, of course, the Ramones aren't all he listens to.<br>\r\n     \"Not a lot,\" he replies, \"I'm bored out of my mind actually, wanna do something? You're off work today, right?\"<br>\r\n     \"Yeah, I'm off,\" You reply, \"But, do what? There's nothing to do here, and I don't trust that piece of crap in my driveway to get us five blocks.\"<br>\r\n     \"You've got a point,\" Chase says. It was no wonder you two are friends, you're almost in the exact same situation. Chase lives just down the road from you, in the same neighborhood. He has, for all intents and purposes, the same living conditions as you. He, however, has a job a little more enjoyable than you. He works weekends at Baskin Robbin's. Not the most exciting job ever, but it does the job.<br>\r\n     Then the idea donned on you...<br>\r\n     \"Chase, you still play the drums, right?\"<br>\r\n     \"Of course, why?\"<br>\r\n     \"Dude, let's start a band!\"<br>\r\n     Chase was a very good drummer, but he'd never considered being a part of a band.<br>\r\n     \"A band? Here? Did you fall down the stairs and hit your head or something?\" he asked.<br>\r\n     \"Chase, I'm serious. I think Johnny still plays guitar, we could get him to play bass,\" you say. Johnny was another one of your friends, also human. He had sandy blond hair that parted in the middle, and was very shy to anyone he didn't know well.<br>\r\n     \"And what about a singer? We can't sing,\"<br>\r\n     \"Oh, I've got that covered. Just get a hold of Johnny, and I'll get our singer.\"<br>\r\n     \"Whatever.\"<br>\r\n     After you hang up with Chase, you head straight for your phone book. You plan on calling Even. Even is a light brown fox, about a year younger than you. You'd only talked with him on a few occasions, but you'd heard him sing at many talent shows when he was in school, and he was amazing.<br>\r\n     After a few rings, you hear Even's voice answer.<br>\r\n     \"Hello?\" he says through the receiver.<br>\r\n     \"Hey. Even?\" you ask.<br>\r\n     \"Yeah, who's this?\" he asks.<br>\r\n     \"It's [your name].\"<br>\r\n     \"How'd you get my number?\"<br>\r\n     \"Found it in the book. Listen, would you like to join my band?\"<br>\r\n     \"A band? I can't play any instrument.\"<br>\r\n     \"No, but you can sing. So, what do you say?\"<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

The main diffrence is that we are not alone, mythical creatures are not that mythical and roam around and do jobs like the rest of us, some of them are morphs and some are bipedal, yet they all lead lifes quite similar to our own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are an average teen who has just graduated highschool, unfortunatly, you didn't graduate with top scores for a scholarship.  Now all you have is a crudy job in a crudy neighbor hood that isn't exactly kid friendly.  You want out, but you don't have the money or much of a real reason to leave other than \"you want out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour guitar has been your only true \"important\" possesion and you have gotten pritty good.  Could this be your key out of this forsaken neighborhood and a profitable life, you decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n- Additions must be three or more scentences long (with very few exceptions)<br>\r\n- Romance is alowed as long as it's around PG13<br>\r\n- No slash (unless your talking about the guitarist, then go ahead)<br>\r\n- Keep things PG13, as in no drug addiction, but a fight here and there is a welcome addition<br>\r\n- Nothing realy gay, you can always have those little \"odd\" relationships, but nothing that gets real \"personal\"<br>\r\n- Don't end the story, but if you do at least give the option of continuing it, thank you.</td>",
