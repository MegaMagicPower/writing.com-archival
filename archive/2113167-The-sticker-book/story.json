It was a saturday morning, what could your mother want at this time of morning?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a half-hearted grumble you slowly stumble out of bed, shuffling over to the door. Cracking it open, you stick your head out into the hallway. \"What?\" You growl out, one eye rubbing at the crust that had gathered about your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think fast brat! You've got mail!\" You hear your mother shout out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a moment for your mind to start to register the words that she said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a moment more for the meaning to parse in your head. Unfortunately, that was two seconds of thinking too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\">THWACK</div></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rock back, nearly falling back as something large and square slams into your face at a rather respectable speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Owww...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly pull the square thing off of your face before it has time to fall to the ground. Hopefully whatever this is isn't breakable. It wouldn't be the first time that your mother has accidentally broken something because she has far too much energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading back into your room, you sit down on your bed and look at the square. Oh. It's a box. That makes a lot of sense. It's mail. And mail tends to either come in boxes or in letters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight... Your brain is obviously not ready for whatever this is. Time to go and take a shower before opening the box...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long, and relaxing shower you return to your room. It takes almost no time at all to remove the brown paper wrapping the box, and get it open...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, you find something... very odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a book. A book of sticker paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that if by far not the most interesting part. No, the most interesting part if the first page, which is filled with absolute nonsense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt talks about how the book is magical and these are magic stickers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is ridiculous. There is no such thing as magic...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at the same time... It's not like there is going to be any kind of results from trying... <i>right?</i> So it's completely fine to play along while in your room, where no one else will see. Because you most certainly don't think that a strange mysterious book that arrived in the mail for you with no name or return address or anything on it would be strange or mysterious or possibly actually real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would just be silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWouldn't it?</span></div></div>",

So there is no reason to worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long, slow moment, you crack open the book, and after flipping past the first page, which of course was the rules about the book and how to use them, you turned to a blank page of sticker paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow... to do the deed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should you try to stick into the book...</span></div></div>",

You post Scat stuff, I will take it down.<br>\r\nGood Spelling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\">Characters:</div></b><br>\r\nAlex - 16 years old, Average young man, brown hair, green eyes. After a mysterious package arrives in the mail, Alex comes into possession of a strange book of sticker paper that has magical powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary - 12 years old, Youngest sister. Is almost the stereotypical girly girl. She likes stickers, plushies, and all manner of things in pink. Likes to pretend she is a magical princess from another dimension. Has black hair and blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilliana 'Lilli' - 15 years old, Younger sister. A bit of a black sheep amongst the family, she has more Japanese leanings. A lesser man might call her a Weeabo. Tends to wear very ornate and complex japanese clothing even when the situation doesn't call for it. Dyed her hair black with green highlights. Always wears red contacts<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley 'Ash' - 17 year old, older sister. A full on Gothic girl, wears only black and silver. Naturally black hair and silvery grey eyes. She has admitted to you that she is a lesbian, but refuses to tell anyone else in the family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet - 19 years old, older sister who is in her final year of High school. Captain of the cheer team, she has blonde hair and bright green eyes. She is known to have a bit of a flirty streak, but according to her, she is still a virgin, despite her best attempts. (In fact, she's even propositioned you) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay - 22 years old, Eldest sister, from a different marriage, Red head, lives in town but not with you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiden - 38 Years old, Mom, russet hair, brown eyes, Stay at home mom<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Father' - ???, Your dad. You've never met him, and the best you can say is that a large check comes in the mail each month<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel free to create even more characters<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\">THE STICKER BOOK</div></b><br>\r\nThe sticker book, at first glance appears to be completely normal. And a little pointless as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a big book filled with blank sticker paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, despite the pages being blank, when you decide to peel a sticker free of the page, the sticker will be the exact shape and size that you want it to be. And sticker laid over a body part will take on the features of whatever has been stuck, and when the sticker is peeled off, so is the part in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEG: If you were to take a sticker and place it over your mouth, and then pull the sticker off, you would then have no mouth and your mouth would be on the sticker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still have control over body parts that have been peeled off, and you can still feel everything that the body parts feel. So for instance, if you were to peel off your eyes you could still see and if you peel off your mouth you can still talk. With a few exceptions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. If the sticker is placed on another person, the original owner no longer has control over the sticker and whoever the sticker has been placed on has control of it instead. With the further exception of the head. If someone's head is placed on another body, they also gain control of it as well as control of all their original body parts as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. If you place a sticker on backward, the body parts in question temporarily cease to exist. So if you were to peel your nose off with a sticker and then put it on reversed, you would then no longer have a nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Fire - Fire is the only way to destroy the stickers. If you were to rip a sticker of a body part, the sticker would be ripped and the body part would drop out. This goes for any other means of destroying the stickers other than fire. <b>Fire is the only way to destroy the stickers. <span class=\"clred\">ANY BODY PARTS DESTROYED THIS WAY ARE GONE FOR GOOD</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition, you can also place a body part on the sticker page and push it into the book, turning it into a sticker. Unlike the above where you turn a body part into a sticker, this becomes a regular looking flat sticker, that cannot be controlled. However, you can also do much the same with a regular sticker where you push it against a body part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can also create copies of body parts by using a scanner/printer and printing out copies of the parts, but only if you are using sticker paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStickers under regular use last for <span class=\"clred\"><u><i><b>12 hours</b></i></u></span>. After that point, the adhesive wears off, and you can no longer remove or attach the parts. They are now part of whatever and wherever they have been stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, you can simply apply new stickers to make them usable again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStickers that have been placed on in reverse will not time out like this, however if another sticker is placed on top of this sticker in a normal means then after the 12 hours have passed the parts that have disappeared are gone for good. <span class=\"clred\">ANY BODY PARTS DESTROYED THIS WAY ARE GONE FOR GOOD</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">The sticker book has an infinite number of pages, and so if there is not enough space on the page to remove another sticker you can just turn the page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">THE BOOK IS NEARLY INVULNERABLE. NO MATTER WHAT IS TRIED, THE BOOK CANNOT BE DESTROYED.<br>\r\nEXCEPT FOR FIRE<br>\r\nIF THE BOOK IS BURNED TO A CRISP, ALL STICKERS LOSS THERE POWER FOREVER<br>\r\nALL BODY PARTS LOST THIS WAY ARE GONE FOR GOOD</span></div><br>\r\n</td>",
