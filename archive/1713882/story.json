The purple and gold dragon stretched slowly so as not to wake the lovely black and red dragon female beside him. Smiling down at her still snoozing form. Spyro took a moment to look out over the unusual landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been several months since Malifor had been defeated and Spyro still couldn't get over how the land had changed. With the planet nearly having been destroyed, it had taken all the power he could muster to stop it from flying apart. As such, somehow he'd caused the large landmasses that had started pealing off the planet to now hover at varying levels above the former surface of the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now the pair were resting on a small green island that was floating easily two hundred yards above the surface of the world below. Spyro glanced over the edge of the tiny island and looked at the changed landscape. One sight in particular caught his eye...</span></div></div>",

Something in Spyro urged him to examine it, that it was important somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to Cynders still sleeping form and gently nudged her awake. Yawning the black and red dragoness stretched as she awoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something the matter Spyro?\" she asked sleepily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That cave down there,\" he indicated the one he'd seen, \"I think we should check it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder looked at the gas dissipating from the entrance, \"I don't know, that air might be poison. It looks a lot like my poison breath.\" Cynder demonstrated, breaking away from Spyro. The small cloud of her breath attack and the one below were similar, but not quite the same shade of green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we won't know until we get down there,\" Spyro shrugged, \"If it is poison, you can just use your wind power to blow it away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder wanted to argue for caution some more, but Spyro was eager to explore and had already leaped off the floating island. Sighing, Cynder followed as they swooped down to the cave entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp close, the entrance was bigger than they expected, easily large enough for two adult dragons to enter side by side, so to the two of them it was quite large. Thankfully the gas also seemed to have dissipated by the time they landed, leaving only a few wisps remaining as they too continued to vanish into the open air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder gave a tentative sniff, \"It doesn't smell like poison,\" she mused, \"It doesn't smell like anything I've encountered before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the more reason to look into this.\" Spyro smiled and strode forwards. Once again Cynder wanted to protest buy could only sigh and follow him as they entered the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir powerful dragon eyesight took only moments to adjust to the dim light and once it had they were amazed by what they saw...</span></div></div>",

Dials and gauges were covered in dust and grime. And some giant gears the size of Spyro's whole body had fallen off one of the contraptions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you suppose this place is?\" Cynder asked as she cautiously circled one of the looming creations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know, but be careful,\" Spyro cautioned her, \"This stuff looks real old. No telling if it might collapse on us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro continued walking with Cynder, pressing a bit further into the cave.

Spyro could only watch as Cynder seemed to grow fuzzy as if he saw her through a foggy glass. But then the room started to turn fuzzy for Spyro and there was a sensation like being slurped up a long straw and dumped into a mixing bowl. After an uncertain amount of time the sensation that followed was akin to being dumped out with the force of a cannon being shot into a brick wall at point blank range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the machinery began to cycle down, the two platforms that had once been occupied by a pair of dragons were now devoid of any sign of them. However on a third nearby platform another figure was stumbling to their feet. Black scaled across their body with golden belly scales and horns, the dragon stumbled a bit in place, blinking a mismatched pair of eyes. The left iris colored a light green the right a soft lavender. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cyn... Spy...\" The dragon tried to talk but wobbled as a wavering voice went up and down in their throat. Finally the dragon sat down hard and took a few minutes to simply lay there and collect their thoughts. At which point they made a rather shocking discover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were both Cynder and Spyros memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock almost drove the dragon to their feet bot again the loss of balance hindered them and they stumbled to the floor again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... but how...?\" The voice was more controlled now and less warbling, but still sounded faintly like two voices speaking as one.Searching their mind the dragon found two sets of memories, whole lifetimes worth even. Both Cynder and Spyros minds were joinfd together in one body. One shared body made of both dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two had merged together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new dragon, felt worry and concern from both sides and yet as the minutes ticked by they also felt more like a singular being as well. There was a strange overlap. Cynder and Spyro were each part of them, but somewhere in between this new dragon had been created. And, though they were unsure if it was a good idea or not, the first thing they did was give themselves a new name: Spydra. A bit odd but it would do for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second thing they decided to do was to discover more about their body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly examining themselves Spydra found that they were a good deal thicker than Spyro or Cynder, a bit taller too. Probably the result of mashing two bodies together into one. All that excess mass had to go somewhere. Perhaps the most shocking and embarrassing though was Spydra discovered they weren't a 'him' or a 'her'. They were both. Below Spydra had an impressive pair of male parts but tucked behind them and below their tailhole was a female vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShi was a herm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" the dual gendered dragon heaved another long sigh, \"This... is freaky. We... I need to figure out what's going on. Maybe there's a way to undo this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpynder then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Sets about examining the cave/lab. maybe there's some answers to be found. or maybe they just bump into more machines or chemicals that mutate them further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Leave and go back to the dragon temple. Maybe there's a spell book in the library that can undo this sort of thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Embarrassing as it is, perhaps seek help from the Dragon Elders. They might known an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Something else?</span></div></div>",

Cynder moaned, the sensation of bloating up with fat feeling heavenly on her expanding frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shortly after, the rest of her body began to blimp with rich, gorgeous dragon fat. Her ass cheeks grew into large, squishy orbs that would have swallowed up her tail, had not it swelled with some pudge of its own. Her neck began to become less and less visible, chins forming around her head. Her legs and arms began to fwoomp out, sinking into her ginormous belly. But the main center of attention was her swelling breasts. They rapidly grew into two giant blobs on her chest, able to put any other dragon's breast size to shame. The dragoness murred, feeling her body slowly expand, sinking into herself deeper and deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Soon after, the once small dragon waddled out of the pool, becoming a huge blob of her former self. She was the same size as what Spyro currently was, and absolutely adored it. \"I take it you enjoy your new body?\" Spyro asked lewdly. Cynder could only nod her head, barely able to process the pleasure she was feeling right now. Her head was cradled snugly amidst numerous chins. Her body rippled like a pond with every movement she made. The idle glorps and gurgles the dragon's immense bodies made was music to her ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The barely-mobile Cynder used all her might to move over to her purple lover, her body violently rippling in the process. She eventually made it face to face with Spyro, who smiled back at her lovingly. \"Spyro...\" she finally managed to speak. \"I-I'm soooooooooooo fat\u2026\" the dragon muttered, using her comparatively minuscule hands to rub her body. \"Indeed you are\" grinned Spyro, \"You're the most beautiful dragon I've ever layed eyes on. Cynder's enourmous cheeks turned a bright red, hearing those kind words from her purple lover. The dragoness leaned in and gave Spyro a rough kiss, causing the dragon's eyes to widen, before he returned Cynder's affection, the kiss growing softer and softer as it went on, their giant bellies squishing into each other. \"I love you Spyro, my big sexy beast\" Cynder said seductively. \"I love you too, my beautiful bloated blimp\" Spyro replied.</span></div></div>",

She began to rub and squeeze at his fat body, even daring to give his stomach a couple kisses. \"Mmmhh... C-Cynder...\" the dragon muttered, \"D-Don't stop...\" Cynder was happy to oblige, kneading into his enormous frame like dough. Spyro moaned, feeling his bloated belly get rubbed and squished by his lover. The pleasure was almost too much for him to handle. Their stomachs sloshed and gurgled on top of each other as Cynder wobbled closer to caress the purple mound of scales in front of her. To finish off the massage, Cynder leaned into Spyro's flab, and gave his enormous cheeks a sweet little kiss. A goofy smile came across Spyro's face, that of a dragon experiencing true pleasure. \"T-Thank you\" Spyro called out to her. \"Anything for you, my plump little prince\" she seductively replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Spyro's smile turned into that of a smirk, as he looked as his equally obese counterpart. \"Allow me to return the favor\" he said with a lewd grin. Before Cynder could respond, Spyro SHOVED his muzzle deeply into her stomach. He began to kiss, rub, and grip at her numerous rolls, pleasuring the dragoness as best as he could. \"H-ahhh... S-S-Spyro!\" she yelled, the pleasure overwhelming her immense body. Her moaning only increased Spyro's lust, however, as he continued to play with her body. Cynder was panting uncontrollably, loving every second of Spyro caressing her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eventually, Spyro pulled his face out from Cynder's stomach. She let out a long sigh, her body still sloshing from Spyro's intense play-session. Spyro let out a chuckle, before leaning back into her. \"I'm not done with you yet!\" he said devilishly. The dragon turned to the immense tankers which were her breasts, before latching his mouth onto her left nipple. Cynder screamed at the top of her lungs as a huge shockwave of pleasure hit her like lightning. \"S-SPYRO!\" she screamed, but he kept sucking at her massive mammaries. Soon, a large torrent of milk shot out of her breast causing Cynder to moan louder, Spyro happily guzzling it down. As soon as the flow of milk ceased, Spyro immediately latched onto the other nipple, continuing to drink the delicious dragon milk. Cynder was unable to speak, the pleasure was too intense for her to form words. She simply sat there idly, panting heavily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally, the river of milk had stopped, and Spyro detached his mouth from her breasts. Cynder was dumbstruck with glee, having unloaded her breast milk into her ginormous lover. She leaned in and gave Spyro a deep and passionate kiss, the two blobs murring in deep pleasure. The dragons cuddled themselves together in their body fat, and began to fall asleep. \"I love you Spyro\" the dragoness said to her blimp of a dragon. \"I love you too, Cynder\" he happily replied. The two dragons peacefully dozed off to sleep, happily dreaming about each other's love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">The End.</div></span></div></div>",

Cynder turned her head to Spryo with a mischievous smile. \"You thinking what I'm thinking?\" she asked. Spyro looked at the pool of slime that had given them their new bodies, and smiled back at her. \"That's what I thought\" the dragoness giggled, the two slowly waddling over the the pool's edge. With one last look at each other, the dragons jumped, or in this case sloshed, their way back into the mysterious liquid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Spyro and Cynder began to wallow in the pool of goo, the gel-like substance seeping through their numerous rolls of fat. They did their best to get covered with as much of the stuff as they were able to, wanting to become as big as they possibly could. After a few minutes of rolling around however, they didn't seem to notice any effects on their bodies. \"Maybe we're too big for it to have any effect on us\" Cynder said. \"Yeah, the growth should have kicked in by now\" added Spyro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Just then, a thundering GUUUUURGLE emitted from the dragon's stomachs, the noise loud enough to shake the very cavern they were in. Their bodies shook and wobbled like gelatin, only adding to the miniature earthquake their girth was creating. They both moaned hotly as their bodies quaked and rippled violently, the gurgling growing louder and louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Soon enough, the dragons' bodies began to grow once again. Their stomach's were big enough by now that they we're able to touch the bottom of the pool that was fattening them up. Their necks became completely invisible, swallowed up by the multitude of chins that cradled their heads snugly. Their cheeks blimped into huge spheres, each blowing up as big as beach balls. Their wings were comically tiny compared to their now-massive frames. Their asscheeks swelled up along with the rest of their body, the squishy orbs each as big as Spyro and Cynder had been originally, before the slime had turned them into quivering piles of lard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eventually, Spyro and Cynder had grown large enough that their legs began to slowly rise off the ground, their entire bodies being supported by their whale of a stomach. Now the dragons had no way of stopping their growth, even if they wanted to. They simply sat and enjoyed the feeling of becoming larger and larger with every passing minute. \"Mmmhh... Spyro...\" Cynder managed to speak. \"We're s-so huge...\" she whimpered. \"You enjoying yourself?\" Spyro asked. Cynder nodded back at him, her head movements sending ripples throughought her body. The dragon's arms and legs were closer and closer to becoming nonexistent from the outside world, having sunk almost completely into their bodies. In just under an hour, the two had transformed into big, wobbling sacks of lard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The pool of goo was tiny compared to their bodies by now, but the growth continued to be piled on. They both layed there moaning heavily, unable to find words to describe how they were feeling. They continued to rise up into the air like dough, their stomachs pushing them up higher and higher. Their legs and arms continued to thicken, becoming squishy tubes of fat as they continued to be swallowed up by their bloating bellies. Their asscheeks were enormous, each as big as a fully grown dragon. Their vision had become clouded with their immense cheeks, encroaching on their vision as they swelled larger and larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pretty soon, the dragons felt their bloated booties hit the sides of the cave, a testament to how enormous they were. This, combined with the immense pleasure they were getting simply by feeling themselves grow, caused Spyro and Cynder to cry out in bliss, howling uncontrollably as they felt themselves swell. Higher and higher they rose, their bellies gurgling and glorping as they became less and less recognizable as dragons, almost completely sinking into themselves. They were now face-to-face with the ceiling of the cavern, the entire area taken over by their bulk. As their growth peaked, the two screamed at the top of their lungs, pleasure coursing through every bit of fat on their bodies. And just like that, it was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0To say that the two were gigantic would be an understatement by now, as they had become nothing more but scaled blobs. Their arms and legs had completely vanished into their flab. Their bellies were colossal, roughly the size of three adult dragons. They donned cheeks the size of large boulders, almost rendering them blind. They had so many chins that they were almost impossible to count. Their tremendous asses were tightly squished upon the sides of the cave. Their bodies were constantly shaking, the delicious rolls of flab wobbling and gurgling like pudding. \"Hehehe... oh ancestors...\" Spyro finally spoke. \"We're gigantic.\" Cynder smiled back at him, adoring her new lardball of a body. It was then she noticed that the once green pool of slime had turned a dull shade of gray. \"Looks like we drained the slime for all it's worth\" Cynder said. \"Yeah...\" Spyro replied. \"Can't say I regret doing this though\" Spyro murmured. \"So big and sexy...\" Cynder smiled back at him, also intoxicated by her new curves. Eventually, the warmth their fat was producing caused the dragons to become drowsy. They settled into the depths of themselves, and peacefully drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Spyro awoke, he found himself laying next to Cynder. The two had somehow shrunk back to their normal sizes, the once immobile pair of dragons back on their feet. Spyro nuzzled Cynder awake, the two smiling at each other, before leaning in for a long kiss. The pool had returned back to it's bright shade of green, bubbling mysteriously as the dragons continued their affection for each other. \"Best. Discovery. Ever.\" Cynder said, the two breaking free from their kiss. \"You said it\" Spyro replied. \"Come on, the others are probably worried about us by now.\" said Cynder. And with that, the dragons headed out of the mysterious cave and headed home, but they knew that wouldn't be the last time they would visit the mysterious pool. No, it was only the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">The End.</div></span></div></div>",

His big forelegs were more like flippers of flab as the upper arms rolled over the lower in big folds. His face was twice as wide now thanks to thick chubby cheeks that diminished the length of his snout as a result. Even small rolls of fat could be seen inching up the base of his horns. Below his face a new triple chin had formed, sagging out in cascading rolls that replaced his neck as they flopped over a chest containing a large pair of, what Cynder had once heard described as 'breasts', .

She moved her claw, slowly from the weight, back to some of her horns, which felt more covered at the base than Spyro's horns. Bringing her claw and head down, she glimpsed her chins, she counted seven and an eighth growing in quickly. The black dragoness also saw her well developed what could be best described as breasts, which put Spyro's breasts to shame, and her belly, dwarfing Spyro's belly at nearly double its size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Spyro...\" Cynder barely got out. \"Spyro I'm monstrous...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro nodded and smirked, before moving his mass so he was right next to the blubbered black dragoness. \"It's a very attractive 'monstrous', Cynder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you're the attractive one, Spyro.\" Cynder would blush were it not for the scales covering her growing, jiggling body. \"Especially with that growing belly of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blubbery, fattening dragons attempted to kiss each other when their bellies started rumbling, causing the rest of their bodies to jiggle wildly.

He looked like he could fall asleep right there, and plummet to the void below. Cynder flew close to him, trying to keep him awake. Spyro flapped his wings unevenly, his head bobbing up and down from the sleepiness he was feeling. When they returned to the floating island where they rested, Spyro collapsed on the ground, too tired to move. The last thing he could hear was Cynder calling his name, before his vision faded to blackness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro looked around him. He was in some endless void of white, with nothing around him. And also...He noticed how hungry he was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I feel so hungry. I need food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen and there, a big slab of steak appeared before him. Spyro blinked his eyes in disbelief. He looked at the steak, sniffing it, smelling the tantalizing aroma of cooked meat. His mouth watered, and he reached his head forward, eager for a bite. As he tore a piece off with his mouth, the sweet flavor of meat exploded on his taste buds. He tore into the steak eagerly, hungry to fill his empty stomach with meat. As he finished off the steak, leaving only bone, it disappeared. He placed a clawed hand on his belly, feeling it poke out a bit, but still hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-more! I gotta have more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a long string of smoked sausages appeared before him. He bit one off, tasting the juices flow over his tongue and into his throat. He sucked on one, inhaling the sausages in like a noodle. He was chewing and sucking at the same time, swallowing the sausages quickly. When the last one entered his mouth, he chewed on it and swallowed, feeling his hunger sated for now. He smiled as he lied down, rubbing his bulging tummy. It was poking out quite a bit, a pudgy ball of scales on his otherwise lithe frame. Then, he suddenly felt drowsy. Very drowsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...This feels...So...Familiar...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spyro! Wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro's eyes shot open as he lifted his head.

You just fell like a log, and you started blowing up, I didn't know what was happening! Please, are you alright? Tell me you're alright!\" Cynder said, worry etched into her every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynder, I'm fine. I feel fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro got up, but felt his center of balance thrown off. \"Wait, did you say I started blowing up?\" he asked. He looked down at himself, seeing a pudgy ball of fat on his underbelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spyro, it started growing a few moments after you fell asleep. I knew that weird slime was dangerous.\" Cynder told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro placed a hand on his new belly, kneading the soft fat on his frame. Then, he looked at Cynder.</span></div></div>",

The total effect was the city looked like one gigantic treasure.<br>\r\nSomething was awoken in Spyro then for the first time, the desire all dragons possessed for treasure. Not a form of greed as most beings assumed, but to a dragon treasure was a reflection of strength, and Spyro despite all his strength had never had any treasure in his life (not materialistic anyway). As such his desires drew him to the city, and it took all his willpower to resist for the moment.<br>\r\nA soft snort from Cynder alerted him to her presence again and for a long moment he debated whether to wake her or not. Unfortunately curiosity won out and he told himself he would fly down just to look and maybe bring her back a few jewels as a surprise.<br>\r\nAs he approached though the question came as to how to get inside. The whole city was covered by a great clear dome, and much as Spyro wanted in, he feared breaking it might be very dangerous. Flying around the edges of the city he finally spotted what looked to be a great gate at the base of the dome. Landing before it on the rocky former seabed, he approached cautiously. Such a huge treasure of a city, and yet there appeared to be no guardians in sight. Surely the ones who had built it would have left some form of protection, he mused.<br>\r\nStill, as he managed to claw the doors open and slip inside there was no sign of anyone or any traps in the least. After passing through a second, more intricately carved pair of doors, these opening inwards, he found himself on the main street of the city.<br>\r\nEverything looked so much bigger once inside, the streets could have held three of the Elders walking side by side with room to spare. Spyro wandered deeper and deeper into the city, the air smelling slightly dusty as it tickled his nose. Eventually he came to what looked to be the town square and in the center was poised a great statue of a dragon. The statue itself was gold, but had been covered head to toe in gems carved and placed so intricately it looked as if the creature was covered in scales made of the precious Amethyst stones. What's more there seemed to be some magic in the statue as it seemed to change shape depending on how Spyro looked at it, the features shifting slightly depending on where he stood.<br>\r\nSuddenly his breath caught in his throat as the shape looked all too familiar. The curved horns, the red stones for it's eyes, the dangerous fangs. Spyro would never forget that face.<br>\r\nMalefor.<br>\r\nStill before Spyro could even get over the shock the statue changed again, this time actually seeming to shrink a little and once more Spyro gasped as the statue took on his own features and he finally understood. The statue was somehow showing all the purple dragons of history, from the very first to the last two, him and Malefor. He shook his head, wondering what this could possibly mean.<br>\r\nAgain, before he could dwell on the subject a faint noise cause him to start, and he looked around for the source...</span></div></div>",

Her tail being dragged behind her because she was currently too shocked to keep it lifted.<br>\r\n\"This... this is just huge\" she said flabbergasted, shaking her head just to make sure that it was not some delusion brought upon by lack of sleep.  She turned to Spyro with her eyes wide asking, \"I cant believe you found this and didn't tell me!\"<br>\r\n\"I was going too\" Spyro retorted, hopping around to face Cynder, \"but I'm also kind stunned that this is even real, let alone that it might all be MINE!\"<br>\r\n\"Yours\" Cynder scoffed, \"I know the whole 'finders keepers thing, but claiming an entire city of riches like that is a bit extre...\" She then noticed the large statue of Spyro, and like her arguments, her jaw fell  \"Well... never mind then.\"  The purple dragon of legend couldn't help but chuckle seeing the strong and independent Cynder being rendered speechless by a statue of himself.  Still, to give Cynder credit, he was probably even more speechless, though the gears in his brain were on full overdrive.  He could be the luckiest, wealthiest, and most powerful dragon currently in existence, he was set for life.  Scratch that, both he AND Cynder were set for life, a very wealthy life that was normally reserved for penny pinching elders who did not know the meaning of 'splurging'.  Heck, he'd be able to Ember and give her a life of excess without even denting the supply of gold and jewels.  Spyro even smiled at the idea of keeping the pink dragon on the other side of the city that was so massive that even if she flew she would probably NEVER see him again.<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do with all this?\" asked Cynder, her eyes wide with curiosity and a tiny twinkle of begging.<br>\r\n\"You mean what are 'we' going to do with all this\" responded Spyro with a smile, only to have more joy well up within him when he saw the dragoness suddenly start getting giddy before quickly regaining her composure.  \"Still, your right, what 'are' we going to do with all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree possible choices:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA. The Best Treasure Doesn't Glitter Like Gold:  Spyro and Cynder decide to explore the city and let the vastness of their newly acquired hoard sink in.  While they explore though, the two find several interesting magical items and machines that are marked with strange descriptions written near them that is a bit vague.  This place also has a large stone arch that looks like a portal, and a meager library.  ((Anything from weight gain, to inflation, Transformation, sky's the limit))<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB. Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely: Spyro and Cynder decide that a city of gold is still a city, 'their' city.  So after sending the word out people quickly flooded in to populate the wealthiest city in the world, hoping to acquire their own riches, and if not, they knew that the \"Purple Dragon of Legend\", a hero to all, would be a great and just ruler.  That might have been true of Spyro and Cynder given that they were of decent age, but both are still young and immature, immediately using their massive wealth to live like royalty, it's the least they should get after saving the world after all.  Unfortunately, the seduction of excessively extravagant creature comforts, the aspect of seemingly unlimited wealth that's constantly growing, and the still predominant image of being 'heros', very quickly turn the two goodie goodie young dragons into a pair of selfish, gluttonous, slothful child dictators with just enough charisma when needed to get the hired hands and city residents to do what they want.  This lifestyle of excessive eating, lack of movement, and constant pleasure is sure to impact both of their waistlines.  ((Weight Gain))<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC. I Always Feel Like, Somebody's Watching Me:  Unknowing to the two of them, the city had it's own residents, currently hiding in the shadows.  It was a mystery if these things were hostile or friendly, if they would treat the two dragons as the incarnation of their purple god, or were they going to do something terrible like force water down their throats in an effort to extinguish the dragon's fire, turning the two into vaguely dragon shaped water beds?

The two dragons encountered many beautys as the made their way down the streets: jewelery shops that sold fine pieces of golden and silver wears, large parliament buildings, extraordinary feats of argitechture, and temples that would make the one in warfang look like a primative shrine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was overwhelming for Spyro and Cynder. Never have they seen a city so magnificent. The question of who could construct something like this(and abandonining it) hung in the two dragons' heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two dragons felt like they where getting lost in the incredible of streets, they took flight, but they weren't about to leave this rarity just yet.

The book store smelled of vanilla; a typicle smell for aging paper.

The books where very interesting, but not as facinating as the scrolls.The scrolls had instructions of how to controll ones element, aswell as a few spells here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a few spells that Cynder came apon that sparked her interest. \"Hey, Spyro, lookie here,\" Cynder said.

This spell has probably been lost for centuries; can you imagine what might happen if we could find a way to fuse two objects together?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyros\u2019 brow tabled giving Cynder a look that screamed \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d The dragoness just gave him a pleading look.

Spyro sneezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder yelped in shock breaking her concentration and the spell in the process.

The \u201chydra\u201d stood on four legs, and it was much bigger than Spyro or Cynder.

This quickly became overbearing for the two of them, and despite a little backlash from Cynder, Spyro hired some intelligent dragons to delegate the bulk of the work to while they delt with the larger issues.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for at least a week, and even with the additional help both dragons were starting to become quite weary of their jobs.  Though, things like food and good rest certainly did help them go through the difficult times of starting up the city, but it would only seem to grow worse as time went on, even if the actual 'work' diminished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro had soon started to ask for longer breaks and larger feasts to help 'regain his energy' while his work hours dwindled.  Soon having the entire week off after one day of 'work', despite the fact that all the work he did do was raise the taxes a little more and glut himself on more food before traveling back to the massive mansion that housed the two.  By the end of the month Spyro had grown into a very fat dragon, his belly arching downwards passed his knees while his chest seemed to swell out a bit.  There was even a light layer of fat around his limbs.  Still, this change wasn't even able to hold a candle to what had happened to Cynder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing in control of the police force was quite the responsibility, but it was also a very 'enabling' job.  Constantly the dragoness had servants who would offer her additional treats and favors while the black dragoness lied around waiting for more work to pop up.  Though, after trying out the fatty cuisine and slowly starting to get used to the servants constantly offering up their services, she slowly started 'expecting' certain things, and when it didn't happen she quickly made sure it did.  It wasn't to long that she began to constantly bark out orders for both food and pleasure, but mostly food.  She then began to not even leave the confines of her house, getting servants to run back and forth between the two places.  This had some horrific consequences for her body as it seemed to have exploded with lard.  She now looked more barrel like as her body oozed out a bit in her lying down possition but would have solid contact with the floor if she ever decided to stand up.  Fat limbs partially engulphed while uselessly spread out, her chest pushing out and providing a nice place to rest her thick neck.  Once sharp feminine features have now bloated up into a greedy muzzle with fat cheeks.  Her tail was even weighed down by the fat and there was a slight layer of lard on her wings too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"COOL ME FASTER\" Cynder blurted out to the dragonesess that surrounded her, the fans in their hands flailing as the dragon blob slowly pulled her usless body to the table.  The additional lard wrecked havoc on the dragoness as now she constantly demanded others to fan and cool her off, her fat doing too well to insilate her body.  Her panting and wheezing quite audable as she flopped down on the pillows and slowly began to gorge away.  Spyro's plump body already ahead of her, but was on a pile of gold coins and gems.</span></div></div>",

Still, he was the ruler of this small empire, despite delegating most issues to people below him, he still wanted to have final say in major issues and be able to inact what he wants into law.  Currently there was a law on the table, partially smeared by food (a little bit of Spyro's fault, a little bit of Cynder's fault), that had been troubling the great round ruler.<br>\r\n\"So, there's been some issues with importing food\" Spyro commented.  He looked across the table to see Cynder for once in a long while look concerned for something.  Starring directly at her, Spyro took note how the dragoness's fat arching back and massively wider body seemingly framed her head with thick rings of neck flab.<br>\r\n\"Ish it thieves, raiders\" Cynder spurted out, saliva flicking out of her thick jowls and her massive body jiggling.  Her shaking was more obvious considering her legs were pulled in, her obese shoulders and sides overhanging them like a dough ball pinched from the bottom.<br>\r\n\"I'll get the guarhds,\" she slurred, slowly lumbering her massive body, her flanks rolling about with each labored, anger fueled, step.  She dragged her gut along with the rest of her towards the table, as if she was going to ready the guards herself.  She began to attempt to climb up on the table for dramatic effect, her huge chest that jutted out far beyond the tip of her muzzle, oozing over the table, her sunken in legs pushed it up before firmly planting on the wood of the table with a heavy thump.  Propped upwards like that pushed her chest and chins into her own muzzle, making her appear sunken in.<br>\r\n\"Ih will crush *huff* dem myshelf, *wheeze* I'll eat em... *pant pant* I'll...\" she blurted out with wheezing.<br>\r\nCREEEEEK<br>\r\nCynder's end of the table then collapsed under her massive fat chest and front legs with a loud crack, sending the dragoness sprawled out with her head firmly planted in her own fat pigeon chest and rear end sticking up in the air, wheezing desperately.<br>\r\n\"No no no, nothing is being stolen\" Spyro groaned, noting that Cynder was as possessive of her food as he was about wealth, \"we need to expand our ports and streamline the inspection procedures at the gate.  Until then, there's going to be a food shortage.\"<br>\r\n\"A... *huff* shortage?\" Cynder panted, her thick legs spread out, too exhausted from her initial outburst to even attempt to get up from her current undignified position.<br>\r\n\"Now, in order to provide us with enough food, an adviser suggested we start rationing out food so that 'everyone' gets the food they deserve\"  <br>\r\nCynder let out a heavy, raunchy belch, a thick ripple traveling through her body, \"I still... get to have all... I want right?\" <br>\r\n\"Of course\" Spyro rolled his eyes, \"after all, we've saved the world, we sacrificed enough, the people can suffer through not having buttered rolls at dinner.\"<br>\r\n\"Perrr*URRRRP*...fect\" the massive blobby dragoness conferred, reaching out with a weak claw to grab at some more meat to stuff her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, upon the terrace, Spyro and Cynder waddled out wearing their best.  Spyro with an elegant crown and long cape, and Cynder with jewelry but also an arm band tightly wrapped around her front leg like a fully inflated blood pressure cuff with the symbol of the city guard.  Spyro's waddle, although heavy and slow, was much more majestic than Cynder's, having to practically drag her own massive body while Spyro merely waddled.  <br>\r\nWith their heads held up high, showing off their multiple chins, Spyro announced,<br>\r\n\"Ladies and gentledragons, I, Spyro, have come to bare you some unfortunate news.  Due to our city's rampant growth and prosperity, it has experienced what can only be described as 'growing pains'.\"  Spyro's bellows sent his cheeks and chins jiggling.  He stopped to take a few heavy heaves before continuing \"Our ports and gates can't handle the increasing flow of both food and goods going into the city, and thus, I am sorry to announce that until we've fixed the issue, all food in the city will be rationed and handed out.\"<br>\r\nThere was a bit of commotion among the massive crowd, Spyro holding out his hand to silence them.<br>\r\n\"Fear not, it shall not last long and not be extensive, even I and Cynder shall ration our food as well\"<br>\r\nCynder gave Spyro an almost hellish glare, but the purple dragon merely winked at her in assurance, \"the rationing shall be enacted on the morrow, so please, enjoy your night.  This will pass shortly and painlessly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough for Spyro and Cynder, it wasn't going to effect them at all, not only getting their own supply, but able to pick out the best bits of food that were rationed before distributed. </span></div></div>",

It was so incredibly effective that a new age had begun in the empire. A \"Soft Age\", or \"Age of Fat\" easily spread across the entire empire. Common folk were able to feed their families like never before and even the homeless were more than easily well fed. Dragons would stuff their faces as full with food as they could, not caring about moderation. Once thin dragons were thick and thick dragons were incredibly thick. A new phenomenon occurred in the empire's society, a lust for fat. The fatter a dragon was, the more children he or she was likely to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro and much, MUCH more so Cynder caught on to this trend.

In those days the situation in this small empire seem to worsen as Cynder's weight and Spyro's love for wealth increased.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Taxes were raised alarmingly high and certain foods, most of them sweets or red meat, were actually being rationed. The citizens were complaining about this, but they were largely ignored by their two round rulers.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hell, they didn't even bother to come to court when the matters were being discussed. Unfortunately, this would have some very negative effects.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The mole was quivering in fear, his eyes wide, looking up at his barrel-shaped ruler sitting, with few pillows shoved under him to cushion his large, soft behind, on a specially tailored golden throne, which stood on a raised platform.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Heaps of gold surrounded him, for it comforted Spyro greatly to know that his treasures were safe and in his sight. A golden crown rested on his head, and a red cape, with white fur around the edges, rested on his wide back.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uprisings!\" he yelled, glaring angrily at the little mole, \"What do you mean \"uprisings\"?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y-your m-majesty,\" the mole began, stuttering, shivering in fear, \"T-there's been c-chaos in the s-streets lately. A-a rebel group is sweeping up the citizens to fight against the so called t-tyrannical rulers of this kingdom.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Out,\" said Spyro in a low voice, his face growing dark.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I b-beg your pardon, your grace?\" the mole said, not quite hearing.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"GET OUT!\" Spyro screamed, his voice shrill, thrusting out a thick arm, his jowls quivering and fat jiggling, spittle flying, \"NOW! NOW! NOW!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The mole recoiled before he fled in absolute terror, leaving the king to brood in silence, between his hills of gold. Even though Spyro had little knowledge of how to rule a kingdom, he knew that rebels were bad, and it would cost him his position (and possibly his life) if he did not do something quick.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And he knew just who to turn to for help.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He would have called for a litter to carry him to his destination, but Spyro was so worked-up that he, surprisingly, got up from his own fat ass and began to waddle as quickly as possible, huffing and puffing, already sweating a little, his flanks rolling against each other, stopping a few times along the way to catch his breath.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After some time, the purple dragon reached his destination: a tall, thick, wide door with the symbol of the city's guard carved into the wood. Two burly male dragons clad in armor stood guarding it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Open up!\" Spyro commanded.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Knowing the ruler by sight, and muttering \"Yes, your majesty\", they opened the door. Spyro waddled right in, stopping to scan the room and to rest for a few moments.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He found himself in a large, lavishly decorated room, oversized furniture everywhere. There was even a small pool in the center of the room; but this was actually no pool but a bath meant for someone of great size!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That someone was laying on a huge bed, her fat rolls almost covering the already enormous bed, munching and slurping on what looked like the remainder of a huge cake. She was so large that Spyro was dwarfed by her size. Two dragonesses stood on each side of this black blob, fanning her to cool her down, their faces expressionless; they were quite used to the corpulent dragonesses slobish behavior by now.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Spyro whistled to her as if she was a dog. With a grunt, Cynder quickly raised her head, her green eyes blazing with anger between her basketball-sized cheeks, obviously not happy about being disturbed during her midday \"snack\".<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But she calmed down when she saw who it was. \"What?\" she asked, her voice sounding a few pitches deeper and oddly slurred.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her long, pink tong came out of her mouth, licking away the frosting from her fat lip, jowls and chins.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We got a problem,\" Spyro answered, \"Rebels are tearing up our streets.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What!?\" Cynder cried, raising, with great effort, her upper body in shock.<br>\r\nIf there was one thing she despised hearing, it was bad news.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How dare they!

I'll-\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But she was cut off when Spyro spoke. \"Calm down!\" he said, \"There's a couple of ways we can fix this.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cynder settled back down, folding her chubby paws over each other. \"I'm listening,\" was the only thing she said.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright,\" Spyro began, \"You need to double, no, triple the amount of guards on the street, and if they see any meetings gathering I want them to arrest everyone there for treason, got that?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sure,\" Cynder said, \"That'll be a piece of pie to do. Speaking of pie...\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She picked up a heavy chalice before flinging it at her nearest servant, a weasel in a butler's uniform, yelling: \"Get me a piece of pie, now!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It hit the poor servant, and he went down with a yelp, but he quickly regained himself, rubbing his sore head, saying: \"Y-yes, ma'am.\"</span></div></div>",

It had been a small affair since Spyro knew making it a big display would invite any remaining rebels to try something desperate. Instead it was small, contained, and a few of the most trustworthy individuals of the community were gathered to spread the word after the event.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Spyro sat atop his golden throne, more of a couch now as it had been widened several times to suit his ample rear end which now stick out further than his cone shaped nub of a tail. The big dragon no longer had a neck to speak of either, just a cascade of chins that rolled from his heavy jowls down to his flabby chest. His wings were tiny and useless, partially absorbed into expanding back rolls. As it was he'd never fly again. Not that he wanted to as it was far too much exercise anyway.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cynder sprawled nearby, her great form having been carried into the room by ten of the strongest dragons in the kingdom. If Spyro had been an apple in size Cynder was a watermelon. Her rolling mass dominated the throne room with it's house sized proportions. There was no sign of her legs or wings as all had been absorbed into her fatty rolls ages ago. Her back was even rising above her head and threatened to roll over it if not for her horns holding it back. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Interestingly, when it came time to decide punishment, Cynder had insisted on it herself. Normally Spyro, as King, would have done it, but he allowed it as he loved Cynder dearly.  However right as Cynder was trying to decide just what sentence to pass on the three rebel dragons who had been fighting them, her stomach gave a loud growl. Cynder demanded to be brought the biggest cake available and was soon delivered a five tier chocolate cake which she promptly dug into.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Cynder?\" Spyro asked as everyone waited while the enormous dark scaled blob gulped mass after mass of sweet treat, \"We need a decision.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Jush let meh eat cake,\" was her reply. However, to those assembled, the word 'me' had been mumbled and with her like 'them'.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Spyro pondered on this a minute and then smiled wickedly, \"Yes... yes a fitting punishment indeed. They claimed the revolution was to get food for everyone? Well now we'll give them all the food they can handle and then some. Lock them in the dungeon and feed them every hour on the hour with all the most filling foods available. Soon they won't be much of a threat and whatever credibility they had to any remaining rebels will be destroyed in the process.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The three were dragged away as Spyro congratulated Cynder on such a brilliant idea.

If we don't lower the prices for food soon there won't be anything for anyone to eat. If the citizens begin to starve they'll try to flee the kingdom.

A flickering light flashed from it, provoking the purple dragon to find the source of this mysterious illumination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back and saw Cynder still asleep, but she was beginning to stir. Spyro would have waited for her, but when he looked back, he saw that the island was quickly disappearing from his sight. He couldn't wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Spyro launched himself away from the cave's entrance. While flying to his desired location, the purple dragon could not help but feel guilty at leaving Cynder behind. But this strange phenomena he had to investigate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing into the island, the glinting object began to take form. It looked like some sort of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha!\" A familiar voice called from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, Spyro looked up before he was crashed into by a black figure. He lost his balance and began to fall, but two powerful arms grabbed a hold of his chest, saving him from his plummet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple dragon didn't need to know who the prankster was, but he couldn't resist to roll his eyes. \"Cynder, really?\" Spyro groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giggle came from the black dragoness. \"You should've told me where you where going first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro let loose a frustrated sigh. \"Can you let me go?\" he asked, not unkindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but can you manage to fly on your own?\" Cynder asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro nodded and Cynder let go with a \"OK\". Spyro fell, but quickly gained his composure. He flew up to her, saying: \"Sorry I left you; but there was this island I had to explore. He pointed towards the exact platform that was drifting ever further away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder looked towards it and raised her eyebrow. \"Well, if it's so interesting that you would be willing to abandon me, I guess I would go check it myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether they flew, coming closer to the island. There was that flicker yet again, mesmerizing both dragons. Rather flying straight to the source, Spyro and Cynder landed on the outskirts of the forest and proceeded to walk towards the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExiting the lush forest, Spyro and Cynder headed off to the light, that shone with more intensity then before.

The two expanding dragons were each bigger than Terrador's whole body. Each a mass of sagging scaly folds and rolls that threatened to consume their figures completely.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cyril was the larger of the two, probably because he started out as the slightly bigger of the two of them. His bloated body pressed out between his thick tree trunk legs, themselves layered with fat that sagged down to cover his joints and covered the top of his clawed feet sporting toes like thick sausages. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His wings had not escaped expansion either, each extended rod bloating out thick, making the webbing between them appear smaller.

His chest had puffed out far enough that Cynder could have spread out on it with room to spare, and the golden dragons neck was lost to the expanding rolls of his side and rising hump of his back flab.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sh-inder!

Ever since we toushed it we've been getting bigger in wavesh.\" In fact, as Terridor and Cynder watched, a sound like an avalanch of pudding rumbled from the pair as their bodies began jiggling all the stronger. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cyril clenched his teeth and Volteer actually let out a small moan as the pair began to swell. New rolls and folds appearing before Cynder and Terridors eyes. The pair were ballooning like sacks of lard. Cynder even watched as Volteers bloated front claws slowly left the ground, his belly lifting him high enough that they no longer touched the floor and were consumed a little further by sagging leg fat.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The rumbling faded and the pairs expansion slowed but it didn't seem to fully stop. Cyril's nearly boulder sized cheeks deepened with a blush. \"It'sh embarrasshing really, but thesh 'shpurts' actually feel shtrangely pleashureable.

They were lucky that the temple was mostly empty this time of day, or Terrador had to do a lot of explaining to citizens and fellow guardians. When they finished, Terrador and Cynder head back inside to get Cyril.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it'sh about time,\" said he impatiently, his fat arms folded across his chest, which acted as a nice table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a little harder to move the ice guardian to the garden. His enormous, blubberly domes known as his ass was scraping the walls of temple and threatened to get stuck. It did get stuck, though at the entrance of the gardens, and Terrador and Cynder had to pull and push to get the Cyril free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all and all, they got them outside at least, and that was the most important thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We thank you,\" said Volteer, \"Now we have room to groooooow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as he said this exaggerated \"grow\", both he and Cyril's bodies began to balloon up with ominous gurgles and rumbles. There shadows lengthened in the afternoon sun and passed over Cynder and Terrador, who backed away in slight shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt that the Spell they've been talking about would fix these two,\" Cynder said. \"I'm going inside to look for the gem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrador nodded. \"Yes, if we find it we can reverse this situation,\" said he, \"Don't worry, I'll stay outside and watch the two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder searched the guardian's chamber high and low for the gem, but could not find it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the hell is it?\" Cynder asked herself, becoming frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she spotted a flash under a wardrobe on the other side of the room. She hurried towards it, bent down, reached under, and grabbed something. When she pulled it out she beheld the gem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must have rolled under here when they dropped it,\" she concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then left the room.</span></div></div>",

Apparently back when Ignitus was around he and Cyril took good care of it, making sure all the books were nearly organized by subject and age so it wasn't hard to find the newest (or oldest) tomes when need be. But ever since Ignitus had... left them, the ice guardian had been slacking in his duties. Spyro couldn't blame him too much but it was annoying that, in pulling down the first section of spell books, he'd accidentally grabbed two recipe books and another on the history of dragon grooming techniques.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And that was three shelfs ago. \"How am I supposed to find anything in this mess?\" he grumbled going back to another shelf and scanning what few books actually had titles on their binding.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Spyro was just about to reach for another one when he felt a strange bubbling sensation in his stomach. \"Oh no,\" he groaned, \"Please say it's just lunch disagreeing with me...\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0No such luck unfortunately. When he looked down he watched as his golden belly scales began to sag with new fatty deposits, his limbs began to thicken as well, one after the other and his tail drooped with new fat filling it from base to tip. He could even feel the strange sensation of fat moving up into his neck and face, rounding his features slightly and giving him a faint double chin.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The changes stopped there but Spyro could still feel faint gurgling coming from his stomach, as well as a growing hunger. It was as if the changes were simply settling for the moment but would build again sometime soon.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Spyro reached for another book, \"Running out of time. Need to find some answers soon before... before I get too big...\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For just a moment Spyro hesitated, the image of himself as big as one of the guardians flashed through his mind. A massive fat blob of a dragon too big to do anything but eat and grow. Cynder feeding him, others massaging his huge rolls...<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The image only lasted a moment but Spyro snapped back quick to find a stirring in his privates. \"What...? How...? Why...?\" he wondered.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He tried to shake it off. He pulled the book from the shelf, a newer one, and flipped it open. <i>Groan</i> yet another cook book. And yet, Spyro couldn't seem to put it down. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Page after page of delicious looking food was pictured, making his mouth water and his stomach grumble. By the time he got to deserts and the triple chocolate cake he couldn't take it anymore. Almost without thinking he lifted the book to his mouth and bit into it. His sharp teeth tor though the paper and binding with ease and in just a minute her worked the whole thing to a pulp and swallowed. It was only as the last bite traveled down his throat he'd realized what he'd done. He'd consumed a book like it was food. And yet... it felt good having something in his stomach now, even as it sagged a bit lower as a result.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A rumble came from his belly, and he felt his cheeks puff up before a belch escaped his maw, bits of paper flying out.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Spyro gave himself a hard slap on the cheek. Something was very wrong if he was eating books. He couldn't let that happen again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The large library door creaked open. \"Hello? Spyro are you in here?\" It was Volcanus, the new fire guardian. \"Cynder said you were in here and could use some help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What should Spyro do?</span></div></div>",

With a groan, Spyro knew that he had to eat something.

The purple dragon couldn't help but find his situation both humiliating and ironic, for he, the legendary purple dragon, the being that rid the lands of Malefor's oppression, who saved the world from destruction, was suddenly reduced to a seriously corpulent dragon due to the Gem's curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro waddled, huffing, his rolls rippling, surprised and alarmed by how his rapid weight gain had effected his stamina so negatively, into Volcanis' view. The older red dragon drew a sharp breath through his clenched teeth, staring at Spyro with wide eyes, as if he was inspecting a nasty injury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yikes, Terrador said you might be effected by the Gem's power too, but I didn't expect it would be this bad,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Spyro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was odd that his fattened figure didn't shock Volcanis as much as he expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw Cyril and Volteer outside,\" said Volcanis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How bad are they?\" Spyro asked, worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very bad,\" said Volcanis, \"They're practically blobs. That why I agreed with Terrador to come and help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro groaned inwardly. He had to find that spell fast! He was running out of time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" said Spyro, \"I need all the help I can. I'll start with this side well you do the other. We have to move fast before... O no... O no, no, no, no! It's happening again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple dragon was panicking, staring with wide eyes at his bloated middle, for his stomach was giving that dreaded gurgling noise again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the matter, Spyro?\" Volcanis asked, \"What do you mean that it's... O, now I see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro's figure was swelling outwards again. His limbs grew thicker, thick flaps of fat sagging over his joints. Spyro whimpered as he felt his face being swallowed up by his grapefruits-sized cheeks and his three sets of chins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly sagged even lower, pushing his legs apart, hanging mere inches off the ground. His butt and thighs plumped up, raising his tail even higher, which was beginning to look even thicker than an alligator's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-before *Huff* that!\" Spyro cried, ones again surprised and alarmed that now even breathing was becoming a difficult action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay, I'll get to work,\" said Volcanis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he didn't right away. He remained rooted to the spot for a several moments, watching Spyro turn and walk, with great effort, to his part of the library. For a second he was tempted to give those sagging domes that was Spyro's but a hard slap, to give his lovehandles a firm squeeze, to feed him and watch his form swell bigger and bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the moment passed, and Volcanis was left standing there, his heart racing, sweating a little, wondering why on earth he would think such a thing.

He kept stealing glancing at the morbidly obese purple dragons known as Spyro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way he waddle, his large butt cheeks sliding together, his fat body rippling with each step, and stopped to catch his breath every few minutes, his stamina seriously affected by his weight gain, was rather mesmerizing for the red dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy in the name of the Ancestors did he want to fondle those lovehandles, to hug that ample butt, to pinch those bloated cheeks? Why did he want to raid the temple's entire kitchen of food and feed it to Spyro while he rubbed his growing bell, watching his figure swell out with more fat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he tried to ponder what was wrong with him, Volcanis was absent-mindedly sneaking closer to Spyro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you don't have to *Huff* go through those books. I already checked *Huff* them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolcanis was broken out of his thoughts by the voice, and he looked down. Spyro was staring at him from between his grapefruits-sized cheeks (or were they? They looked bigger) and three (four?) chins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sorry,\" apologized Volcanis, \"I kinda forgot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay,\" said Spyro, \"Just remember to look on that side, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay,\" said Volcanis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they didn't go back to work. Instead, they stood there, staring at each other, an awkward silence descending on them, but then it was broken by a loud rumble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He, he, sorry, I'm rather hungry,\" said Spyro, blushing a little, \"It's getting hard to focus on a empty stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I get you something to eat?\" Volcanis heard himself saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not sure. We're kinda on a race against time, so I don't think..\" Spyro said, biting his lower lip, which both he and Volcanis noticed was thicker than previously, but his belly began to rumble again, this time much louder than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-on second though, perhaps I should get something to eat,\" he said, \"Perhaps a few roasted chickens, steak, and a loaf of bread.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly rumbled again, as if it was speaking for itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make it five loafs, heavily buttered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly rumbled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And also dessert, if they have some,\" Spyro finally finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Spyro,\" Volcanis said, beaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes later the red dragon was making his way back to the library, carrying six sacks filled heavily with food in his maw. He mad a half-hearted excuse to the curious moles in the kitchen why he needed so much food, saying that it was for a celebration for something. As expected, they weren't convinced, but they didn't question him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amount of food he had was far more than Spyro asked for, and the purple dragon pointed it out when he made it to the library and dropped it before, spilling their contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you said that you struggle to focus on a empty stomach,\" said Volcanis, \"And with your girth, no offense, I have no doubt that it would be ravenous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken,\" said Spyro with a sigh, \"Well, I guess I should eat as quickly as possible. I need to get back to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Volcanis could register what was going on, the corpulent purple dragon had already made his was way to a roasted chicken and devoured it with frightening speed, leaving nothing but a skeleton behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro belched loudly, sitting on his large haunches, reaching for a steak. With every bite that he took, Volcanis could have sworn that the purple dragon's figure was swelling out more and more. Spyro was vaguely aware of this too, but the delicious taste of the steak he was consuming, seasoned with his favorite spices, was too great to give up... Too heavenly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple dragon was so occupied in consuming his food that he failed to realize that he was now lying on his back, his massive stomach jutting in the air several feet high, and growing bigger. He was also no longer eating but being fed by no other than Volcanis, who dropped strips of bacon into his awaiting maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared at Spyro almost lovingly, rubbing his growing belly. The purple dragon didn't register this, or if he did he didn't care. All he wanted was to be fed and pampered. He was growing sleepy, his eyelids drooping. Should he go to sleep? Yes, a nap won't hurt anybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the darkness engulf him, the purple dragon heard a voice say, \"Sweet dreams, fatboy,\" before he finally fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

He attempted to turn his head but large cheeks and chins held it more or less in place. Lifting his legs likewise proved to have little effect as the heavy limbs barely wiggled in place. Volcanis smiled and moved aside so Spyro could look at his reflection in the old polished metal that had once been a mirror in the bath house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The mass Spyro saw was only a dragon in the loosest sense of the tem. His whole body was nearly as large as Volcanis but layers with roll after roll of fat. His legs were fat cones with a couple rolls of tapering sizes that sank to almost cover his claws. His golden scaled belly lifted him high up off the floor and even the bands of scales seemed distorted by the stretched hide under them. His wings wobbled fruitlessly amidst a back covered with more hills of flab and he couldn't even see his tail beyond them. His butt cheeks however were wide enough they at least protruded on either side where they wobbled and jiggled with his every breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Spyro gulped nervously. \"Volcanith,\" he huffed seeing his lower lip, the size of a loaf of bread wobble as he spoke, \"I need... help... the guardianth... need help...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"All in good time Spyro,\" the red dragon smiled as he caressed Spyro's sides gently, \"You know, it's weird.

I know how weird it sounds, but it's true. but, as they say, we all grow up. I put it aside, learned to accept what was expected.

He had to find a way to stop this. he had to get back to the library. he had to help Cyril and Volteer. he had to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The fist custard creme pie met his mouth and all other thoughts besides enjoying the delicious food began to melt away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Volcanis brought several desserts out balanced on his wings and laid them out, feeding one after another into Spyro's gaping maw. Sometimes the purple dragon blob tried to resist, but for the most part he took everything willingly as Volcanis fed him one treat after another. It was amazing, even if Spyro had been growing before now Volcanis could almost see it. Little by little the massive blob swelled and gurgled, limbs becoming more useless as they started to sink out of sight. Rolls of flab swelling and sloshing in all directions, the massive dragon growing gradually bigger and bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was becomig hard though to keep bringing the food to Spyro though. Try as he might to move quickly it seemed he was constantly getting up to bring more food to Spyro. And while he enjoyed it, he would have prefferd to sit and watch. Fortunately he had an answer. A simple spell. Everything in the room designated 'food' was to be levitated one after the other and Brought to Spyros mouth to feed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Amazingly it worked as the first platters of fried turkey sandwiches floated to Spyro's mouth on a cushion of magic and were dumped down his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was getting hard for Volcanis to resist though. he just had to get closer and enjoy the events unfolding...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice One: Volcenis gives in to temptation and begin caressing, licking, and even humping Spyro's huge form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice Two: Volcanis begins sampling some of the food himself and, somehow, begins putting on a few pounds as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice Three: By accident Spyro gets part of Volcanis in his mouth and, amazingly, swallows the red dragon whole.

So deep was he in his Hedonistic state that he only cared about eating, completely unaware that Volcanis was groping, slapping, and licking his rear, enjoying every inch of his globes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire dragon sat up, pushing his erect, red member between the huge, scaly mounds, and he began to thrust his hips, hotdogging Spyro's butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This feels so amazing!\" he whispered, growling in pleasure, as a strand of seed shot out from his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking his lips, feeling still as pent-up as ever ten spite his climax, Volcanis had an idea. Spyro was alarmed when the flow of food stopped, looking around frantically, searching for an answer, but finding none for his beach ball sized cheeks obscured his view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what isth...going...on?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not, panic, young one,\" said Volcanis, suddenly appearing, \"I just wanted to give you a treat for being such a good blob of a dragon for eating all your food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flew closer, landed on chest, gripped his cheeks, and trusted his hips forward, pressing a chocolate coated rod against Spyro's snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...isth...it?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, It's just a lollipop,\" lied Volcanis, \"Go ahead, sick it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Spyro was level-headed, he would have realized that it was actually the fire dragon's cock that was just dipped in chocolate sauce, but his need for more food was all that he cared about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to lick it, causing Volcanis to shudder in pleasure, before taking it into his mouth and began to suck on it. The fire dragon gripped Spyro's head and thrust his hips, pushing his member deeper and deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice one: Spyro continued to give Volcanis a blow job until he cums. But afterwards, the fire dragon's penis began to leak a strange purple substance that taste a lot like food, his balls swelling larger and larger with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice two: Unaware, Volcanis was actually being slowly swallowed whole by Spyro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice Three: Though Volcanis is not eating the food he prepared for Spyro, somehow he's beginning to fatten up As well, the more Spyro licks and sucks on his member.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Don't touch it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, Crystal, stop being such a wimp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white dragoness bit her lower lip, watching nervously as the pink dragoness pressed her paw against the soft, blue flesh, the half of her front leg swallowed up by the enormous belly of the Ice Guardian known as Cyril, his bulk towering over them like a large hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a strange, loud bloop noise, like a small water tank releasing a air bubble as whatever contents inside were disturbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, nothing,\" said Ember, giving her friend a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't like this,\" said Crystal, looking around warily, \"What if someone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what are you doing here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder waddled into view from behind Cyril.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not suppose to be here,\" she continued sternly, \"You heard Terrador, the temple's gardens are off limits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber shrugged. \"Alright then,\" she sneered, \"I guess this is a all out fatass meeting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling, she walked away, saying, \"Come on, Crystal. You heard her, not skinny dragons allowed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white dragoness didn't giggle along with Ember, but she cast Cynder a worried look before she left. The black dragoness clenched her teeth in annoyance. For a moment she wanted to tackle the arrogant pink dragoness down, to pin her under her weight, to show her that she's still capable of serious damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that moment passed and Cynder sighed. There was no use in denying it. Ember was right; she was turning into a fatass. The Gem's power had plumped her up over the past hour. Her ones sleek, elegant form is now covered in a thick layer of fat, her belly curving and reaching to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel her choker and bracelets digging into her skin painfully, for her limbs had thickened greatly. But from all the fat features on her body, they were nothing compared to her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was embarrassing, really, that most of the weight went to her haunches, but it was to be expected, for she was a dragoness. Her two sagging globes were nearly the size of beach balls, and on top of these were her tail that was as thick as a crocadile's, the bracelet on her tail squeezing around it like an over-inflated blood cuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder knew that it was only a matter of time before it, with the rest of her jewelry, would snap off violently. Her belly began to rumble. The noise was surprisingly loud, her whole frame rippling. Cynder groaned, clutching her thick middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunger had been growing worse and worse. She felt like she could eat the whole temple's stock clean. But Cynder had to remain strong. She had to remain here and watch over Cyril and Volteer, who had grown larger and fatter over the last hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrador was currently in a meeting with the remaining Guardians, discussing what to do with the two blob-dragons. Spyro still hadn't arrived with a spell to cure his two mentors, and Cynder was worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, Spyro, where are you?\" she thought to herself, staring up at the darkening sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly gurgled and her form swelled out with as a few extra pounds was added to her weight.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Upon waking up from his food coma induced nap, the purple dragon noticed two things right away. The first being that having let his stomach digest, his form was noticeably softer. His body was much more sunken-into his flab, limbs nothing but little forearms and paws sticking out. His belly glorped and groaned nonstop as his body sloshed around, filled up with fattening magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second thing he noticed, was that his mouth was clamped shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore specifically, his muzzle was being locked into place by a leather strap, lips pressed tightly around a rubber hose. Following it down to the floor, it was hooked up to some strange contraption. There at the control panel rested Volcanis, fiddling around with some settings as he eyed the dragon awake. \"Had a good nap, Spyro?\" he said with a sing-song tone to his voice. Spyro only let out a fearful 'Mmmph!' in response, brimming with questions and unable to voice them. \"Don't worry, I don't mean any harm...\" Volcanis replied happily, slowly making his way over to the dragon before belly-flopping right into his golden stomach. He sunk in a good ways, meeting face to face. \"It's just that with a tummy as big as yours, it's gonna need a lot of food to keep you sated. So I decided to go with a more effective way at doing that\" he chuckled, rubbing the dragon's gut. \"You'll like that, won't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro knew he should convince him not to do this, grunt and whine to get him to stop. Have him try and search for the spell to help slim him and the others down so they could put this whole thing behind them. Yet... he didn't want to.... It wasn't the gem giving off a secondary effect to brainwash him into this either, it was pure love from himself. He truly loved being such a colossal fatass, being fed and pampered by Volcanis all hours of the day as his bulk was complimented by him. He eventually gave out a \"Mmmph~\" of approval, blushing lightly as his belly was rubbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I thought, a small after-nap meal will fix you right up~\" Volcanis purred, giving his belly a tight squeeze. Wedging himself out of Spyro's fat rolls, he made his way back to the machine, adjusting a few dials and pulling down a lever. The contraption whirred, gears turning as the machine roared to life. It wasn't long before a thick, heavy substance began to rush through the hose, right up to Spyro's mouth. As soon as it hit his tongue, he immediately recognized the sweet, gooey taste of chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro murred, wagging that fat tail happily as he guzzled down the sweet substance. Volcanis was back at his belly, rubbing and kneading his rolls like dough as his growth started up once again. His body spread more and more across the ground, the room growing smaller as he swelled and grew. Volcanis reached up with his claws, smushing Spyro's beachball-sized cheeks together as they blushed pink. \"Just think Spyro...\" Volcanis whispered, rubbing those purple balls of flab around. \"...Endless food, Endless growth, Endless love... I'll feed you as much as you want, make you the whale you and I both want to be. You want that, right?\" he asked. Spyro only responded with a muffled moan, wanting nothing more than to be fed and pampered all hours of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good dragon~\" Volcanis smiled, the machine running dry just as Spyro had doubled again in size. \"C'mon, let's get you outside with the others so we can have you really grow...\"</span></div></div>",

She guessed that they were the baby dragons that resided in the temple, who were given to the Guardians to hatch and raise. The most likely saw the massively fat dragons outside and thought that it would be interesting things to play with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey only giggled at Cynder's slow attempt to catch them, easily skirting out of her reach. She wanted to roar in anger. It was both humiliating and frustrating to be laughed at and how the hatchlings were treating this like it was all some stupid game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you guys doing out if bed so late? Go inside now! Get down from there!\" Cynder shouted at them, but the hatchlings ignored her completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder groaned, feeling hopeless. O, how she wished Terrador was here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard her, go to bed this instant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe booming baritone voice both startled Cynder and lifted her spirits. Turning, with some effort, around, she saw the large Earth Guardian arriving on the scene, placing two sacks on the ground and looking sternly at the small dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hatchlings squealed and immediately stop playing, running back inside the temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" said Cynder gratefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" said Terrador, reaching into the first sack, \"These hatchlings can be rowdy and very disobedient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled out a glass orb the size of a basketball, tapped it a few times, causing it to flare up and illuminate the garden in a bright yellow glow, and let go of it. It floated up into the air by some unseen force, most likely magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled out more and one by one he did it with the rest, and the dark garden grew brighter and brighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he did this, he spoke, \"I brought some food for you, if you are hungry. It's in the second sack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder was starving. She had been suppressing the urge to run off to the kitchen to grab a bite to eat for hours, and her hunger was so bad that it was excruciatingly painful. It was through sheer willpower alone that she didn't go mad with hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder didn't hesitate and dove right for the second sack and found that it was filled with all kinds of neat and pastries. She began to eat at a very quick pace, slowly climbing into the sack. But as she ate, he form began to expand, tearing and finally ripping the sack apart as nearly a hundred more pounds was added to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Buuuurrrrrrp!*\" Cynder belched, spittle flying. \"Dam, that was good,\" she added, licking her lips and cheeks clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she saw Terrador's shocked face, she grinned sheepishly, a faint pink appearing on her grapefruits-sized cheeks. \"Sorry,\" she apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking the scene out of his head, Terrador said, \"I'm sorry to tell you this but I'm not going to stay here long. I just came here to provide you with some light.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Whoa...\" Cynder asked, getting to her feet, wobbling, her new weight threatening to throw her off balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If searching for a way to fix this wasn't hard enough, I have to lead a search party to go look for Spyro and Volcanis,\" Terrador said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Cynder exclaimed, \"Spyro's missing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately,\" Terrador said gravely, \"But before I leave, I need the Gem. Some of the other Guardians might have a way to fix this and need the Gem to experiment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" said Cynder, \"I'll go get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro being missing came as a shock to Cynder, enhancing her worries even further. She hoped nothing bad had happened to them. Waddling around Volteer, Cynder arrived at the place where she had last placed the Gem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut was it still there?</span></div></div>",

She had no idea on what powers the gem had, and was blind to see it's power starting to work on her own form. With every step Ember took, the weight on her haunches increased ever so slightly. The gem was slowly pouring energy into her body, bloating her outwards at an unnoticeable rate. Her cream colored belly gained a slight jiggle to it, buttcheeks swaying with her movements. And yet Ember was too busy fantasizing about Spyro to see herself slowly transforming into what she had teased Cynder about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spyrooo, are you in here?\" the dragoness asked with a sing-song tone to her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was left with no response, the temple dining hall vacant aside from herself. That's when she noticed the fridge that resided was open. Inside lay a good helping of desert items. Doughnuts, pastries, cake, and other things filled the storage unit. Ember made her way over to the food, licking her lips ever so slightly as she eyed the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't propose to Spyro on an empty stomach, now can I?\" she said to herself with a grin. And with that, she grabbed a cupcake from the fridge, tossing it into her maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, she would be sated there, a lone cupcake more than enough for a snack. But the gem's magic was working on her appetite, keeping her hungry. She reached for another cupcake without a care. Then another, and another, and another! Pretty soon, she straight up shoved her muzzle into the fridge, eagerly chowing down on whatever was closest to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhhh... so good...\" Ember purred to herself, biting down on a doughnut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all those calories being poured into her, it wasn't long until she began to get some serious weight on her body. She was quite the chub now, sagging belly and globular buttcheeks jiggling with every little movement. And yet she continued to gorge, moans coming out of her in bliss as she ate. On and on she swelled, pumped up by both the gem and her newfound bottomless appetite, until she was left without anything else in the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh my... *burp!* That was the b-*urp!* best meal I've ever- *UUUURP!!*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness stumbled backwards from the force of her belch, landing flat on her swollen rump and sending her body into a jiggling fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wha? Why am I so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer question was answered mid sentence as she looked over at a nearby mirror, and shrieked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't believe I've seen where he went, though most likely somewhere to find a cure for... this\" the red fire dragon Ignitus told Terrador, pointing to the blue blob next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's hope he get's back here soon...\" Cynder added in \"There's no telling how out of control this is going to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words were cut short when she heard a feminine scream, looking over and seeing Ember charging at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CYNDER!\" her voice boomed out, the dragoness seeing how big the gem had left her. She was already as big as she was! \"WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY BODY!?\" she yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't do anything! It's that blasted gem that's fattening us up!\" she responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what can we do to fix it!?\" she asked, tossing the purple crystal on the ground to get it away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing yet, we're going to have to wait until Spyro finds a counter spell for this. So for the time being we're stuck this way\" she said with a tiny grin, seeing Ember as big as the dragon she was teasing. \"Karma's a bitch, ain't it?\" she chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up...\" she groaned, laying down next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll only be a matter of time Ember, we'll get you back to normal\" Ignitus reassured her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, now we should just remain here and hope nothing else happens...\" Terrador added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the gem had other plans for them. In fact, just as he finished his statement, the gem began to glow. And glow it did, going from purple to bright pink as it glowed stronger than ever in the presence of so many dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Ulp!* Ancestors help us...\" Terrador whimpered...</span></div></div>",

With only moderate understanding of the gems powers escape seemed the only option. And yet every dragon who could move was rooted to the spot in a mixture of curiosity and concern as the gem glowed brightly, shining a cone shaped shaft of light that rose higher than the roof of the temple. Everyone braced for what was to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What they got was an apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cynder blinked in confusion and Ember cocked her head. A singular red apple floated in the beam , bright and shiny with a tiny stem and a singular leaf. It simply bobbed there for a few moment looking innocent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh my,\" Ignitus looked deeply concerned, \"I really hope this doesn't mean what i think it means.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why? What is it?\" Cynder asked and then blinked, suddenly there were two apples in the beam of light, both identical, What's more it seemed every time she plinked another appeared until there were six total. And then each began to hover towards the dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't eat them,\" Ignitus muttered even as one drifted towards his own muzzle and he found himself unable to turn away, \"Whatever happens don't eat them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why?\" Emeber asked, \"Are they poisoned? Enchanted to put us to sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"They're perfect,\" Ignitus replied receiving stares from everyone, \"Don't you see? No blemishes, no bruises, even the stem and leave are pristine. they look like something made by a sculptor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So?\" Cynder asked looking warily at her apple as it drifted closer, \"What's wrong with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's the 'perfect' version of this food. Imagine eating the best meal you ever had and then someone makes you the same thing but far more sloppily. Would you ever want to eat their food again? Now times that by infinity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cynder's eyes went wide as the apples had nearly reached their faces, Terridor and Ignitions tried to lean away finding their feet rooted to the spot. Cynder likewise tried to struggle but couldn't move. Two more apples floated up and over the masses that were Cyril and Volteer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm still not sure I get it,\" Ember asked, \"How is that a ba-\" She was cut off as the apple closed the last few inches to her muzzle and she bit into it. The juice that flooded her mouth was sweetness incarnate, the pulp pure and clean, the sin crisp with just the tiniest tang that emphasized the rest of the sugar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ember had only taken a bit but her eyes unfocused as the pleasure washed through her as she moaned loudly. Her nethers grew moist. Impossible as it seemed, this apple was better than sex. She couldn't resist and opened her mouth for another bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ember! Don't-!\" Cynder was also cut off as her apple found it's way into her mouth and her loins clenched with impossible heat and pleasure. Try as the guardians might each also succumbed as their members raged harder than diamonds in seconds at the pleasure of eating perfect foods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ignitus coughed as the last of the apple slid down his throat, \"Blast it! This is bad,\" he grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That was the best apple every,\" Ember moaned, still soaking in pleasure, \"How was that bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Now any apple you eat besides the ones this gem creates might as well be trash. Like eating dirt. Once you've had perfection nothing else can even come close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And it's not done yet,\" Terridor muttered as the apples reappeared in the beam, six of them, but also with them were six bananas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh sweet Ancestors,\" Ignitus muttered, \"This is very bad. I don't think this thing plans on stopping anytime soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Time passed...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Within an hour the light from the gem was creating almost a dozen food items for each of them. It had started simple with fruits but soon more complex items formed like apple pie and chocolate chip banana bread. ANd every round some new dish was added while all the others were fed down every dragons throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And all of them were perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Perfect flavors, perfect textures, everything. It was so much now that all the dragons were in a constant state of pleasure. Ember had creamed herself twice during the last round of feeding alone and Cynder once in the round before that. The guardians held on better, but both Ignitus and Terrador found the ground under their distending bellies splashed with their white seed as pleasure flooded their minds on a level none of them were trained to handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So far more than twenty different items of food had been created, enough that the dragons swallowed one every three seconds as the cycle seemed to repete once a minute. However it was getting to the point where they'd barely gulped one down and another rushed in to take it's place. If this kept up soon the food would become an endless stream and there was no telling how large the dragons would swell then.</span></div></div>",

They didn't seem to care about the weight though, in fact, they embraced it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ghmmph... *urp!* m-more...\" Terrador moaned out. \"M-make me bigger... fatter... n-never stop feeding me, o powerful gem...\" he added, his member shooting a hot sticky load onto Ignitus' belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gem conjured up more and more fattening types of foods for the dragons, milkshakes and full-sized wedding cakes being greedily devoured by the group. The dragons quickly made Cyril and Volteer's growth spurts look tiny, fwoomping up with lard as they ate. Chins piled onto their bodies as they swelled, limbs thickening as they moaned uncontrollably as they ate and grew. Ignitus and Terrador's blobs of stomachs sloshed and wobbled on their members, further pleasuring them as Cynder and Ember's guts tightly smooshed into theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA now-constant stream of foods were flowing into them, fattening the dragons like mad. Their limbs were quickly sinking into their stomachs as they ballooned outwards, quickly approaching the size of Cyril and Volteer. Despite not being fed by the mysterious gem, they too showed lust as multiple fat dragon bodies crashed and wobbled on them. Their fat shafts peeked from under their rolls, pulsing and throbbing as they too joined in the chorus of moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"V-Volteer...\" mumbled Cyril in bliss, cheeks blushing red hot as he moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cyril...\" he responded back, body sloshing around as he was bumped into<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more food, more pleasure, and more softness piled onto the dragons, their lust showed more and more. They were now constantly leaking pre, a larger glob shooting out every time they were fed another piece of food. They whined, panted, and wobbled as they grew, heads resting deep in their neckrolls and cheeks as they ate. Their pleasure grew higher and higher with every pound added onto them, until their bodies were unable to hold all that bottled up lust. A band of draconic roars broke out as the blobs let loose, cumming uncontrollably as they wailed out in bliss. They blew their loads all around the area and on each other, orgasm lasting for a good long while until they came down from their climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gem had stopped feeding them for the time being, but not before it had completely left the group helpless. They had all grown to the size of the Yellow and Blue blobs, the dragons covered in crumbs, frosting, and semen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haaah... Spyro...\" Cynder panted in need and desperation. Despite just cumming, she was still in heat. \"P... Please Spyro... I need you...\" she whimpered to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Spyro needs of you, Cynder.\" a voice called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking from her cavernous chins, her eyes opened wide as she saw Volcanis approaching her. Alongside him floating in the air by his magic was Spyro, fattened up to the size of her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I brought him out to give him some more room to grow, but I hadn't expected to find you all aught up to size~\" he chuckled, resting Spryo's blubbery body next to Cynder's. He instantly dove his lips into hers, the two moaning in bliss as they snuggled with each other. \"Oh S-Spyro... You look so big and beautiful...\" she said inbetween smooches, cumming a bit as they sloshed and wobbled in burning love and passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheheh... for such a small gem, you sure hold a lot of magic in you\" Volcanis chuckled, picking up the purple gem. His grin grew wider as he saw it begin to flash and pulse again...</span></div></div>",

The dragonesses accepted and offered to be his feeder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother scene was in the temple's garden, where a shy orange dragon was talking to beautiful green dragon, which he had a crush on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they spoke, the green dragoness began to gain weight rapidly, so fast that she was reduced to a immobile blob within three minutes, crushing the stone seat underneath her huge flanks and sending the orange dragon falling to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe struggled to get up, for his beach ball-sized belly was in the way, but managed, after a few moments, to get to his feet.

Instead of packing on the pounds randomly, his weight gain was more \"normal\" and indirect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmerging from his office where he served as the Headmaster of the Warfang acadamy, the Fire Guardian marched towards the temple's mess hall to grab something to eat, for he felt a little peckish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was in a good mood, humming a song to himself. When he arrived at his destination, he ordered three pies, a few large steaks, some beer to wash it down, and a big slice of cake for dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sitting himself down, he began to eat. As he enjoyed his meal, unaware that eat bite was directly being changed into fat by his body, expanding his figure, someone came barging into the mess hall, calling his name urgently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: it was Volcanis, Ignitus' apprentice, who want to show his mentor something. But little did the Fire Guardian know, as he accepted to follow Volcanis, that the younger dragon was planning to fatten him up to immobility, like he did with Spyro, adding him to what he called his \"Fatty collection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: It was Hunter, who had seen Cyril, Volteer, and Cynder outside. He's desperately seeking Ignitus' aid, waddling towards the him, his large furry belly leading the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: It was a dark green dragoness named Flora who Ignitus has been interested in for years looking ven more appealing now with a few subtil extra pounds on her frame. </span></div></div>",

I can wait here with you to finish your lunch and then we will go.\" Volcanis says with a eager and seemingly friendly smile.

The meal in fact was far larger than any adult dragon would usually have. For some reason Ignitus had been feeling extra hungry all morning and procured the extensive meal of several steaks, a bowl of mashed potatoes and what looked to be a bucket of gravy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big dragon worked quickly but was methodical so as to both not appear a greedy hog and not waste a crumb of the meal. Something Volcanis was grateful for as he watched every swallow add a few more pounds to the red dragons figure. It seemed like every gulp sent a rolling wave down Ignitus' neck that spread across his body as it hit his torso, rolling up his wings and down his limbs as they gained the slightest additional thickness. Of course it was his rear end and thighs that got to most of it. By the time he'd nearly finished his meal both of Ignitus butt cheeks were each bigger than all of Volcanis' body and shook like mountains of jello as the red dragon shifted about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of him had not been spared either, though he'd not grown as much. His neck was wide enough to cover his shoulders at the base and at least six large chins flowed down the front of it leading down to a broad chest that sagged nearly to his flab concealed knees. His belly almost brushed the ground as he turned but there was just enough space for him to still manuver, even as fat threatened to sag down and cover his clawed feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon the wait,\" Ignitus muttered, his voice sounding about an octave deeper from the fat pulling on his vocal cords, \"I am curious to see what it is you have to show me my deer pupil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a single beat Volcanis almost forgot his plan, but quickly smiled and nodded eagerly. \"Oh yes Master Ignitus. I'm sure you'll be quite pleased. Though I hope you don't mind a bit of a walk. It's on the other side of the temple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus smiled and said it would be no problem, but inside he let out a soft groan at the distance as they set off. However almost immediately they ran into a problem as the bigger red dragon failed to pass through the doors so easily. Though it was only for a few moments Ignitus remained confused briefly how his hips could get stuck in the doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would have questioned it further but Volcanis caught his attention a moment later suggestion they should go by the cafiteria. \"I haven't had Lunch yet,\" he smiled warmly, \"I'm sure we can pick up a couple snacks there.\" Despite his large meal Initus big belly growled in agreement and once more they set off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately the halls were very wide, enough for three dragon elders to walk side by side. And a good thing too as Volcanis slowed his pace slightly to walk behind and to the side of Ignitus who's fatty undulating rump was beyond hypnotic. Every swish and bounce as the twin mountains moved and jiggled was beautiful to him. And, as impossible as it seemed, as they walked the mass of fat that was the elder dragon seemed to be getting larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was small at first, a new soft scraping sound that gradually gre longer and louder, but soon Volcanis realized it was Ignitus' belly scales rubbing against the ground. And further his titanic rear was drooping lower to cover those massive hips and begin brushing the ground as well. They'd just touched down when the pair made it to the cafitera. A walk that would have taken five minuted but took almost three times as long thanks to the headmasters size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they neared though Ignitus caught sight of several young dragons existing the cafiteria, all of them looking quite round, some barely able to walk. \"My my,\" he muttered shaking his head, \"What are they serving the hatchlings these days? We should discuss the lunch program at the next meeting.\" It was hard for Volcanis not to grin, given the massive dragon beside him so he just nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering the cafiteria though both of them received quite a surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: It's Ember, she's become quite the blob of a young dragoness and is getting other dragons to feed her in exchange for cuddling her massive frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: The hall is packed with young dragons. A great many too fat to move and yet still determined to keep eating via whatever method they can manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: As they enter Spyro <i>somehow</i> bursts through the doors on the opposite side of the room. His enormous form rolling into the cafeteria desperate for more food.</span></div></div>",

Volcanis, too, was gawking but with a twinkle in his eyes at the spectacle before him.  Ignitus would have thought it strange if he saw that twinkle but he didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the duo, the cafeteria was littered with small scaly blobs that were munching, burping or snoring loudly after a huge feast.  There were even young dragon that became so fat that they depend on others help to get food to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is quite disconcerting.\", Ignitus said. \"I must really look into this obesity epidemic before it escalates any further.\" At that moment, Ignitus's belly growled loudly, which cause the immense flabby paunch to jiggle.  \"Right after we get a snack of course.\" With that, Ignitus sluggishly trotted off to the serving area to feed his growing appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolcanis eyes glazed a bit as he watches the immense bottom heavy elder dragon go.  He was mesmerized at how Ignitus's red orange scaled flabby folds wobbled and bounce about, but what he was most focus on was the fatty elder fire dragon's ass.  He watches, enchanted, as those immense booty oscillating with titanic ripples.  He amazed at how they heavily bounce up and down in rhythm.  He committed the sight of it all to memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Volcanis?\", ask Ignitus, looking back at his startled apprentice in puzzlement, wondering why was he standing there and what is with the look.  \"Aren't you coming to eat with me? Thought you were hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolcanis shook his head, trying to get his head back together. <i>'Come on, get your head in the game. '</i> , Volcanis thought and then said, \"Sorry, got lost in thought there.  Now let us look at what the cafeteria serving today Master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus grinned and looked back to the serving to see what meal is being offered today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolcanis sighed and look around at the small fatty dragons eating and laying about in displeasure.  As much as he want to add these little ones to his Fatty Collection right now, but he had bigger fishes to catch first.

She wore a pair of round spectacles and her sharp noise was tilted up in the air in a haughty fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was the school's librarian, a female that was not much liked. Her professional and bitter attitude made her unpopular with the faculty, and her strict rules and guidelines in her library was despised by the students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to Ignitus she was the most beautiful creature he had seen on four legs, the perfect blend of elegance and gracefulness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, as he watched her walk by, Ignitus noticed something different about her today. Flora was always a a skinny dragoness, but now she seemed...thick?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ones slender legs and neck had filled out, but the most noticeable feature about her was her rump and hips, which had a slight jiggle to it every time she took a step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt served to fascinate Ignitus even more, causing him to forget about his shyness around her, jump off his seat, and approach her, calling her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hello, Flora,\" he greeted, \"Lovely afternoon, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reaction that followed was a little unexpected. The dark green dragoness let out a small gasp a whirled around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Headmaster Ignitus!\" Flora blurted out, sounding not quite like her professional self, but she quickly composed herself and continued, \"Why, yes, it is a good afternoon, not a dark cloud in sight. I just came down here to buy some lunch for me. I'm afraid I accidently left my box of food at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, no need for that,\" said Ignitus, snatching the opportunity to do something nice for her and strengthen their relationship, \"I'll buy you lunch on my own expense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, please don't, there's no need for that,\" said Flora quickly, ones again sounding a little out of character, \"You don't have to waste you coin on me.

There was a reason why she didn't want Ignitus buying her food, and it wasn't because she was being polite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark dragoness was very concerned about her figure.

Spyro and Cynder locked eye contact as Sypro reach her height. \"Help,\" Spyro yelled as he surpassed her in height and all she could see was his gut. \"Terrador, anyone, please help,\" Cynder yelled to the sky. </span></div></div>",

Cold fear washed over Terrador as he felt the Gem plop into his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was dead silence. The nearly immobile Cynder and the blue and yellow blobs that were Volteer and Cyril stared with horror at Terrador. The green dragon's heart was racing in his chest, feeling a tingling sensation spread throughout his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clutched his middle as it began to rumble. \"O, Ancestors help me,\" he murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gut suddenly surged forward, causing him to grunt in surprise, his ones toned middle transforming into a scaly ball of fat in seconds. Terrador gingerly groped at his belly, feeling how soft it was, how it gurgled and quivered as it swelled at a steady pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrador gave a yelp when he felt his butt cheeks instantly inflate with a\"bwoomp\" noise, his tail growing wider and drooping towards the ground as extra weight filled it. The muscles that were visible on his legs disappeared, sinking into his thickening limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green dragon felt the odd sensation of fat moving towards his head, his neck thickening, sets of chins developing, and his face grew rounder and his cheeks swelled larger and larger, obscuring his view. Terrador continued to grow and grow, soon immobilized and looming over Cyril and Volteer, his girth pushing and rolling the two balls of fat away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll while this happened, Terrador moaned, a red tint appearing on his melon-sized cheeks. The cold fear he experienced earlier was replaced with a warm and slightly ticklish feeling. Volteer was right; it did feel good to expand like this, and it wasn't stopping either. In fact, the weight gain seemed to accelerate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tho gooth,\" he whispered, his speech effected by a serious lisp due to his lower lip and bloated cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Cynder stared with wide eyes at the growing green Guardian with both dread and awe. His girth was advancing at a startling rate and, Cynder guessed, it wouldn't be long before he outgrew the gardens, perhaps even the whole summit that the temple was built on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to back away, but her ass was firmly stuck between the two pillars.

As Cynder stared in horror at her swelling body, she almost lost her balance when a strange weight pulled at her pelvis. Looking back, the dragoness saw that her rear was swelling at a massive pace. Cynder's limbs began to bloat up, and her face lost some of its sharp features as new fat moved to her neck, causing it to become more round in shape. And, to put the cherry on top, her lower lip began to swell as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her weight gain stopped, Cynder was no longer a thin dragoness, but a chubby female who looked like she never lost any of her hatchling pudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O dear,\" said Cyril as he saw the newly enlarged Cynder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ith would stheem that the effectsth of the Gem hath taken itsth toll on you asth well, Shinder,\" Said Volteer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got to find a way to reverse this?\" Cynder exclaimed, looking with pleading eyes towards Terrador, the fat on her frame jiggling as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm yourself,\" said the earth guardian, \"We'll find a way to fix this, don't you worry.\"</span></div></div>",

She hustled out the door promising to be back soon. In spite of all his concerns, Terridor couldn't help watching her waddle off and watching her rear end jiggle with every step.<i>If only she were older,</i> he thought quietly to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Snapping out of it the big green guardian returned to the pair of blobs, who somehow looked even bigger than they had just a minute ago.The first question came as to how to get them out of there. Both were certainly too big to go through the door side by side. Even one at a time was iffy. Still, short of demolishing a wall Terridor didn't see how else he could manage it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One at a time seemed to be the only way, so Terridor stepped over to Volteer, the smaller of the two, in the hopes of getting one of them out before having to do any impromptu demolition. However, he'd barely placed a clawed hand on the yellow dragon before a strange feeling ran down his body. His whole form tingled and itched, before seemingly throbbing with a  strange heat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The green elder didn't even get a moment to question it as he felt the sensation spread up and down his body. He could feel his scales stretch as they adjusted to fit new layers of adipose that expanded under his skin. His toned and firm muscles quickly vanished under ruving lumps of lard. His rear end swelled and his belly sagged. He even brought one clawed hand up to his face to feel it as his cheeks thickened. Then pulled back to watch as the waves of fat crept down his leg to bloat his clawed digits like plumping sausages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Perhaps the weirdest part about all of it though was, despite his concern for his changing figure, Terridor couldn't stop the rising arousal in his loins as his dragonhood grew stiff to press against the underside of his distending belly. He knew his large companions had said it could feel good, but he didn't expect it to be <i>this</i> stimulating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0By the time the spurt had passed Terridor was left shuffling at a size almost twice his former dimensions, feeling his belly sway almost to his knees and his rear end wobble with every bounce.His task was nearly forgotten until his attention was caught by something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Terridor sees the gem lying nearby and goes to investigate, causing some additional magical effect to be set off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: A low rumble from the pair of blobs warns him of their next growth spurt, and if he doesn't back away he might get trapped under Volteers expansion. ...Though that might feel nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: A cough from the doorway signals the arrival of another elder (Ignitus, Aqua, Volcanis, etc) curious as to what's going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Something else odd happens.</span></div></div>",

His torso was swollen to twice it's former size and deep wrinkles had formed around his shoulders and haunches where bloated limbs struggled to move against his wider features. His tail nearly stuck out straight though it forcefully bent as it pressed against the wall. He wiggled his bloated claws experimentally, the toes looking decidedly puffy and the claw tips strangely blunted. Even his neck was shorter and thicker, his face rounder and fuller, each cheek bloated like he had a large fruit inside.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But if he was swollen then Volteer was round. The golden dragon couldn't even bend his limbs and instead all four stuck out to the sides of his torso, bloated and cone shaped as he rocked back and forth on his spherical body. He wiggled and tried to press them down to the ground but they just bounced out again as he grumbled in frustration through his thicker features. Also while Cyrils wings seemed only a bit thicker, Volteers were bloated out to rest along his sides like inflated pontoon rafts.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Both of them had a strange shine to their scales as well, not the usual gleam but smoother and more rubber in nature.

It was one of those fancy-looking Victorian models, with fresh candles inserted in their places, but it had a dangerously sharp spike in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering what Cyril said about such objects, Spyro went to action, spreading his wings and flying as quick as possible towards Volteer. When the electric guardian was mere inches away from a violent death, Spyro grabbed his bloated tail, careful not to poke his claws into Volteer's delicate skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a hard tug, the purple dragon pulled the balloon-dragon towards the ground, his body squeaking loudly. It was surprisingly hard, even though he was mainly filled with gas, and Spyro batted his wings furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he was luckily able to get Volteer to the ground. Once there, Spyro took a piece of small rope, which was laying on a nearby shelf, and tied the yellow dragon to a heavy table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there Volteer floated a few feet above the ground, his body inflating more and more every time he hiccuped until his body was spherical in shape, his head and limbs pushing further into his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done, Spyro,\" Cyril said, hopping towards Spyro. He grabbed a nearby table to steady himself. \"You saved Volteer from a gruesome death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thank you, young one,\" Said Volteer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was nothing, real- *HIC*!\" Spyro's sentence was suddenly cut short when a loud hiccup ripped through his voice. He clamped his paws over his mouth in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, dear,\" said Cyril.</span></div></div>",

Like two beach balls, the two elders wobbled. The color of their scales had shifted, turning into something that almost resembled the purple dragon's. Even their eyes seemed to have a purple tint to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome traces of their limbs, like their necks and legs, were still visible, but it seemed like nothing more but lumps on their round frames with paws and heads attached to them. Like their basket ball-sized cheeks, Cyril and Volteer's butts had swelled, resembling, like their bodies, near perfect spheres.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerched on top of these orbs were the Elder's tails, but they had grown wide and stubby, looking more like two fat slugs than a dragon's tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, thank the Ancesto- *Uuurp!*\" exclaimed Cyril, letting loose another belch that sent purple spittle flying. \"Spyro, you're here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Volteer cheerfully, \"Now THIS is *Buurp!* most conven- *Hic* -ient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell happened to you two?\" Spyro exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the *Hic!* Gem!\" cried Cyril.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has *Urp!* contaminated us with some sort of *Buuuurp!* magic, inflating us into...well, this,\" Volteer explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is it?\" Spyro asked, gathering his wits and growing determined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth dragons bit their swollen lips, looking, with great effort moving their heads, at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Cyril said slowly, \"After the Gem *Urp!* - excuse me - was slowly turning us into blueberries, a panther wearing a cloak came running into the room and stole it right out from under our snouts.

And even then it just means a more likely chance one way or the other. Temperature is one such factor. Lower temperatures during incubation mean a greater chance of female dragons hatching...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: The Incubation chamber has cooled slightly. All of them may be reborn as females.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: The incubation chamber is plenty warm. It's likely they'll all be males... Including Cynder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: A female dragon intercepts Terrador, wondering if she might have the eggs to raise as her own.</span></div></div>",

A large dome shaped chamber with alcoves all along the walls filled with soft nests made of carefully crafted sheets of gold bent into bowl shapes that resembled birds nests. Most were empty since the temples old chamber was hardly used in favor of the more modern refurbished facility in Warfang. Mostly because the older chamber produced less heat these days from the underground thermal vents.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Terrador gently set the eggs two to a nest in the alcoves and then gave the place and the eggs one last look before exiting. Spyro tried to follow to gain his attention somehow but felt himself tugged back by his attachment to his body.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Well this is just great</i>, the purple dragon sighed with his mental voice, <i>How long are we going to be like this?</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>It's hard to say</i>, Cyril replied, <i>But I've felt different ever since we left the vicinity of the gem. Normally dragon eggs take months to years to hatch, but hopefully that won't be the case.</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>The more difficult thing we're going to have to deal with though is this chamber is far too cool for our eggs</i>, Volteer added.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>We're not going to go into some sort of hibernation for years because of that are we?</i> Spyro asked, getting a weird mental image of waking up a hundred years in some distant and different future.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Hardly,</i> Volteer reassured him, <i>The far more likely outcome is-</i><br>\r\nVolteer was suddenly interrupted as Cyril gave a sudden gasp and then a shivver before strangely beginning to giggle. <i>I'm sorry</i> he managed between his streams of chuckling mirth, <i>I don't... I just... heh, don't know what's happening...</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The others however were able to see as Cyrils ghostly image began to expand, looking puffy but also dissipating. Like a cloud evaporating apart, becoming wider but also thinly spread. As his ghostly giggles grew faint though they could see the mist he was becoming swirling back down towards his blue egg, which was beginning to rock and shudder.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Cyrils hatching,</i> Cynder guessed, <i>But wait... what were you saying the outcome of this was Volteer?</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0However before the golden dragon could speak he too had started giggling and expanding as his spirit swirled down towards his egg. By the time Volteers egg had begin to crack Cyrils egg was already splitting apart as the blue hatchling slowly emerged gasping and croaking on the first breaths of air for their body. And as the blue dragon slid out of the egg, it was clear Cyril was growing. By the time Volteer  had broken free, Cyril was already looking like a juvenile dragon a few years younger than Spyro and Cynder. It was as the two of them reached dragon puberty though that the differences could be seen.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Both were longer, thinner, and sleeker than they should have been, more pointed muzzles and fewer horns adorned their heads and stocky builds had been shifted to curving forms with larger hips that only grew thicker as the pair aged.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Volteer and Cyril were clearly female dragons.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well this is just great,\" Cyril muttered as she looked over her still progressing body, \"As if this day couldn't get any weirder.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I told you we should have spent some time fixing up this chamber,\" Volteer replied in her slightly nasally tone, \"It's needed it for years.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh don't try to pin this on me,\" Cyril replied as her neck gave a sudden pop and extended almost a full foot as she went through another growth spurt, \"None of us could have known this would happen.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Spyro was distracted from the pairs bickering though as Cynder began to giggle and he felt the strange tickling sensation rise in his own body. But despite the good sensations Spyro felt a sinking dread. he was going to emerge as a female, he just knew it. And while he felt himself spiral down into his egg next to Cynders he dreaded what he would emerge to find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Spyro, like the elders, emerges as a female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Spyro beats the odds and emerges as a male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3. Spyro comes out as the first ever dragon that's both male and female at the same time.</span></div></div>",

Some of them might be reborn now, while others a few years later, meaning that a few of them might be older or younger than the rest, causing a complete mixup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut luckily for them a miracle would present itself for them soon: the effects of the Gem was wearing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, all that they had to do to avoid regressing was to put as much distance from the Gem's power and they would have returned back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they would still have to deal with some lingering effects, like Cynder, Spyro, Volteer and Cyril could testify to earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile floating in the air, waiting patiently for something to happen, Cyril's ghostly form began to waver, switching in and out of focus like a faulty hologram.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I feel strange,\" said Cyril, his voice rising and falling in volume every time he wavered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anything more could be said, his body suddenly pulled apart, evaporating into smoke. While this happened, Cyril began to yell, but not because of fear but of terror and excitement, like a person riding a Rollercoaster for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smoke began to swirl, descending towards the blue egg, passing straight through the shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all the smoke was consumed, the egg began to wobble and shake. A large crack formed on the surface, which was later joined by many others as the hatchling inside tried to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally it collapsed, and between the eggshells and inside the nest crawled the blue baby dragon known as Cyril, half-blind by his milky eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, what happened to the ice dragon was also happening to the rest. One by one their bodies pulled apart, turning into smoke and entering the respective eggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner did that happen did they begin to hatch, breaking free from their organic prisons and crawling helplessly around, their minds in a state of confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was not all what was happening. There bodies suddenly began to stretch, growing taller, older, their features sharpening, their minds progressing into a state that they were aware of what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can someone please tell me what's going on?\" Spyro cried, his voice breaking at he returned to his normal age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it would seem that the power that the Gem inflicted on us were not permanent after all,\" said Volteer, grunting as he grew a little taller and reaching his late teens. \"The Spell wasn't necessary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we went through all that crap for nothing?!\" Cyril said, staring angrily at Volteer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was aging somewhat faster than the rest, quickly surpassing his young-adult stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would seem so,\" the yellow dragon answered, smiling sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the most important thing is that we're almost back to normal, right?\" said Spyro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro jumped when he heard a strong, stern voice speaking behind him. Turning around, he came face to face with Cynder, who was no longer a she but a he.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe keys difference, Spyro saw, was that the black dragon was muscular and a little taller, with metallic fins running down his back, but he was still rather sleek, a body meant for speed rather than strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro was dumbfounded. His lifelong friend and love interest was no longer had changed into a male, which should not be a surprise seeing that the room was basically a tropical greenhouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys better find a way to fix this fast,\" Cynder continued, giving them a angry glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea how to fix your dilemma,\" said Volteer, \"We must locate the Gem again and use it on you again. When your transformed back into an egg, we will just put you in a cooler room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to go through that again?\" Cynder exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the only way,\" said Cyril. \"Say, what happened to that Gem again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe Terrador took it,\" said Volteer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now,\" Cyril said, leading the group out of the room. \"Let's stop disturbing the little ones' rest.

One was a bright yellow color, spotted here and there with a blue feather, and the other was just blue with a large amount of fur covering his neck and ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey realized that someone was in the room with them, and they turned to him, the blue one saying, \"Ah, Spyro, it's so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't finish, for the purple dragon took a step forward, frowning angrily. \"Who are you?\" he demanded, \"What are you? And what did you do to my mentors Cyril and Volteer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue creature looked surprised. \"It's us, Spyro,\" he said, \"Don't you recognize us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course he doesn't recognize us, you dummy,\" said the yellow creature, \"We're a completely different specie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned back to Spyro and said, \"It's still us, young one, me and Cyril. You have no reason to be alarmed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple dragon calmed down, but he was still shocked. \"What the hell happened to you guys?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Spyro, it seems that the Gem you had brought us had some very powerful magic, so powerful that it had the ability to change our very specie,\" explained Volteer, \"Though, surprisingly, I'm not complaining. It very intriguing. Learning from a culture is one thing, but becoming one of their own kind literally is another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's great,\" said Spyro slowly, \"but what are you exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're Griffins, Spyro,\" Cyril said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a Griffin?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what we are, young one, a sort of hybrid creature,\" said Volteer, \"We don't blame you if you don't know. We never taught you about them. Anyway, they're not native to Avalar. They live far away, in very mountain-like landscapes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Spyro said in amazement at learning something new, but then he grew worried, \"But if the Gem did this to you, it could transform me and Cynder too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyril shook his head. \"No,\" he said, \"I don't think so. If you were here earlier you would have seen a blinding flash, which instantly turned us into Griffins afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro breathed a sigh of relief. As much as he was curious to learn more about Griffins, he really didn't want to change species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what now?\" he asked the Griffinfied Elders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" began Volteer, but then someone entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was is?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The elders were more like clay now than goo at least, but they still could only move at a snails pace. So Spyro had another idea. Remember the fun they'd had last winter building a giant snow dragon, he began wadding up their body, rolling it into a big ball.He left their heads out of course but soon the pair were about as close to a sphere as Spyro could get. he gave them another blast of could to harden a shell and then rolled the pair out the door.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fortunately the bath house wasn't far and they only passed one startled group of individuals on the way. Inside the bathes the new fire guardian Volcanus was relaxing in the large heated spring. It was big enough to fit a dozen dragons of Terrador's size with room to spare. And being alone he could spread out as much as he wanted. he flexed and cracked his joints, a mix of red and black scales covering his body. He was the smallest of the Guardians, but that was no bother to him being 'the newbie'. After a long day of trying to fill the clawed footprints of Ignitus, it was his time to relax and enjoy himself.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Unfortunately fate had other plans.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"LOOK OUT!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He had about two seconds to react before the doors to the bath burst open and what looked like a two headed ball of a blue and gold dragon rolled into the pool with a titanic splash. As the pair of heads came up sputtering Spyro jogged into the room. \"Sorry! I didn't anticipate the hill...\" Then he notice Volcanus looking between him and the strange figure that was Cyril and Volteer's quickly warming mass.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Would somebody please tell me just what is going on here?\" the red dragon asked.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And so the three told them.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All the while Cyril and Volteer's mass began to melt and spread...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Being liquid themselves, Cyril and Volteer unintentionally absorb all the water, now they're even more massive amounts of dragon goo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Spyro accidentally rolled up them gem with the two of them. Now it's in the bottom of the pool causing Volcanus to begin melting as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Cynder bursts in, melting herself, desperately looking for Spyro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Spyro feels his own body going soft and before he can leave he melts and slides into the pool with Cyril and Volteer.</span></div></div>",

'divided' for some reason; it was the only way to describe it.<br>\r\nSecond: He felt bigger and heavier than normal.<br>\r\nFinally: He could hear what had woken him up in the first place; a voice arguing loudly. What was weird about it was that it was his OWN voice! And it sounded as though it was coming from two separate directions; he could hear it coming from the right, but at the same time also from the left.<br>\r\nEven stranger, it sounded llike it was arguing with itself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is worse than before! Perhaps, but it is rather interesting... Interesting?!? This is nothing short of a disaster!!! Now, calm down, Cyril. There's no need to get angry... Too late for that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused by hearing his own voice saying those things, Spyro opened his eyes. However, he was immediately overcome by a sense of vertigo, as he was now looking at himself, seemingly from two angles at once!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill overwhelmed by dizzyness, Spyro noticed his own body looking in his general direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spyro....? Is.... is that you...?\" said his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's me...\" said Spyro, but stopped once he heard what he now sounded like.<br>\r\nFor some odd reason, his new voice had an echo-like tone to it; almost as if two being were speaking in perfect synchronization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, boy,\" said Spyro's body. \"Spyro, it's us! Cyril and Volteer! We are both inside your body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro froze at those words. If both of the Guardians were inside one body, then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously, Spyro looked downwards and stiffened in shock, as his hunch was confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom one angle, he was looking at a pair of front paws with cyan scales. But at the same time, he was also looking at a pair of front paws with yellow scales!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gem had somehow caused both of the Guardians to swap bodies with Spyro AT THE SAME TIME!!!<br>\r\nCyril and Volteer were BOTH inside Spyro's body, while Spyro had ended up inside BOTH of their bodies, with his conciousness acting as a kind of hive-mind, making him control both bodies simultaniously!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Spyro completely freaks out at being one dragon with two bodies! However, his inexperience with controlling two bodies at once causes him to accidentally knock out his own body, with Cyril and Volteer inside.<br>\r\nThings gets worse for Spyro when the Temple suddenly comes under attack from the remains of Malefor's army and Cynder comes in looking for all of them.<br>\r\nWith his own body out cold, Spyro unfortunatly has to pretend to be both Cyril and Volteer and help hold back the army until 'Spyro' wakes up.<br>\r\nBut that's easier said than done, since Spyro isn't used to controlling two bodirs at the same time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Spyro quickly calms down and goes through things with the Guardians. Since Spyro is now in two bodies while the Guardians are in just one, they decide that they have to learn how to move around like they currently are, since none of them knows how to use the gem to switch them back.<br>\r\nWhile Cyril and Volteer have to be perfectly synchronized in their movements in order to make Spyro's body move, Spyro has to learn how to make Cyril's and Volteer's bodies move independently from each other; a task which proves to be a lot more difficult than he first thought...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: While still trying to figure this out Cynder, Ignitus and Terridor burst into the room, but something is clearly wrong as the two larger dragons try to walk through the door at the same time and all three keep falling over eachother.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't easy but he started getting the hang of moving. He just had to think of moving each of their bodies like moving half of his one body. Moving his two 'right legs' moved Cyril's body and his two 'left legs' moved Volteer's. It was crude and he stumbled more than once, but he was starting to get the hang of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spyro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cyril! Volteer! Where are you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later the doors banged open as Ignitus and Terrador tried to barge into the room. Unfortunately both being very large dragons they quickly got stuck. Backing out to try again they got stuck a second time as each tried to go through first.Fortunately the smaller form of Cynder managed to slip inside between attempts but she stumbled sideways, flopped about and twisted like she was trying to take a step but kept compensating then over compensating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spyro!\" the pair of guardians spoke as one trying to get through the door still, \"What's happened to us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now calm down,\" 'Cynder spoke, \"Panicking over this situation won't improve anything... That's right we need to stay calm and level headed if we want to make any progress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignitus?\" Spyro's body looked at Cynder, \"Is that you in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terrador too,\" the black dragoness replied, \"Somehow we both ended up in Cynder and she's in both of our bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro looked at the two struggling guardians with his own shared quartet of eyes, \"This is getting really weird,\" Spyro muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: After getting Cynder inside, the group of six dragons settles down and tries to sort out what happened. However it's very awkward as Cynder tries to cuddle Spyro for comfort and all four guardians bodies end up snuggling next to eachother. After a brief discussion Spyro and Cynder excuse themselves for some practice using the guardians bodies, but it quickly devolves into feeling eachother up as the sensations of moving two bodies doubles the levels of pleasure both dragons feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Nearby the gem begins to glow again and without warning the dragons find themselves all pushed together. Six minds controlling six bodies linked as one. With so many brains shoved together it become harder for the dragons to keep their minds separate and thoughts, memories, and experiences begin 'leaking' from one consciousness to the next. A real danger presents itself as their mind might fully merge into one consciousness with all other personalities being absorbed into a singular being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: the gem glows again and suddenly the room no longer has four adult dragons and two child sized dragons, but one MASSIVE dragon as all their bodies have merged into one being with six separate minds trying to control their now simply enormous body.</span></div></div>",

They had front legs and back legs that were bulging with muscle, their prominent pecs had deep grooves, their under bellies, though they had plates, were showing signs of developing sixpacks, and their necks were as thick as oxen. Even there tails looked muscular, being thicker and longer than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth guardians were so captivated by their new bodies that Spyro had to speak to get their attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell happened to you guys!\" he exclaimed, his mouth hanging open in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both stopped flexing and looked at the purple dragon with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolteer was the first to speak, grinning happily. \"Young dragon!\" he said, walking towards Spyro, the very ground thumbing as he did so. Spyro backed away a step, feeling very intimidated by Volteer's size. \"We can not thank you enough for in trusting us with the gem you and Cynder found,\" he continued, flexing his right front leg, watching how it bulged greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" Said Cyril, coming closer as well. \"Our exposure to the gem had some pretty unusual effects on us. Not that I'm complaining, though. This is the best thing to ever happen to us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs both dragons began to admire their forms again, Spyro thought to himself: \"So the gem can make you stronger, eh? I wonder why it didn't have any effect on me or Cynder yet. Or maybe it still had to make us grow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro was mesmerized by the daydream of him and Cynder growing into muscled behemoths, but he could also hear a tiny voice in his head saying that this wasn't natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fantasy quickly evaporated when he heard Volteer say: \"Young one, why don't you go retrieve Terrador or Cynder for us. I bet they won't mind transforming into studs like us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro grinned. \"Right away!\" he said, leaving the room</span></div></div>",

Both guardians blinked and shivered, feeling the strange energies wash over them.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um...\" Cyril ventured as he felt a tingle rising in his chest.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh...\" Volteer agreed as he saw the muscles on his arm begin to swell with every beat of his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Meanwhile Spyro hurried back to find Cynder lounging under the same tree where he'd left her. Before she spotted him he tried to look her over and see if she showed any signs of looking thicker. It was possible perhaps but it was also likely he was only seeing what he expected if the changes were so small at present. Finally he shrugged and just approached.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Welcome back,\" Cynder replied when she spotted Spyro, \"Everything alright after all? No wold ending disasters brought about by the gem?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, everything fine,\" Spyro smiled, \"Though that gem might be a little more special than we thought.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Really? How so?\" Cynder asked curious. And her eyes widened as Spyro told her what he'd seen. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Merciful Ancestors!\" She gaped, \"Really? They were that big?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah,\" Spryo nodded, \"And we were exposed to the gems energies too. Have You felt any different since then?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No not really,\" Cynder replied, flexing her claws experimentally, \"But then I've mostly been daydreaming while you were gone.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well do you think we should try getting exposed to the gem again? I'm sure Cyril and Volteer wouldn't mind sharing it. Or maybe we just need to force it. A few Exercises might being it out.\" Spyro mused, \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well,\" Cynder considered, \"I think that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: \"...we should go see the guardians.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: \"...A few exercises might work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Before she can answer the temple rumbles and the roof explodes upwards in a cloud of debris as two mountains of blue and yellow scaled muscle emerge.</span></div></div>",

From all the Guardians, the green dragon was the most muscular, a typical built for an earth dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro couldn't wait to see how large his already beefy mentor would become, that's if he could find him. Luckily for him Terrador just finished his meeting with the counsel of Warfang and was heading up the stairs that led to the main entrance of the temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro smiled when he saw his mentor, and he called, \"Hey, Terrador.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrador's head perked up, and when he saw the purple dragon he said, \"O, hello, young one. I'm glad to see you're back from...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe trailed off when Spyro got closer to him, for he saw that something was clearly different about him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Spyro?\" Terrador said, surprised, looking at the purple dragon strangely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Spyro asked when he saw his mentor's expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, it became evident to him that the green dragon was studying his body, and Spyro quickly turned his to examine his as well. The Gem was finally having effect on him as well. He had grown while he was on his way to find Terrador without him knowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he wasn't nearly as muscular as Cyril or Volteer, the amount of muscle that increased on his frame was visible. Both his front and back legs were thicker, beginning to bulge with developing biceps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroves were forming between his chest, his tail and wings were more thicker, a six pack was developing on his middle, and his neck was a little thicker. Spyro was shocked at first, but then began to smirk, admiring his powerful body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wondered what Cynder would say when he saw him, but he was snapped out of his trance when Terrador cleared his throat and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you've done some training while you were away,\" he said, \"although, a week isn't nearly enough time to bulk up like this! It's completely impossible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro smirked at the green dragon. \"You're right,\" he said, \"that's why I didn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrador raised his thick eyebrows in surprise. \"Then how?\" he asked, growing curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro's smirk grew even wider. \"I had boost,\" he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrador frowned. \"What boost?\" he asked, growing suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I came to find you,\" said Spyro, whirling around. \"Follow me,\" he exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dashed down the hallway again, moving much quicker than any regular dragon, his paws thumping heavily on the tiled floor. Terrador trotted after him, overflowing with curiosity.</span></div></div>",

Ooohh-mmmm... like that...\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Spyro had heard the words but they barely registered in his mind compared to what he'd been seeing. The two adult dragons sat on their haunches facing each other, each staring down at the others genitalia.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Normally male dragons had their privates hidden in scale covered pouches, with testicles only becoming visible during fertile mating seasons as they upped productivity. The average length on an adult dragon, or so the young dragon had been told, was about the size of Spyro's whole torso.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cyril and Volteer had been sporting cocks the size of his whole body and balls bigger than him and Cynder combined.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Had</i> been.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Spyro watched with strange fascination, the elder dragons members began to grow with a sound like stretching rubber mixed with their own soft moans.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cyril's was strangely ribbed and sported several additional bands around the length just below the pointed head of his blue tinged length of flesh. Slowly, pulse by pulse, the head inflated, pushing further out of his foreskin and working it's way up between his legs. His bands of scales covering his balls created and groaned as they too inflated with a sound like boiling tar  churning away inside the sphered that soon protruded out to the sides of his legs.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Volteer's member was a little shorter and thicker than Cyril's to match the yellow dragons smaller stature, but it was no less impressive as it swelled from base to tip, extending three long but sot spines that adorned the top of his cock head, each giving sot pops as they expanded and tickled his underbelly while his balls groaned and gurgled  with new seed filling them.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was only when the growth paused and the pair were panting a little that Volteer was the first to notice Spyro.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah, young one,\" he blushed almost as bad as Cyril had been who now looked ready to die of sheer embarrassment at the sight of Spyro, \"It, ah, seems the gem you brought us had some... 'interesting' effects.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Understatement of the millennium,\" Cyril muttered as he tried not to stare at his own or Volteer's crotch.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It is most... 'inconvenient'...\" Volteer muttered standing up and hefting his large balls and larger member under him.

They were far too good-natured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Spyro realized what Volteer was hinting at, that there was also other ways to release the tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Spyro said: \"Alright, I'll get here as quick as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better,\" said Cyril, rubbing his towering member, \"I'm not sure how much longer we're going to last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro sprinted from the room, running down the corridors towards the entrance that lead to the gardens.

She ran after him as he dashed back towards the guardian's chamber. Both Cyril and Volteer were standing now, their members throbbing between their front legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got her,\" Spyro announced when he stepped into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Cynder asked, \"Why did y...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trailed off when she saw the predicament that the elders were in, and she averted her eyes, blushing beet-red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on?\" Cynder exclaimed, on paw raised beside her face to obscure the obscene sight, \"What happened to the guardians?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro quickly gave her the outline of what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we need you to help us relieve some tension before...Well, you know what,\" said Cyril.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean...?\" Cynder said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guardians nodded. Cynder backed away a little, fear rising inside her, but Volteer noticed her distress, quickly saying: \"Do not be frightened, young one. We shall never even dream of forcing ourselves on you. You shall do it willingly or not at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But,\" said Cyril, \"If you do not comply, we have to, unfortunately, do \"that\" with each other.\" He cast Volteer a look that told him exactly what he was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder was facing some inner turmoil.

She was swept away a few feet before the current resided, leaving the hallway filled with puddles of dragon seed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder coughed and splattered, looking around in confusion. \"What in the name of the Ancestors was that?\" she asked herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to her feet, and trying her best to ignore the musky smell, she quickly headed to the chamber and looked inside. Volteer and Cyril were panting loudly, laying on their colossal member that reached almost to the very sides of the room.

Every movement set her off and trying to move slowly just prorogued each orgasmic release. Even once she got shakily to all fours her sexual lips dragged the ground between her legs.

The only thing he could think about, was having someone pleasure him and his many members and never stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever; when the four new members were equal in size to the other four, Spyro was snapped out of those thoughts due to an immense sense of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegaining his wits, Spyro quickly found out where the pain came from; his crotch! When he looked down at himself, he became speechless out of both shock and horror, as he saw what was causing the pain... his many giant genitals!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to now having no less than EIGHT pairs of members and balls, his crotch was streached almost to the breaking point; due to the fact that Spyro's eight members had grown so long, that their tips had actually grown to where they were equal to the top of his horns!<br>\r\nIn other words; Spyro now had eight pairs of genitals, all as long as he was!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, Spyro's balls had also grown to be in proportion with his 'rods'; but this was part of the problem!<br>\r\nThe balls on his four lower pairs of genitals, (they were arranged in two horizontal rows; four lower and four upper), had grown so big, that they were forcing his hind legs apart almost more than they could handle! Combined with the fact that he had eight humongous sets of genitals squeezed into the relatively small space between his legs, it was no wonder that he felt such pain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro was horrified at the size of his scrotoms. He was certain that if they got bigger than they were now, his hind legs would be forced so much apart, that he would break his hips!<br>\r\nFortunately; his many members had stopped growing, at least for now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Spyro about two minutes to recover from the shock, but the pain was still there.<br>\r\nFighting through it, Spyro tried to see how the Guardians were doing, but found that he couldn't, as his members now obscured his line of sight.<br>\r\nUsing his front legs to part his members like straws, Spyro looked at the guardians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Cyril and Volteer had gone completely bonkers from watching Spyro's changes. Both dragons now sported members so big that they could suck themselves off; which was just what they did!<br>\r\nSpyro watched in shock as both guardians sucked their own monstrous dongs, moving them back and forth in their mouths with the speed of a jackhammer, while cumming enough to fill a lake!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Spyro a second before he realized what was going on; the power of the gem had caused both guardians to become lost in the feeling of pleasure!!!<br>\r\nThe two dragons could no longer think of anything, other than jacking themselves off with their gigantic members! For the moment, there was nothing else that mattered to the two. Every thought, every fiber of their being; heck, even their whole existence was currently focused on only one thing: the orgasmic pleasure of an almost unfathomable masturbation, with dicks as big as they were tall!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro didn't really know what to feel.<br>\r\nOn one hand, his eight enormous cocks still caused him a great deal of pain.<br>\r\nBut; on the other hand, it was probably only because of that pain, that he had been able to maintain his grip on his phyche and avoiding drowning in pleasure like the guardians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that there was no way that he could walk anymore, Spyro looked at his eight massive dicks, the pain overriding all feelings of pleasure, and wondered what would happen next...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Spyro's eight cocks suddenly shrink down to a much more manageable size, allowing him to walk again; however, his body then starts to split itself into several Spyros (eight, to be precise), each with only one cock each.<br>\r\nHowever; Spyro's consciousness is spread throughout all the bodies like a hive mind; i.e. one mind, eight bodies!<br>\r\nThis causes even more trouble for Spyro, as he now has to get used to looking through eight pairs of eyes at the same time, learning how to control his many bodies simultaneously without crashing into anything, and learning how to talk without using all eight mouths.<br>\r\nThings might get better for Spyro though, when he finds out that the cum from each of his new bodies dicks, will cause different changes to occur to anyone who either gets splattered with it, or swallows it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: All of Spyro's massive members will have a duplicate of Spyro's head on the end, with Spyro's consciousness being split between them, giving him a total of nine heads, but still only one mind.<br>\r\nThough he initially has trouble getting used to looking through nine seperate pairs of eyes, Spyro soon discovers that, due to having a head on the end of each of them, he can move his cocks as though they were his neck, basically allowing him to pleasure one dick with another!<br>\r\nHowever; this could potentially mean that Spyro's feelings of pain would be overshadowed by the feeling of pleasure, which could cause him to become just as orgasm-crazed as the guardians; perhaps even more so, since he has eight dongs to jerk off with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Spyro's body begins to feel weird and his his limbs began to feel hot and soft. He can't help but watch in stunned shock as his limbs, tail, wings, claws, all slowly start to turn into masses of branching cocks, all demanding to be pleasured. Soon only his head is left and as his neck lengths and his horns go soft Spyro realizes even that won't last. he becoming a living bundle of dragon cocks. Can anything save him from becoming a creature locked in endless sexual pleasure?</span></div></div>",

Although not for long. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Whatever was happening the process of dividing continued as the two heads watched the divide move down their chest, bisecting it and spas they pulled apart new legs grew in place.

He needed release, any kind at this point would do. So he could guess just how badly Cyril and Volteer needed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: The Spyros help Cyril and Volteer get some relief and try to find their own in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: One Spyro stays the other goes to find Cynder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Before anything can be decided the Spyros moan in pleasure.

Horns swept back and curled down faintly unlike his which protruded up. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And there was something else. As he looked over the other head, which he was beginning to grasp might just be female, she had a strange overbite of sorts, her fangs on her upper jaw protruded down a couple extra inches. Spyro licked his own teeth (with a startlingly long tongue) and found the fangs on his lower jaw protruded up in a pair of tusks the same length. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He almost didn't want to know, but all the same Spyros right foreleg felt back between his privates. The male parts were still there, but behind his balls weas a new vent, a feminine sex from his other side.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, watch the claws,\" the female head giggled.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was something else Spyro noticed. They were not one mind in two heads. Instead he could pick up faint thoughts from her head and move her side of the body if she let him, but otherwise he was limited to his own right side.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Just when I thought this day couldn't get any weirder,\" Spyro groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Spyro and 'Spyra's stomach growls, the pair are twice as hungry as a normal dragon. But double the food on a singular body means twice the mass put into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Spyra turns to Volteer and grins, \"Shall we continue?\" she offers up her moist sex for play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Something else happens then.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Guardians moaned with pleasure as they were given a blow job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Spyro watched this scene, he couldn't help but blush, reaching with his clawed hand between his legs and began to finger his sex.

He prayed that it wasn't so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe arrived at the spot under the tree where he had left her, and his blood ran cold when he saw that she wasn't there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Spyro, calm down, this means nothing,\" he reassured himself, \"She just got bored and wondered off... Yeah, that's it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro began to frantically search for her. What happened next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Spyro searches and finds Cynder. He is relieved to find that she is alright and had just wondered away. He tells her what happened to the Guardians, but the erotic imagery was making Cynder feel hot and bothered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Spyro searches for Cynder, and he stumbles upon a weird scent that smells like a mix between lavender and fish. As he follows the scent, he stumbles on Cynder, who is in a trance like state, mewling like a cat and spraying juices from her swollen vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: While looking for Cynder Spyro runs into Ignitus and tells him about the strange things going on with Cyril and Volteer as an odd look crosses the red dragons face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Before Spyro can find anyone a poerful sensation grips his own body. Try as he might to fight against it, the strange sensations begin to overpower him as he begins to change.</span></div></div>",

Her balls were also swollen disproportionately large; they were nearly the size of bowling balls, crimson red like her underbelly, churning with its ample amount of seed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder that, Spyro could see if he looked closely, her feminine lips were obscured by her massive balls, but it was effected by the growth as well. Her labial flaps were swollen as thick as Spyro's toe, and her clitoris was as big as a grape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuices ran out of her folds as her clawed hand fingered her hole. The other hand was stroking her cock so fast that it seemed like a blur. Her pre-cum oozing out of her tip shined in the moonlight. Cynder seemed too preoccupied to notice Spyro staring at her in stunned silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was both astonished and dismayed. He knew that it would happen sooner or later, for they were exposed to the Gem's power as well, but he thought he could get to her in time before they began to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro knew he had to snap Cynder out of her hormonal bliss, but he was a little afraid to. She seemed almost feral in this state. On the other hand, staring at Cynder playing with herself (and this came as a shock to Spyro) the purple dragon felt a little aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it the Gem's power finally gaining influence over him?

Every chance she got she turned and admired the sun gleaming off her golden scales.She really was quite the sight.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Perhaps that's why it wasn't long before she was spotted.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hello,\" rumbled a deep voice nearby, \"I don't believe we've met before...\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Volteer looked up into the eyes of Terrador and seemed unsure what to do. Then she smiled. \"Oh hello there yourself... handsome.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't believe I've seen you around here before. What's your name?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Volteer hesitated for a moment and then replied, \"Electra. I just arrived this morning.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well Miss Electra,\"Terridor smiled and took her fore-claw in his and gave it a gentlemanly kiss, \"I'm the earth guardian Terridor. Perhaps you would permit me to show you around?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I would be most delighted.\" She smiled and batted her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A couple hours later the pair arrived in Terradors large private chambers.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And this is where I come to be alone,\" he smiled at her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh I hope that's not too often, \"You must have female dragons chasing your tail all the time.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well...\" Terridor coughed a bit in embarrassment before looking back at her. Something about the golden dragoness was simply enchanting. He'd had a hard time taking his eyes off her the whole time they'd been together. And maybe it was just his imagination but she seemed to get curvier and more lovely every time he looked at her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Is that where you sleep?\" she asked pointing to what Volteer knew to be Terradors bed.Before he could answer she walked over and climbed up onto the mattress. The soft clink of coins the only sign of the gold it contained.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Would you care to join  me?\" she smiled waving him over in a sultry way.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Terrador shook his head to clear it, but smiled as he followed, \"You are a most unusual dragoness, you know that?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She reached up and wrapped her arms around his neck, \"And you like it.\" She then leaned in and planted a kiss on his muzzle as she gently dragged him down to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Volteer is contagious. After a night of fun Terrador wakes up a female as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Volteer wakes up after their fun the next day with a bulging belly. She's pregnant already?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Back with Spyro and Cyril the ice dragon seems to be having trouble focusing.</span></div></div>",

She yawned and turned her head, hoping to find her lover next to her, but alas! Volteer saw that the covers were thrown away and it was completely empty beside her. She gave a sigh, remembering the night they had before, Terrador's green member plunged into her womanhood, the burly dragon saying repeatedly \"I love you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I guess I should rise to and go look for my mate,\" thought she. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when she attempted to sit up, she felt a heavy weight press down on her. Pulling away the covers, Volteer was greeted by a bulging belly. It was not fat, she discovered when she touched it, for it was far too firm and hard. Volteer then came to the startling, and impossible, conclusion that she was pregnant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how?\" she asked herself. \"The sperm has to travel to the womb first to fertilize it. Unless...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Volteer realized that this was too one of the effects the Gem had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps testing out by new body wasn't the most cleverest of ideas,\" she said, rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noise of heavy footsteps made Volteer quickly cover herself. Through the open door of the room came marching in Terrador, balancing a platter of food on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, my love,\" greeted the green dragon with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning to you too, handsome,\" said Volteer, trying to remain calm, hoping that her swollen tummy did not show against the covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brought you breakfast,\" said Volteer, placing the tray on a shelf next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How sweet of you,\" said Volteer happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was indeed delighted that someone brought her food, for she was feeling rather hungry. Volteer would have ate herself, but Terrador insisted that he should feed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All full?\" asked Terrador.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very,\" said Volteer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earth guardian leaned over to kiss his mate and, doing so, reached with one paw to stroke her full belly, but he then felt something very odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" he asked, lifting up the covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscovering what happened to his mate, his eyes went wide with shock<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolteer felt her blood run cold. \"I can explain,\" she said, managing a weak smile.</span></div></div>",

She looked like a female version of the purple dragon, but that was impossible, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only difference she shared from Spyro was that her head crest was larger, her body curvy and sleek, her haunches rather large. The dragoness looked equally surprised to see them and let out a gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments of moments of silence past before Terrador opened his mouth to speak. He wanted to know who she was, why her scales were purple, why she resembled Spyro so much, and where did she come from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the dragoness beat him to it first when her eyes fell on the pregnant Electra/Volteer, who sat down on her haunches, cradling her swollen stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple dragoness rushed to her, saying in a feminine voice, placing her paw against her pregnant belly, \"O no, Volteer, are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Volteer?\" Terrador asked, frowning and growing confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so,\" said the yellow dragoness, \"The sensation, which is not painful or pleasant, have been growing worse.

What do you mean by a spell? Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple dragoness sighed and said, \"Terrador, it's me, Spyro. I've been turned into a girl, okay. So have this dragoness here. This is Volteer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he pointed at the yellow dragon, Terrador's mouth went slack and his eyes widened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolteer/Electra nodded. \"It's true,\" she said, seeing no point in trying to keep this a secret for any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but h-how...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green dragon was struggling to comprehend this. A thousand questions were running through his mind. How did this happen? Did he just had sex with someone that was not only formally a male and fellow Guardian but a impregnated them as well?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll explain everything when we get where Cyril is,\" said Spyro, \"Right now isn't the time.

In fact, he saw no one...except for two new editions to the furniture in the chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, when the purple dragon approached them, he thought that they were two bean bags, on yellow and one blue, but on closer inspection he found truly something odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two blobs had something that looked like a head with horns, barely the size of a tip of a ballpoint pen, and on the opposite side of this head was a long, thick extension that resembled that of a tail, two lumps at the base of this extension that looked like two butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn further examination, he identified four more lumps, and inside these lumps he could make out what seemed like puffy clawed hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Spyro continued to investigate, the yellow blob suddenly spoke, \"Spyro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice was very high in pitch, and the purple dragon took a step back in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spyro, it's us, Cyril and Volteer!\" cried the blue blob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple dragon was so confused that something that looked a lot like bean bags were talking to him, let alone be his mentors, that he could only say, \"What the... But how...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spyro, the Gem emitted some kind of energy wave that regressed our overall height, but, at the same time, we retained our original weight,\" explained the yellow blob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Spyro said, still confused, for he was gathering his wits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me sum this up,\" squeaked the blue blob, \"The Gem made us shrink but we still have the same weight as when we were regular sized dragons, which is roughly around 400 pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" said Spyro, struggling to believe the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, seriously!\" snapped the blue blob, \"and you need to find a solution fast before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyril trailed off, for, Spyro could hear, there was a faint rumbling noise. Before the purple dragon's eyes, the blobs seemed to fill outwards a little and the tiny heads grow even smaller, the lumps swelling even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Confounded!\" the yellow blob cried, his voice even higher, \"Before that happens to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorrified, Spyro said desperately, \"What should I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Spyro,\" began Cyril, \"We need to reverse the effects of the Gem somehow. I believe there is a book in the library which has a certain spell that can switch effects around. In other words, if you cast it, the Gem will make us grow. Though, we will still continue to grow to a ridiculous size if you do that, but it's a start for us and we have no there option.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do just that,\" said Spyro, turning around and attempting to leave, but before he did this, he paused and turned around, saying, \"Wait a minute, Cynder and I was exposed to the Gem's power as well. Shouldn't we start to shrink and get fat too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right!\" cried Volteer, \"How can we have forgotten. Perhaps it's due to our own transformation that we have neglected the situation where you can also be altered. This makes the situation even more dire, especially with the magic inside you, which can have bizarre effects when it comes in contact with the Gem's powers. You must move even quicker, Spyro, before it's too late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro didn't waste time. He ran. What happens next?</span></div></div>",

It won't be long until the digestion begins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Digestion!\" Spyro cried in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" said Cyril, \"This is a stomach. What did you expect? But don't worry; I might have a way out of this situation by using this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held up the Gem. \"I was holding it when Volteer immobilized me,\" explained Cyril, \"He was too focused on eating me to care. We can use this thing to escape!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro understood. In this dark, wrinkly, humid, cramped (though, not as nearly cramped as Volteer's throat) place there was a ray of hope in the form of a glowing Gem. It had gotten them into this mess, it could get them out of it. But the question was how are they going to use it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he asked him this, Cyril replied, \"Well, I'm not quite sure how this thing works. Before he changed, Volteer hypothesized that it was sending out some kind of frequency, for he could feel it disturbing the electricity in the air. I was thinking that we focus our energy into the Gem to make us transform in some way, so that we can escape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" said Spyro, determined, \"What should I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Place your paw against the Gem and focus your energy,\" instructed Cyril.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro did so and felt the tingly sensation of his elemental powers course through him as he focused. The Gem flared up and the purple dragon yelped, backing away, though there wasn't much room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's happening!\" Cyril cried as the Gem hummed loudly, its light increasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a bright flash and everything go dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice one: Spyro wakes up in a surreal landscape along with Cyril, but he quickly discovers that it's actually Volteer's body! They had shrunk to a microscopic level!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice two: Spyro wakes up somewhere outside the temple with Cyril. The Gem had teleported them outside Volteer's stomach. They now have a chance to stop the Naga-dragon before he claims another victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Similar to choice two but both Cyril and Spyro have lost some extra weight. Now it seems whenever Volteer eats someone and they're 'digested' they reform nearby unharmed and nearly normal but lacking any excess fat. </span></div></div>",

Volteer was sitting on the floor, shivering, as if he was experiencing hypothermia. He looked normal except for his head, which was sloping like a neanderthal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo sharp teeth, one from the lower jaw and one from the upper, was portraying from his maw, giving him a savage and primitive look. Spyro was shocked at this sight, and wanted to ask what was going on, when someone spoke behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Spyro, it's simply marvelous, splendid, fantastic that you have finally disembarked from the gardens to pay us homage,\" said Cyril, \"Well, at least me, for Volteer's mind incapable of processing proper thought. Though, it's not utterly his undoing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Spyro turned around, his jaw went slack. Like Volteer, Cyril looked like he always did except for his head. His horns were resting on two bulging mounds that that was covered with veins. It throbbed and flexed like a muscular chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what...?\" Spyro said, not completely understanding what he was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyril held the Gem, which was switching from color to color, in his paw, admiring it. While he appeared to be studying it, twisting it in his paw, he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This precious mineral, or the \"Gem\" as you lot fervently like to call it, had some fascinating abilities,\" he explained, \"It has the interesting feature to transfer, like money, a living beings intelligence to the one holding it via eye contact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro gasped, looking at Volteer and back at Cyril. Now he understood what was going on. The ice dragon had stolen the yellow dragon's IQ, and from the look of it it seemed like Cyril had sucked him dry, like some Intelligence vampire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The sensation is rather magnificent,\" Cyril continued, \"like experiencing euphoria. I never knew it felt so good to be smart. No wonder Volteer was always such a chatterbox. Exercising ones knowledge is rather nice. Perhaps I should drain more IQ.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his head to Spyro. What happens next?</span></div></div>",

The draining made itself known to Spyro by a headache, but he ignored it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cyril, y-you can't do this,\" he said, \"This isn't right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyril, surprisingly, nodded and said, \"I understand that you view this as tyrannical, but, my young dragon, you must know that I'm doing this for everyone's wellbeing. One incredibly smart being making all the decision is far more superior than a bunch of simple minded dragons debating what to do during a crisis. Besides, I will give Volteer's IQ back eventually. Just not all of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro wanted to argue further, but he suddenly felt that he had nothing to argue about. Instead, he found himself agreeing with Cyril's view of things. It was so much more easier to have one super smart dragon to make all the important choices in life, wasn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro felt sleepy, his eyelids beginning to droop, and he found himself saying, \"S-sounds fair...I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good dragon!\" Cyril exclaimed, smiling, turning his gaze away from the purple dragon and back to the Gem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had finished draining some if Spyro's intelligence, and as a result his brain was a tad larger now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I want you to hop along and find your companion, Cynder, for me,\" Cyril ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro would have questioned him if he still had his normal amount of IQ, but he hadn't, so instead he said, \"Sure thing, Cyril.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue dragon watched him leave the room, feeling a little bad for dulling his wits, but he couldn't afford anyone antagonizing him and trying to stop him. He wasn't a bad guy. He only wanted to in force the ideology he received from his new amount of brilliance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, it felt great to drain away someone's intelligence. Cyril could feel that he was a bit aroused from stealing Spyro's. While he was standing there, waiting for the purple dragon to bring his next victim, an idea popped into his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his attention to a cup on the table nearby. Focusing really hard, it suddenly jumped, like someone bumped into the table. Cyril grinned. Yes, if he become even more smarter he would gain mind powers.

He could feel the basic knowledge she contained join his mountain of knowledge he already possessed, his brain growing slightly bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling was so great that Cyril found himself growing aroused, the tip of his blue member emerging from his sheath.

What's going on?\" she mumbled, trying to get her thoughts together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyril smiled sympathetically. \"Don't fret, young one,\" he said, walking closer and patting Cynder on the head. \"All you need to know is that I'm gathering knowledge for myself to built us all a brighter future. Now, hop along to the Guardians' Chamber and join Spyro for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scooted her with his tail, and she obediently began to walk to where she was ordered to go.

He had to call a meeting and assemble the remaining Guardians into the dojo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere he would drain their intelligence, leaving them to serving him with little questioning.

I wanted to run off and seek help, but then I decided that panicking won't help. Instead I decided to stay here and wait for you, to see if the same thing happened to you as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe poked Spyro's large, squishy head. \"And it appeared so that it did,\" she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple dragon grinned. \"I guess we're both geniuses now,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder shot him a glare. \"Spyro, this is not a good thing,\" she said sternly, \"I read somewhere that if one had enough brain power, one could develop psychic powers, like reading minds, levitating objects, and even controlling someone's minds. That could be bad for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro's instant comprehension kicked in again. \"You're right,\" he said, understanding the severity of the situation. \"It's all good and well if one develops these powers over time, getting use to its feel, but to us it's happening too fast. We're not used to it. We won't be able to control it! Our minds would be reading thoughts, levitating heavy objects, and forcing other to do what we want, and all that would be unintentionally. We could cause harm to us and everyone around us. And, if we even go that far, our brains could develop its own consciousness. It could begin to tell US what to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder nodded gravely. \"Indeed,\" she confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith fear, Spyro looked at her and asked, \"What are we going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder answered almost instantly. \"Well, I have two solutions. One, we could go back to the Guardians' Chamber and tweak with the Gem, to make it reverse the changes or at least stop our growth for a while.\" she explained, \"Another thing we could do would be hard but possible. We can master our new abilities. A less known, but very true, saying goes that one cannot defeat ones daemons but only live above them. That exactly what we should do: we should master them, tell our powers what to do, instead of it telling us what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those suggestion sounds good,\" Spyro said, \"But which one should we take?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder shrugged. \"I'll leave it to you,\" she said, \"Your guess is just as good as mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Spyro choose.</span></div></div>",

He had no time to react, no time to defend himself. He swam desperately to the edge of the pool, but it was too late.

I beg your pardon that you had to see us arguing so, but Cyril and I are debating what this strange object is. Cyril here thinks it's some sort of crystal that merged with other. Have you ever heard such a laughable theory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ice guardian shot Volteer a glare and was about to say something about his comment, but Spyro suddenly spoke: \"Don't worry. I'm kinda used to you guys fighting all the time. And if you'll ask me, I think it could be some sort of light-gem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolteer shot Cyril a look that said \"See, even he agrees\". Cyril only grumbled something inaudible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But still,\" continued Spyro, \"I wonder what it could do. Have you tried absorbing some of its magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no, Spyro, we have not,\" said Cyril, \"To be honest, we're a little nervous to do so. It has been making strange humming noises.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro raised his scaly eyebrows. \"Really?\" he said, \"Where is it, then? I want to see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's over there,\" Volteer said, pointing a claw towards a black case. \"We locked it up for safety.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro went over to the case, clicking open locks that held it closed, and peered inside.

Perhaps it had something to do with the way Volteer was glaring at the ice dragon. \"The flying grounds is far too dusty in my opinion, and with so much space someone could spy what we are doing, making it unsafe for testing. But, for an unknown reason, some think it's a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cast the Electric Guardian an accusing side-look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, hush now, Cyril,\" said Volteer, \"We all know you only selected the area because it has seats. You would care nothing if someone witnessed what we were doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not you that has a sore pelvis,\" said Cyril.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, wait, wait,\" Spyro broke in before the argument escalated any further, \"You mean we're going to do the testing away from the public?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Terrador, \"It's for their own safety. We have not the slightest clue what the Gem is capable of. If something goes wrong, only us will be inflicted by the damage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But,\" Spyro said, dropping his voice to a whisper, \"won't that be, you know, a conspiracy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolteer shook his head. \"No, it will most certainly not be,\" he answered, \"We are only doing this for cautious reasons. As soon as we discover what it is and what it's capable of, good or ill, we will inform the general public.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro shrugged. \"I guess it sounds reasonable if you put it like that,\" he said before a group of moles arrived at their table, bearing their food on platters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe testing would take place at midday, for the guardians had other things to do during the day, leaving Spyro and Cynder to wonder around aimlessly in the city, looking for something to do. When the bell toned for afternoon they ran to the temple, more than excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dojo was one very large, round room. In the center was a field of dirt and sand, and all around it was stone steps, seats for spectators. Currently, a pillar had risen out of the ground, the handiwork of Terrador, and on it was placed the Gem for examination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" said Cyril when he saw Spyro and Cynder rush into the dojo, \"You have arrived. I almost thought we have to start without you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop being such a bully, Cyril,\" commanded a female voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blue dragoness, with webbed feet and dolphin fin shaped tail, sitting on a nearby bench, glared at Cyril. She was none other than Aqua, the new Water Guardian, a distant cousin to the Ice Guardian. Cynder took a seat next to her, and they both gave each other friendly smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the recent years she and Aqua had formed a close bond with each other, becoming good friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, I'm was not serious,\" said Cyril, his prideful and smug attitude dropping, being replaced by a awkward and guilty expression, \"I often do this. Isn't that right, Spyro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so,\" said Spyro, taking a seat next to Volcanis, the youngest guardian in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother cousin to Ignitus, he looked much like his Uncle, but with redder scales, slim build, and a horn growing from his chin, which he often liked to stroke when he was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that everyone's assembled,\" said Terrador, who was standing next to the pillar, \"It's now time that we do the scan. Ventus, if you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the stone seat roused the Wind Guardian, a silvers scaled, lengthy dragon with whiskers, that almost looked like noodles, portraying from the sides of his face. He was the oldest of all the guardians in the room, and the tallest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is truly a remarkable find,\" said Ventus, his voice smooth and deep, \"I do admit that I'm a little nervous about this scan. I can feel the Gem casting a rather negative aura.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" said Terrador, \"But one must take risks for the sake of discovery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod from Ventus, Terrador took a seat, watching with mild amazement as the Wind Guardian's scales began to glow brightly, preparing to scan the object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think he can find out what it is?\" whispered Spyro to Terrador.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If there is anyone who can unlock this Gem's secret it's Ventus,\" answered the green dragon, \"He has studied the nature of crystals and gems for decades.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey turned their attention back towards the examination.

In fact, this is kinda fun, though, I wonder how I'm gonna get down from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo answer her question, the Gem stopped glowing, retracting its lights. With the strange force now gone, Cynder plummeted from the sky with a scream, but she was caught just in time by Aqua, who was the closest to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Extraordinary, magnificent, brilliant, baffling!\" exclaimed Ventus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You took the synonyms right out of my mouth,\" said Volteer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It truly is a object of great wonder,\" said Terrador, \"Perhaps not even native to our world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" agreed Ventus, \"I would not mind if I could study it further.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow,\" said Terrador, gazing out a nearby window at the setting sun, \"It's getting quite late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all left the dojo, but instead of going to their own courtiers, things got a little bit scramble up that evening: Volteer, Cyril, and Terrador took the Gem with them to the guardians's chamber, where it would be held for safety, Volcanis accompanied Ventus to the library in the temple, where he would conduct a study about the Gem, and Cynder and Aqua were going to hang out a little with each other, leaving Spyro alone tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple dragon didn't mind Cynder having other company than his own.

It's not often that I get some girl company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your welcome,\" said Aqua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey began to talk about their usual things. But as they spoke, getting lost in the conversation, the Gem's power took hold of them. It first began with a itch between their thighs that grew worse and worse as time ticked by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth dragonesses resisted the urge to scratch between their legs, for it would be both rude and embarrassing to do such an act, but the itch grew so worse that they could not resist anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" apologized Aqua, reaching with her paw between her thighs and scratching furiously, \"It's just so dame itchy. I think the moles should use less chemicals on my pool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it's that,\" said Cynder, also beginning to scratch, \"I'm a little bit itchy too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as they scratched, they were, unknowingly, busy stimulating the second step: arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how quick is it?</span></div></div>",

Her head snapped towards Cynder, and the black dragoness knew that Aqua lost all control of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, the blue dragoness jumped at Cynder, tackling her to the ground. They rolled for a few feet before coming to a halt, Aqua laying on her back and the black dragoness on top, held tightly by the blue dragoness's paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasure me!\" she shrieked at Cynder, flipping the poor dragoness over and pressing her against her swollen lips, \"Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat else could Cynder do?

Though, not in the way you are thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery molecule in her body suddenly detached itself, bouncing around in the womb, before they were forced together by the pressure into white, formless goop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Cynder wasn't dead.

The time wasn't right yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder could feel how her body was morphing inside Aqua, shaping into something that was an oval and black in color. An egg, she realized. She was turning into an egg!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut did that mean Aqua was her mother, and she her daughter? Would she born different now? It was so weird.

Dreams of the guardians melting, inflating like balloons, or becoming dragonesses of all things. And always he was right behind in the series of changes, doomed to inflate, or grow, or change however they did.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As such  it wasn't too surprising he found himself awake in the middle of the night. His eyes glanced out the window at the full moon, rising high in the clear night sky. Despite the odd series of dreams, Spyro endeavored to roll over and try to put them all out of his mind and go back to sleep. Yet somehow it simply refused to come. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It took a couple minutes of just laying there before he figured out why he was awake.Something had him on edge.

For a moment Spyro considered waking Cynder but turned down the idea as, not only was her door squeaky as he knew, the time it would take to wake and convince her meant he'd lose track of the figure. So, quietly, Spyro padded after it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The temple was cool and dark, all but the most essential of fires snuffed out, leaving only the shafts of moonlight through the windows to illuminate anything as Spyro crept after the figure. His heart pounded in his ears as the slightest sound put him on edge. He tried to remind himself there was nothing dangerous about, and he'd already saved the world multiple times, but the darkness had ways of letting imaginations run wild with ideas of what might be luring just out of sight.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Spyro swallowed his fears and moved on, the dark figure was just a short ways ahead now. The creak of a hinge echoed as the figure slipped into a room, Spyro was almost certain it trailed a tail after itself and it was quite large. If he was right that was the same room where the Gem was being stored. Quickly he snuck to the door and peaked inside. Fortunately a large fire had been left going in the fireplace. And though it had burned low he could still see the room fairly well through the open door.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And what Spyro saw was quite surprising.</span></div></div>",

The moon shone through the the glass doors that lead outside to the balcony of the guardian's courtiers, and a fire was burning bright in the hearth, looking like it was recently lit. But of the strange thumping noises and shadows Spyro heard and saw there was nothing of of such sort in the room. There was only silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro shrugged off this bizarre event as nothing more but the hallucinations of a tired mind, and he turned around to go back to his room. But he then noticed something very out of place: the case that contained the gem was wide open and a deep purple glow was coming from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was most odd, for Spyro could distinctively remember Terrador closing it shut and locking it with the clippings. Perhaps what he saw and heard was actually real. Spyro slowly crept into the room, on high-alert if anything came came rushing out of the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he drew closer, he began to hear voices, but all of them were mere whispers, impossible for Spyro to decipher, but he heard occasionally words such as \"It's him\", \"Vengeance at last\", and \"Come to me\". It sent chills down the purple dragon's spine and he got the feeling that he was being watched. He peered into the case and saw that the gem didn't look at all normal; strange purple, red and black smoke was swirling inside it, and the gem was throbbing like a heartbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro, like Terrador earlier, suddenly felt the urge to touch it, like it was calling to him, begging him to make contact. But, unfortunately, Spyro was not as willful as the earth guardian and fell for the Gem's power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few things happened at ones when Spyro touched the Gem: a ominous shudder went through, a blast of wind blew in his face, a cold laughter full of malice rang in the air, and the Gem lit up and raised into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, Spyro pulled back his paw, but he found that it was stuck to the object. No, It was stuck INSIDE the gem. It was sucking him in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith cold fear filling his insides, Spyro desperately tried to pull his paw free, but to no avail. With one furious tuck, Spyro was completely swallowed up by the gem, his last terrified scream echoing off the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash the Gem turned back to normal, its color turning back to white. It sat itself down, and the case closed shut, locking itself with its clippings.</span></div></div>",

The place he was in looked like something out of an abstract painting. Color blended in the skies with a confusing splash of greens and golds, but purple seemed to be the most predominant color. The ground too mimicked the coloring of the sky, though it had the difference of being shiny. In fact all the ground and structures all around Spyro looked to be made of crystal. And there were structures. It was hard to pick out against the splatters of colors that dominated the landscape as they blended with it, but there were buildings and pillars in places. Some upright, some partially destroyed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's a city...\" Spyro marveled as he stood up, looking around at the buildings, \"What's left of one anyway.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Very astute of you to notice young dragon.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Spyro's blood ran cold as he recognized that voice.

Well, sort of.\" The figure emerged from around the side of the building and Spyro blanched. The big dragon was no longer all organic. The left half of his face, right front leg, and left wing appeared to be crystal like everything else in the world. \"As you can see since our last little encounter I've experienced a few... 'changes'.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But how...?,\" Spyro braced for any possible attack, \"We left you...\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"...Trapped in a giant crystal in the core of the planet?\" Malefor finished as he slowly approached, \"True, but it turns out that crystal is quite the magical item. The remains of our breed of purple dragons. A powerful magical item and a failed experiment. An attempt to contain the remnants of their race. In a way it's both our legacy and our afterlife.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Afterlife?\" Spyro asked looking around carefully, trying to look for any possible way out.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes, when a purple dragon dies this is where our spirits end up. You and I however are quite alive in this world, having been brought here body and soul.

It's like a small window into this larger realm inside, through which I was able to bring you here.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He strode forward, eyes locking with Spyros, \"You see, I've been doing a lot of thinking since you trapped me here.

I tried that when we fought and I learned making you fight just makes you stronger.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He began to circle Spyro at a distance, like a wild animal preparing to pounce, \"That's why I've had to get more creative.

Malefor heaved a sigh, \"So we're doing it the hard way huh?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Spyro ran and ran, ducking around columns, swing around ruined fountains, and gliding over piles of rubble. And yet he heard no footfalls behind him, no noise of Malefor chasing him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He slowed and turned to look behind him, but saw no sign of the dark dragon.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This really is boring you know.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Spyro yelped and turned to find Malefor in front of him and scrambled back the way he had come. Five minutes of running later Spyro slowed to a stop, panting and heaving.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You can't get away you know,\" Malefor smirked as Spyro jumped up again and made to run but tripped over his own feet, \"We're inside the gems world. You can run and run but you might as well be just a few feet away from me for all the good it does.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So I can't get away?\" Spyro puffed, \"Fine. Then I'll fight you here and now!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gathering his strength Spyro tried to launch an earth based attack at Malefor but found the magic did nothing. He tried again, this time with ice. This one worked but did little more than form a few ice shards. Electricity just fizzled and dissipated like static cling. And fire barely left a scorch mark. All the while Malefor just stood there and watched Spyro's attempts with mild boredom.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally with no choice left, Spyro tried the darkness attack he'd learned and that got a raised eyebrow from Malefor... moments before the purple beam of energy smashed him to pieces. For a moment Spyro wondered if he'd done it, only to have the big dragon reappear around a corner.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I told you Spyro,\" he stated casually, \"this world is not like our reality. Your powers will have little effect here.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Still Spyro tried to smash him with the energy.

Good,\" Malefor smiled down at the struggling Dragon, \"Now the fun can begin.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With a wave of his clawed hand the landscape around them changed, resolving into the familiar look of the guardians temple. \"A far more comfortable setting for this, I believe,\" the dark dragon grinned at the still panting Spyro, \"Now. Let's get this party started...\" He waved his hand again and a large table appeared, loaded with everything from BBQ pork, to cooked sheep, to goblets of rich cream mixed with honey. Spyro wanted none of it but his throat was dry and the smells made his stomach rumble.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Dig in Spyro,\" Malefor smiled, \"I'm giving you this one chance.

He sat down in a chair, which had ample room, and began to nibble on a steak, thinking of a way out of his silly situation. Maybe if he...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat like you're hungry, dammit!\" Malefor roared in Spyro's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe recoiled, staring with shock at the much larger dragon, who was giving him a intimidating frown, towering over him. Spyro had to admit that he was a little afraid, so he did what was demanded. He began to quicken his eating pace, taking big bites of the steak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro's eyes widened, surprised. It tasted magnificent, better than anything he had ever eaten. But little did he know that the food was tampered, enhanced with magic to make it delicious and addictive, and with the first bite Spyro was already hooked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis primitive mind began to take hold, and he grabbed the meats and sweets, stuffing his mouth full and washing it down, not caring that he was covering his paws and face full of grease and sticky cake batter. With a grin Malefor watched Spyro greedily gorge at the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was truly making a pig of himself. When Spyro, after a while, returned to his senses, he was caught by a overwhelming feeling of fatigue. He leaned back into the chair, groaning with discomfort. He had a terrible stomach ache, and when he looked he winched at what he found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly was bloated, a sphere of yellow bands and purple scales, bigger than a beach ball. Spyro never knew that it was physically possible to inflate a stomach to such a size. In fact, it wasn't really. His stomach was only inches away from exploding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA red tint was visible on the surface of his purple scales, veins running all over it. Spyro touched it, feeling how his skin was as taut as a balloon. He could hear It gurgle and groan. He looked at his paws, which was covered in food. He looked at the table, which was smeared with it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was shocked. He had far better eating habits than this. What the hell happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoyed your meal?\" Malefor whispered into his ear. \"Why don't you eat more? There's still plenty left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro knew he couldn't fight him, especially in this state, so he resorted to begging. \"Please, mercy. If I eat anymore I'll explode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mercy you ask?\" Malefor said, pleased that he managed to break his nemesis so easy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed a claw to his chin, pretending that he was considering Spyro's plea. \"I guess I could,\" he said with a sly grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snapped his claw, and Spyro's bulging belly began to reside... and the rest of his figure filled out. His limbs and neck grew thicker, his face grew rounder, and when his stomach resided, his belly was still sticking in front of him. Spyro was now noticeably chubby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple dragon was horrified at what happened to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's continue,\" Malefor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table ones again filled with food.

One way or another.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was a click and the piston moved up, wrenching Spyros jaws open. At the same time a piston in front of him pushed a large cupcake into his mouth before retracting as the piston came down again. It moved up and down several times before another push shoved the mushed mass right down his throat. Spyro coughed but the next up stroke filled his mouth with another cake and again he only had a few chews before it was pushed down his throat.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You can make this so much easier but just giving in at any time you know,\" Malfor muttered.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\" 'Uck 'oo,\" Spyro managed in a brief moment when his mouth was open and clear.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And so it went. The machine never moved so fast Spyro risked choking, but neither did it stop. Occasionally a splash of something drink worthy was thrown down his throat and half the time dribbled out his jaws. Time fast lost all meaning. Spyro tried to keep count of the food he was being stuffed with but after five hundred and thirty-nine dishes he began to lose track. It was amazing he hadn't burst.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That wasn't to say Spyro hadn't changed at all. His belly under him had stretched and swelled, beginning to gradually lift his rear end off the table. His forelegs were kept wide apart which left his chest and chin pressed tight to the wood, so his stomach was forced back as it grew bigger with all the sweets it held.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Malfor watched with a smile as Spyro's figure expanded. The wide bands of golden scales across his middle stretched for a time thanks to his youth, but soon they began to separate as pink bands of leathery flesh squeezed between them as his middle grew. Malfor couldn't help tracing his crystal claw gently over the sensitive skin in amazement. He was going to be a pig, one way or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Spyro eats and eats and eats...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Malfor pauses the feeding to rearrange things and make stuffing Spyro easier as well as give him another chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Something else.</span></div></div>",

All the food rapidly filling his middle must be painful, and his maw must be clamped shut very hard around the nozzle that was feeding him. He had to switch his position soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter watching Spyro's belly reach the size of a beach ball, Malefor snapped his fingers and the purple dragon found himself lying on his back, his bulging belly high in the air. His legs were still bound and the nozzle still around his maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalefor approached him, the food that was forcing its way down Spyro's throat stopping suddenly, and the dark purple dragon released the nozzle from his maw. The purple dragon gasped, as if he was holding in his breath for a long, which was what he was doing all along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could speak, a tremendously loud belch ripped through his mouth, which continued for a few seconds before ending with a squeak. Spyro lay there, panting, while Malefor rubbed his massively bloated stomach, which felt like absolute bliss to the purple dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let loose another healthy belch to show his pleasure, his tongue lolling out of his mouth, and Malefor couldn't help but chuckle at this gluttonous sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Spyro, had enough?\" he asked with a grin, \"Will you now comply with my wishes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what...do *Urp!* you want...from me?\" Spyro said, panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple,\" said Malefor, \"Although I'll like to see you fattened up to immobility, I also want to escape from the prison. But the only way I'm going to do that is to have someone else stay behind to take me place. That person must, of course, be a purple dragon, and you fit excellently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro barred his teeth angrily. \"No!\" he exclaimed, struggling against his bonds, \"I'll never stay here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalefor shrugged. \"Alright then,\" he said, \"Suite yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lowered the nozzle and Spyro's eyes widened in fear, remembering all too well how unpleasant it felt being force-fed. \"No, please,\" he suddenly cried in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please?\" Malefor said, another sinister grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm going t-to burst i-if I drink anymore,\" stuttered Spyro, \"I-I can't, please, no more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, young one, I won't, but only if you live up to our agreement,\" said Malefor, \"So, what do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro bit his lower lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXxxX <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was morning back in the real world. Through the large windows the sun's rays illuminated the Guardians' Chamber. On the pedestal the Gem stood, motionless, but suddenly it began to wobble violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt lit up brightly and shot out something very large, the force sending the Gem flying back and sliding across the floor for several feet. The large figure it shot out stood up, smoking a little, rubbing his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he regained his composure, Malefor looked at his surroundings and beamed. Never in his life had he felt so happy. He wanted to do a silly dance on the spot. But celebration had to wait; Malefor had worked to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe threw a last glance to the Gem, where Spyro was trapped inside, before making his way out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had searched throughout the temple, his enthusiasm slowly waning in the process as he checked every deserted room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he made his way down to the corridor that led to the mess hall, his glass leg clanging against the floor, frowning to himself and growing more impatient by the minute, he suddenly heard voices. Grinning to himself, following the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found the main entrance clogged with young dragon, all who looked very worried. Curious himself, and deciding that it wouldn't be best to scare them, he summoned his dark powers and wrapped himself in shadow, making him invisible to the naked eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragons cried out as they were shoved aside by some unseen force as Malefor made his way to the front. What he found in the mess hall was startling. The moles were running around frantically, sweat running down their foreheads, disappearing with empty platters into the kitchen and re-appearing with ridiculously full ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were all tending to four extremely fat dragons, who were verging on immobility, covered in food, and eating like pigs. Though their features were greatly distorted by their astonishing weight gain, Malefor could tell who they were: Cynder, Terrador, Cyril and Volteer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the largest, Terrador towered over the others, his belly lifting him off the ground. Cyril had butt cheeks that seemed to dwarf his other fatty body parts. Volteer had a chest that stuck out before him like a massive bed, his head being swallowed by his back fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast butt no least was Cynder, who, like Cyril, had a massive rump and a wide, drooping tail that resembled that of a massive, black and crimson slug. Her choker around her neck and braces around her ankles had snapped off some time ago, and her braces around her tail was about to do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, with a loud \"ping!\", it shot off, freeing her tail, which was squeezed by it like an over inflated blood cuff. The floor was messy with sticky cake batter, grease, bones and shatters plates. But the morbidly obese dragons didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing that mattered to them was cramming more food into their bottomless stomachs. Other Guardians were standing around them, looking just as worried as the dragons that clogged the doorway, speaking to one another urgently, trying to figure out what caused this and how to fix it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalefor was shocked but then he remembered that he caused this, a thought that made him smile wickedly to himself. He had cursed the Gem so that anyone who came in contact with it would suffer from a steady weight gain and a unsatisfying hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was his way to knock two birds down with one stone. Malefor chuckled evilly to himself.</span></div></div>",

The Gem inside began to light up and out Spyro's body erupted like a geyser. He fell to the floor with a hard thud, where he lied lifeless for a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro began to stir, his limbs twitching to life. He groaned as he sat up, rubbing his head, and observed the room around him. An uncharacteristic evil smile grew on his face before he chuckled menacingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Free,\" he muttered, \"I'm finally free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs most of you would have already guessed, Spyro was not in control of his own body anymore, but Malefor was. He was possessed by the Dark Lord when he was sucked into the Gem, but that didn't mean he was dead now. Somewhere, inside the purple dragon's mind, Spyro's conscious still endured, suppressed by Malefor's cruel power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dark Lord could feel and hear the purple dragon's distress faintly, like a prisoner banging on the door of his cell, demanding, begging to be freed. But Malefor had other plans. He could finally take out his vengeance on those that rebelled against and defeated him, but he had to wait, unfortunately, for his new body was far too small and weak for such things. But that would soon change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalefor examined himself in one of the mirrors in the chamber. He looked every inch like Spyro, though he had to admit that his eyes had a slight yellow tint to it. But that was no problem. He just had to hide it long enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExiting the chamber, he strolled down the hallway, enjoying the feeling of being mobile again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut suddenly he heard a voice behind him...</span></div></div>",

The beating became louder and more frequent, echoing off the walls of the chamber, until it shot out a beam into the air, smashing against the roof but not breaking through the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTentacle-like smoke began to dance about the room, bathing the wall in a ominously green color.

She looked passed, perhaps trying to identify on what part of her body it was coming from, but what she saw past Ember made Cynder's eyes widen in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let go of me! Let go of me!\" the pink dragoness shrieked, breaking free of Spyro's hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's her problem?\" Spyro said, more to himself than Cynder, watching as Ember ran awkwardly down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could have sworn he saw something dripping between her legs, her hips and thighs looking thicker than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned back to Cynder and saw that the dragoness was staring blankly ahead of her, her mouth open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, Cynder,\" asked Spyro, concerned, \"What are you looking at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she didn't answer, Spyro decided to follow her gaze, but what he saw made his expression shift to that similar to Cynder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore them laid a scene of turmoil: dragons of all ages and gender ran around with swollen privates, engaging in sexual intercourse or trying to please themselves solo, their juices forming puddles on the well-polished floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe males had tools that could rival horses, testicles as large as small coconuts, and the females had large sacks drooping between their legs (which Spyro guessed was their womanhood), their thighs and rears expanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was not all: some of the dragons looked like they were shifting genders! Some of the dragonesses had members growing from their vaginas, their clitoris transforming into a penis and their feminine lips into balls, their forms growing taller and more muscular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe exact opposite was happening to some males, their prides shrinking away, much to their dismay, transforming into cunts, their forms growing more sleek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro and Cynder stood there in the hallway in complete shock, but it mad itself clear that they were standing there far too long, for they began to draw some unwanted attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome began to notice them, and the pent-up dragons grinned when they saw that new \"competitors\" had decided to join the game, or that's what it looked like to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro was the first to break out of his trance, noticing the few dragons approaching him and Cynder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Knowing what would happen if they were captured, the purple dragon yelled: \"Run!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed Cynder and pulled her down the steps, breaking her too out of her trance. Spyro could hear angry snarls from above and paws dashing across the tiles, and he knew that they were hot on their tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey luckily made it to the bottom. They closed the heavy wooden door that opened up to the steps, locking it just when they saw the dragons running down the steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was heavy thuds against it, angry roars, shouts, and growls. Even though the crazed dragons were sealed off, it was, Spyro knew, a false sense of security, for there was still a chance that they could use their elements to break or burn down the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to move, now!\" Spyro commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder knew from the tone of his voice that the purple dragon wasn't playing around and he didn't want any arguments. She followed him obediently and swiftly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ran until they reached the gardens outside.

It's even better that you and Cynder have not been inflicted by the Gem's wrath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Spyro asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, I forgot,\" Volteer said, \"You two probably do not know of the revelation that is happening in the upper part of the complex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" Cynder said, cutting Volteer off, \"We do know what's happening. We saw it when we went to investigate the noises.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did!?\" Volteer said with alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro and Cynder recoiled, and the purple dragon said: \"Yes, we did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And do you feel strange in any way?\" Volteer asked, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro and Cynder looked at each other, not sure where the yellow and blue dragon was going with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, no,\" Spyro said slowly, \"I don't feel strange. Do you, Cynder?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black dragoness shook her head. \"No, not really,\" Cynder said, though, she was feeling a slight tingle in her lions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolteer lapsed into silence, his paw resting on his chin, in deep thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the yellow dragon was silent for too long, Spyro decided to ask. \"Volteer,\" the purple dragon said, \"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Electric Guardian gave a say, then said, \"I will tell you, young ones, but it's a long story, and if you cared to hear you best make yourself comfortable, for it is a long story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did as Volteer suggested, climbing on a nearby stone bench, and the yellow dragon began with his story:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was strolling down the hallway to get a drink of water, for my throat was dry after I had a long argument with Cyril about the Gem's identity. But while I was walking, I felt a disturbance in the air. Now, you know, Spyro, that us Electric dragons can sense when there is a shift in the electrons in the air, thus we can calculate if there's danger ahead, and that is how I knew not to proceed onwards, for my instincts were warning me, cautioning me, begging me not to continue. It was then that I saw strange green, wispy smoke snaking down the hallways, ominous and alien, which was coming from the Guardians' Chamber where the Gem was held, and I was filled with a sense of extreme dread. I bolted, running towards the nearest window, which was big enough to accommodate my size, spread my wings, and flew away, landing in this garden. My first thoughts were, \"Volteer, you paranoid old fool! Why did you go and do such a silly thing?\" But it was then that I heard screaming inside. Alarmed, I went to investigate, though, I still did not enter the temple, for my instincts were holding me back. Instead, I flew up again and looked through a window into the hallway and saw the obscene actions taking place inside. It would seem that the Gem is skyrocket any dragon's libidos and morphing them in strange ways. I was shocked and now I'm in this garden, wandering what to make of this strange situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro and Cynder was stunned, not sure what to say, but then the purple dragon spoke: \"What are we going to do, Volteer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple,\" answered the yellow dragon, \"You two need to go in there and retrieve the Gem and take it as far away as you can from the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro and Cynder were shocked at his blunt request, and the black dragoness cried: \"That's insane! We can't do that! We'll end up like those dragons inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" Volteer said,\" You two can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro frowned. \"And how is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's also simple,\" Volteer said, \"When you two told me that you two went up to the upper levels that is contaminated with the Gem's power, and that you returned without being infected yourself, for it has a almost immediate effect, it had me thinking. It seems that you young dragons have magic that is resisting the Gem's power. This means that you two are immune to it and can carry it away safely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O,\" Spyro and Cynder said, drawing out the \"o\" word, now understanding what Volteer meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But wait,\" Cynder said, \"If we take away the Gem from this place, won't everyone turn back to normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolteer shook his head. \"I do not know, Cynder,\" he said, \"Perhaps it would, then everything would be alright. But if it's not, then we have a crisis on our paws, and I will have to quarantine this whole building. Let us hope that when the magic is gone everything would turn back to the way it was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then,\" said Spyro, standing up, \"Let's get moving then. The situation isn't going to get any better while we sit here. You coming, Cynder?...Cynder?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro was struggling to get the black dragoness' attention, for she was staring at the ground. Her mind was drifting away to dirty thought, imagining her sucking on Spyro's purple length, causing the tingling sensation to grow worse in her privates, but luckily the purple dragon broke her out of her daydreaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, sorry, Spyro,\" said Cynder, realizing that she was awkwardly silent, \"I was just deep in though, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro lifted a scaly eyebrow, but he decided not to press the matter any further. \"Alright then,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple dragon spread his wings, taking off into the air with Cynder in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The best of luck to you, young ones,\" said Volteer, watching them leave.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Only... was it Spyro? Something was wrong. As Cynder watched the wet crunching sounds came from the purple dragon as his clawed feet increased in size, growing longer and more wicked looking. New spikes sprouted from his elbows and knees, another set burst from his shoulders as the dragon grunted with pain. His back humped up as it swelled with muscle and the ridge down his spine grew more pointed and sharp.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Spyro's eyes glowed with a blue-white light as he grit his teeth. His lower jaw suddenly jutted forward, his two lower canine fangs sprouting up into a pair of tusks. Another set of horns grew on his head curling around the sides and his whole form seemed to swell in size and muscle as this more monstrous look continued to take hold.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cynder could only watch in slack-jawed horror as the cut friendly, somewhat handsome dragon she knew continued to turn into a hulking beast.

It was rearing on its hind legs, its mouth open in what seemed to be a silent roar of triumph. In the sun the statue glowed, casting bright, yellow rays in all directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" Cynder said, astonished, \"I've never seen a thing like this. Have you, Spyro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple dragon shook his head. \"Never in my life,\" he answered. \"I wonder why it's here, though, and what's it meant for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two dragons decided to examine it further from a closer view, so they approached the dragon statue. It was large, bigger than Spyro and Cynder combined, and it rested on a slab of concrete. Around the edges, Spyro saw, were strange writing of some unknown language. Try as they might, Both he and Cynder could not decipher the letters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps we should take it to the guardians,\" Spyro suggested, \"Maybe they might know what it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you nuts?\" Cynder said, \"This thing is huge. I'm not carrying it. Besides, it's fixed to the ground. If we want to find out what it is we have to bring the elders here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Warfang is a couple of miles away,\" Spyro argued, \"If we leave now we won't be able to find the island again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess we have to leave the statue be,\" said Cynder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we should,\" said Spyro disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as they were just about to leave, Spyro, who was walking across the concrete, suddenly, completely unaware to him, stepped on a strange stone on the pavement.

Spyro and Cynder looked down this path, wondering where to it lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we go down?\" Spyro asked. He was very curious, but he also felt threatened by the gloom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can,\" said Cynder, \"But we're gonna need some light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry; I'm on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalling upon the element of fire, Spyro's scales began to glow a deep purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neat trick,\" Cynder complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing,\" Spyro, \"Learned it a while ago, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod, both dragons descended down the stairs, Spyro in the lead, illuminating the way.</span></div></div>",

They walked past strange machinery, trying their best not to trip over their pipes and electrical cords that ran from them. They wandered in the darkness until Spyro spotted a switch that had the words \"power\" written above it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling it up, lights began to flicker all across the room and machines turned on with a humm. They discovered that they were inside a laboratory, which stretch on for quite a distance, but it looked like it had been abandoned for years. Cobwebs, scattered paper, and rusted tools were everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like we found a lab,\" said Spyro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya think,\" said Cynder with playful sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey explored the lab further, investigating machines, reading papers, trying to figure out what all this was meant for.

But when he turned around, he saw that the black dragoness had vanished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis echoing call went completely unnoticed by Cynder as the black dragoness trotted by shelves stacked with bottles containing strange liquid. Taking one down, Cynder gave the bottle a sniff. The smell was sweet yet very strong. A strange curiosity overcame her and Cynder found that she was taking a sip of the potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Spyro was searching for Cynder, looking left and right. But he suddenly saw a very peculiar machine standing only a few feet away. It looked like a giant ray-gun. It was pointing to a \"X\" that was marked on the ground. Curious, Spyro went over go examine the machine.</span></div></div>",

And, of course, there was books, lots of books; they all varied in size, ranging from scrolls and pamphlets to tombs so large that Cynder speculated that even a grown dragon would be left huffing and puffing if he or she had to carry such a burden. But the place seemed largely neglected: cobwebs and dust were everywhere, hanging on shelves and covering books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro would have liked to compare this library to the Chronicler's lair, but it lacked in half the size, and it didn't have the enormous, glowing hourglass in its center: instead there was a elegant wooden stand, which looked like it was created by a skilled wood carver. On the stand lied the biggest book, so large that it dwarfed the huge tombs, that Spyro and Cynder had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, the two dragons decided to examine the book. Hardened wax were stained all across the pages that had dripped from candles nearby. They were still in a functioning order, which was a good thing, for Spyro's chest was beginning to ache due to the swirling fires in his body. He lit a few with the same element before he extinguished it inside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with the pages lit, Spyro and Cynder saw, to their dismay, that they were written on with the language of the dragons of old, which was, at least for them, hard to decipher. It made them regret for not listening when the guardians lectured them about their history. Luckily Spyro had some knowledge about the words, for he payed more attention in classes than Cynder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquinting his eyes in the dim light, he made out the words \"spell\", \"transformation\", and \"growth\". He could also pronounce the words, though, but he didn't know what he was saying at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I should try one out,\" said Spyro, mouthing the words silently to make sure he would say it right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't sound like a very good idea, Spyro,\" said Cynder, \"We have no idea what could happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Spyro was not swayed by the black dragoness's warning. \"There is only one way to find out.\" And with that said, Spyro began to read the words, his voice sounding odd as he spoke the ancient words.</span></div></div>",

Her whole body shook as her tendons twitched and shook with energy. It felt like it was building to something. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Suddenly a loud pop got her attention. Staring cross-eyed at her snout Cynder gaped as her nose had suddenly ballooned to twice the size of her head. Another lout pop followed a moment later and she yelped almost falling off the stand with the book. As she looked back she saw her back legs were three times as far back than they should have been her whole middle torso greatly elongated. Still another pop followed and Cynder lifted her clawed hands to see they'd grown to the size of dinner plates.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She tried again to yell for Spyro to stop but before she could another pop sounded and her tongue rolled out of her mouth, at least as long as her whole body used to be. The pops were coming faster now as a pair came right after each other, enlarging her eyes one at a time. And another pop grew her fangs down long enough to touch her chest before another grew her neck out longer than a giraffes. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cynder whimpered as the changes didn't seem to be stopping as she was stretched and enlarged in various ways. Soon she became too large to stand on the same wooden stand as the book and fell to the floor. Fortunately by then it wasn't far to fall for her bigger size. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As the spell continued she was glad to see she was gradually equalizing again, however some parts still refused to stay with the rest of her like her horns growing to twice the length they should have been and her lower lip was bulging in a permanent pout against her fangs. Her rear end also seemed larger, but that seemed a bonus of sorts.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally it seemed Spyro reached the end of the spell. Whatever trance it had on him was broken and he looked around, then yelped when he saw Cynder looking down at him, her head the size of a small cottage to his view point. She had to be two or three times the size of Terrador at least.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Maybe in the future you should think before just reading a spell aloud to see what it does?\" she suggested and Spyro chuckled nervously, \"Now, are you going to find a way to get me back to normal or am I going to have to try it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Spyro tries another spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Cynder has a go of reading the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: They find something unexpected.</span></div></div>",

One of the books on the shelves caught her eye and she reached up with her new size to give it a tug. However, the book would not budge and instead a loud click was heard as a section of the wall slid away.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Spyro looked up to see what she'd found and the pair gaped at the room beyond. It was as big as the library but contained one single book on a slanted stand. However the book was <i>enormous</i>.

And Spyro was smaller than the protective metal corners on the cover of the binding.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Aside from the sheer size of it though the most fascinating thing about it was that it seemed to be filling in as they watched. At the moment the book was open and one page was full but the other appeared to be half-full, lines of tiny text no bigger than normal handwriting scrawling across the page. And as they watched for several minutes the page slowly filled in. And then with a sound like a great sail turning in the wind, the page flipped and the next completely blank page began to fill.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Curiosity drew the pair forward and Spuro flew up to read what he could. The text was in some form he couldn't understand, and yet as he looked the letters seemed to reshape themselves into the common language.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Spyro read from the book at the top of the page. \" 'It was about this time when Spyro and Cynder discovered the Tome of Time. The most powerful magical book in all of existence. The greatest power to exist in the world before them.

I think this is the Tome of Time like it said,\" Spyro marveled, \"The Chronicler once told me that he had books that recorded all of history, that filled in as events happened. But all of them were just pale copies of the original. This must be it. THE Book of Time. It's recording everything that's happening as it happens.

As much as the purple dragon wanted to change his colossal friend back to her former self, he wasn't sure, with a book of such immense power, could possibly do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to start small, Spyro, taking a ink pot and a quill from a nearby drawer, wrote the following at the bottom of the page: \"And then a cake dropped from the sky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSPLATE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of seemingly nowhere a chocolate cake materialized and came crashing to the floor, frosting and bread scattering everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Cynder said, \"Now that we know that it works, can you PLEASE change me back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright,\" Spyro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the purple dragon wrote: \"Cynder transformed back into her former size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effects were almost instant: thirst Cynder's head shrank, then her limbs, then her tail, then her body, retracting with such speed that when it was finished Cynder was left spinning in the air a few times before she fell to the floor with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynder!\" Spyro cried, rushing towards her, helping the dragoness up, \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" she said, rubbing her head, \"I'm back to normal; that's all that matters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, she was back to her former size, but Spyro had to admit that her rump looked still a little too large. But all and all, she was back to her former size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should go tell the guardians about this place,\" Cynder suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro nodded, but his eyes drifted back to the Book and a strange urge tucked at his mind to try writing more stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does the purple dragon decide on doing?</span></div></div>",

He seemed t have a lot of ideas of what he <i>could</i> do with such power, and yet so many he dismissed outright.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She he write that he ruled the world? No, the planet was fine as it was and who would want the headache of making decisions that affected every being on the planet. He could make himself fabulously wealthy. But why do that when there wasn't much he wanted to own? Dragon hoards and some good books were nice, but buying everything seemed silly. Strength and power? Perhaps the most tempting but also the most concern worthy. That was what Malefore desired and Spyro would sooner jump off a cliff with a boulder tied to his tail than follow in the footsteps of that monster.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For all the unanswered questions though Spyro was starting to form a more rational idea of what he should write by the time the temple came in sight. He could write some nice things for himself certainly and there were a few moderately selfish desires he might indulge in, but he also had the power to make the world better. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When they landed Spyro excused himself briefly for a 'bathroom break' but really he planned to write his first groundbreaking message on the paper. Slipping off down the hall to his room, he moved up to the barely used writing desk and dug out a quill. He already knew what his first decision would be. He'd been feeling his stomach grumbling most of the way back, eager for food. So, picking up the quill and writing as small and as legibly as he could, he wrote <i>From here on no being on this planet will ever become hungry again.</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Spyro felt a tingle run through his body as it worked. The sensation of hunger soon passed and felt content and comfortable, as though he'd just had a moderate sized meal. With a smile Spyro tucked the piece of paper into the back of one of the books on his desk for safe keeping and then returned to join Cynder.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What Spyro wasn't aware of however was <i>why</i> he was no longer hungry. Whole food had simply appeared in his stomach to to be digested and as it was slowly over the next few hours more food would fill his stomach. In essence it was as if the dragon and everyone else effected were eating 24/7. What's more, each time the food appeared in their stomachs it stretched them ever so slightly bigger, so more food would be needed to fill the space the next time.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Spyro had essentially started a world wide endless fest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: A couple days later. The first signs something is wrong begin to show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: A couple weeks later. Everyone is starting to get really heavy and wondering what's going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: A month or so later. Everyone is seriously fat and desperately looking for a solution.</span></div></div>",

At the back of the hall was a spinning propeller, which was making noises that resembled that of a train, but with a much lower volume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro immediately recognized the machine: it was a blimp. The purple dragon raised his eyebrow in surprise. Now what could a blimp be doing out here? It didn't look in any way hostile, but it was heading straight towards the cave he and Cynder resided in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro dashed off towards the black dragoness's sleeping form and began nudging her, trying to wake her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, Spyro?\" Cynder finally asked, yawning and stretching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to see this!\" Spyro said quickly, already running towards the entrance of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder snorted but got up and followed her friend. The blimp was much closer now, and Spyro could make out the drivers of the aircraft: the first was a badger, judging from his black and white fur, and the other was a mole, who wore a pair of spectacles that magnified his eyes to a comical proportion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder, who had also seen the blimp now, waved a paw at the critters, receiving a wave in return from the badger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahoy there,\" cried Spyro. He presumed that it was the correct words to use, for they were flying on something that looked like a ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahoy there to you too,\" shouted the badger in a surprisingly deep voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we help you in any way?\" said Spyro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you can,\" answered the badger, \"We need a landing spot to make repairs, and your cave will do just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was indeed true; the cave had a large cliff that could serve has a landing sight for the blimp and still have room to spare, and the propeller, Spyro noticed, was making strange coughing sounds, black smoke erupting from it with each cough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two dragons cleared the way as the machine touched down on the flat earth, and the mole and the badger used a ladder to climb off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We thank you greatly,\" the badger said, holding out one of his paws, \"My name is Martin, and that's my assistant, Sam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro took Martin's paw in greeting, saying: \"It's a pleasure meeting you. My name's Spyro and this is my friend Cynder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin's eyes widened in surprise. \"THE Spyro and Cynder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe badger suddenly gave a bow a gestured Sam do do the same. Both dragons felt a little embarrassed by the praise they were receiving, but it was only natural in their case.

It's just a little weird that anyone would be up here to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" agreed Martin, \"But we're here to search for treasure located somewhere in one of the islands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro and Cynder's eyes widened when they heard this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" continued the badger, \"at least I am.

Busted my rudder when a island came smashing into it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can be maped,\" the mole suddenly said. His voice sounded young but not child-like. \"You just have to give the most prominent islands names and chart them, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say,\" said Martin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they exchanged their greetings and got to know each other better, they made camp inside the cave for the night. Spyro would have went out to hunt some food for them, but Martin had everything he needed in the cargo of his ship: dried fruits and vegetables, wood, matches, and other important equipment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating a good meal with each other, Sam, Spyro and Cynder went to bed. But Martin stayed a long while up, repairing his broken rudder, but he was having success, for he had much experience with machines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the next morning the blimp was in functioning condition again and ready to fly.

Are you shtill there?\" Cynder asked.<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, I'm still here.\" Slurp responded as he put a paw on Cynder's stomach. <br>\r\nSuddenly, they both heard a voice in the hall they were just at that lead to the machine say \"I swear, I heard the machine go off!\"<br>\r\nSpyro and Cynder both looked at the entrance as two people appeared, one was a small orange mouse with green patches all over it's body and another was a male satyr who was wearing a purple lab coat with various stains on it.<br>\r\nThe newcomers stared at Spyro and looked up at the moaning cynder, and looked back at Slurp.<br>\r\n\"Did she chew a gum from this machine?\" The satyr asked.<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, but who are you?\" Spyro asked.<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry,\" the satyr apologized \"I'm Danny, and this is my friend, Skit.\" He said as he pointed to the mouse.<br>\r\n\"Jeeze, I never saw anyone swell up that much before.\" Skit said as he jumped on Cynder's stomach.<br>\r\n\"Shpyro? Whatsh going on?\" Cynder moaned.<br>\r\n\"Oh, dear, we better roll her quickly!\" Danny said as he rushed to Cynder's side and started to push her.<br>\r\n\"HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!\" Spyro shouted.<br>\r\n\"We have to roll her to the juicing room before it's too late.\"Skit answered as he, too began to push.<br>\r\n\"Wait, 'juicing room'?! What kind of place is this?\" Spyro asked.<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Danny grunted as he kept on pushing cynder with no success, \"This is my secret lab where I create food for those that can't afford any. The gum this dragon chewed was ment to provide a 3 course meal for the poor, but, alas, every time it gets to the dessert, the test subjects either become a water balloon full of blueberry juice, become a blueberry, or gain insane amounts of weight, just like this one.\"<br>\r\nSpyro just stared at the satyr, trying to process the information. It sounded like a story, but the satyr looked like he was telling the truth.<br>\r\n\"So, you guys are trying to make food?\"Spyro asked.<br>\r\n\"Now is not the time for questions! She must be rolled to the juicing room at once!\" Skit said.<br>\r\nAlmost as though Spyro had a fire lit under him, he quickly ran to where Skit and Danny were and started to push, this time causing Cynder to roll on her back with her still moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like an hour of rolling Cynder down hallways, they stopped at a fork in the hall.<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, skit? Where are the signs?\" Danny asked.<br>\r\n\"I don't know... Maybe they were stolen...\" Skit said sheepishly.<br>\r\n\"Well, one of these hallways must lead to the juicing room.\" Spyro said.<br>\r\nThey all looked at the halls, and they decide to go down the....</span></div></div>",

He looked around, trying to locate where the sound had come from, hoping that it was Cynder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the largest pile of gold, located in the furthest corner, Spyro saw a black figure sitting on its summit, throwing coins in the air, which sparkled and jingled softly together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro began to ran towards the black shape, shouting: \"Cynder!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure seemed to stop with its activity and looked in his direction. \"Spyro!\" came a feint voice, and the purple dragon knew immediately that he had finally located his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynder!\" he shouted again, \"Stay where you are; I'm coming to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black dragoness was smiling when Spyro arrived, perched on top of her pile of wealth, and how she glittered! She wore a diamond and silver tiara on her head, a necklace made only of rubies and gold, dozens of diamond rings adorned her fingers, and she even replaced her regular steel choker and bracelets for platinum ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro grinned. \"So,\" he began, \"How does it feel to be on the top of the world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder wiped her brow. \"Kinda hot,\" she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, the black dragoness jumped off, sliding down with a avalanche of gold, rubies, and diamonds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she safely made it below, she lifted one of her paws, showing off her jewelry, saying: \"Like my bling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fantastic,\" Spyro admitted, \"But I think it's best that we leave this place. We have no idea if someone still lives here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ag,\" Cynder groaned, \"Come on Spyro: no one lives here; this place has been abandoned for years!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still,\" Spyro said, \"It feels wrong messing with other people's stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, Spyro,\" she said, her tone sounding oddly frustrated, \"Perhaps I should show you the more \"unique\" treasure I found.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that said, she turned around, gesturing for him to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Spyro do?</span></div></div>",

She also has an hourglass figure, Her slim waist had defined 6 pack abs and restingo or rather topping over them E cup breasts, jigling with each motion or even breath. Wide hips and her butt was also covered in big round muscle. Calf buldged as well giving more curves to her hind legs. Tail was really long.

It was silver, just like her scales, and very long.<br>\r\nShe looked up. Her beautiful blue eyes spotted the dragons interring her study. \"Ah, Spyro, Cynder. It is a pleasure to see you two again,\"Arya said. Her voice was thick with her native southern accent, (something that sounds very close to British.) She custard them to two nearby cushions<br>\r\nThey sat down, and Arya began to address them. \"So, what seems to be the problem?\" she asked. Spyro was about to tell her the story, but Cynder's belly started to growl loudly, answering for him.<br>\r\nArya sighed, saying,\"Stomach problems. I have been getting patients with the same problem.\" Spyro raised a eyebrow. \"Really?\" he said. Arya nodded. \"You have to be the third patient with the same problem,\" she began,\"Now tell me, does your stomach hurt?\" Cynder nodded.<br>\r\nArya took her to a nearby bed she used for examination. After that, she gave Spyro a potion to help Cynder with her stomach problems. \"Remember, two times a day,\" Arya instructed him.<br>\r\nThey gave their thanks, and the mole led them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe potion seemed to take affect. She didn't have stomach pains anymore, but her belly still growled, and her appetite increased everyday. Spyro started to worry about his mate's figure, as it seemed to get bigger as the days passed.</span></div></div>",

Spyro looked at Cynder, it was true, they were both almost a hundred years old (equivalent to 20 human years), and they had been each others mates for close to 70 of those years. But the last couple of years had just been normal day to day life, they hadn't done anything 'fun' in a long time. \"You know what? Your right, I hadn't thought about it\" he said as walked up to her and nuzzled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then walked to the mouth of their cave before looking back at her and asking \"Well, you coming?\" She looked at him questioningly \"To where?\u201d He smiled \"I don't know! let\u2019s just fly somewhere, have some fun!\". Her face lite up almost immediately as she bounded towards him, they both then unfurled their wings and took off into the nearly cloudless sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they flew ,Spyro couldn't help but admire Cynders graceful form flying through the air. Fully grown she looked similar to when she had been under the control of Malefor, but there were some notable difference. First off, her face and head was smoother and just all around kinder looking, she was overall bigger and had a lot more nice curves to her body with a rump that was absolutely to die for! Compared to the absolute stick figure she was before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she wasn't the only one who had grown up to be a fine specimen of a dragon. Spyro was equally as magnificent. He was a full head taller than her, his neck and horns were significantly longer then when he was a child, and his facial features were now even more defined along with a lean muscular frame that just screamed strength and speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they flew Cynder looked down and smiled sadly at a small dragon family with a several young hatchlings, they had discovered shortly after her and spyro had become mates that she was barren, most likely form Malefor\u2019s transformation of her. Spyro notice her expression and and the family on the ground and knew exactly what she was thinking and flew up to her and nuzzled her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continued to fly he saw\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) The ruins of a temple high in the mountains, with a something shining inside (Anthro-ication and/or Genital growth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) A valley filled overflowing with fruit trees (Other transformations)</span></div></div>",

It made Spyro wonder if this temple was really abandoned. It all seem,from the outside,that it was neglected,but from the inside it was well look after.<br>\r\nA sense of unease came over Cynder. \"Spyro,i think we sould leave.\" But Spyro was relucetent. \"O,come on Cynder.

Have it your way,but were only staying for a few minutes and thats it.\" Spyro nodded,feeling pleased that Cynder complaid.<br>\r\nThey started to walk to the center of the room,where they spotted a strange green gem. It floated in mid-air,wich Spyro could only speculate was the work of some strange magic.<br>\r\nCynder stoped where she was. Spyro turned around to look at her. A very worried expression darted her face. \"Come on,Cynder,it's safe,\"he said. \"No,spyro. You go ahead. I don't trust this.\" Spyro only grunted. \"Alright then,scardy cat,\"he mocked,only recieving a low growl from Cynder.<br>\r\nAs Spyro approuced the gem,he felt a strange tingeling feeling wraped itself around Spyro's private area. He ignored it. A strange humming sound filled the room. It was soft at first,but increased in volume.<br>\r\nCynder looked left and right,trying to find the source of the noise. Her eyes finally found it. It came from the gem. Cynder noticed that the ones green gem's colore changed from green,to black,to yellow and,finally,to red. The hole colore changing process repeated itself,casting a glow of many light through the room.<br>\r\nThe humming increased in volume to the point that Cynder felt the temple shook slightly.<br>\r\n\"Spyro,we need to get out of here!,\"Cynder yelled,but Spyro did not respond.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Spyro continued up the temple steps, His slim athletic form swelled and grow stronger and more powerful looking as he walked in his trans-like state. She watched as Spyro's penis grew longer and thicker, though unlike his muscles it seemed to be growing in pulses, probably in time with his heart beat, but it was impossible to tell with it bouncing with his walk from this distance. With each bounce some pre-cum Leaked on the stairs, and the amount seamed to be increasing as Spyro got bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Spyro's penis passed the half way point on his underbelly he stopped and Cynder watched with a growing felling of arousal as Spyro's entire form grew larger. Spyro grunted in what sounded like a mix of arousal and discomfort, It was like a wave passed over him. First his head and jaw lengthened, became more angular and what could be best described and more mature, a groan of what Cynder thought might have been pleasure allowed her to see Spyro's teeth become larger, and sharper as more grew in. Next his neck grew longer and thicker, clicks and pops could be heard as new vertebrae grew in as layer upon layer of new muscle grew in. When the growth reach his shoulders they exploded in size, more then doubling in width with their muscle quadrupling in size. His for Limbs grew longer as they swelled and rippled with more newly grown muscle, as his front paws grew larger and more meaty with his claws leaving noticeable gashes in the stone of the stairs as they grew and he clenched. The scales all over his body seemed to shimmer as they grew tougher and thicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth Continued down Spyro's torso, his form continuing to bulk up and swell with seemingly never ending amounts of muscle, his torso lengthened as his rock hard underbelly went from smooth to having a 6-pack before the number of \"packs\" quickly grew more numerous. His wings shot out to over 8 times their previous size fully unfurled, with them thickening with muscle. Even with his new and increasing size it look like he'd probable be able to fly for days while carrying a mountain and not be tired from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the growth reached  his hind quarters, while their muscles got the exact same treatment as his fore Limbs and swelled larger and more powerful, his hips and hind legs didn't grow as long or as wide and his shoulders and fore Limbs, leaving him with a stance similar to that of a gorilla. His Tail got the same treatment as his neck, growing longer and thick. The mace the the end of his tail growing larger an spiked and his spines along his back grew larger and harder. Spyro's penis shot forward, past his shoulders and stopped just short of his head, it continuing to grow thicker as it's pleasure bumps and ribs grew larger and more numerous, it's head swelling and flaring out of exceed Spyro's fist, all the while producing greater and greater amounts of thick and thicker pre-cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs all this happened Cynder was frozen in equal parts fear, Shock, (and a growing sense of arousal). She had just watched her mate, the hero Spyro, the dragon she had know for most of her life, turn into what could only be described as a over-sexualized version of their ancient non-sentient ancestors, and as she watched spyro reach the top of the monument and seemingly bask in what ever energy had transformed him, he was still slowly growing, but only a fraction of the speed we was before the massive surge he had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen at the base of Spyro's penis 2 small lumps developed. It took Cynder a second to realise what they where, they where his balls!  But that shouldn't be possible! A male dragons balls only dropped during mating season to help with their increase in production during the time, and that was still 8 months way! While the couple had \"fun\" like everyone else during mating season, it had been discovered that she had been rendered Barren by Malefor's corruption, but even now she could tell something was different, a heat in her loins unlike any Mating season before ignited when she Spyro's ball's drop and she was flip-flopping on she like it or not, and wheather she should run now or stay and see if Spyro was okay...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Comically small compared to the rest of him, they quickly began to gain in size. They swelled larger, becoming more spherical, as more and larger veins formed to supply them with the blood they needed. As they got bigger the pre-cum Spyro produced became thicker and whiter before it became a slow but constant stream of thick, viscus cum leaving his cock. Spyro had to splay his hind legs slightly to accommodate their increasing size as they hung lower and lower screamingly increasing in weight exponentially, as they swayed from side to side Cynder could hear them gurgling and sloshing as their production sky rocketed. They eventually touched the floor but kept growing until the tops of his balls once again touched the base of his penis, while she didn't think she'd ever be able to move them Cynder doubted that they could hinder Spyro and his now massive muscly bulk in any way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then Spyro's head wiped around to look at Cynder again. While there are still more then enough feature to easily identify him as spyro, his entire visage is now more powerful, more imposing, more... Primal...  His eye's however hadn't changed much, that ever present love for adventure was still there but it seemed to be tempered with a maturity that she had never seen him have before, and even with that it was still filled with with an endless of love... and Lust for her... His gaze seemed to penetrate right into her and she could begin to feel the heat in her loins become a full on inferno, and she could feel a tugging at the base of her mind to get closer to Spyro and the floating Gem. Was this the same felling that drove Spyro to the Gem as well?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter so long Spyro spoke; \"Cynder, you have to come up here and try this!\" he said as he flex every muscle in his body, and swelled even larger as a result. His voice was now much lower and much more masculine. He groaned as his Penis stretched further, his balls continued to plump up as he began to stroke himself with one of his massive front paws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Cynder slowly approaches the gem and Spyro, letting the energy overtake her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Cynder Asks Spyro to come down, they need to talk about this abd what happened to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Cynder Runs she has to tell the others what happened to spyro!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cynder slowly began to climb towards Spyro and the pedestal containing the Gem, spoored on by the tugging at the base of her mind pulling her closer and the heat in her loins making her want to be closer to Spyro. As she got closer she could feel whatever power the gem was producing begin to fill and change her just as it had done with Spyro. She could feel as her body swelled and grew with muscle but at the same time feel the energy building up in her, is this what caused Spyro grow so large, all of a sudden? She felt as her womb not only grew hotter but just grew in general, no doubt so she would be able to take Spyro and is gigantic length. Beneath her tail she felt her pussy physically swelling and plumping up becoming more sensitive by the second and the lower part of her under belly beginning to swell outward as her womb became larger and required more space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the energy building up in Cynder began to reach what felt like it's tipping point Cynder slowly became intoxicated by the feeling of the growth. Looked back to examine herself, while it was quite obvious she was growing stronger and more muscular, she wasn't growing in the same way Spyro had. While he had grown into a near-literal mountain of Muscle, she was maintaining her more sleek yet Plumper look, she could feel her muscles growing and getting stronger but it seemed that they were perpetually hidden under a soft layer fat and flesh, letting her look more feminine and graful looking while still growing stronger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Cynder's mind was off thinking about how her growth was different from Spyro's the energy inside her finally hit it's tipping point, and everything seemed to happen at once for her. Like a dam the energy all released at once as she was struck with the most erotic and sensual feeling of her life, like every fibre of her being was messaged in a hot spring at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Spyro her entire form surged larger as her head and jaw lengthened, became more mature, Horns lengthened and curved while teeth became larger and sharper. As her neck lengthened she could feel the every new bone and muscle being created, her head surged forward as her neck thickened, though nowhere near as thick as Spyro's was. As the surge worked it's way down to the base of her neck to her shoulders, her shoulders themselves didn't get to much wider her lore limbs grew slightly longer. Her muscle grew larger, while still completely hidden by layer of fat, their movements could now be seen under it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer wings then grew, easily match Spyro's and the surge kept working it's way down. And as her torso lengthened she didn't notice that 2 lumps had developed on the upper portion of her underbelly below the base of her neck. As the continued to grow larger and more spherical they each developed a nub at their peek that quickly grew larger and more sensitive Cynder began to swing her shoulders slightly to feel the pleasure of the air moving over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the surge worked it's way to Cynders rear, her hips exploded in size, more then tripped in size as Muscle and fat poured on them. Her thighs grew thinker and meatier as her thighs almost came to touch each other at their mid point even with the added distance from her hips growth. Her Tail grew longer and thicker as her butt Ballooned in size. Finally, as Cynder reached the top of the monument her womb swelled larger still, she could literally feel her ovaries growing larger and more productive as they began to create what would be equivalent to hundreds of life times worth of potential off spring. Her pussy and Labia grew to exceed the size of her own head making her have yo splay her hind legs slightly like Spyro did while increasing amount of pussy juice was dripping onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while the Cynder could feel every bump and fold of her pussy while being able to control every muscle, which she now instinctively knew we so she could perfectly pleasure and absolutely milk dry any partner she had. And paradoxically the larger her pussy became, the tight she felt herself become, probably to increase the pleasure for everyone involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Cynder sat on the ground across Spyro and the Gem, feeling the ambient energy from it as it slowly make her and Spyro larger still. Enjoying the feeling of her new breasts growing larger and heavier as she felt the butt and pussy slowing move across the floor as the too grew larger. She open her eye's and made eye contact with Spyro for what felt like the first time in an eternity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you it was good\" Spyro said with a knowing smirk as kept stroking himself. Cynder, now slowly kneading one of her new breasts, \"I'll admit, this does feel VERY~ nice, but what do we do now?\" she said with mock concern, \"We can't just stay here getting bigger all day, while that would be fun I'm sure there are some much more fun things we can do, given out 'enhance' physic...\" Cynder said playfully as she bounced her new breasts in her hands for Spyro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Spyro thinks that it WOULD be more fun to just sit here all day and grow, maybe try and out grow this temple with pure size <br>\r\n               alone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Being like this is so GOOD feeling! Why not bring it back home to the village and \"Spread the love\", they'll come around to liking <br>\r\n                it eventually!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: They just start having sex, regular or growy sex, doesn't matter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He took a bite of it, and was bewillderd by its flavor. It tasted sweeter then honey, but at the, same time had a something sour mixed into the meat. Spyro moaned as he was ingulfed  by its riches. Cynder eyed him curiously, deciding to pick one of the fruits up as well, but this time, it was pink. She bitted the fruit, tasting strong sweetness, but with less sour. Spyro finished his divine fruit, and picked another red one up.<br>\r\nThey continued to gorge themselves until a strange drunk feeling took hold of them. \"Spyro, I think we need to *hic* stop,\" Cynder said. \"Nay! *Hic* I'm enjoying this too much. If both dragons where more sober, they would have realized what had happened to them. Cynder's clit had swelled up like some sort of dog on heat, and cum leaked out of the pink nether regains, flowing over her love nub. It throbbed with intense pleasure, but Cynder didn't notice in her drunk haze.<br>\r\nThe effects on Spyro was different. His balls swelled larger with seed, growing into the size of basketballs, spreading his legs apart. His member drooped out of his sheath, half erect. His penis was a good five inches longer that it should be, and bobbed in the air. Spyro licked his chops. The horny feeling didn't have much effect on females, but for a male like Spyro, it was overwhelming. He spotted Cynder's pussy, and couldn't restrain himself any longer.<br>\r\nHe hade a hard time trying to move around with his huge orbs, but made it to Cynder. He grasped it tightly, and stood on his hind legs. Cynder broke somewhat out of her trance, looked around, and said to Spyro,''What are you doing?\" Spyro did not say anything in return, but only gave her a horny look. Without warning, Spyro rammed his dick into her plump clit. Cynder letted out a moan of intense satisfaction. Spyro licked his chops again, and then slowly moved his hips back-and-forth. He releast a groin of pleasure.<br>\r\nHis hips began to move faster, and cum flowed out of Cynder's clit. Spyro lowerd his head to Cynder's, saying,''Gets yourself ready. I'm close'' Cynder didn't understand at first, but after a few moments, felt how a river of cum flow into her womb. Spyro roared as he climaxed. He pushed his penis as far as possible into Cynder's love tunnel, making sure she collected every drop of sperm he had to offer. Cynder could only moan in response, feeling how her bely expanded with his warm cum.<br>\r\nSpyro pulled out his dick, and cum sprayed out of Cynder's clit. She collapsed, feeling worn out. Spyro still felt that he could go on. His dick still rock hard, and his balls rapidly swelling up with new seed, but he let Cynder rest. Laying next to her, he said quietly into her earhole,'' Sleep well, my love.''</span></div></div>",

Such was the case with Spyro and Cynder, thought, they are not going to perish just yet, for they have a few more decades to live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHundreds of years passed since the tyrant Malefor was defeated. In those centuries the dragon population grew, cities and towns were rebuilt, and destroyed temples were restored to their former glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is here, in swamp's temple, that our story begins. Elder Spyro was staring out the window of his room, gazing at the giant mushrooms and rushing river below, reflecting on his young days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind him Elder Cynder was pacing slowly. She fidgeted every time she stood still, and she look every now and then over her old mates shoulder at the horizon, hoping to catch a glimpse of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were waiting for the arrival of the Fire guardian Infernous, one of Spyro's eldest sons. He was bringing his children along as well, so that they can see their mighty grandfather and grandmother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was why Spyro and Cynder were so anxious, but the purple dragon concealed it much better than his mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly five black shapes appeared in the horizon. From the shapes Spyro could tell that they were obviously dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're here,\" Spyro said, his voice sounding deep and tired, which was natural for his old age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are?\" Cynder exclaimed with a creaky voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Spyro confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were waiting outside when Infernous, his mate and children landed at the steps of the temple. Infernous was a spitting image of his father when Spyro was young, but only with dark-red scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mate was a beautiful water dragoness with webbed feet, ocean green scales and shell-shaped horns. Her name was Cleo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInfernous had sired three children; the eldest was names Blaze and was a fire dragon at the age of fifteen, having the same scale coloring as his father; the second was a female named Crystal, who looked a lot like Cynder when she was young, only with green scales (she was fourteen years old); and the last was little Frodo, the baby of the family, who looked a lot like his mother. He was thirteen years old and just hitted puberty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro and Cynder exchanged happy greeting with Infernous, Cleo and their grandchildren. After that a small feast was held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Blaze had other plans in mind, saying to his sister: \"Hey, we should go outside and explore the swamp a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Crystal exclaimed, \"Mom and dad are going to be very angry if we seek off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, stop being such a goody-two-shoes,\" Blaze complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Crystal still refused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine then,\" said Blaze, \"I'll go alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sister called out to him as he flew away from the safety of the temple, but he ignored her, and that was how the trouble all began...</span></div></div>",

He knew that Crystal would go tell their parents that he had ran off and he would get grounded for it, but that was a risk the fire dragon was willing to take for the sake of discovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was currently flying towards a fabled lake hidden deep inside the swamp. The Lake of Dreams, they called it. If someone drank the enchanted water, any wish he/she makes would come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, of course, Blaze knew exactly where to find it after he studied dozens of maps and books about the topic in Warfang. It was hidden in a underground cave, where the swamp's river had its origin. After flying what seemed like hours, following the stream, Blaze finally found the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was situated at the foot of a mountain, and it had a very large opening, large enough for the fire dragon to fly into with ease. It got quite dark as Blaze proceeded forward, and he was afraid that he might fly into something, but a light at the end of the tunnel suddenly appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the tunnel he flew and found himself in a huge cavern that stretched what looked like for two miles. In the center was a large lake, and Blaze concluded that it was The Lake. It had a sparkle to it and glowed a sea-green color in the dark cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze landed at the shores of the Lake, walking towards it. He bent dow and began to lap up the water, Wiping away some of the droplets from his muzzle, Blaze grinned mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what should I wish for,\" he thought to himself. \"I know,\" he finally said out loud,\" I'm tired of being small and bossed around, I wish I was bigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what happens next?</span></div></div>",

The rolls of fat on his body began to leak sweat due to the insulation doing its job too well to keep the heat inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was finally full, he had transformed into the very thing he would have least expected to change into: a blob-dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut due to all the food in his stomach, gas started to develop inside him.

The only thing we can hope for is a spell that could diminish his fat a little to get to the Lake below.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what spell could possibly able to such a thing?\" Infernous said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Spyro said, \"But if I go back to the temple I can search around a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll stay here,\" Infernous said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" said Spyro before he flew away.</span></div></div>",

The truth of the matter was he'd barely been waiting a minute, but to Blaze it seemed much longer.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What's taking so long?\" the dragon grumbled, \"Don't tell me I this is all fake.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He huffed and sat down again feeling decidedly gypped.

It was a tingling twitching sensation that seemed to settle into his stomach.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Blaze looked down just as his stomach surged forward in a small spurt. It was barely a inch or so, but it happened again a moment later with a sound like stretching rubber accompanied by a small pop. It took him a moment to realize his head was also a bit higher off the ground, it wasn't just his belly that had swelled, but his back too. His whole torso was disproportionately larger by the slightest degree.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The process wasn't done though as he felt it begin to spread. He watched his legs as the tingling moved down one and then the other, his right front leg expanded from the should to his elbow, then from the elbow to his arm and then his hand with each finger popping one after the other as they grew. Then his left front leg did the same, followed by each of his back legs. His tail gave a strange pulling sensation as it lengthened out by almost half a foot. Each wing gave a series of rapid pops as one and then the other expanded across his back.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A wave of dizziness caught him as his neck rose with several more pops, thickening too. His eyes crossed as the nostrils on the top of his nose popped first one and then the other, then his snout lengthened over all. His horns grew in with soft creaks before his vision shifted as each eye enlarged to match his expanded head.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When all was said and done he shook his head trying to gauge what happened. Near as he could guess looking at his footprints from entering the cave, he was about one and a half times larger than before.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's not much bigger,\" he admitted to himself and smiled as his voice was slightly deeper than before, \"But it's nice.

He wasn't done yet. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His eyes drifted down to his clawed feet and watched as has they gave a series of pops growing bigger. And bigger. And <i>bigger</i>. By the time they paused each of his clawed feet ere as large as his whole torso and the clawed toes were as thick as his legs. That didn't look like it would last long though as the tingling surged up through him. It seemed to bypass his legs for the moment though and go right to his belly and torso, swelling both bigger and rounder as he was slowly forced up off the ground.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Maybe this wasn't such a good idea...\" Blaze muttered as he watched his snout grow out further, extending longer than his neck with nostrils that looked like they could snort boulders.

Please tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber raised her head again, her sobbing dying down, sniffing. \"Take a look at that,\" she said, pointing to a nearby desk, \"Then you'll know why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pink dragoness cried softly, Cynder walked over to the desk, picking up a sheet of paper. It was the results of a test that they wrote a while ago, and it was a very important one, counting almost half their final grade. Cynder inhaled sharply when she saw the mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Ember said with a sniff, \"It's horrible! I'm struggling to keep my grades up, I'm just so stupid.

I don't wanna go away from herere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe burst back into tears, burying her face into the pillow again. Cynder bit her lower, knowing fully well Ember's situation.

Even though she failed an important test, Cynder knew not all hope was lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing the paper back on the table, she walked back to the sobbing Ember and said soothingly: \"You're not dumb, Ember. You just struggle with other subjects. Don't worry, the test tomorrow would help you get through the year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber sniffed. \"Thanks,\" she said, \"That's if I actually studied for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder facepalmed. \"What!\" she exclaimed in surprise, \"Ember, why didn't you study?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I saw no point in it, if I was just going to fail again,\" said Ember, wiping away her tears, \"But I was wondering if you could perhaps help me. You know a lot about spells from those books you read. Perhaps you can find one that could boost my IQ, even for a little while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder put her claw to her chin, thinking. Ember was right; she did know a lot about magic. Reading spells was a hobby she picked up after the war, and she did remember reading something about a knowledge-boosting spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Ember,\" Cynder said, \"It just doesn't feel right cheating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleeeeeease,\" Ember begged, looking at her with big, blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder sighed and said, \"Alright, come with me.\"</span></div></div>",

She might have been a touch more mature than years back, but part of her still desperately wanted Spyro for herself even if the more rational side of her mind said he was interested in Cynder.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sensation that Spyro and Ember experienced was so bizarre that it left the two dragon standing awkwardly in the hallway for two minutes. In that time, they both tried to process the new feeling swirling around their brains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro could feel, for some reason, that his head felt lighter. He could also feel that some of the things he learned in the past, some of his memories, was missing, like he had completely forgotten them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew that he was suppose to be alarmed by this, but for some reason he found that it felt good. He even dare say that it turned him on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber, on the other hand, felt the exact opposite. Her head felt heavier and memories and knowledge that were not her's joined her thoughts from out of nowhere. But it still felt good to Ember, like her brain was wrapped in a thick, warm blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I think I s-should be going,\" stuttered Spyro, still feeling confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Ember cried, grabbing his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know why, but she wanted to feel that bizarre sensation again. Of course, the moment she touched Spyro did the feeling return, but this time it was stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time it not only focused in their mind but throughout their bodies. Their was an explosion of imagery in Ember's mind. Memories of Spyro using his elemental abilities, fighting off fierce monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInformation such as history, geography, and other skills poured into her head. Things that Ember struggled to understand, like math, suddenly became crystal clear to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel her head growing heavier, the brain inside her head growing bigger, causing her forehead to expand in size to contain it's sheer mass. Ember could feel it. She could feel how she was growing smarter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Spyro could feel how he was growing dumber. He could feel his thoughts...drifting away. But he did not stop Ember. Why should he? It felt so great!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only was he forgetting about his current problems, the duties of being the purple dragon, but problems in his past. It felt so good to be so...so stupid. Ignorance was truly bliss. Spyro's tongue lolled out of his mouth. His front teeth grew longer and his forehead shrunk, his eyes drooping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the drain didn't go on for long. The more Ember drained, the more aware she became of her surrounding. She eventually decided that it was enough and let go of Spyro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she took a step back, Spyro fell down on his haunches, looking very dazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...like...what was that?\" Spyro asked, his voice sounding strange, like he was very sleepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know,\" Ember said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was shocked when she saw Spyro's appearance, but she blushed and looked away when she spotted his purple member between his legs, which was fully erect and dripping pre-cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Ember felt something wet between her legs as well, and when she lifted one leg to check she saw that her vagina was exposed, wet with juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, like, someone's a little frisky,\" she heard Spyro say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her attention back to the purple dragon, Ember saw that he was grinning in a way that she caused was suppose to be seductive but came off as goofy due to his buck teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was craning his neck to get a view of her sex. \"Like, can I pound that for you?\" he asked like a person asking to pass the salt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber blushed harder. Spyro's bluntness surprised her, but at the same time she was eager to take up his offer. Why wouldn't she? This was her chance to be rutted by the dragon she had a crush on as long as she could remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the past she was lucky enough to receive a hug. Ember did feel very horny after all. But yet again, she was reminded of what happened. She had to fix this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did she do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Ember searches for a way to fix the problem, taking Spyro with her. But little does she know that the influence of her brain drain is not only limited by touch anymore. It gets even worse when she begins hearing voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: She decides to have sex with Spyro some place private before going in search of a way to fix the problem, draining the last of the purple dragon intelligence. But little does she know that brain draining might become a pleasurable addiction afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: The bell for the next class rings before Ember can decide and she's forced to make a hasty exit to her classroom , perhaps promising to meet Spyro later for some 'fun'.</span></div></div>",

Confused, she stepped inside and looked around, spotting Cynder on the far side of the room, her snout buried in a book and, by the way her head wiped left and right, was frantically looking for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber had not seen Cynder all day, which had worried her greatly, and she was very happy to see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynder, I'm so glad to see you!\" Ember said happily, \"Where were you all day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black dragoness' body went rigid when she heard her friend's voice. \"E-Ember?\" she said, and Ember heard that Cynder's voice sounded a pitch deeper, \"T-there's s-something I need to t-tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber frowned. \"Cynder, what's going on?\" she asked, walking slowly towards the black dragoness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder suddenly turned around, and what the pink dragoness saw made her gasp. Cynder's two front teeth had enlarged, looking very similar to that of a mole. Her Adams apple was large and bobbed every time she swallowed. Her skull was sloping downwards, almost like her cranium had shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorrified, Ember took a step back. \"C-Cynder, w-what's happened to you?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ember...\" she began but tripped over some books, falling flat on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber quickly helped her up and promoted her to continue. \"Ember,\" Cynder repeated, \"t-the spell. It didn't m-make you s-smarter. I-It draining by brain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\" Ember said, still not understanding what she was hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Cynder could explain again, she clenched her eyes shut, as if she was in pain. Ember, to her horror, saw that Cynder's front teeth grew even bigger, her Adams apple swelled larger, and her head grew even more flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed Cynder by the shoulder and said frantically, \"Ember, the smarter you get, the dumbor...I'm...get...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that said, Cynder's last remaining IQ was drained away, and sat there shivering, her eyes looking in the opposite direction of each other, drooling a bit. The sight horrified Ember. She frantically raked her enlarged mind for an answer to what was going on and what to do about it, and the solution came much quicker than she expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran to a mirror, saw her massive head, and deduced that the spell had drained away Cynder's intelligence and transferred it to her. She had to find a way to fix this and quick! But what to do? Two answers presented themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Ember seek help in the library, knowing little that her brain draining influence was increasing, meaning that more dragon could suffer a similar fate as Cynder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Ember seeks help from one of the Guardians, knowing nothing that they would be the next to be brain drained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Before Ember can attempt either Spyro stops by to check on Cynder.</span></div></div>",

Her forehead was bulging over her eyes, her horns pushed to the side to make room for her massive cranium. Veins bulged against her skin, throbbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight rendered Ignitus speechless and he sat there with his mouth wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignitus, you got to help us!\" Ember exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire dragon found his voice. \"What's going on?

Ignitus frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Encouraging your friend to dabble with dark, forbidden magic, cheating on a test, and then reducing Cynder to the level of an imbecile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at Ember angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have the faintest clue what you've done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry!\" Ember cried, tears rolling down her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus sighed heavily. \"We'll deal with this later,\" he said, \"Right now we have to find a counter spell for this. There's bound to be one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat the book down on a table and began to leaf through the book quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: While Ignitus searches, he feels the strangest sensation, like his head was full of water and someone had pulled out the plug.

We only improved your brain power, like when you take vitamins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in that case then,\" said Ember cheerfully, \"Shall we go to the market and get some lunch? I'll buy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lead the way,\" said Cynder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as they left school, heading towards the marketplace, taking an alleyway as a shortcut, Ember, who was in front of the black dragoness, suddenly stopped in her tracks, clutching her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything okay?\" Cynder asked, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber shook her head, the sudden headache that assaulted her gone. \"Y-yeah, I'm fine,\" she said, \"Just...had a little headache back there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I buy you some medicine for that?\" Cynder asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Ember answered, \"I'll be fine. probably just stress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then,\" said Cynder, though she wasn't completely convinced that her friend was alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she wasn't. In Ember's head her braincells began to increase, rapidly producing in order to contain the knowledge that was flooding into the pink dragoness' head without her even being aware of it, and it was because of this that Ember brain began to expand, her forehead swelling slightly bigger as the mass pushed at her skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Cynder or Ember did not notice this at first and spent the whole day hanging out at the marketplace, though the pink dragoness would complain of headaches suddenly popping up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they arrived home at the temple, they entered their dorm and called it a night. But they were both unaware that, during the time that they slept, Ember's brain would continue to grow larger and larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow big did it get the following morning?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: The next morning Ember wakes up and discovers that her brain had grown to the size of a basketball. But that wasn't the end of it. As it swelled larger, the big-brained pink dragoness experience splitting headaches. As she and Cynder tried to calm down the pain, Ember accidentally \"zaps\" the black dragoness, diminishing some of her pain, but causing her friend's own brain to expand bigger in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: The next morning Ember wakes up and Cynder saw that her head had grown to the size of a yoga ball. Despite this, the pink dragoness does not notice and thinks everything is normal. But that's not the end of it. It seems like she had developed psychic powers and it was spiraling out of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: The next morning Ember wakes up to find her brain has grown to the diameter of a cart wheel, yet for some reason only she notices the change. Everyone else struggles to see anything odd about her. But the more they're close by the more they can see the truth as their own brains start to swell from being in her presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Something else happens</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cynder woke up the next morning to hear her friend Ember groaning in pain. She sat up, rubbed the sleep from her eyes and spotted the pink dragoness under her covers, moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned and rgot out of bed, walking to her and saying, \"Hey, Ember, are you okay?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink dragoness suddenly went quiet, and a few moments later she answered, \"I-I'm fine. It's just...it's just a headache, t-that's all. Go. I'll catch up. just give me a moment to....OOOOOOOH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time she cried in pain and the black dragoness was startled. \"I think this is a little bit more than just a headache,\" said Cynder, \"I think I should take you to a doctor.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, please!'' said Ember, sounding afraid, \" Please, I'll be f-fine....OOOOH! Dammit, that hurt so bad!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder shook her head and grabbed the covers, saying, \"No, Ember, we need to get you to a doctor and quick. This could be severe.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!'' Ember cried in dismay when the black dragoness pulled away her covers, trying desperately to grave for them and cover herself again, but it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder had already seen her, and what she saw shocked her, her maw falling open and taking a step back, as if she was afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Ember, w-what happened to you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know,\" said the pink dragoness as she reached up with her clawed hand to touch her bulging cranium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was roughly the size of a beach ball, her horns pushed about by her balbous head...which was swelling bigger! Before Cynder's very eyes Ember's cranium increased in size, the veins against her skin throbbing, and the pink dragoness shuddered, moaning in pain, clutching her head with both paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOOOOH!\" she cried, \"It feels like it's going to explode!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the rising and falling of someone's chest as they breathed, Ember's head did the same action, swelling larger and smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do something!\" Ember yelled at Cynder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black dragoness panicked. Never before had she seen something like this before, and she didn't have the faintest clue what to do, but then Ember shrieked and something strange happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small yellow bolt of lighting suddenly emerged fro her head and zapped Cynder. Though it was small, it had astromg impact and sent the black dragoness flying, crashing into a bookshelf, causing the books to fall and bury her underneath them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only then that most of the pain subsided, although there was a dull throb still lingering in Ember's head, but the pink dragoness could at least think clearly now. She reached up and touched her head and found,to her surprise, that it had shrunk in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was far from normal, mind you, for it still bulged a noticeably large size, but it was definitely smaller. As she wondered what on earth happened, several theories sprouting so quickly that it too her by surprise, Ember heard Cynder groan in pain from underneath the books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!'' she said, worried, rushing over to help her friend. \"Cynder, speak to me. Are you alright?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she dug the black dragoness out, the books shifted and she rose, moaning, and it was Ember's turn to gasp, her maw falling open and taking a step back, afraid. Like an inflating sausage balloon, Cynder's skull stretched, elongating as the matter inside grew, her forhead pushing forward over her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... what happened...?'' Cynder said, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then saw her reflection in a nearby mirror and screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to me!?'' she shouted at Ember, clutching her head in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...I-I don't know!'' the pink dragoness cried back, just as horrified and confused as Cynder, but then it hit her. \"The bolt. I remeber it. It struck you and I think it must have transfered some of this-\" she clutched her big head, which seemed to be swelling larger again \"-into you.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you think so?\" said Cynder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Ember, \"And I also think I know how I ended up like this. Do you remember the spell you cast on me, the one that was supposed to make me smarter?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think something went wrong,\" she continued, \"I think it's constantly making me smarter, and in order to contain my growing knowledge, my brain is swelling bigger!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet Ancestors,\" said Cynder, shocked, \"We need to find a way to fix this, and fast!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't have to tell me twice,\" said Ember, \"But what will we do? If we go out we will be seen, but if we stay here, there's a good chance me head will explode, and if I zap you again, your head will explode.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both thought for a few moments of what to do, but with their enhanced intelligence, they quickly came to a salution, and Cynder presented her solution while Ember presented hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat were they and which one do we follow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Cynder solution was that it's probably best that they come clean, that they should seek out the Guardians for help and tell them what happened. If they got into trouble, it would be better than to have their heads inflate into a massive size and probably explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Ember's solution was that they sneak out of their room and head back to the library, where they would search for a way to fix their situation. Of course, they don't find they answer that quickly, leading to the pink dragoness' brain swelling up to a ludicrous size ones again, giving her a splitting headache, and she is forced to relieve some of that pain by zapping some unexpected dragon passing by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Before they can decide on a course of action Embers brain begins hurting again and there's a knock at the door. Seems Spyro was passing by and heard the noises. Being a good friend he's eager to help even if he doesn't know the situation the girls are in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Something else unusual happens as a result of Embers new brainpower.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was something terribly wrong about this clear Summer's day. Spyro, as he made his way down a pathway in the temple's garden, a shortcut he had chosen to get to the dojo quicker where he was going to partake in a few exercises with Terrador, knew that odd things were going on, all which had a sinister purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did he know this? For starters, Cynder was missing, though they say she wasn't, that she simply went on a solo mission to retrieve some forgotten and ancient artifact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was several things wrong with this. One: Cynder would never go off alone without taking Spyro or at least telling him about the mission. It just was part of her personality! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo: it was told to him by Ignitus, who, also, wouldn't send off Cynder alone. In fact, he would send no one off without company to a dangerous place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only was his choices careless but his behavior raised another red flag for Spyro. The Fire Guardian these days seemed oddly...detached from the world, like he was constantly deep in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis ones bright eyes were hazy now, his eyelids drooping, and when he spoke, his speech was slow and soft. He had grown listless, often favoring his own company above others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, something very strange was going on, and Spyro feared that it was curse, or perhaps the Dark Master himself, that was behind this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he made his way down the path, pondering who was behind this and seeking a solution, he collided into a familiar pink figure, knocking her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, my, I'm so sorry,\" Ember quickly apologized, regaining her composure, \"I wasn't watching where I was going and I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink dragoness trailed off when she saw who she bumped into and felt her her heart rate quicken, not out of excitement but because she was very nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, I should apologize, Ember,\" said Spyro, reaching out with his paw to her, \"I hope your not hurt in any way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking it, Ember said, hoping that the nervousness in her voice wasn't noticeable, \"N-no, I'm fine. Perfectly okay. B-but I must go now. Late for a class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber made a hasty escape, but she only took a dozen steps when Spyro called to her. \"Hey, Ember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe froze in her tracks and turned around, trying to give him a innocent smile, but, due to her nervousness, it came out looking rather suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Spyro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't seen Cynder anywhere have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the question she dreaded he would ask, and, mustering all her courage, she said, \"No, I haven't seen her. Didn't the Guardians say she went on a solo mission or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes they did,\" he said, disappointed, \"Must have forgotten. Bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye,\" said Ember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXxxX<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink dragoness watched him leave, and after she made sure he was really gone did she breath a sigh of relief. Phew! That was too close!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to pick a different, better, and much more secretive route next time. Ember had risked Spyro growing suspicious of her and ruin her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe may have fooled everyone, but the purple dragon wasn't so easily misled. Ember decided that it was time that she underwent her second stage of her plan and ran towards her secret hideout, where subject was being kept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXxxX<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, Cynder!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black dragoness' blood ran cold when she heard Ember's happy voice rang out throughout the cavern, and soon she hopped into view, dragging something that was covered in a blanket behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder's instincts told her that now was her chance, that she should lunge at Ember, beat her to a bloody pulp, and then escape, but, alas, she knew that was impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bounds that held her were strange yet familiar. It was like the snakes that was placed around her and Spyro's neck the day they broke out of the crystal that contained them for three years, but these were places around her wrists, the glowing green chain attached to the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess what I got?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go!\" Cynder ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber made a sad face. \"Now why would I do that?\" she said while pouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because if you do,\" Cynder said, \"I won't tell the Guardians what you did and consider only beating you half to death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you haven't seen what I brought you,\" said Ember, and she pulled away the blanket, revealing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Choice 1</u>: a cylinder shaped machine, which had a hose extending from it, and attached to this hose was something that looked a lot like a face mask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cylinder had bright pink liquid inside it, which contained as many calories several large meals<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber's plan was to see how full Cynder's belly could be stuffed and how fat she could get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Coice 2</u>: it was a trunk, but it was what it contained that mattered. Inside were, vulgar enough, several dildos, but they weren't ordinary sex toys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were magical, looking and feeling incredibly realistic, almost like they were disembodied penises, and some could even increase in size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all had a pair of plump balls, containing samples of seed from several dragon, including the Guardians and the pink dragoness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber's plan was to breed forth a dragon that could overpower even the legendary purple dragon, and if that was successful, she would breed an entire army, Cynder being the egg-factory, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Choice 3</u>: It was a special pair of necklaces. One for Ember and one for Cynder. Forcing one on Cynder She begins to take on the appearence of Ember while Ember begins to change to look like Cynder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the change isn't just physical. Over time Ember begins gaining Cynders memories and even her magic. All the better to replace her as Spyros love. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the transformation magic isn't flawless and could lead to some weird effects at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Choice 4</u>: Something weirder and more deprived? Something to slowly break Cynders strong will and turn her into a helpless plaything for Ember to enjoy?</span></div></div>",

They looked identical to the ones that were placed around her and Spyro's neck by the forces of Malefor when they escaped out of the crystal, but these differed in color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne was black while the other was pink, much like Cynder and Ember's scale color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" Cynder said, feeling uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These,\" began Ember, picking up the black necklace, which suddenly sprang alive and jumped to her throat, curling around it and becoming inanimate ones again, \"is a special sort of necklace, one that's designed to morph you into someone else. It's pretty useful for disguises, and that is just what I'm going to do. I'm going to disguise myself as you, and you as me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Cynder exclaimed in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me!\" said Ember, grinning wickedly, \"I'm going to become you and steal Spyro! He will never know the difference.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will never get away with this!\" Cynder shouted, trying to edge away, but the chains held her in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hush now,\" said Ember, pink necklace in hand, \"And stop squirming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe necklace came alive and jumped at Cynder, who couldn't dodge it, curling around her neck. The black dragoness was getting scared now as she waited. Nothing happened after a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder smirked and said, \"It seems like you need a refund on these. They appear to be broke-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Cynder's narrow snout swelled larger, growing bulbous, her nostrils larger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In think not,\" said Ember as her own snout narrowed, growing sharper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder's belly lurched forward as she gained a small potbelly, her height and length of her body diminishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ember lost a few pounds, growing slightly taller and longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir scale color began to change, pinks spots appearing in Cynder's body while black spots appeared on Ember's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder blinked, her shocked blue eyes staring into mischievous green ones. Ember chuckled as her new body reached completion, her heart-shaped tail tip turning into a sharp blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, Cynder,\" said Ember, running her paw over the side of her, \"no wonder Spyro is in love with you. Curvy body, perky rump...you are pretty sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder gritted her teeth, struggling with her body that looked like Ember's against her bonds, but it was pointless. She wanted to scream how she was going kill her, but then she noticed something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerfect copy? No, Ember didn't look quit like her. There were a few subtle differences. Her eyes were poisonous green instead of emerald green, and her face looking softer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven her voice sounder different. It sounded higher and whiny. <i>Hmm</i>, thought Cynder, <i>I may be able to expose her by using these flaws.</i> She just had to get free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, It seems like you might stand a chance with him now,\" said Cynder, noting how her voice sounded deeper and more sturdier than Ember's used to sound, \"I'll give you Spyro for now. But can you release me? I look like you now. No one would ever believe me if I said otherwise. They will think I'm crazy.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" said Ember, considering what Cynder said, \"I suppose, but only if I'm a fair distance. Can't have you pounce on me. The chains will break only at my whim. Well, I guess I should be going. I got one hunk of a boyfriend waiting for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, she trotted away, laughing triumphantly. A few minutes later the chains vanished and Cynder rubbed her wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Now looking like Ember, Cynder starts to think of a plan to fix herself, but weird things begin to happen as she suddenly start to remember things she had never experienced in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same begins to happen to Ember, only these memories is quite traumatizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Weird things begins to happen to Cynder and Ember, for the effects of the necklace isn't one hundred percent full proof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey begin to morph in strange ways, one day gaining a lot of weight and the other growing suddenly taller. It gets even weirder as they begin to sprout extra limbs, eyes and wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: the transformation of the necklaces is unstable and when either of them run into another dragon the other one changes into a copy of that dragon.

Her breathing grew quick and shallow, and the next thing she new she felt her new ball sacks pull up as she camed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber shot her load deep into Cynder's throat, and the black dragoness swallowed it. She let go of the pink dragoness' cock with a wet pop, liking the remaining seed from her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you're really good at this,\" Ember said, smiling at Cynder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a lot of experience with Spyro,\" the black dragoness said, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1 Cynder decides to experiment more with Ember's penis by shooting semen into the pink dragoness' own womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: A few days pass and Cynder wonder how it feels to have a cock just like Ember's.

The black dragoness was also growing more bolder, trying to suck Ember off even in public places. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was ones a time that Cynder even tried to do it during the middle of a lesson in class, but the pink dragoness managed to convince her that it was a horrible idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut afterwards she had to skip a few classes, hiding away in one of the bathroom's stalls as Cynder had her way with her, sucking her off and bouncing on her cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Ember thought of the consequences of the black dragoness constantly rutting her. She was at the age that she could bare eggs, but that wasn't the only problem the pink dragoness feared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spell that Ember casted upon herself was just for plain fun, and according to the magical book she used, it had some strange side effects if you used it for too long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to get rid of it as soon as possible, but the pink dragoness didn't expect that Cynder would gain such an obsession with her penis. Ember couldn't get rid of it now, because she couldn't stand seeing Cynder disappointed. But she will soon grow bored if it, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she stuck with her new appendage for a while, and soon, like the book warned, the side effects began to rear its ugly head out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber felt aroused more frequently, and when she and Cynder had sex, she found that it took less time to climax, her member growing more sensitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also lasted longer during the climax, unloading more seed each time, giving Cynder a larger cum-filled belly, which the black dragoness loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber's orientation began to shift as well. She found herself attracted to females, often having to leave the shower room when she was surrounded by them. Just watching them bathe their sexy bodies was enough to give her a raging hard-on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that didn't mean that she lost interests in males. In fact, she fantasized how it would feel to pound rears, feeling them squirm under her, stroking their hard cocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro was one if these dragons...yet, Ember still couldn't have him, for she was sure Cynder still loved him, although she spent less time in his company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, she was pretty sure Flame, a fire dragon, who she knew had a crush on her for quite some time, would suffice. Ember just wasn't sure how he would react to her large member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she knew he would be desperate enough to have her as his lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was another dragon also, her name being Aqua. Though she was several years older than her, a Guardian and a teacher, Ember was attracted to her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber had heard somewhere that Aqua, before becoming a Guardian, was a broodmother ones and that she missed the days when she was full of eggs. Perhaps Ember could help her relive those days...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho did Ember decided to pick?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Ember decides to have sex with Flame, knowing little that the spell she casted on her had even more strange side effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every male she has sex with her cock and balls will grow bigger, siphoning the other dragon's privates away. (Cock growth/cock shrinking/cock stealing.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Ember decides to have sex with Aqua. After using a few spells on her, the blue dragoness is happy to comply with Ember's wishes, her swollen pussy lips burning with need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after one night with Ember, Aqua wakes up the next morning with a huge, pregnant belly. (Hyper pregnancy.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Neither. Cynder was plenty fun and Ember wouldn't have to reveal hirself to anyone new. But Cynder has been too eager for Embers cum of late. It's like an addiction and she can't get enough. And it's having an effect on her body. Drinking so much has caused the black dragoness to thicken up, growing more bloated from Embers protein heavy seed (Cum drinking = weight gain)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: A new dragon? Someone just transferred into the school and has yet to make any strong friends. Maybe Ember could become 'friends' with them? </span></div></div>",

Dragging herself to the water basin in her room, she splashed her face and gazed at herself in the mirror, expecting to see her chubby, ugly, miserable face staring back at her. But what she saw instead made her gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder was making her way to Ember's room. She had tried everything to get her friend to talk to her yesterday, to figure out what was her problem, even getting Spyro and two Guardians to help her, but their efforts were fruitless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Aqua the Water Guardian told her that she should give Ember some time to calm down before trying to talk to her again. Cynder gave her all night to calm down and now she was going to find out what was the problem. Also, this time she wasn't going to take a \"no\" for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knocked on the door and said, \"Ember, it's me, Cynder, can I come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black dragoness braced herself to be shouted at to go away, but what Ember said next took her by surprise. \"Oh, do come in. I need your opinion on what to wear today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder could hear that her tone was genuinely happy, a farcry from the state she was in yesterday, and the black dragoness was confused. She opened the door anyway and stepped into the room gingerly. She found colorful ribbons and jewellery scattered across the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ember, what's going...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder froze when her eyes fell on the pink dragoness, and at first she did not recognize. Staring at herself in the mirror, trying on one shiny necklace after the other, Ember had transformed into sleek and thin dragoness overnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ember, is that you?\" Cynder asked, astonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink dragoness turned to her and gave her a broad smile. \"It's great, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it is...

''Nope,\" she said, \"But it doesn't matter how I ended up like this. All what matters right now is that I've got a gorgeous body! Now, help me pick something to wear. I need to look my beat today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder was happy for Ember, helping her out, but she couldn't help but feel that something very strange and wrong was up with the pink dragoness' sudden and dramatic weight loss.</span></div></div>",

As a healer in training, and a amateur spell caster, it was Ember's responsible to replenish the medical stock at the temple's infirmary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer task was completed for today, but she wasn't going back home just yet. Usually she liked hanging out in the square for a while, buying herself something with the spare money she had, for her instructed, Aqua, didn't mind her doing so (it was a reward she gave Ember for her hard work during the rest of the year), and checking out a few stores that sold beautiful items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she walked down the street, her head zipping left and right, Ember's eyes fell on a very peculiar store.

Snow that covered the roof caused the canvas to droop, and a sign, swinging in the light breeze, was titled \"Madame Lumeria's fortune telling and gift shop!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber was curious, for she had never seen such a store before in Warfang. She decided to pay it a visit, trotting over towards it, lifting the flap that acted as a doorway, and entered the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found herself in a round room, the walls, multicolored pillows, and scented candles giving it a cozy feeling. A table was set in the middle of the room, and in the middle of that table was a crystal ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello!\" Ember called, \"Is anyone here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings,\" came a voice, which caused Ember to jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to her left, where the voice came from, she saw a old female fox emerged from the shadows where she seemingly just materialized from, wearing a red robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad that you've came to seek my help, Ember,\" the fox continued.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink dragoness' eyes widened in surprise. \"How did you know my name?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, young one,\" the fox said, \"I am Madame Lumeria! I know all and much more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked towards the table and took a seat on the pillow, watching Ember with piercing green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink dragoness eyed her skeptically. \"O, really?\" Ember said with one eyebrow raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLumeria nodded. \"Indeed,\" she said, \"I know that you also had a crush, and still harbor feelings, towards the legendary purple dragon, Spyro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber's mouth fell open in shock, taking a step back. Things were getting a little bit freaky. How could she know? It was probably coincidence, or someone, she did not know who, told this weird fortune teller about her crush on Spyro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like Lumeria could read Ember's mind. \"And no, no one told me about your crush on the purple dragon.\" She grinned. \"If you still don't believe me, I have another secret that no one, except yourself, knows: you also have \"feelings\" towards Spyro's mate, Cynder, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, now Ember was freaked-out. After Spyro turned Ember down, the pink dragoness was soon treated with disdain by Cynder, angry at her trying to steal away the one she loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber didn't want to make enemies, even less wanting someone to hate her. She was a sweet girl that wanted to be friends with everyone, so, she, after apologizing to Cynder several times, began to built a relationship with the black dragoness. But soon she began to develop deeper feelings for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber didn't know why but Cynder's strength, her beauty, her charm attracted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink dragoness blushed so hard that her face turned from pink to red. She rubbed one front leg against the other, and she averted her gaze. She felt like darting out of the tent, to escape this freaky old fox who knew so much about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLumeria laughed. \"O, young one,\" she said, \"It would seem that my bluntness had embarrassed and scared you. Don't worry; your secret is safe with me. In fact, I want to help you. So, why don't you take a seat and I'll offer you a few items.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing what else to do, Ember did as Lumeria asked. The fox reached into her robe and pulled out to objects, setting them on the table. One was a pretty amulet, made from gold, and the other was a small bottle, containing pink liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed at the amulet, saying: \"This amulet right here in enchanted to transform you into something your crush, the purple dragon, would find attractive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber studied it. \"So this thing would make me more pretty for Spyro?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said that it will transform you into something HE will find attractive,\" explained the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber nodded, turning her attention to the one bottle. \"And that?\" she asked, pointing a claw, \"What will that do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sinister grin appeared in Lumeria's face. \"That,\" she began, \"Is a love charm. Feed it to someone and that someone will fall in love with the first person it sees. But there is a catch: the potion only works on females, so you will know who to use it on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned forward, asking in a hushed voice, \"I can only give away one, for using both can be dangerous. So, which will you choose? They are five gold coins each.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber looked from the bottle to the amulet, and from the amulet to the bottle, wondering which one she will take.</span></div></div>",

Her conscience was telling that stealing ones lover away was wrong, but she wanted Spyro badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it came to something she desired, Ember would stop at nothing until she had it.

Ember turned her head, coming face-to-face with another Ember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth screamed, trying to back away, but found that they couldn't. Looking at what was preventing her from doing so, Ember saw that the perpetrator was her own body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the heads, who's necks had elongated by at least two feet, was attached to the pink body that stood quivering in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is happening to me!?\" Ember cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second head, just as horrified as she, replied: \"I-I-I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second head was soft spoken, quite timid, a perpetual nervous expression on her faces, her features smooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the first Ember could think of anything to to, she felt a stab of pain run through her head. Clutching her it, she felt a bizarre sensation, like something was pulling at her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain subsided, and Ember asked: \"What the hell was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was me, you idiot!\" said a angry voice suddenly beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to her right, she saw another head, this one frowning, her features sharp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber could not believe it. She was turning into a hydra-dragon. Worse, every head seems to embody one of her personality traits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was afraid. Ember had no idea how things now worked, sharing a single body. Was this what the purple dragon really like? Multi-headed females? She was beginning to think Spyro was a bit if a weirdo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to fix this somehow,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no shit!\" said the head to her right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please don't s-swear like t-that,\" said the head to the right, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, shut up, pipsqueak!\" said the angry head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a p-pipsqueak,\" the shy head said, almost mumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are,\" mocked the angry head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not,\" said the shy head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are too,\" argued the angry head again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two heads flung the same words at each other, sounding like a annoying chant. The original Ember tried to think of a way to fix this, but the other two heads kept distracting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she could not take it anymore. \"Shut up!\" she roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two heads stopped their actions immediately, looking at her with sheepish grins. \"Sorry,\" they apologized in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber sighed, thinking.</span></div></div>",

Her conscience was telling her that it was wrong to steal ones lover away by force, but Ember wanted Cynder more than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she wanted something she desired, the pink dragoness would stop at nothing until she had it.

She wasn't doing much so she excepted her friend's invitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd here the two of them sat, together. It was a lot easier than Ember expected. She made small-talk with Cynder, first asking how she was and how her day was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart was racing as she watched Cynder lift the cup of tea to her maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A little more, a little more!</i> thought Ember, her tail twitching with excitement, <i>Just take a sip, dammit!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she did...</span></div></div>",

It worked! It actually worked! Cynder was Ember's now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black dragoness suddenly closed the gap between the two of them, drawing Ember into a deep, long, wet, passionate kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink dragoness was surprised, her eyes growing wide, but she calmed down and gave into the pleasurable feeling that her new lover had to offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moaned as the intense feeling took her away, their tongs entering each other's mouths, wrestling one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber pushed Cynder onto her back, still kissing her. Due to a lack of oxygen the two finally broke their kiss, there muzzles departed with a wet noise, gasping for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stared at each other for a while, basking in each other's warmth and love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Ember,\" said Cynder with a whisper <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my love,\" Ember replied back tenderly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I feel strange,\" the black dragoness said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber smiled. \"It's the love that you bare for me, Cynder,\" the pink dragoness said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" said Cynder, \"It's not that at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed it wasn't. The black dragoness' stomach began to rumble, gurgle and slosh, sending chills up Cynder's spine. Between her legs she felt a heat began to rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer two scaly sexual lips began to swell, the tip of pink clitoris visible between the folds. Juices began to leak out between her folds, causing it to become moist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her juices were different this time; instead of being white or transparent, like any female's should be, Cynder's cum was a bright pink color, just like the contents of the bottle Ember used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ember, please climb off,\" Cynder pleaded, \"I-I feel very weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReading the genuine distress on her face, Ember did as her new lover asked. Cynder sat up and her claw went immediately to her sex, spreading her legs apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her clawed tip touched the plumb folds, Cynder moaned a little, jerking her paw back. It was extremely sensitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ember stared at her lover's swollen sex, she too began to feel her heat rising between her legs. But, unlike Cynder, hers was natural, meaning that she could suppress it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a spell caster, even though a amateur one, Ember knew that this wasn't normal. The potion was only supposed to make her fall in love with Ember, not make her arouse her as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Cynder came to her feet, moaning loudly. Startled by this, Ember took a step back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Cynder,\" stuttered Ember, afraid, \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...I...\" was the only words that Cynder could manage, for the extreme pleasure she was experiencing was like none other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the sound like creaking floorboards, and before Ember;s very eyes Cynder began to grow taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't much, only a inch or two, but is was enough to set Ember's eyes level with Cynder's sharp muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were getting stranger and stranger by the minute. Ember had to stop this somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait here,\" said the pink dragoness, \"I'll find a way to fix this. Just give me a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ember, wait!\" Cynder cried, but the pink dragoness had already dashed out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made an attempt to run after her, but the black dragoness' body began to shake like an earthquake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-a-ah-o-oh,\" Cynder said, feeling a gigantic wave of pleasure explode all over her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber dashed down the hallway, towards the small library that was in the temple. The pink dragoness had spent some time in that place, reading and trying out old spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she was not mistaking, she could remember a particular spell that could halt a organism's growth for a short period of time. It wasn't much but it was all she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite easy finding it, and Ember borrowed it, running back to her room. But when she arrived at her courtiers, she was greeted by a startling sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened to Cynder?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption one: Cynder was at least a few heads taller than Ember, her form growing soft with fat. But that's not all: her stomach it filling with eggs, and her vagina swelled to a ludicrous size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption two: Cynder was a blimp, her limbs and head sucked into her scaly sphere of a body, floating several feet off the ground. But that's not all: her vagina is swollen to a ridiculous size. Strange pink gas, which smells of roses, was spraying out of her womanhood, having bizzare effects on females and males that catches a whiff of it.</span></div></div>",

And her rear end had ballooned to the size of Embers whole body. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0However, all that was nothing compared to her sex. As Ember walked around her engorged love, her jaw fell at the sight. Cynder wasn't just puffy now. she wasn't just spread, her sex was a gaping cavern that spread under her rear end and along the ground for a good three feet behind her. It was so big Ember was sure she could have hid inside if if she tried.

Ember backed off more than a little nervous as Cynders belly began making sounds like a boiling pot and large lumps began to form in her sides. As they shifted about Ember realized they were inside here, and not one minute later Cynder gave a loud moan as a large melon sized egg rolled out of her sex with a gush of juices.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was soon followed by another.

But Ember had a lot of muscle, didn't she? Her black penis was erect, though. Cynder guessed it was that that made her suspicious.

She turned her attention to Ember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what seems to be the problem?\" Ember asked in a calm voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Cynder said slowly, rubbing her thighs together, feeling how they were sticky with cum from her vagina, \"I've got a kinda embarrassing situation in my paws.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is it?\" Ember prompted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, take a look,\" Cynder said, lifting her one thigh and exposing her swollen cunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder saw Ember's eyes widen a bit, her black rod beginning to leak pre-cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How...interesting,\" Ember said, her voice still calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it's not normal,\" Cynder said, blushing a bit, \"Mating Season is months away, but I'm already in heat.

She was constantly leaking pre-cum, and Cynder had to stay inside to avoid humiliation. Her thighs and haunches were growing bigger, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Cynder wasn't the only one expanding. Ember was going through some unusual growth spurts as well. The pink dragoness found that she was growing taller each week, reaching the the point were she was a head taller than Flame, and her muscles were increasing, giving her a more sturdy and intimidating figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber could only come to the conclusion that it was the magic of her necklace that was doing this to her. She wasn't complaining, though. In fact, she was loving every second of her larger and stronger body. It was made even better that, for some reason, no one was aware of her transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, things were going great for Ember until one day...</span></div></div>",

The black dragoness heaved and growled in pleasure just as much as she had when Ember had hir member burred inside her. Turning around Ember looked back through the door and gaped at the sight.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cynder was exactly where she had been, but now her belly bulged out almost half a foot bigger. And as Ember watched it gave a sudden heave, as though being filled by a powerful hose, and expanded larger still with Cynder moaning all the while. The sound of her scales stretching could be heard around the room as Cynder bucked and heaved with each wave of expansion, each coming faster than the last. Her fat sex had only expanded thicker under her tail, growing as large as a cushion and constantly dribbling a stream of cum.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ember stood with jaw slack as Cynder's muddle grew bigger than a barrel, then a small boulder. The black dragoness was actually lifted off the ground so far her legs could no longer reach. Her big dark pink scaled belly heaved and glorped and as it grew now Ember could make out faint lumps pushing against the sides of Cynders body.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She's... pregnant?\" gasped Ember, \"Already? And with so much?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apparently the pink dragon shemale was far more potent than shi'd ever imagined. Cynder was already four times the size of any adult dragon heavy with clutch. And she seemed to not be slowing down at all. The heaving mass that was Cynder was soon bigger than a cart and her back began to round up as her torso filled out bigger and heavier with dozens of eggs. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ember was just wondering if she should run to fetch help when Cynder gave the loudest moan yet and her fat vaginal lips parted. A egg the size of Embers head began to push out and she barely had time to slide a damp cushion under Cynnder's sex to catch it before it fell. The egg was a mix of dark and pink swirls, a blend of both their colors, but ember didn't get the chance to stare at it before another began to emerge. And then a third. Then two more in rapid succession. Cynder's eggs dropped from her sex faster than any dragoness had ever given birth and still she din't look one inch smaller. If anything Cynder was only getting bigger still.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What do I do? What do i do?\" Ember moaned as shi caught the twelfth egg and gently set it aside just in time to catch the thirteenth. If this kept up she wouldn't be able to catch them all. Shi could run for help but then the eggs might break with no one there to catch them. And besides what would shi even say? How could shi even begin to explain this situation?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Just then...</span></div></div>",

Slowly bit by bit the shell broke away as the first of the shemale dragons children began to emerge.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The figure that flopped out had Cynders Dark scale color but a brighter pink belly like Embers body scales. The little dragon blinked at Ember and then smiled. Ember felt a little uneasy at that, but couldn't understand why. Then she realized the chiled was growing. Right before her eyes the newborn was growing up, aging years in seconds. Hir horns grew in, a perfect match for Embers, as she soon approached the same age as Ember and Cynder. Shi too had a member like Ember, the large black mass dangled between hir legs as she brushed it experimentally. Then began to stroke and pleasure herself.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ember didn't know what to make of this, but soon shi began to hear other 'tink,tink' sounds and realized other eggs were beginning to hatch.

Cynder drooled with pleasure, her mind too far gone to even question what was happening now as the eggs built inside her and flowed out at a pace of one per second.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0By the time Ember looked back to the kids three more had been born and aged to the same as the first while a half dozen more were in the process of hatching. All looked similar though there were minor variances of traits shared by both Ember and Cynder. One thing they all had though was a male member. And all of them were putting it to good use as they paired up and began rutting eachother, eager to feel sex for the first time.</span></div></div>",

Flame was with his childhood hero! He still struggled to believe that the legendary purple dragon was flying next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young fire drake threw a quick glance to the older dragon flying next to him. Master Spyro was everything, and more, that they described him to be: burly, tall, powerful, and, of course, a deep purple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Cynder was there, too. Flame was memorized by how her curvy, black body glided effortlessly through the air. She was so attractive. Flame sighed inwardly. He knew that Cynder would never be his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was well known, although the red drake tried to hide, by Flame's fellow students at the Academy that he had a crush on the Savior of The Skies. He was teased often because of it, but Flame didn't blame them; Lady Cynder had to be at least two or three decades his senior!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, Flame was truly in the presence of greatness. He was chosen personally by the Guardians to go on this patrol with Spyro and Cynder. Flame wasn't sure why. He guessed it was because he held the strongest chance to become the next Fire Guardian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an important task for important people, Flame concluded, which made him swell with pride. The said task was an investigation about a mysterious object that fell from the sky one nights ago. Everyone knew about it. It was hard not to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlame could still remember being woken up by a loud and eerie rumble in the middle of the night, and then he was startled greatly when a loud boom echoed throughout the whole Valley of Avalar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose who were awake those hours of the night reported seeing a ball of green fire streak through the dark sky, crashing somewhere behind a large hill thirty miles away from Warfang. It alarmed the residence of the valley, and it was strongly requested to the Guardians to investigate this strange occurrence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so they sent Flame, Master Spyro, and Lady Cynder to find whatever crashed into Earth last night. Along came ten dragon knights for extra protection. Though Flame highly doubt that would have been necessary; Spyro and Cynder was without a shadow of a doubt the most powerful beings in Avalar, perhaps even the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlame expected professional silence to rule this whole entire flight, but to his surprise Spyro and Cynder were constantly chatting with one another, and their conversations weren't of anything serious but mundane situations that any being in the Avalar would suffer. Flame was really beginning to see them in another light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat surprised him even more was when they began to chat with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, kid, I heard that you're the next in line to become the the new Fire Guardian, isn't that true?\" Master Spyro asked with his thick voice. He seemed genuinely interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I guess it is,\" Flame said with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt good to admit his position, but then Flame saw, to his alarm, Master Spyro's eyes grow sad. Why was he sad? Flame had heard from his history lessons that the Fire Guardian Ignitus was ones the purple dragon's mentor, and that he died during the great war against the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stories tell that he and Master Spyro were close. Perhaps that was the reason why he seemed so somber. But like the sun appearing behind a dark cloud, the purple dragon brightened again, cracking a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, young one, the best of luck to you,\" he said, \"I think you'll make an excellent Gaurdian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think so?\" Flame asked, astonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we do,\" the Savior of The Skies said, dropping alongside them, and the red drake felt his heart rate speed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice was sharp, even though she was speaking kindly. Flame really didn't want to be on her bad side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been hearing quite a few tales from you, little one,\" Lady Cynder continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlame felt his face heat up by being called \"little one\". When it came to size, Flame was a little shorter than most dragons his age. He took it up as an insult to be referred in any way of being small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Flame forgave her and said nothing, mainly because he knew that she probably didn't know and that his crush on her prevented him from getting angry at Cynder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Spyro said suddenly next to him, \"top of your class, and clever too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlame blushed a bit from all the praise. They continued to talk merrily for a while, but when they were close to the crash site they party grew silent, the seriousness of the task settling in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the came to the hill, they flapped their wings a few times to gain altitude, and behind the hill was...</span></div></div>",

Even though it was left to cool down overnight, the rock was still smoking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro, Flame, Cynder, and the rest of the party landed a good distance nearby, for they didn't want to come close to something they had little knowledge of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take lead,\" Spyro declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Lady Cynder suddenly jumped in front of him, and she said: \"Hey! Why should you lead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro smirked. \"Because I'm the purple dragon,\" he said, \"And besides, remember what happened last time you leaded us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they began to argue, the two dragons began to lead the party anyway. It was interesting for Flame to see these legends playfully bickering with each other.

Cynder's head bobbed up-and-down, sucking out every drop of Flame's pre that came to taste upon her tong. The red dragon's tong lolled out of his mouth. His body went numb with pleasure, and he slugged against the pillows of his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlame's breathing became labored, as his climax was fast approaching. Flame started to buck his hips, deepthroughting the dragoness. She almost gagged, but was able to keep up with the pacing; sucking even harder then before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one finale thrust, Flame's large loud of seed spurted out of his member and into Cynder's mouth. Cynder could feel large glops of sperm shooting into her throat, and she happily drank all of Flame's love juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his climax was over, Cynder released the large dragonhood. Cynder licked the remaining amount of cum off of her chops, turned around, and lifted her tail and ass into the air. Flame's twenty three inch cock sprang alive with much friskiness when he saw Cynder's swollen pussy lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe licked his chops, and got up from his bed. He positioned himself at Cynder's rear. His cock was only a few inches away from Cynder's love tunnel. He looked at Cynder. With a suddictive grin on her face, she gave him a nod of approval. With that guster, Flame plunged his cock into Cynder's womenhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gasp of surprise left Cynder's mouth. Flame grunted as he slowly moved his hips back-and-throw. After getting fimiliar with Cynder's vagina, Flame started to thrust faster into Cynder. Soon the room was filled with the noise of moans and scales slapping against scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlame could feel the walls of Cynder's clit tense around his shaft. Cynder squirmed with delight. Flame's penis was absolutely heaven to her. Her cum started to cover Flame's penis. The red dragon's hips started to thrust deeper into Cynder's pussy. When the tip of his penis breached the her womb, Cynder's clit exploded with juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlame could feel his climax has arrived as well. But before he came, he ripped out his penis from Cynder's wet pussy, and started to jerk it madly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally camed, sending cum spurting everywhere. When they where finished, Flame and Cynder cleaned up their body's, and went to lay on Flame's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to massage Cynder's back, saying,\"That was fun, wasn't it?\" Cynder only smiled, responding,\"It was. You really have the penis of my dreams.\" Flame proceeded to massage Cynder's back, untill Cynder broke the silence again. \"Hey, Flame,\" she began,\" Do you remember those spell classes I took?\" Flame stopped massaging for a moment, and said,\"Yeah, I do.\" Cynder grinned. \"Well, I learned a few use full spells,\" she said,\" I was thinking of using them for sex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sparked Flame's interest. \"Sounds interesting,\" he bagan,\"We could use it. When sould I meet you?\" Cynder said,\"Tommorownight in my bedroom. I have to get the spellbook first.\" Flame grinned, saying,.\"Tommorow night it is.\"</span></div></div>",

As he rounded the last bent to Cynder's room, his mind trailed off to the night when he and she first started their affair with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashback:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a mild spring night. The last bits of winter snow had melted away, and the rivers of Avalar was free to spread their waters throughout the valley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was on a pathway, next to a large river, that Flame found himself walking on. But he wasn't just taking a simple midnight stroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was called here by a letter, but not just any letter. This letter was written by Cynder's very own paw. It requested Flame to meet her here in the valley; in the dead of night even. It was strange. Cynder would never let anyone meet her at this time of night. What could she possibly want from him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moons bathed the landscape in its pale white light, and Flame could see the black dragoness sitting on a hilltop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head turned when she heard the crunching sound of grass under Flame's paws. It was hard to tell, but Flame could see Cynder smiling at him. Her green eyes flashed in the darkness, giving her a slight ominous presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there, Flame,\" she greeted. Flame was at a loss for words, but, after wetting his lips, he said,\"Why did you call me here?\" It was a little bit too forcfull then Flame really intended, but it was not like Cynder at all, and, for reason, he expected a trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder sighed. \"Alright, I'll cut to the chase,\" Cynder began,\" I want to have sex with you.\" Flame was shocked. \"Why,\" he asked bewildered. The dragoness stood on all fours and walked towards Flame, tail and ass rocking sideways in a seductive manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, come on, Flame. I know you have a crush on me,\" she said, coming closer and closer. Flame felt nervious sweat run down his head. He backed up, but felt his body collide against a boulder, blocking his any means of escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinning his shoulders against the rock, she said,\" And I'm about to make your wishes come true.\" With that, Cynder moved her head down Flame's frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder gave Flame's pouch a lick, ceausing him to moan loudly. His penis started to erect itself from its hiding place, slowly growing to its full hardness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder's eyes went wide when she saw shaft's size. \"It's huge!\" she exclaimed. Flame blushed at the compliment, and said,\"Bigger then Spyro's?\" Cynder nodded, saying,\"way bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed ahold of the bobbing organ and started to stroke it lovingly. Flame licked his chops. He placed his paw right under Cynder's and started to stroke his penis aswell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to rapidly increase Flame's orgasm, and soon he and Cynder was pounding away faster and faster on his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPre-cum oozed out of the tip of his member, couting their paws in a shiny clint of sticky sap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm close,\" Flame said between his panting. Cynder didn't say anyting in return, but only moved her head closer towards his cock, giving his loins a long lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis send Flame overboard. He climaxed, sending cum flying everywhere. Thick glops of cum fell on the two dragons, covering them in its liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Flame's climax subsided, Cynder stoos up, ans said,\"That was fun, wasn't it? If you come by tommorow, we can get more serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Cynder flew off, leaving Flame behind on the hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashback end:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memory made Flame smile, if not horny. He gave a few knockes on Cynder's door. A moment later,Cynder opened the door, and she invited Flame inside. Happely, Flame steped into the room, closing the door with his tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Flame started to play with her sex, saying softly into her earholl,\"So, what about thos expansion spell you talked yesterday?\" Cynder gave him a horny smile, custering for him to roll over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did so, and exposed his large shaft to Cynder. She stroked his dragonhood, making Flame moan, and she started to utter strange words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlame didn't understand the language, but he suddenly felt more horny then ever. He witnessed his cock grow in size. His already twenty three inch cock grew longer and thicker. He felt his loins swell with seed, forming into tight balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was done, Flame's erection stood a proud thirty inches in the air. He stood on all fours, his large dick slapping on the mattres, and a grabbed Cynder's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave her cunt a few licks, lubrocating it.

Cum leaked out of Cynder's vagina, soiling the sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a roar, Flame camed into her womenhood.

The sun was rising over the mountains, shining its golden rays over the landscapes of Avalar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at the beautiful sight of the sun rising, a satisfied smile spread across Ignitus' face. They had done it. Spyro the dragon, alongside Cynder, had fulfilled his destiny and vanquished a great foe and repaired the world, just like he had trained him to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough scars lingered and it would be a long time before every trace of the Dark Master's terror would vanish into history, but Ignitus was glad that all the effort and sacrifices if him and others were not in vain. The world was at peace now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while longer the red dragon stared out the window before yawning again and rising to his feet, but he winched in pain. The bandages around his middle concealed nasty burn wounds, which he had sustained while traveling through the Belt of Fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nearly died transporting Spyro and Cynder through, but on the last stretch he was able to pull through, nearly exhausting all his energy, and make it to the other side with a scorched middle.

Or maybe it was because-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's quite enough, Volteer!\" Cyril cut in, giving the yellow dragon an annoyed glare, \"No one wants to hear you perpetual babbling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At ease, Cyril,\" said Ignitus, taking a seat next to the looming form of Terrador, \"I find his praise rather flattering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolteer stuck out his pointy tongue playfully, and Cyril snorted a puff of frost. \"Where is those moles with our food?\" he said, changing the subject and glaring to the door that led to the kitchen, \"They are masters at construction, building complex architecture in months that would take others decades, but they struggle to make simple meals, the nerve!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm yourself,\" said Terrador with his baritone voice, \"They will arrive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a bit cranky today, Cyril,\" Ignitus observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally he's always cranky, in my opinion,\" Volteer said, but he was ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has something to do about Spyro and Cynder being too long gone, hasn't it?\" the red dragon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue dragon sighed. \"Yes, it is,\" he said, \"They had been gone for more than a week now. I'm beginning to wonder if it was a bad idea to give them this vacation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they did deserve it,\" said Terrador, \"They did save the world, after all. Besides, being gone for two more days isn't so bad. They'll so up eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so,\" Cyril mumbled.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That was why Charter was surprised to see them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something must have happened while they were away,\" he concluded, studying the two dragons, trying to find evidence of injury or disease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when he found none, he thought: \"Okay, perhaps they found something cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Charter was wondering why the two dragons returned home so early, Flint jumped from the table and ran towards Cynder, hugging her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynder!\" he cried happily, his arms wrap around her chest, not quite reaching around. \"I'm so glad that your safe...er, I mean your back.!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it came to the black dragoness, Flint had a far too strong relationship with her: he had a crush on Cynder.

Its shape was a Old European Cut, sparkling in the little sun there was in the room. But what really interested Charter was the fact that it kept shifting color from red, blue, yellow, green, and many more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was mesmerized by its beauty, and for a moment he had a urge to reach out and snatch it away, but he resisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never seen anything like it before,\" Charter finally said, \"Do you know what it could be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro shrugged. \"Don't know,\" he answered, \"That's why we're taking it to the guardians to be examined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure that's a good idea,\" Flint suddenly said, causing everyone on the group to be slightly startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so small that he had that ability to go unnoticed for a while, and when he acted he could scare a few people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, what if something goes wrong?

Spyro never knew why the guardians gave him a larger chamber. He guessed it was because they though he deserved a little more than others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if it was so, the room was still perfect for what they wanted to do. Dragging a nearby round table to the center of the room, Spyro place the Gem on it. The door was closed and locked, and the curtains were drawn in front of the windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" Flint said, \"But how do we figure out how this thing works, exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave that to me,\" Spyro said, \"The guardians taught me how to scan things a while back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro stood in front of the Gem, his body stiff, his eyes shut tight, looking like he was concentrating really hard, which was exactly what he was doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others made themselves comfortable on the nearest cushions, watching Spyro with great interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body suddenly began to glow.

Spyro noticed that there was a disturbance in the frequencies that the object was sending out, and he opened his eyes and saw the young drake's paw nearly inches away from touching the Gem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Spyro yelled, pulling his paws away and trying to stop Flint, sending the Gem into some state of instability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too late.As soon as the child made contact with it there was an almighty thunder clap. With a cry, Flint was shot backwards, landing on one of the cushions in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fliiiiiint!\" screamed Charter, rushing towards his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body was smoking and even more blackened by soot. Electricity ran over the surface of his scales for a few moments before it disappeared completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharter felt hot tears come to his eyes as he held his brother's limp body in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flint, please, say something!\" Charter cried, his voice wobbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro and Cynder stood nearby, watching anxiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...was...,\" came Flint's weak voice, \"AWSOME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of relief washed over Charter as his brother sprang to life, his eyes wild with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do that again!\" he exclaimed, trying to run towards the Gem to touch it again, but his tail was caught be Charter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, no you don't!\" he said sternly, \"Your going to the infirmary.

I've heard and seen some gory training accidents of a dragon's element backfiring on them. It's really a miracle that Flint's snout wasn't blown off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharter had to lie about what happened, for he felt the need to protect the Gem's identity for as long as possible.

I've got much work to do. And remember: use your elements wisely!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro and Cynder were waiting outside the infirmary. The purple dragon paced restlessly, but he stopped when he saw Flint and Charter walking into the hallway and towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And?\" Spyro asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doc says he's fine,\" Charter answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I told you!\" Flint said, glaring up at his brother, but he was ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he'll need a good bath,\" Charter continued, tracing a line along his brother's back, rubbing the soot between his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know!\" cried Flint, \"We can go to the place that you promised to take me to swimming in today. I can wash off there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, no,\" said Charter, his expression turning stern, \"You almost got yourself killed today, and the community pool is a place to cool off in and relax, not to take a bath in! We also don't know if that blast might have some aftereffects on you. The doctor might have given us the green, but we're staying here incase something bad happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No \"buts\".\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Flint turned his disappointed face to the ground, Cynder spoke: \"Besides that, what are we going to do with the Gem? We know now that it could be very dangerous when it wants to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's best that we take it to the guardians,\" Spyro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your decision is just as good as mine,\" Charter said, \"I'm going back to my room to clean Flint up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then,\" said Spyro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving each other a nod, they parted ways.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was on days like these that Dimitri felt very smug indeed. The black dragon twisted his thin, elegant body, the scythe on the tip of his tail flashing deadly in the midday sun, flying through the hoops and not missing a single one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wooden bullseye appeared suddenly, but he was ready, his maw open and blasting it to smithereens with his dark fire. Below he heard cheering from his classmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri grinned. There was nothing better than attention and praise to the black dragon. It was like music to his hears. It made him swell with pride, made him feel important, made him feel proud to be the son of two living legends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlying around the last bend, he gracefully touched down on the ground. He basked in their praise for a few moments. Most of the class were applauding, some shouting things like, \"Wow, that was amazing!\" and, \"I wish I was as good a flier as you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few dragonesses winked at him as he passed to receive his grade, which he returned with a charming smile, causing them to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done, young dragon!\" Terrador praised, his booming baritone voice sounding throughout the Flying Grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri's smile grew even bigger. He was sure that he would bag at least 100 percent on this physical test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You managed to fly through every hoop, knock down every target, and did it in record time to boot,\" Terrador continued, \"A- for your effort!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri's smile dropped like a anchor. \"But that was perfect, sir,\" he said, \"Shouldn't I get full marks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was very good, Dimitri,\" the Earth Guardian said calmly, \"but not perfect. You were a little slow on your turns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could that be possible? He was one of the best fliers in school, perhaps even in Avalar, or so he claimed to be. Dimitri wanted to argue more, but he decided against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead he hung his head in defeat and said, \"Yes, Master Terrador.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he left, the class applauded again, for Dimitri had received the highest mark so far, but this time he didn't feel and prideful. Instead, their praise now annoyed him and he only wanted to get away. Him, not getting full marks...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a series of raised cylindrical platforms on one side of the Flying Grounds, each varying in size, which acted as a strange sort of benches. It was where the students were to sit when their test was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReclining on one of the platforms, Ash watched his grumpy friend approach with his bright blue eyes. The black dragon took a seat next to him, mopping in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the long face?\" asked the maroon colored dragon with a smirk, \"You did great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great? Great!\" exclaimed Dimitri, \"I did every single thing right. I should get full marks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Alright, don't get your horns in a twist,\" said Ash quickly, \"In my opinion, I think you were just showing off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black dragon snorted. \"You're just jealous that I got better marks than you,\" he retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" Ash said with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri didn't say anything. He looked at his friend through the corner of his eye for a few moments. Ash was the son of an odd pair. His mother Ember, a pink dragoness that was a healer, and his father Flame, who was an enthusiastic collector of dangerous artifacts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh had his mother's bright blue eyes, his father's golden crest, and the scale color that was a mix between red and pink, resulting in maroon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, he shouldn't be one to talk. Dimitri was too a child from a strange pair as well. Despite being famous, the Legendary Purple Dragon and the former Terror of The Skies seemed to be an unlikely match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri carried a lot of his mother's features, including her sharp blades, black and crimson coloring, and green eyes, but he had his father's handsome face and horns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he and Ash were best friends since they were hatchlings. They were growing up together and shared the popularity Dimitri had inherited from his parents and his ariel skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite their friendship, Dimitri couldn't help but notice over the past few years that Ash was a little unusual. He was, for some reason, very disinterested in females.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was odd. He and Ash were 16 years old now, entering that uncomfortable phase that they were warned about for years at school when there hormones began to kick in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri thought that he would be able to escape this awkward stage in puberty, but he received the full brunt of it. Every morning he woke up to a boner, and his thoughts drifted away to sex and females whenever he dared to daydream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ash was different. For example, Dimitri pointed out the sex-appeal of a pretty, pearly white dragoness with feathery wings, who was currently doing the ariel test, but Ash only said in a bored tone, \"Sure, she looks good, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when a tall, well-endowed earth dragon named Titus stepped up to take his examination, Ash's interests sparked. Dimitri didn't want to sound paranoid, but he was beginning to think that his friend was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school bell suddenly rang, plucking Dimitri out of his thoughts. He was surprised how much time had gone by while he was thinking. Shaking his head, Dimitri followed the class out of the Flying Grounds, Ash at his side.</span></div></div>",

He just saw it at something pointless, a waste of his potential. He wanted to be out there, to fly around, fight dangerous foes like his parents did at his age, do something useful with his life, not be stuck behind a desk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it was up to him, the black dragon would have dropped out of school a long time ago, but he was forced by his parents to continue his curriculum. But despite his hatred, Dimitri found that there was one subject that he liked, and it wasn't one that you would easily expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was history, perhaps the most tedious subject at school for many, and it would have been to the black dragon as well if he didn't find his teacher so entertaining. Volteer, a yellow and blue dragon who was the Guardian of Electricity, made the subject fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice was never monotonous, even if he had a bad day. His lectures were full of energy and he made jokes every now and then about topics that Dimitri found amusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ash, on the other hand, rarely listened in class. He said that it didn't matter, for he couldn't understand what the yellow dragon most of the time said. Apparently it was so for other dragons as well. With such a wide vocabulary, he could understand why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri didn't know why he could understand the yellow dragon so clearly when others couldn't. His father could interpret what Volteer said though. The black dragon guessed he must have got it from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bright smile on his face, Volteer entered the room. \"Good day, young dragon!\" he greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class muttered their greeting back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is absolutely splendid, marvelous, stupendous to see you ones more,\" he continued, \"Now, before I begin with today's lesson to enrich your developing minds, I need to make an announcement first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class sat up a little straighter.

The Electric Guardian was always so optimistic and fun, occasionally raising his voice and looking serious to keep his class under control. This meant that what he was about to say was very important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'A troubling activity amongst us young ones', eh?\" thought Dimitri to himself mockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had heard that phrase said many a time by other teachers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's probably going to lecture us about flying in the hallways again,\" whispered Dimitri to Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maroon dragon chuckled and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this is far more complex than a few rebellious drakes and dragonesses flying down the hallways and injuring themselves,\" said Volteer, as if he heard Dimitri, \"What I'm talking about is a sort of fornication culture emerging amongst you called Snake Balls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri raised his eyebrows. Snake Balls? What the hell was that? It was the first time the black dragon had heard of it and his interest spiked. Whispering broke out. Drakes grinned at each other while dragonesses giggled behind their paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri frowned, wondering what they knew that he didn't. He looked over at Ash and saw that the maroon dragon was shifting in his seat, looking uncomfortable, like he was hiding something. It only served to make the black dragon even more suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At these \"gathering\", I am told, there is much under age drinking and usage of dangerous substances,\" continued Volteer, \"Which brings me to the second thing I want to discuss with you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yellow dragon walked over to his desk and pulled something out. Holding it up high so that the whole class could see it, Dimitri saw that it was a very small bottle that contained red liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dragon Drive,\" stated Volteer, \"It enhances ones libido and it is specifically designed for beings that struggle to perform. It is medicine- powerful medicine, something that shouldn't be taken lightly, yet it is at these \"gathering\". We have several perfectly healthy young dragons hospitalized for growth issues because they overdosed on this substance.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm giving you all a stern warning,\" Volteer said, looking at his class very seriously, \"Anyone that is linked to these infamous \"gatherings\" or found in the possession of Dragon Drive would suffer being expelled and even face criminal charges.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, pushing these dark matters aside, let's begin with today's lesson!\" the yellow dragon said cheerfully, his seriousness disappearing in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Dimitri only half listened to the lesson. He couldn't stop thinking about what he heard. Dragon Drive, Snake Balls. Why didn't he, the most popular kid in school, know anything about this? Why did the rest of the class seem to know, judging by their suspicious reaction?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh seemed to be hiding something too, for he kept squirming in his seat. There was something up and Dimitri was hellbent on finding out.</span></div></div>",

Taking a view deep breaths to steady himself, Ash looked around the courtyard, as if to make sure it was so silent and deserted as it appeared to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" he said afterwards, \"but we've got to sit down. It's a long story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey found a stone bench and sat down on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another deep breath and sighing, Ash said, \"Last year, when I just turned fifteen, I was invited by a couple of dragons to one of these Snake Balls. It's very secretive, for obvious reasons, and they only trust a few dragons with the location. They invite a select few dragons they think they can trust not to tell on them, and I was one of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how was it at the party?\" Dimitri asked, \"I'm sure you had a blast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, It was like Volteer described it,\" said Ash, rubbing his neck, \"There's drinking, Dragon Drive and lots and lots of sex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, you definitely had a ball,\" said Dimitri grinning, \"You're definitely NOT a virgin anymore. You probably banged every girl in that place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh bit his lower lip, looking very uneasy. \"I-I guess you can say so,\" he said, his paw moving to his rump and rubbing it, \"But it's not something I'm proud of doing. I mean, the sex was great and all, but when the excitement wears off after a while you kinda feel guilty of doing something so rebellious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where is the place?\" Dimitri asked, \"Do you know when the next Snake Ball's gonna take place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The place doesn't have an exact location,\" Ash said, \"It keeps moving to avoid it from being busted. And yes, I do know when and where it's gonna take place.

Basically, it was the dragon's equivalent of Athletics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother sport was Tail Ball, where the players had to slyly steal away a ball from another dragons tail and throw it into a net to score a point. Dimitri had heard that his mother had been part of it when she was a little older than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was it. There was some unofficial hybrid versions, but they weren't much fun.

Now, I don't know much about this new sport, and rightfully so, seeing that I'm simply just a history teacher, but I at least know that it's called Ru-Ka, which, roughly translated to our language, means hoop-ball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolteer walked to his desk, opened his drawer, and pulled out a stack of papers. \"Now, these pamphlets will give you more information about the sport, where and when it takes place,\" he continued, handing out the papers to his class, \"If you have any other questions, I advise that you report to Terrador, who I have heard will be the couch for Ru-Ka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Volteer arrived at his table and gave him one of the pamphlet, Dimitri practically snatched it out of his hand and began to read it earnestly. It was a strange sport, promising many bruises, cuts and serious injuries, but it looked very fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA series of paragraphs and illustrations explained how the game worked: one team, depending on what circumstances, obtained a ball, and they had to fly it through a large hoop at the opponents side of the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like one of those hybrid sports, a mix between Air Dashing and Tail Ball, but instead of slyly depriving someone of the ball, players had to do it by brute force!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri was giddy with excitement. Finally a sport where he could show off his ariel skills and physical strength at the same time. He could imagine it now, standing victorious before a crowd of applauding dragons, battered but showing off his trophy or medal that he won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Ash, Dimitri saw that he had a dreamy expression too on his face, indicating that he had the same daydream of glory. The black dragon grinned. He could tell without asking that Ash was going to enter along with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nO, what fun this was going to be!</span></div></div>",

Terrador took him aside to speak with him privately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Dimitri,\" said he, \"but Ru-Ka demands certain qualities of its players. Unfortunately, you lack those qualities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but what do I lack?\" the black dragon said, finally finding his voice, \"Am I not fit enough. I'm the best flyer there is in Air Dashing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that,\" said Terrador, \"But you must understand that your body structure is not meant for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What wrong with it?\" Dimitri asked, glancing at his sleek, muscular body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For starters,\" began Terrador, \"when you where weighed, I found that you did not make the minimum weight. Your a little short as well. Young one, please understand that I'm not discriminating against you. Your very fit, but your body structure isn't meant for a game like Ru-Ka. It rough and often dangerous. Trust me, I've seen it a few times myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri looked at the small group of dragons assembled in the Flying Grounds. Some were tall, others very muscular, and two were chubby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut only one thing mattered: they were all bigger and heavier than the black dragon. Heck, even Ash got in, and he, Dimitri realized for the first time, was only a few inches taller than him and weighed only a few pounds extra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maroon dragon was categorizes as a \"lightweight\" in the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri sighed and hung his head in disappointment. \"I understand,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good dragon,\" said Terrador, \"There's no use crying over this your whole life. The best is now just to move on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri nodded sadly as he left the Flying Grounds. He didn't want to stick around to watch the practice, for he was too disappointed to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black dragon sighed heavily and sat on a stone bench outside the school's entrance, which was bathed in the orange rays of the late afternoon sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven from here he could here the shouts of the players, cries of joy as a goal was scored, and Terrador barking orders. It only served to make Dimitri feel worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo light, hey?\" Body structure not meant for this, hey? It was ridiculous. How could he be denied this? The black dragon was the coolest dragon at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the rules were the rules. He could do nothing about that...but he could do something about himself. Dimitri's raised his head as hope returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, he could bulk up, but how was he going to do that? Well, he could stuff himself with sweets and turn into a fat ass or train excessively and gain muscle, but even doing that would take a lot of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to be on the team now. But how? Just how? Then it hit him. A grin worked its way on Dimitri's face. He jumped off of the bench and raced back home.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When he got home, he didn't greet his mom, which was odd, for he always greeted her when he got home, and said to his little brother, Sunder, to stay out of his way, something else he rarely did, for he had a good relationship with his brother, which made the stocky, younger dragon very concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri went to his room and lay down on his bed, frowning angrily. He could hear thunder outside, the weather reflecting his mood. He fell asleep after a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the storm raged outside, the magic of the spell finally took its effect. As the lightning flashed, Dimitri rolled his body in his sleep, which was gurgling, morphing and swelling outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis member emerged from his sheath, soon as hard as a rock and several inches bigger than it previously was. His balls were swollen with cum too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he moaned, experiencing the greatest wet dream of his life, his voice got a pitch deeper, shooting out a glob of seed so hard that it the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(The next morning)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri woke up with a yawn and climbed out of bed, feeling strangely heavy this morning. It's when he walked by the mirror he froze in his tracks, his jaw going slack and eyes wide<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri noted that his room's mirror seemed smaller than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he ignored, for what was reflected in the mirror was far more important.  In the mirror, a young dragon with a chubby face stared back at him, befuddled.  One thing Dimitri notice most was that he was a fat ass, and he meant a fat ass.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon's entire form was padded with draconic blubber. With a good majority of said blubber focusing on his ass, hips and thighs. That giant booty and extremely plush hips could be seen around his plump gut no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet despite the flab, Dimitri could feel that he was packing on heavy in someplace else, that place being between his thick thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thought went through Dimitri's mind:<br>\r\n'Holy ancestor's asscheeks it work!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Dimitri notice how hot and bothered he was and how heavy his crotch was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed release, and badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri turned his rear to the mirror, craned his thick neck around and lifted his tail, and he was met with another surprise. His balls had swollen to the size of grapefruits, his huge black penis fully erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri grinned. \"This is awesome!\" He shouted, \"I can't wait to show this bod at school. I can finally make the team now. But first, I need to bust a nut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Dimitri left his room to go to school a few minutes later, his mirror was soaked with jizz.</span></div></div>",

I can see you really want this, but I'm cautioning you since you might already be bigger than anyone on the team. And as the biggest you could hurt someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrador lead the way to the locker room so Dimitru could change into a spare team uniform for the tryout. While there the black dragon took the time to look at himself in the mirror. Impossible as it seemed he looked even bigger than when he'd left home that morning. A billowing stomach hung past his knees and his shoulders had broadened considerably. His neck and tail were both tapering cones of fat on a round jiggling orb of a body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spell had worked too well it seemed, and as Dimitri struggled to get into the clothes (made all the harder since dragons rarely wore anything) he worried about the thin ice he was on. If he was potentially the biggest that meant he could throw his weight around well on the field. But if he hurt someone bad he could get kicked off the team. He'd have to be careful not to injure anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he finished dressing, the clothes ill-fitting on his massive body, he resolved to go back and check the book again and re-read it more thoroughly. Maybe he could adjust his weight to something more preferable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Dimitri tries out and is accepted onto the team, however their first game is the next day. Dimitri hurries to get the book from the school library but finds it's closed for the weekend, he won't have any way to get the book for the next two days... And he's still growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Dimitri is accepted onto the team but after their first practice he finds his balls refuse to settle down. He's horny. Desperately so. And after working himself out in the shower he leaves, embarrassed. Unaware the scent of his seed begins to have an effect on the rest of the team, causing them to fatten up as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Dimitri does his best at the tryout but thanks to the new weight he's too slow and stiff to keep up. Terrador apologizes that he can't put him on the team, but suggests there's something else he could do instead.</span></div></div>",

More like lard mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The huge dragon was a veritable blob. Every shuffling step seemed to shake the stone room ever so slightly, the solid rock bouncing under his feet. Every heaving shuffle dragged a golden belly along the floor and caused at least five chins along his front to bounce and wobble as round cheeks made it impossible for the dragon to see anywhere besides directly in front of him. His seemingly tiny wings even looked thick with added pounds. if he could actually fly with so much weight it would be nothing short of a miracle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um, nice to be here,\" Jake muttered with a smile to the class that dimpled his big cheeks, \"I can't wait to be a part of this class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's wonderful to have you here Jake,\" Volteer smiled with no hint of irony in his voice, \"Now find a seat and once you're comfortable we can begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wow, were you ever right,\" Dimitri muttered to Ash as the heaving mound of scaly blubber dragged himself to the nearest stairs as several students scooted over to make room for the huge figure, \"Talk about a whale. I didn't know dragons could get that big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah... me neither...\" Ash replied, but there was something about his voice that drew Dimitri's attention as he looked at his friend. the maroon dragon was looking at the newcomer, not with disgust or shock but with what Dimitri could only describe as 'wonder'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey... You alright?\" Dimitri asked snapping Ash out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huh? Oh! Yeah, yeah I'm fine,\" Ash blushed as he tried to refocus on Volteer as the lesson began, but his eyes kept drifting over to where the massive mound that was Jake sat, arms resting on a ball of a belly that could have held all of Ash inside with room to spare.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The mess hall was a cavernous place, large enough to hold hundreds of dragons. It was a popular social hub, always filled with talking, laughter, and shouts. But today it was strangely quiet. The only noise breaking the stillness was loud slurping and belching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were all staring at Jake, who's whole rump took up one side of a bench that was meant to seat four dragons. It bowed under him terribly, greatly groaning in protest, ready to snap at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table was piled high with dishes as Jake devoured every massive meal before him, showing no sign of stopping. There was an endless stream of moles running in and out of the kitchen, bringing him food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany wondered if the red dragon was going to deplete the school's entire stock, Dimitri being one of them. He was watching Jake with disgust, wondering why a dragon would ever let himself go like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh, on the other hand, was staring at the red dragon with fascination, as if seeing a rare and beautiful jewel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, I think we should go and sit with him,\" Ash said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea was so silly that Dimitri thought that he was making a joke. \"Yeah and be crushed to death when he trips and falls on us,\" he said, grinning at Ash, expecting him to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he didn't. The maroon dragon glared at Dimitri, clearly not amused by his remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not serious, are you?\" Dimitri asked, his grin dropping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, I'm serious,\" said Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why?\" Dimitri said with shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because he needs a friend,\" said Ash, \"And I highly doubt anyone around here would talk to him, judging by the way they're looking at him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He looks pretty happy on his own,\" said Dimitri, looking at Jake who was happily munching on his seventh helping of cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're missing the point,\" said Ash with a sigh, \"Everyone's going to shun him around here, so it's up to us to at least make him feel welcome. It's the right thing to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't want to come, it's fine by me, I understand,\" Ash continued, walking towards the corpulent red dragon before Dimitri could say anything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black dragon struggled with himself, debating whether he should leave his friend and have his image undamaged or risk Ash being angry with him. He finally decided to go with Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral dragons gave him curious looks as he walked by, following the maroon dragon. He threw them a nervous smile and ignored them further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jake!\" called Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red dragon stopped eating, swallowed his mouthful of food, and looked down at Dimitri and Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking away the grease from his bloated cheeks, he said warily, \"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we sit with you?\" Ash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Jake said slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two dragons climbed up on the bench opposite of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Ash and this is my friend Dimitri,\" the maroon dragon introduced himself and the black dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you. Okay, Ash and Dimitri, what do you guys want,\" said Jake, trying not to sound rude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" said Ash, \"We figured you need a friend, so we came to talk to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and also ask you a few questions,\" Dimitri suddenly said, \"Like why the hell are you so fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black dragon was genuinely curious why the red dragon was so enormous. Ash shot him an angry frown, but to their surprise Jake only laughed, slapping his belly proudly, the contents inside sloshing loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because where I come from, bigger is always better!\" said Jake with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" said Ash, fascinated, leaning on his elbows. \"Tell me more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake began to talk about his home country, where your size determined your status and sex appeal. His people were absurdly tall, grotesquely muscled, and, like him, enormously obese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was absorbed, listening to every detail of what Jake said. Dimitri was only half listening, looking over his shoulder. All the other dragons were staring at him, looking at him strangely. He even saw some snickering. He blushed a little and looked away, wishing that he could just get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So, what do you say?\" Ash said to Dimitri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" he asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, do you want to hang out with Jake after school?\" repeated the maroon dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe both both staring at him hopefully. Dimitri bit his lower lip. He didn't want to ditch his friend, but he didn't want to look like a loser either hanging out with a pig of a dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did he do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had lied to Ash, telling him he had non-existing ariel stunts to practice tonight, in order to avoid hanging out with him tonight. He despised deceiving and ditching his friend, but what could he do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople would think that he's a weirdo when they saw him with that lard-sack of a dragon, Jake. But still, laying to his best friend just because he didn't want his image damaged. It felt like kicking a puppy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was raining tonight. Dimitri was staring out the window, watching the droplets run down the glass. He sighed, turning his gaze away. It was cool and wet outside, but warm and cozy in the living room, a fire burning in the hearth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe atmosphere was calm, but it didn't help Dimitri stop thinking of his friend. As he sat down on a cushion next to his mother, a tall, elegant black dragon, trying to distract himself with a book, his thoughts drifted off to Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked out the window again, at the blurry image of the city of Warfang. Dimitri wondered where they were now. Apparently Jake knew almost every restaurant in the city, as he boasted a few hours ago in cafeteria, which was no surprise for it was the only thing he thought of, his belly always rumbling at the mention of food. It was so bizarre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of bizarre, Dimitri was constantly wondering what Ash saw in Jake. Granted his friend was nice with everyone he met, even the people the black dragon deemed uncool, which always annoyed him a little, but the red dragon was a bit too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake was so fat that it would disgust even the nicest of dragons. It truly baffled Dimitri. He was wondering why? Just why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother's voice pulled him back to the real world. Apparently he was pondering so hard that the strain was showing on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing,\" said Dimitri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it about your father?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri sighed inwardly. She had guessed wrong, but at the same time struck another sensitive topic. The black dragon had grown used to the fact that his father was rarely home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the purple dragon, it was his duty to protect the realm. The only times Dimitri saw his father was early in the morning, where he patted him on the head like he was still a kid or sometimes had a short conversation with him, often giving him advice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a rarity when he came home early, but then he was too tired to talk. Judging by the time, there was a good chance that his father would be home very late tonight. It made Dimitri feel lonely that he couldn't go to his friend either tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" said Dimitri, rising to his feet, \"I'm going to bed. Night, mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight, dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri flopped down on his bed, giving a heavy sigh. He watched the blurry image of the city outside and listened to the rain pouring outside until a dream less sleep took him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Whenever he went to the maroon dragon's house, he found that his friend was not there and was told that he left early to meet up with some obese dragon named Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri was worried. Did Ash find out that he had ditched him on purpose? Was he mad at him and was avoiding him? The black dragon was pondering just these questions as he sat under the large tree just outside of school, the usual spot where he and Ash always met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just had to wait here and confront his friend when he arrived. But Ash never did arrive. Dimitri waited and waited until the sound of the school bell ordered him inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's probably just late, that's all,\" the black dragon told himself as he made his way to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he walked into the rowdy classroom he found, to his surprise, that Ash was already there, chatting merrily with that sack of lard the was Jake. Dimitri frowned, feeling irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, hey there, buddy,\" said Ash cheerfully when he saw Dimitri approach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where were you?\" said Dimitri a little more sharply than he intended to, \"I waited for you, like what, an hour outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was taken aback. \"I'm sorry,\" he apologized, \"but Jake wanted a quick snack before school. That's why we couldn't catch up with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri looked over to Jake and saw that the fat dragon was munching on muffins from a big sack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" said Dimitri, his irritation fading, \"But why didn't you talk to me over the weekend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, me and Jake went to all kinds of places,\" said Ash, \"Most of them were restaurants, but sometimes they were places like hot springs. I'm sorry that I couldn't take you along. Jake always insisted that we go as early as possible and was too impatient to wait for you. If you're made at me I understand, but I promise to make it up to you next weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's okay,\" said Dimitri, finding it hard to stay mad at his friend, \"So, you two only sat on your butts the whole weekend and ate? Sounds a little unlike you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is,\" Ash admitted, \"I need to do some ariel exercise to get me back into shape. I think I've put on some weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment that Dimitri realized that his friend did put on some weight over the weekend. His ones slender middle was bulging a little, and his haunches seemed to take up more space on the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over at Jake and saw that he looked fatter as well. Dimitri wanted to ask move questions, but then Volteer entered the classroom, demanding silence.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was right behind me a moment ago, but now he's gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrador grunted, looking around the Flying Grounds again. \"Must be skipping class,\" Dimitri heard him say, \"I'll deal with that later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, students,\" he said, turning his attention back to the assembled young dragons, \"We're going to do another flying test today, but don't worry; this one will not count for your grade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri was too worried to fly today. Where was Ash? It wasn't like him to skip classes like that. He was beginning to thing that Jake was a bad influence on his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to find him. Dimitri snuck away when the aerial practices began. He did not care about them. It didn't count for his grade and he could afford getting into trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black dragon only wanted to find his friend. Dimitri didn't know where to look as he made his way down the hallways of the school. There was a few places he could start at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitchen was one place. Jake had only one thing in mind and that was food. He probably went to get a \"snack\" and dragged Ash along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second place was the library.

Jake never liked it when someone hated him, and when that person did he was hell bent on changing his mind, even if he had to apply manipulation to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was exactly what he just did to Dimitri. The cookie the black dragon was offered wasn't given to him by coincidence. It was specially made for him, laced with a special supplement that skyrocketed hunger and lowered metabolism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive batch of chocolate brownies was on standby, and Jake offered it to Dimitri. The black dragon bit his lip, hesitating, before his hunger urged him forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ate one. The another. Then another. And then another! Soon all the brownies were finished and Dimitri was eating everything Jake put in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black scaled dragon's relished the taste and texture, moaning in pleasure. But if you think the ample amount of food was able to sate his hunger, think again! It only increased it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake watched as Dimitri devoured his food, feeling very proud. Ash, on the other hand, was watching his friend with fascination, for the food he was devouring was affecting his waistline already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach sagged lower to the ground, and his limbs and butt bwooping thicker, his face growing more rounder, a second chin developing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was truly a fat dragon, lying on the ground, belly in the air, his former slim, elegant body a distant memory, covered in food stains, Dimitri's hunger was finally sated. And to prove that, he let loose a massive belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that he snapped out of his trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what h-happened to me!?\" he cried in horror when he saw his corpulent body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri tried to stand up, but found he that he wasn't used to his new weight, and fell on his back again, his whole body jiggling like jello.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You joined the fatass club, that's what,\" Jake said, playfully mocking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri growled. \"You did this to me!\" he yelled in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to pounce at Jake, but Ash waddled over and began to rub his belly, saying in a soothing voice, \"Hey, man, calm down. No need to get so worked up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to get worked up? Look what he's doing to you! Look what he did...to...me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri trailed off, calming down. These belly rubs felt kinda nice. He couldn't help but belch again, feeling some pressure being relieved from his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" said Jake just as soothingly, joining in on the belly rubs, \"No need to get so worked up. Being fat is okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being...fat...is...okay,\" Dimitri repeated in a trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake looked over at Ash and nodded at him. They had broken him in.</span></div></div>",

And there's so many good recipes I know... It's hard to chose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well take your time,\" Ignitus smiled, \"I won't announce the contest just yet, but I hope you decide before the week is up. I'm sure you'll win first place with whatever you make. In the meantime though, could you make another batch of those chocolate and marshmallow cookies for the teachers lounge? The last batch didn't go very far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say that barely made it down the hall,\" Ash giggled eyeing Ignitus' softer middle.

A cook off? Involving the whole school? Sure some of his classmates could barely boil water and Dimitri himself barely knew the basics of grilling food, but he was uncertain all the same. Yet despite his uncertainty that slight competitive edge he had was rising. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to win, not just for the adoration, but to take Jake down a peg. Some irrational part of his mind saw Jake stealing his friend away and he didn't want to risk that. But what could he do? He was no great cook.

Wearing a dark cloak, the black dragon made his way down the crooked streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"bad\" part of Warfang was a ghetto, a place young dragons were often told never to go, and Dimitri could see why. It was a smelly, untidy, lawless area. Ragged anthropomorphic animals, sitting around fires, stared as he passed curiously, making the black dragon feel uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear that a well-off person like him didn't belong here. He wanted to get what he came her for and leave as quickly as possible. This part of the city was infamous for crime and trafficking dangerous objects and spells. Dimitri was bound to find something that could help him win the contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spotted a shabby store, which had a wooden board above it that read, \"Magical supply store: dealing with all the mundane crap your to lazy or pathetic to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri went inside. He was greeted by the disturbing sight of dead abominations in chars, even stranger items that were no doubt magical, and massive books that looked as old as time itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shop had a dusty smell to it, and a few spiderwebs hung in the shelves. At the counter Dimitri spotted an old anthro fox, who was sleeping, snoring loudly and drooling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, hello?\" Dimitri said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox came awake with a jolt. He looked around in confusion until he spotted Dimitri and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, *Urp!* a customer,\" he stated, coming clumsily to his feet, slaving a bottle of whisky on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I *Burp!* get for you?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, do you have any cook books?\" Dimitri said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox looked at him for a few moments before bursting out with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There ain't no *Urp!\" cook books here,\" he said, \"unless your planning on cooking up a poison or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well your shop did say you sells stuff that helps people with mundane problems,\" said Dimitri, not happy that he was being mocked, \"Can you get me something that could help me with cooking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I *Burp!* can,\" the fox said, disappearing into the back of the store before re-emerging, holding a strange light blue crystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tapped it and out of thin air, to Dimitri's amazement, appeared a white humanoid creature, dressed in a apron and wearing a chef's hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This here is Chef,\" said the fox, \"Say hi, Chef.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiiiiiiiiiii!\" it cried happily, the pitch of its voice obnoxiously high. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chef can make and type of food as perfect as possible,\" the fox said, \"Make me some eggs for the dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okaaaaaay!\" Chef cried happily, and out of nowhere it pulled out a frying pan, some eggs, and a portable stove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a few seconds later it was done. Placing it on a plate, Chef gave it to Dimitri. He looked at it skeptically, sniffed it, and ate it. There was an explosion of flavor. The black dragon had never eaten anything so good in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap, it's delicious,\" he cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All done!\" Chef cried and disappeared in a puff of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! It exploded!\" Dimitri Cried in alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax,\" said the fox, \"They don't mind. These creatures have only one thing in mind: to make wonderful food, be complimented, and then disappear out of existence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much for it?\" Dimitri asked eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll give you a discount on it,\" said the fox, \"It costs one purple gem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri inhaled sharply through his teeth. That was expensive. He looked into his bag he brought with him and counted his money. He smiled when he saw that he had just enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there goes my year's savings,\" Dimitri thought as he bought the crystal.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His limbs were much thicker and his belly didn't have to be stuffed anymore to bulge outwards noticeably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt amazed Dimitri how only being friends with that butterball of a dragon could make Ash gain so fat. He looked like he gained thirty pounds over the course of a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I have some knowledge,\" lied Dimitri. \"I have a recipe that would blow all the other contestants out of the water!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right, I'm sure you're gonna win,\" said Ash sarcastically, \"Jake could beat you with his eyes closed.

He seemed to pull what he needed out of thin air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Dimitri found a dish for Chef to prepare. One was a dark chocolate cake that was four stacks high.

Many of the creations were sweets like cakes and cupcakes, but here and there were proper food like roasted ham or chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all looked very well made, and Dimitri was wondering if he would win. He looked at his muffins. They were a deep blue color, so flawless that they seem to be made out of plastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hoped Chef did a good enough job with this, for he had to win.

The last one was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there, my dear. How's things going here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder. Dimitri didn't expect that his own mother would be one of the testers.

The large, muscular purple dragon, with his many horns growing from the back of his head, giving them a crown-like appearance, was chatting with the Headmaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the way his father was peering around Ignitus, and when the fire dragon laughed, patting his bulging gut, Dimitri had no doubt that they were talking about his recent weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Spyro here refiled the black with new confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, you're one of the judges, after all,\" said Dimitri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder took one of the muffins and took a bite. The explosion of flavor that greeted her was like nothing she had ever eaten before. It was so sweet, the texture so smooth, and the center filled with dark blue jelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so juicy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly gobbled up the rest and ate another one. Cynder went for a third, but her son quickly swiped it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, mom, but I need to save the rest for the other judges, remember?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, I'm sorry,\" apologized Cynder, grinning sheepishly, \"Your food was so delicious. I don't know what got into me. I never knew you had such a talent for cooking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" said Dimitri, \"To tell you the truth, nether did I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we all have our hidden talents,\" said Cynder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they could continue their conversation any further, there was a sharp clinging noise. Ignitus had climbed on a raised platform and was tapping on a glass to get everyone's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you all could settle down and listen for a few moments,\" the fire dragon said, \"The voting is about to start. Can all the judges assemble here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta go,\" said Cynder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye, mom,\" Dimitri said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But before he did, he stopped when he suddenly got an idea to solve a problem he had been having lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned back and said to Jake, \"May I ask you a favor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing,\" said Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been having problems with my head chef that works in the school's cafeteria,\" the fire dragon began to explain, \"You see, he's been asking to go on a vacation, but I'm afraid that I can't send him, because who would supervise the food then? We need someone to take over his role for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm that someone, right?\" said Jake, catching on what Ignitus wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire dragon nodded. \"Yes, indeed,\" he said, \"You have a extraordinary cooking talent\"- Ignitus patted his bulging, stuffed belly to emphasize what he meant -\"and I believe you should share it with everyone else. So, what do you say? Would you take on the job?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake shrugged. \"Sure,\" he said, \"I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus smiled. \"Good dragon,\" he said, \"You will start next week. I'll make a few arrangements with the teachers to excuse you from homework and classes when it's needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, the fire dragon turn and left the kitchen. Dimitri, who had been eavesdropping, quickly hid behind the corner when he heard the Headmaster's approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched him leave, taking note that it wasn't just his gut that was growing softer but his whole body, before he crawled back to the open door to listen further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoohoo!\" he heard Ash cry in joy, \"You hear that? You're gonna be head chef of the school! You're really gonna make a name for yourself here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" said Jake, sounding just as happy, \"Can't wait to show off my talent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri crawled away. As he made his way down the hallway, the black dragon had time to think to himself. Jake was working himself pretty high up in a very short amount of time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeck, he had not even been here for a week and he's been promoted to serve the school food. After seeing what happened to Ignitus and his friend Ash, Dimitri feared what would happen to the rest of the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe he was just being paranoid. He had heard that the school had protocols in place to serve certain kinds of food. Maybe, Dimitri thought, he had nothing to fear and Ash and Ignitus was the only casualties of Jake's fatty food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked off when he heard the next bell ring, assured that nothing bad would happen and that he would soon get his friend back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know how wrong he was..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You're more than twice the dragon you were when he arrived.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maroon dragon paused and looked over his own figure, which was indeed larger. and hung almost past his knees. His limbs had thickened and developed new creases where fatty folds sagged. His rump was definitely larger, perhaps twice it's former width and jiggled with his every step. Even his cheeks had begun to round, giving his snout a stubbier more soft appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe I've indulged a little...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" 'A little'?\" Dimitri echoed in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...But it's hardly the big deal you're making it out to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the Elders then?\" Dimitri pressed as they joined the throng of students headed for the cafeteria, \"I heard this morning Headmaster Ignitus crushed his seat in class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,\" Ash muttered, \"Even the headmaster admitted it was old and creaking and could have broken at any time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the fact he got stuck in the doorway leaving class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Student rumors,\" Ash replied, \"Why are you so keen to paint Jake as the bad guy? Maybe he just makes good food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too good...\" Dimitri replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they even got to the cafeteria the smells grabbed them by the noses and spun the taps on their saliva glands wide open. In spite of himself Dimitri felt his stomach growl like a starving beast before he even laid eyes on the food. And when he eventually saw the food as he got into line it was an effort not to dash to the front and grab everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake had gone all out for his first day cooking for the student body. A normal meal consisted of a main dish like a hamburger, an alternative say a fried chicken sandwich, a side of fries, a couple cookies, and a packaged drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake's lunch however consisted of five main dishes: Pizza, spaghetti and meatballs, boneless fried chicken breasts, Salisbury steak, and fried lamb-chops. Five side dishes: Fries, scalloped potatoes, macaroni and cheese, chicken Alfredo, and chicken fried rice. And three desserts: Chocolate pudding, doughnuts, and small chocolate cakes. The latter of which were each the size of a small plate for each student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri wanted to resist, but by the time he got to the food he couldn't help himself and loaded up his overflowing try with one of everything. It was only after he walked away following Ash's bouncing rear and precariously holding the try in one clawed hand he realized what he'd done. His mind wared with his stomach over the issue, but by the time they sat down at a table his stomach had won and Dimitri shrugged as he dug into the delicious food. How damaging could Jake's meals actually be? </span></div></div>",

Dimitri was staring at himself one of the large mirrors that were in the shower room, feeling very worried as he examined the damage on his figure, turning sideways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne week: that was all it took to send the black dragon well on his way to join the fatass-club. His body had ballooned out considerably, his belly sagging lower, almost level to his knees, and, due to his \"snack\" earlier, his gut was quite stuffed, pushing outwards sideways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis limbs were, along with his tail, much thicker, but, embarrassing enough, the part of his body that was affected the most by his weight gain was his rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis two black butt cheeks were rising above him like two hills, his thighs thick. The only part of his body that escaped was his face and neck, which remained relatively slim, giving his body a pear-shape, but Dimitri knew that wouldn't stay so for long, that his handsome was was doomed to round out like the rest of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the name of the Ancestors did Jake put into the food?\" he wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was impossible to get so fat in such a short amount of time. The blubber-butt, Dimitri concluded, must have added something to his food to make it so fattening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, at the same time, the black dragon admitted to himself sheepishly, it wasn't completely Jake's fault. Ever since he dug into that meal a week ago, Dimitri found himself addicted to the red dragon's cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to take seconds, thirds and fourth helping, eating not to live but living to eat and enjoy the rich food. Though it was partly his own fault, his massive weight gain only proved Dimitri's suspicions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat suspicions is that? Jake was fattening up the whole school on purpose. What was his goal? That was still a mystery to the black dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Dimitri closed off the warm water that was pouring over his bloated body, grabbed a towel, and began to dry himself off, his body jiggling furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left the shower room and stepped into the assembly room, where the rest of the dragons that was part of the Ariel Dash team were packing up and going home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike him, the whole team had put on a serious amount of weight. It was one of the reasons why they were retiring early today, for a few players had passed out after some light exercises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all had gotten severely out of shape, and Terrador was far from happy. He was planning to whip them all into shape by the end of the month, but the team didn't feel very motivated, for the big green dragon wasn't in the best shape either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Ignitus two weeks earlier, he had a bulging gut and was showing signs of getting even fatter. It seems like no one was immune to Jake's cooking, not even the military-disciplined Terrador.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jake was waddled/walked out of the room and into the hallway, heading to the exit of the school, he bumped into...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: two orange mounds of fat portraying from the doorway. Oh no, not again! Ignitus got stuck in the doorway, and someone better grab some butter, smear him thick, and start pushing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: It was Ash, who's nearly as fat as Jake, who came to ask his friend for a favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3:</span></div></div>",

They stretched from one side of the door to the other and all the way to the ground. Only the scale pattern and the swishing fat covered tail overhead gave indication that they weren't some lard filled weather balloons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is someone there?\" Came Ignitus voice from the other side of the door, \"I could use a claw here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Dimitri snapped out of it with a shake of his head, \"Y-yes sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dimitri?\" Ignitus asked, \"Help me out here. Your Friend Ash just left to get some butter or something to get me through but any help you could offer would be greatly appreciated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Of course sit,\" Dimitri replied and cautiously put his clawed hands up on Ignitus right butt cheek. Trying to shove proved difficult though as his limbs sunk in almost up to his shoulders. In fact putting all his weight behind it left Dimitri pressing his cheek to the big dragons butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was embarrassing but Dimitri actually felt some part of himself stirr as he groped and shoved Ignitus' huge posterior. His face pressed so close his nose filled with a scent, not unpleasant, but like a mix of cinnamon and apples. It actually mas his belly rumble a little as he gave another heave against the wall of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear,\" Ignitus muttered between strains as he tried to help from his end, \"We've put off renovations long enough. This temple wasn't made for dragons of our size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri wanted to argue that of course it didn't since every dragon he knew had more than doubled in size in just the past week. Of course he knew it was pointless to do so. Despite bringing it up to the elders before they'd always been oblivious to the true cause of it somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't to say they were unaware of their own weight, Terrador had once grumbled something about there not being enough hours in the day for proper exercise, and Volteer blames no good methods of studying while moving, and yet none of them seemed to make the connection to the five to ten meals a day they were consuming from Jake's kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri eventually collapsed panting. Ignitus might have been a bit further through the door, but barely more than a foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri blinked and looked up to see he had company...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Ash has returned with butter... as well as more snacks from the kitchen he's eager to share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: It's Cyril, looking nearly as fat as Ignitus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: It's Jake, the red dragon looking smug and... thinner?</span></div></div>",

Ignitus this can't go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri stared up at the figure of Cyril, trying to take in what he was seeing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo put some perspective on the young dragons thought process, although he'd yet to have Cyril's class for the day he'd seen the ice guardian just the day before. And while he too had been affected by the cafeteria food he still had some semblance of his old strong and streamlined form hidden by a moderate layer of pudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stood before Dimitri now however the blue guardians belly hung all the way to the floor and squished between his legs. His blue scaled sides billowed out around them to the point they actually smushed into his girth. His back humped up slightly increasing folds around the joints of his wings and his expanded chest puffed out like a pigeons under at least three pumpkin thick rolls of neck fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo naturally Dimitri's mind was, to put it ironically, out to lunch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cyril? Is that you?\" Ignitus voice called from over his enormous rear end, which Dimitri realized with some shock came all the way up to Cyril's chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's me,\" the blue dragon sighed, his cheeks wobbling in the process, \"You've really wedged yourself good this time haven't you? I told you not to use the East gate, it's far too small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the most direct route between the library and the kitchen though,\" Ignitus muttered somewhere between irritated and a little whiny, something Dimitri never though he'd hear, \"Come on, just get me out of here. Ash isn't back yet and I'm going to miss tea time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sweet ancestors forbid you miss your customary cup of tea and cookies... and pastries, and maybe a pie or three...\" Cyril snarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're one to talk, Mr.Three-cakes-is-hardly-as-calorie-rich-as-five-cakes,\" Ignitus grumped back, \"Now are you going to help or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a difficult decision certainly,\" Cyril smirked playfully but in the end agreed to assist Ignitus in working free. Although even with his great strength working the massive mounds of the fire guardians rear only a few more feet were pushed through before he had to pause to catch his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri who'd been assisting was likewise spent as he looked between the two. You know,\" he muttered between gasps, \"This is all Jake's doing. Ever since he took over the kitchen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now stop it,\" Cyril admonished gently, \"Really Dimitri, jealousy does not become you. Jake is doing a fine job. I've never seen the students so happy to go to lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But everyone gets five and six servings of <i>everything</i>,\" Dimitri protested, \"Doesn't that seem weird?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Growing dragons need lots of good food,\" Cyril replied as if he were reading from a text book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad they're growing wider, not taller,\" Dimitri muttered, knowing both guardians would just ignore the comment. Somehow the blind spot to the dragons gains refused to budge, keeping Jake's position as head chef intact. Dimitri was certain it had to be a spell of some kind, but without the guardians help he had no way to test for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith still no sign of Ash Cyril had to resort to a technique that Ignitus greatly disliked. Using his ice power Cyril turned the door frame freezing cold with a layer of ice between the red dragons scales and the stone. As it quickly melted the slipper water helped to push the fat dragon butt the rest of the way through, though Ignitus grumbled the whole time about the cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri barely had time to take in the full size of Ignitus (which was very much pear shaped like himself) before the bells rang signalling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Time for the next class, Dimitri waddled with Cyril to it, taking in the sights of all the other expanded students on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Time for Lunch. A veritable rumble is heard through the school as every dragon who has lunch that hour (including Dimitri) hustles to the cafeteria to gorge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: The end of the day? Dimitri hasn't had his class with Cyril yet though and Ignitus explains they're cutting School days in have to go easier on Students. Cyril and Volteer teach one day, Terridor and Ignitus the next and so on switching off every other day.</span></div></div>",

He could feel the ground begin to temple ever so slightly beneath his paws and he bit his thick lower lip, knowing that he was going to embark in one of the most difficult task his school gave its student these days: getting to the next class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors of the classroom opened, and the student came waddling out, filling the hallway with their immense girth, only mere inches of room to spare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make way!\" Cyril ordered, \"I have a class to get to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the Red Sea, they parted out of his way, and what a sea of blubber they were! Everywhere Dimitri looked, he only saw chubby, fat and obese dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school wasn't facing an obesity crisis; it was facing a near-immobility apocalypse. And that wasn't an exaggeration. Many students were so fat that it was becoming hard to move for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is why a service had begun to spread amongst them. This service offered these dragons a ride on a stretcher to get them quickler to class. Of course, the payment the asked for carrying you around was food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now a few of these near-immobile dragons were being carried on stretchers, looking as high and mighty as kings, their skin littered with spots where their was no scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was another thing Dimitri noticed every student had now. Soft Spots, the called them. When they all began to gain weight, their scales couldn't keep up with their stretching skin, and now they had leathery patches on their bodies where the scales had yet to grow in. It was the dragon's equivalent to having stretch marks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri himself sported some of these Soft Spots, though, it wasn't nearly as bad as the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued to waddle behind Cyril's monumental rear, each butt cheeks sliding in a mesmerizing fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther dragons saw Dimitri clever way of traveling faster and fell behind him, walking after Cyril like a bunch of duckling after their mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri finally arrived at his class, the crowd of bulky dragons thinning out. Unfortunately, their was a females dragoness stuck in the doorway, the huge white globes that was her butt wedged between the frames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther dragons were sniggering at this while her friend, a chubby blue dragoness, was trying to push her inside with all her might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, the embarrassing show didn't last too long, for she finally came loose, crashing to the floor. Dimitri could!only shook his head and grin, a little amused at the sight. He also admitted to himself that she had a great ass. Maybe he could ask her out sometime...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDmitri sat at his table, which was thankfullly made sturdier and enlarged after many student complained about the chairs being either too small or breaking underneath their fat flanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students chatting with each other, their conversations centering mostly around food, quieted down when a big yellow mass of blubber entered the classroom, nearly getting stuck in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis yellow mass was Volteer, who was almost in the near-immobility rank. He had an interesting figure when he was fat, the weight centering itself in his chest in neck area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe result was that Volteer's head was being swallowed up by his rolls of neck fat, his chest spreading out so far that Dimitri was sure that he could lounge on it with room to spare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon, my robust pupils,\" he greeted the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students greeted him back, and he said, \"I'm going to do a little roll call, just to make sure that some students aren't missing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolteer called each of them by name, who responded immediately, but when he called out Ash's name, he was greeted with silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up and searched the classroom, seeing that the seat next to Dimitri was empty. \"Hmm, that's odd,\" he said, \"Dimitri, do you know where your friend is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri was surprised to find the seat next to him empty, yet he shouldn't be. The fat black dragon had been so preoccupied with his own problems that he had forgot to notice that Ash was spending less and less time with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri shrugged and said, \"I don't know, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA random dragon suddenly raised his paw and said, \"Sir, Ash is helping out Chef Jake with something very important. He has permission from the Headmaster to skip classes for it. But no one had said what exactly they are working on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if he gas permission, then he may be excused,\" said Volteer, \"Though, I am curious if what they are making. Maybe it is something delicious. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes seemed to glaze over as he began to daydream, most likely about stuffing his bloated face with food, but he snapped out of it, shaking his eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" he said, \"we have more important matters to worry about now. Please, turn your history books to page 10.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class and Dimitri obediently did this, but the bulky black dragon couldn't focus. Why was Ash helping Jake? More importantly, what were they doing that was so secretive?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would just have to wait and see...</span></div></div>",

The line for food was so long that for the first time since Dimitri could remember the second food station had opened up to help students through twice as fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food was as bountiful and high calorie as ever. Lasagna, meatloaf, and overstuffed burritos topped the days meal plan and whole gallon tubs of ice cream were offered as desserts. Everywhere Dimitri looked the young dragons were gorging themselves, many going back for refilled. Just in the time it took him to get to the front of the line he was sure several students he'd been watching had swelled a few inches wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet he couldn't stop himself from getting 'two, no three of everything' when he placed his order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guardians behind him each got their 'teachers portions' which amounted to ten times the students got per serving and had to be carted out on special wheeled trays to the teachers table. Volteer was already there, seat on his haunches and sporting a belly so round he had to sit sideways just to reach his plate. Terrador had yet to arrive (no doubt finishing putting away the athletics equipment) but he was sure to join the throng soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverywhere students packed in, in some places shoulder to shoulder as fatty sides rubbed against fatty sides in the too small seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo! Dimitri! Over here!\" The black dragon heard Ash's voice bvefore he saw him. As he made his way over he couldn't believe his eyes when he saw his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Ash is a bit bigger than Dimitri, so soft and heavy he's struggling to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Ash is WAY bigger than Dimitri.

It was Ash, who had grown so fat that he seemed to have lost the ability to walk, practically swallowed up by his own blubber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri was shocked at his friend's dramatic weight gain, who had been only obese just a mere week ago, far too little time to be reduced to immobility, but he wasn't surprised, for he knew that, judging by all the corpulent dragons in the mess hall, there was obviously something strange being put in the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was seated at a table, which was piled with food so high that it almost resembled a mountain, and the fat dragons, all of them male, were feeding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dimitri waddled over, the maroon blob began to speak, \"Come sit and eat with me.

Why was Jake asking him for help? They barely knew each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake? What does he want from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He,\" began Ash, pausing to take a bite of a sausage being offered to him, \"wants you to help him out at the parent-teacher's night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Parent-teacher's night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few moments for Ash to answer, for he chewed on a cupcake, swallowed, and then spoke, \"Yeah, don't you remember? They announced it a week ago.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri nodded, remembering. Overwhelmed by his changes and everyone at school, the black dragon had forgotten about the parent-teacher's night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, what does Jake want me to do?\" he asked, growing more interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He wants you to be some sort of announcer. You know, wear fancy clothes and call people's names,\" Ash began explaining, \"He's got this whole mid-evil royal court theme going on. Plus, I hear, he has something big planned as well, something very secretive. He doesn't want to tell anybody about it, even me. So, what do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri first instinct was to refuse, but his rational side of his mind quickly suggested otherwise. He could use this to get closer to Jake, find out what he's putting in the food and the \"big thing\" he's planning for the parent-teacher's night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it,\" said Dimitri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit!\" exclaimed Ash happily, \"I'll tell Jake.

To reassure himself that his reputation would be safe, Dimitri looked at his clipboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had all the names of the parents who had agreed to come, and the black dragon knew each of them by heart, for he had to rehearse them so many times that he was sick of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the many parents that were attending that night were Ash's mom and dad, Ember and Flame. Apparently his friend was coming along too, but how the maroon blob was going to get here was anyone's guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother parent stood out on the list, for it was the only one that didn't have a partner, and Dimitri knew why.

I hope that strange clothing you're wearing doesn't bother you too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri tugged at the ruff. \"It has its problems,\" he said, \"Anyway, don't want to disappoint you, pops, but you're not on the list.

Using a few weak but clever spell to conceal himself, he was able to sneak past a few mole chefs and other fat dragons, successfully infiltrating the supply room of the kitchen without drawing any suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple dragon was awed at the sheer scale of it. It was the size of a warehouse, if not bigger! Though, it should be no surprise, seeing how much everyone ate at this school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro, being busy handling the realms problems, repeatedly going on quests to save the world, and filling out endless paperwork, became aware of everyone's state when it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was first alerted by this the day his former mentor, Ignitus, payed him a visit. It was a shocking sight to see his near-immobile, moon-faced, pot-bellied father figure enter his office, holding a hamburger, nearly getting stuck in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Spyro printed this out, Ignitus simply laughed and said, \"I might have put on a pound or two, but it's nothing serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the purple dragon began to do a little digging and found out that the school had a new head chef named Jake, who had been fattening every student and faculty at a astonishing rate, much to Spyro's horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was this Jake? Why was his food so addictive, delicious, and so full of calories? And why was it that only he and his heavy-bottomed son could see the changes affecting everyone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore importantly, what was Jake planning for the parent-teacher's night? That's what he was going to find out as he walked past the shelves heavily packed with foods of all shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't easy. The place was a maze, and Spyro had to frequently make sure where he was in order not to get lost. As he explored the massive room, he came across something peculiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appeared to be some sort of machine, nearly twice the size of the purple dragon, humming softly, indicating that it was on. Gingerly, Spyro approached it. Could this be the thing Jake was planning?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were several hoses extending from the machine, he picked one up, studying it. His curiosity getting the best of him, he decided to place it in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he tasted something bizarre. It was hard to describe the flavor, but it tasted delicious. So much so that Spyro, after he reluctantly let go of the nozzle, watching some pink fluid drip out it and licking his maw, felt tempted to take another sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid he? What happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Spyro takes another sip...then another...then another...and another! Soon the purple dragon is drinking the pink fluid happily, his form swelling bigger and bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Spyro resists, leaving the warehouse, unaware that the pink fluid he just swallowed was about to have strange effects on his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis member drops out of his sheath, rapidly hardening, and every time he spills his seed, he gains a full fifty pounds of fat, but that, unfortunately, doesn't stop him from finding a large rear and hotdogging it, his favorite fetish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Spyro continues to explore the warehouse, but the pink fluid is having an effect as his body slowly changes, growing soft and goopy as he transforms into more of that pink fluid himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Something even more unusual happens?</span></div></div>",

Putting the hose back in his mouth it began to trickle in, a small flow less than that of a half-open faucet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Surely this could go a little faster</i>, Spyro thought as he looked about the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting a valve near the base of the hose he gave it a tiny twist and sure enough the stream increased to something more like a garden hose. Spyro moaned as he gulped mouthful after mouthful of the delicious fluid, even as warning bells rang in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow Spyro's belly began to lose definition, sagging and stretching as his golden belly scales spread over a developing gut. However that wasn't the only bulge on his body. Spyro blushed to find his member emerging from it's sheath, the feeling of arousal growing quite strong as he drank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting back on his haunches (already they had a new layer of 'padding') he reached under his new belly and began to stroke his member, all thoughts of his 'mission' forgotten. Shockingly he brought himself to climax in just fifteen seconds. This was quite the shocker for Spyro (who's personal record with Cynder was almost an hour) but even more shocking was just five seconds after that he was rock hard again and ready for another round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this time it was harder to get off, mostly because his belly was beginning to get in the way. Spyro looked at the dome that covered his lap like a big beach ball and blinked. Something was wrong here but he couldn't put his claw on what. And yet as he shifted his member rubbed against the underside of Spyro's belly and again the dragon came with shuddering pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome part of Spyro nagged at him that he should be doing... something. That he shouldn't be wasting his time. But he couldn't comprehend that. How was he wasting his time? He was eating and filled with pleasure. What more did he need? As Spyros belly jutted out further than his front legs could reach around, he looked at the valve again,The stuff from the hose was so delicious. He could take a bit more. He wanted more. <i>Needed</i> it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course trying to reach the valve was tricky. Standing up with his blubber thick back legs had him resting on his dough-ball of a gut. And trying to reach had him rock forward over it, with small kicks partially rolling him forward before he sagged back. Still Spyro was determined. he kicked, rolled forward... rolled back, and kicked a little harder the next time. It helped that doing so caused his member to rub againts his belly even more and every rock got his rocks off again as he continued to cream the underside of his scales. And with each rocking motion his thickened claws got a little closer to the valve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Spyro's claws brush the valve, spinning it ever so slightly and increasing the flow a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Spyro grasps the valve and manages to give it a good spin turning the strength up to that of a fire hose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Spyro manages to grab the valve... but it breaks off in his clawed hand, spinning fully open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Jake arrives, discovering the massive purple dragon and his attempts to drink more from the machine.</span></div></div>",

The chair she sat on was struggling to handle her weight, the legs visibly bending, and over the rim of the said seat Cynder's ample butt cheeks spilled over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly, round, taut, and the size of a yoga ball, was reaching towards the floor, gurgling faintly, pushing away the table that was heaped with foods of various kinds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer limbs were threatening to snap off the other pieces of jewelry she had, like her neck did with her choker, especially the one on her tail, for the appendage that was suppose to be thin and graceful was reduced to a drooping sack of fat that resembled that of a giant slug than a dragon's tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri was at a loss for words, not knowing how he would break the revelation to his rapidly fattening parent, and after a few moments of silence trailed on for too long, Cynder went back to devouring her seemingly endless meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, the black dragon turned away. He walked passed the parents with their children attending that night, who were all in various stages of obesity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hopeless, he knew, to try and convince them to stop, for they wouldn't listen and just laugh at him, oblivious to their swelling form, whatever spell Jake had over them too strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, unfortunately, Dimitri knew, this wasn't the worst yet, for the red dragon still had his big secret to reveal. He could only hope that his father had done something by now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a chair breaking pulled Dimitri out of his thoughts, and he saw that his aunt, Ember, had broken her chair under her sheer weight, crashing towards the floor, which undaunted her, for she went back eating a her food a second later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn't be the first chair to go. They were being practically massacred. Her husband, Flame, had expanded in a different way. Laying on a belly the size of a cart, he was yelling at an unfortunate mole who was serving him to fetch him another mug of beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was rather drunk, his stubby nose beet red, hiccuping and belching in each sentence. Lastly was their son, Ash, who seems to have abandoned every trait of his former species and now resembled a round maroon blob covered in numerous folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Dimitri, come here,\" he heard his friend say, and even his voice was different, for it was an octave or two deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black dragon approached him, and between the sets of chins and basketball-sized cheeks he could barely see two large lips wiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great party, huh?\" he said merrily, \"Why aren't you eating anything? Come on, man, join in the fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri bit his lower lip again, for he was very tempted to do just that. He was famished, but through sheer willpower he managed to eat very little. Even then he, the black dragon guessed, gained a good fifty pounds, his ruff growing tight and his butt cheeks lifting up his cape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks,\" he said, \"I got some things to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but you're missing out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri waddled away, deciding that he needed some fresh air. He went and stood on the many balconies of the school, the night air clearing his clogged head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stood there, gazing at the stars in the sky, something happened. What was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: He felt something long, warm and slick begin to slid up and down his fat butt, and turning around quickly, he saw, to his horror, that his father was grinding his ass, his purple cock huge...and it seems to be growing bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoice 2: A giant pink blob suddenly appeared, sliding towards him. At first Dimitri thought that it was jelly, but, on closer inspection, he could see his father's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, he couldn't fully clarify what he saw, for the blob sprang forward directly into his maw!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Jake slipped up next to him, the red dragon grinning and asked if Dimitry was enjoying himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Something else?</span></div></div>",

He thrash in his feral father's gripped but was unable to free himself.  Dimitri continue to try to free himself while trying to ignore the growing large hot shaft of his father's between his plump rump cheeks but failing quickly as the hot dogging continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything change when Spyro lowly growled, shifting his position.  Dimitri couldn't help but NOTICE a big hot tip poking his tight puckered and his eyes widen in horror. \"DAD, PLEASE STOP!\", Dimitri yelled, hoping this time his father will come to his senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hope was in vain as the beast that was Spyro eagerly growled and thrust his hips forward strongly, pushing his entire immense hard cock into his son's tight hot cavern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri's entire vision became hot white as he felt the burning dick of his dad penetrate him.  Dimitri felt himself lost focus on the world around him, of the beast molesting, and the sounds of it all felt so far away from him.  The only things he was aware of with clear clarity was pain, heat, and... pleasure.  Echoes of deep grunts and high pitch yowling reach him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a roar. A loud roar that shook him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then Dimitri that felt, for a lack of a better word at the moment, off.  He feels like he is... expanding?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Dimitri came back to the world.  The first thing Dimitri notice is that he felt FULL. Overly full in fact.   Second thing was the large purple scaled body with golden underbelly plating above him panting.  Last thing Dimitri notice that he too was panting while feeling sore and... satisfied?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Dimitri remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, what the fuck?\", Dimitri warily ask as his father that he was underneath shook his head, his entire body turning rigid and slowly look down at his son, horrified and confused purple eyes staring at Dimitri.  No hint of the savagery that Dimitri bear witnessed that short while ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Di-Dimitri?\",  Spyro ask, confusion and panic filling his voice.  \"Wh-what just happened?  Please don't tell me we...?\", he trailed off, looking at his son with a desperate hope that what happened was nothing a dream or fantasy.  But Dimitri also caught something else in his voice. What exactly, Dimitri didn't want to know at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That you were fucking wildly a few moments ago?  Yes that did happened Dad.\", Dimitri said tiredly, just wanting to power through... this and deal with it later hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1:  It was at that moment Spyro clutch his head, growling.  Before Dimitri could respond, Spyro snapped his eyes to him and Dimitri saw that the savagery was gradually taking over his father once more.  With what little control he had left, Spyro pleaded with Dimitri to run before he gets him once more as his shaft hardens and grow once more.  Dimitri complied and left to the banquet to hopefully get help to deal with the beast that was taking over his father. <br>\r\nBoy was he surprise what he find there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2:  After a awkward pause, Spyro broke the silence and explain what he found so far before he fell to... whatever took over him.  After explaining without looking at his son the entire time, Spyro suggested they split up once more to stop Jake and left before Dimitri can have a word with him.</span></div></div>",

It sounded, oddly enough, like someone trying to squish a large amount of pudding into a too-small container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri turned his head just as it reached it's loudest and the strange sight rounded the corner. The mass was bright pink and faintly transparent, undulating and jiggling very much like pudding and pieces of it rolled down the sides only to be reabsorbed. In short order it had filled the balcony doorway, which wouldn't have been a problem since Dimitri could fly, except he was frozen in shock with what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough drippy and goopy with horns sagging like melting ice cream, his fathers head, now a uniform shade of pink, sat atop the blob. With unblinking blank eyes, the face stared at Dimitri, and in one swift movement dove for his mouth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==========<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Just a short time earlier...</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro moaned as he clutched his stomach, the bloated mass filled with the pink goo from the machine. It was so tasty he still wanted more, but it churned in his middle like a rolling tide, sloshing from one side to the other as it left his insides feeling weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like they were melting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro gave a combination hiccup and burp as a dribble of that pink goo oozed out his mouth and he gave another groan. \"What... happening... to me...?\" he moaned, each word sounding a little more strained as his insides heaved and shifted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed help. Whatever that stuff was it was doing a number on him. He had to find Ignitus, get to the library, something. But just turning and starting to walk away felt like his whole body was made of molasses. By the time Spyro had worked his way out of storage, he was looking decidedly worse. His colors were paling, looking pinker in places. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached for the door but gasped as his limb bent unnaturally under it's own weight, his claws drooping, and with a wet plop his limb fell right off onto the floor, oozing pink goo from the stump. Spyro tried to grab it, but the limb just melted into the mass as the rest of his body was soon doing. Again he tried the door, but he was fast becoming too liquid to turn the handle. In a last desperate attempt her rammed the door with his whole body, but that just caused him to splatter like a dropped cake that was soon dissolved into mush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this state Spyro moaned and burbled as he could feel every inch of himself dragged along the floor and door as he tried to hold himself together. It was... surprisingly nice. He felt warm and loose, like after a really deep massage. But his thoughts were cloudy, unfocused. He'd promised he'd get back to Dimitri didn't he? There was some reason. But he couldn't remember what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, despite being unable to turn the knob, the mass of Spyro goo was able to slip under and around the door, squelching all the way. Yes, he had to find Dimitri. That thought rang in his mind. What he did when he found him... well, he'd figure that out when he got there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==========<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Back in the present...</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri gagged and gasped as he tried to fight off the stream of pink goo that poured down his throat. It wasn't that it tasted bad, if anything it was oddly good, but in a way he couldn't describe. The first word that came to mind to describe it was 'flurple' which also made no sense. And yet somehow fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it was his father, or had at least looked like him, and the mass had been close to the size of an adult dragon. Dimitri felt his belly rounding out as more and more of the pink goop flowed inside. The stream didn't let up as his belly rounded to a beach-ball size, then a yoga ball. Despite all his struggles every last drop worked it's way inside leaving the black dragon looking more like an appendage on a ball of a stomach three times his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh sweet ancestors,\" Dimitri looked at his gut horrified, \"I... I ate him. I ate dad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;I suppose you did.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri would have jumped but he was too bloated for that now, \"Dad? Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Yes I'm here,&gt; Spyro's 'voice' replied, &lt;I'm... inside you I guess? Not sure how this happened. Everything from the last hour or so seems fuzzy&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can talk about that in a minute, but are you hurt Dad? I'm not... digesting you or anything am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Well I'm not in any pain certainly,&gt; Spyro replied, &lt;Although... this does feel extremely weird. Maybe if I...&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro gave a mental grunt as Dimitri gasped, his massive belly shifting, some portion of the mass suddenly jumped up from his belly and into his muzzle. The black dragon's crossed eyes widened in surprise as his muzzle swelled, the bloated ip becoming bigger than his whole head briefly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt shrunk back a moment later though but the mass had migrated again and Dimitri felt the space between his horns, his brain cavity on top of his head, suddenly swell up like a beach ball was stuffed in his skull. Again the effect was only a moment before it sagged away again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Well that didn't work,&gt; Spyro muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad,\" Dimitri gasped, \"You're shifting your mass inside of me. Do you think...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: \"...You could expand my whole body to adult dragon size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: \"... you could find an exit somehow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: \"...we could find someone to tell about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Something else.</span></div></div>",

As his stuffed belly diminished in size, he also noted, with some confusion and alarm, that the world was shrinking around him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...No, it wasn't shrinking; he was growing bigger! As he grew taller, every part of his body swelled to disproportionate sizes, as if the were in a race to see who would look the strangest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this happened, Dimitri could only watched his expanding body in horrified fascination, trying his best to stay calm while his dad did his work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon things evened out, and the black dragon studied his figure. He looked exactly the same as he did a few moments earlier, though he was now much taller. Dimitri guessed that he was as large as a full grown dragon, if not bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dame, I'm huge!\" he exclaimed, slightly startled that his voice sounded a few pitches deeper, \"Are you sure that I should go in there like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, if we want to fix this we best hurry,\" said Spyro impatiently, \"You're at least mobile now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what will I do if the Guardians freak out when they see me?\" asked Dimitri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll worry about that when we get there\" he said, \"First, let's focus on getting through the doorway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri looked at the arched doorway and understood what his father meant. Like Ignitus, he would get stuck in the doorway as well due to his widened body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a a deep breath, sucking in his gut in weak attempt to slim himself down, Dimitri walked forwards, and when he moved the black dragon felt like a giant water balloon, his whole body gurgling and sloshing, his blubber shaking like jelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri thanked the Ancestors that he was able to move through the doorway, though his fat rump came very close to wedging itself in the small passage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Onwards!\" cried Spyro, \"We need to tell the Guardians about this before it's too late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut little did they know what awaited them inside. What happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: they were too late! Jake had already revealed his big secret and everyone had had a good gulp of the pink fluid. Now many blobs of various colors and sizes were shifting around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Dimitri entered the room, they immediately took notice and began to move towards him, with only one thing in mind: to be consumed by him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: They came across Ignitus, who, like always, had his rear stuck in a doorway, but this time he was facing Dimitri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he explains what was going on, Jake unravels his big secret. By the time Ignitus was freed and they enter the mess hall, it was too late! The blobs taking notice of them and slowly approaching them with only one thing in mind: to be consumed by Ignitus and Dimitri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Same as 'Choice 2', only they were far later. Jake has already changed all the dragons, consumed them for himself, and is in the process of growing into the biggest most powerful dragon ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Again, same as 'Choice 2', only they're in time, the other dragons haven't changed yet, but will they even listen to the now changed form of Dimitri? Can he and Ignitis convince them of Jake's plans? Or will both be drawn (by Spyro in Dimitri's case) to the food and unable to stop themselves from glutting with the rest of them?</span></div></div>",

Ignitus, bit bigger and fatter than ever, was stuck in the doorway by his rear. Again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Ignitus open chubby maw, seem either to question about what happen to Dimitri to become adult size or about to ask for assistance in freeing from the doorway. Dimitri clamped the chubby lips of the Fire Guardian with a thick paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care if this is rude, but right now isn't the time, one we are running out now. Yes it is me, Dimitri, me have proof that Jake is up to something sinister.\" Ignitus's eyes widen. \"If you don't believe me than let my dad convince you otherwise.\" Dimitri said, turning around and have his huge blubbery ass before the stuck elder fire dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus blush at being presented a huge plump rump, a rather eye catching one Ignitus secretly admitted, and ask the crazy tubby adult dragon that looks like Dimitri... And his jaw dropped and eyes widen in disbelief as he saw the black scaled butt flesh rippled and contorted until in bulge and form into a familiar face. Spyro's stern visage eyelessly stared at him before returning to beneath Dimitri's curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus look seriously at Dimitri in the eye.  \"Pull me and explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTook a while, but Dimitri pulled Ignitus out while explaining what happened with him and his father.  They made it to the mess hall just before Dimitri finished,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth were stunned to find what was before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of the mess hall and covered most of it and growing, lay Jake slurping up what appears to be a big gelatin blob. The last one from the looks of it.  Just as Jake finish slurping the dragon blob up, Dimitri realize it was Ash who was being consumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he finish, Jake notice them and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you guys missed the party.\", Jake said pleasantly, his entire form shook, jiggle and slosh as it swell immensely with no end in sight.  Faces of dragons of all ages' faces appear in his flab, as if trying to break free from their new existence as Jake's blubber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1:  As Jake gains control over the dragons that become part of his flab, gaining their powers as his own, Jake suggest that they surrender to him, become slime blobs and be devoured him as he grows to be the strongest dragon in the world. Dimitri and Ignitus refused and tried to stop Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2:  Just as Jake offer the two the chance to surrender, Jake suddenly groan out in discomfort.  Apparently, he was having difficulty controlling the dragons that become part of Jake's fatty flesh. Dimitri and Ignitus use this opportunity to defeat before he could gain the power of the dragons he devoured under control.</span></div></div>",

The red dragon was bulging with muscle, his head being practically swallowed by his beef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis chest, Dimitri was sure, was twice the width of a dragon his age should be, a deep valley forming between his pecs, and along his belly, the black dragon could see was a well-defined, six, no, eight pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's front legs were bulging with biceps that were at least the size of a mole's head, veins visible on the surface of the skin and throbbing, his thighs as thick as tree trunks and looking powerful enough to knock big trees over with one hard kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttached to his perky rump was a long tail, which, like the rest if him, was thick with muscle, something Dimitri never wanted to get struck with, for he knew the force would probably lunch him into space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black dragon had heard gossip that Titus could do push ups with three dragons on his back, but Jack looked as if he could lift an entire pavilion of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen spite the fact that he was dragon one could be easily intimidating by, a solid wall of hulking muscle, Jake bore a friendly smile on his face and gave the class with his paw, which seemed comically small compared to the rest of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, everyone,\" he greeted the class, \"Nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it is nice to meet you as well, Jake,\" said Volteer, smiling kindly, \"Now, please take a seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very floor trembled as he walked by, and Dimitri, surprisingly, stared Jake with disgust as he took a seat not very far away from them. Being a jock, the black dragon was quite used to being around well-built dragons, and he liked the motto of \"bigger is better\", but that had its limitations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake was so muscular that he, for Dimitri, had entered the realm of the grotesque. He had far too much of a good thing, as one would say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned forward and whispered to Ash, \"Dam, look at the newbie. He's a freak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ash didn't seem to listen. He was staring at Jake with awe, his mouth slightly open. Dimitri was alarmed when he saw red fluid leak out of the maroon dragon's noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook him, saying frantically in a hushed voice, \"Ash, what's gotten into you? Snap out of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did, blinking and shaking his head, saying in confusion, \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe realized the blood leaking from his snout and quickly wiped it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm fine, I'm okay,\" Ash assured his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" asked Dimitri skeptically, \"You had me worried there for a sec.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, I'm perfectly fine,\" said Ash, \"I was just...deep in thought, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, as they went back to their lessons, the maroon dragon found it very hard to concentrate. He kept stealing glancing at Jake, who, to him, was the most fascinating thing he had ever seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: After leaving the shower room of the dojo late that afternoon, Ash chances upon Jake, who gives him some advice, and that said advice could make him gain a considerable amount of mass over one weekend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: The same scenario as choice one, but it is Dimitri who encounters him instead of Ash.</span></div></div>",

His rump was the size of two inflated beach balls, the red globes almost perfectly round and shiny like a balloon. They quivered with each step he took, sliding hypnotically up and down. Dimitri's face curled up in disgust; he had never seen a sight so unnatural and vulgar. The red dragon was a freak in his eyes with his disproportionately large assets, and he leaned over to Ash to voice his opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geeze, look at that guy,\" he whispered, \"He looks like a complete freak with that hug butt of his. Do you think he gets stuck in a lot of doorways with that much backside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ash wasn't listening. He sat there with his maw hanging open, awed at the sight he saw. It was hard for the maroon dragon to believe that one of his most wildest and unrealistic sexual fantasies had come true, yet here it stood in all its glory in front of him as clear as daylight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that his friend was waiting for an answer, who was looking at him strangely after he noticed the faint pink tint on his maroon scales, Ash swallowed and said, \"Y-Yeah...I guess so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri regarded him with a raised eyebrow for a few moments and, though he thought his actions were strange, he decided not to ask questions, to ignore it, turning his attention back to the heavy-bottomed dragon standing in front of the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet all of you,\" said the red dragon, and Dimitri saw him wiggling his hindquarters in a seductive manner, his rump shaking like jelly, \"My name is Jake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it is marvelous to meet you as well, young dragon,\" said Volteer with a warm smile, \"May you have a fantastic academical year at our institute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also have a gift for you too, sir,\" said Jake, pulling out a strange flower in a pot from seemingly nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri had a feeling that he kept it stashed beteween those enormous globes of his, and he shuddered when he thought what else he kept hidden in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how thoughtful of you, Jake,\" said Volteer, both surprised and flattered, \"But I do say this is perhaps the strangest piece of flora that I have ever seen. Though, It does smell quite nice. I'll keep it on my desk. Thank you, young dragon! You may take an empty seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake smiled and did as he said, walking to the nearest empty seat, which was, coincidentally, right next to Ash, far too close for the black dragon's liking. The last thing he wanted was some freak near him. Ash, though, found himself blushing even harder. Those globes that spilled over his seat was so mesmerizing to look at, and he knew that it was going to be very hard for him to focus throughout this entire year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: When the Dimitri entered Volteer's classroom the next day, he was met with a surprise. The yellow dragon's rump had inflated overnight for some reason, and though it was not nearly the size of Jake's, it was quite large, each globe nearly the size of a basket ball...and they appeared to be swelling bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: A week goes by and nothing odd happens, but when the second week arrived and Dimitri came to school early one morning, he saw the gardens were planted with the same flower Jake gave to Volteer. At first the black dragon thought nothing of it, but as the day progressed, the rumps of both the faculty and students at the school were swelling larger and larger, the black dragon's butt growing the quickest and largest of them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Volteer wasn't the only one to be given this peculiar plant. It seemed every teacher in school received on. But as the days went by, all of their rears begin to expand, Ignitus' butt growing the quickest and biggest of them all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Something else happens</span></div></div>",

He refused to acknowledge the fact that he may be among that slowly growing number. Ash seems to be very friendly with Jake and spends a lot of his time with the young, big bootied, red dragon, both at school and outside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri reasoned Ash pitied the freak and was being extra kind to him. And he DID NOT feel jealous or envious when he sees Jake and Ash together, smiling and content with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when the second week started, something weird occurred to Dimitri's school.  On the morning of the second week since Jake arrived,  Dimitri arrived at school as usual and was befuddled at what he saw. In everyone single garden the school owned was only bearing the same flower Jake gave to Volteer on his first day here.  And everyone seem to like them as they admire or took a long sniff at them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri then caught sight of something more stranger than this.  Volteer.  Or to be more precise, his hindquarters. While not the most physical of the Guardians, Volteer was still considered well-toned and fit.  At the present, that might not be the case anymore as his once toned yellow buttocks seemed to be more roundish and puffy.  Even from far away, Dimitri swears he sees them jiggle and bobbed slightly as the electric elder dragon took a long sniff of the strange flowers.  Dimitri turned away in disgust, not noticing the eyes gazing at Volteer's noticeably plump behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the second week came to an end, Dimitri decide that something wrong is happening to everyone at school.  Everyone's rump are growing large and plump at a fast rate. Much as he hates to admit, so is his booty and seems to growing and fattening to be the largest for a dragon his size.  No one's is finding this butt growth startlingly or strange...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, they....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Choice 1:  Seem to actually like it and openly admires everyone's as well their own booties.

And don't get him started by what is happening to the rest of Warfang.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Choice 2:  Don't seem to notice it most of the time. Well not entirely anyway.  Everyone goes on their way as close as usual, trying not to let their eyes linger on tushies before them.  Dimitri knew something was gonna give way soon if this... booty growth continues.  It is high time for Dimitri to get to the bottom of this and he knew where to look first.  Jake.<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Although Ignitus was handed a bouquet of them at the end of the day, Dimitri never saw the always calm and friendly elder fire dragon blush and stutter a thanks before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile finding all of this weird, Dimitri decide not to delve into that weirdness for his own sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a week passes by and Dimitri regretted such a decision.   On the first two days that went by, he thought it was just his imagination but later he comes to realize it wasn't his imagination but actually happening before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery teacher who took a weird flower from the big bootied transfer student and took them home was gaining some junk in the trunk of their own.  Especially Ignitus.  The fire dragon's rumpus was swelling and rounding out to the point of being making one jiggly third of the fire dragon's entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what is weirder is that no one seems to notice... well that isn't actually true.  Every student does notice their teachers' swelling booties, but not shock or disgust... but rather appreciation and acceptance?  Dimitri was more weird out when he notice this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd was more startled to find even himself appreciating the swelling rumpuses at school, including Jake's.  Dimitri was disgusted himself and many others for those thoughts. And don't get him started at how disgusted he was when he let those thoughts wander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was going on, Dimitri knew, and he knew Jake was on the center of this butt growing epidemic.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1:   After the weekends were over, Dimitri trudge to his first class with a troubled but gloomy expression.  He was displeased when another of his attempts to make his mom or any adult that something was going at school failed again.  That expression and displeasure melted away to shock when he and few of his fellow students came across a fascinating spectacle in the form of a ripply pair of redish orange scaled spheres wedge tight at Dimitri's first classroom entrance.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2:  As the weekend began, Dimitri made his way to his home as usual, before saying goodbye to Ash. He didn't notice at how transfix the young maroon dragon was as he watch a certain transfer student's massive posterior wobble and shake, before joining said dragon's side with a blush and smile.  As he return home, Dimitri was trying to get his mind off of giant butts and try once again to convince his mom of something going a foot a the school.  All thoughts of that came to a halt as he bumped into something soft and squishy and  looked up to see two giant quaking masses of a familiar shade of purple scales. His father, Spyro, is back and he seems to pick a few things as well.</span></div></div>",

Dimitri and Ash walked side by side, the black dragon eyeing the plump rumps of some dragons with worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one wanted to believe him that something weird was going on, not even his best friend Ash, who had been eyeing these strange, swollen globes with growing interest lately, especially Jake's<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri decided that it was best to remain quite for now. As he parted ways with Ash, heading back him, his head hung low as he pondered what to do, he bumped into something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, he saw two spheres which had a similar purple color. \"Hmm, who's there?\" came his father's voice from behind these two spheres. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri looked at his father, or rather at his plumper caboose, with mounting horror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No dad, not you too,\" Dimitri thought in dismay as another adult fall to whatever weirdness is happening, watching his father's head turn and look over his muscular back and huge fat rump to see what bumped into him.  His purple eyes lit up upon seeing his son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dimitri!\", Spyro says happily, turning around which cause his fattened round buttocks to heavily sway and bounce hypnotically.  Dimitri couldn't help but be mesmerized of the show his dad's buttocks gave him right then and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you, my boy,\" he said, smiling warmly, \"let's walk home together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked down the street, Spyro asked him, \"how's things going with school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri bit his lower lip. He wanted to tell his dad everything, but seeing that his dad was yet another victim, he hesitated. ''Not much, dad,\" he said. \"Tell me, have you ever noticed something...odd lately?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro was quiet for few moment before he said, laughing, \"well, today a saw one of my co-workers get stuck in a doorway. Boy, his rump is sure big!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And don't you think yours is?\" asked Dimitri, unable to take it anymore that no ones cared about their huge amount of junk in the trunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave his dad's butt a poke, and he saw Spyro winch. \"Careful, son, this thing is sensitive,\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri ignored the fluttering sensation in his gut when he touch his dad's uber thicc rump.  \"Hu-huh?  I mean, sorry dad.\",  Dimitri stuttered, face blushing and look away from the big bouncing purple spheres before him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro thought how cute his son was acting and simply smiled at him before resuming their journey home.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving to their house,  Dimitri was shocked yet again. </span></div></div>",

For example, Cyril kept making mistakes in his lectures, and the class had to constantly point out his grammatical and spelling errors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolteer was very easily distracted today, which resulted in him arriving at his class fifteen minutes late, apologizing, claiming and giggling stupidly that he found something shiny and was just inspecting it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, he would stop in the middle of his lecture to look at something he found interesting and had to be brought back on track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was just to name a few.

How could he have not notice it before?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Jake's fault,\" declared the black dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh frowned. \"How is it the new guy's fault?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Dimitri didn't answer his question. He knew that it was pointless, for only he could see Jake's disproportionately large brain for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, he stood up and said, \"I'm going to follow him around after school and see what he's up to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ignored Ash when he cried out to leave Jake alone, heading down the hill, keeping a fair distance as he followed the red dragon down the streets of Warfang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Dimitri uncover?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He looked at Cyril, who was glaring at him sternly, and gave him a sheepish grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey, there, sir, what are you doing here?\" Dimitri said, saying the first thing that popped into his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I doing here?\" Cyril said angrily, \"Patrolling the hallways to catch rule-breaking young dragons like yourself in action, that's what! Why are you not in class? More importantly, why are you eavesdropping on Headmaster Ignitus' conversation? Have you no respect for someone else's privacy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't understand,\" said Dimitri, \"Jake is in there and he's up to something. I think Headmaster Ignitus is in danger or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Cyril shook his head. \"I have never heard so much nonsense in my life,\" he said, \"Detention for you, young dragon, for lying, eavesdropping and skipping class. And I'll make sure your father will hear about this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed Dimitri by one horn (the equivalent of being grabbed by the ear for a dragon) and was about to drag him away when cries of pain emanated from Ignitus' office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyril let go and went to check what was going on, Dimitri following closely behind. The black dragon caught a glimpse of a strange machine and both Ignitus and Jake clutching their oversized, wobbling brains before a bright light blinded him, the world instantly growing dark around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he woke up a while later, he found himself in a large and strange room. It had four walls painted in white, a ceiling that seemed to stretch on forever, and in the center was a machine that looked like a control panel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, where am I?\" he asked himself, standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGingerly he approached the control panel and saw that it consisted out of many buttons, switched and knobs. Dimitri didn't have the faintest clue what to do, so he pressed a flickering button that said \"on\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment he did this the world around him spanned violently, and he suddenly found himself back in the real world. But he immediately noticed that something was terribly wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was in Ignitus' office, and around him sat the Headmaster, Cyril and Jake. Their eyes were lifeless, drool seeping out of their mouths, and their cranium, even Jake's, had shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri had barely time to register what was going on when he felt a great weight pull on his head and he fell like a tree that was cut down, yelling, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe struck the ground painfully, and, with some effort, managed to stand up a while later, nearly toppling over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is on my head?\" Dimitri asked himself as he felt a great weight weigh his skull down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked slowly and carefully to a nearby mirror, trying to keep his balance, and what he saw in the reflection made him almost scream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked completely normal...except for his cranium, which had grown eight times bigger, nearing the size of a beach ball, bulbous in shape and covered in throbbing veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dimitri struggled to comprehend what was going on, despite his increased mental capacity that lay dormant, something odd happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: The world started to spin again and Dimitri was sucked back into his head, where Ignitus, Jake and Cyril were waiting for him. They were arguing furiously, trying to gain control over the control pad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Someone unexpectedly enters the office and saw what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Dimitri tries to leave to find help. Surely Terrador or Volteer would know what to do. However every dragon he passes has their entire mind and consciousness sucked into his head, their intelligence adding to his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Something begins to waken in Dimitri, the knowledge of the others starts to pour into his mind and his intelligence skyrockets.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly Dimitri put two and two together. Hes giving Cynder a hyper lesson, shes absorbing knowledge like a sponge! Indeed it looked as though Cynders brain was absorbing information at an incredible rate. While her brain at first looked like it was just barely spreading her horns, over the past hour it had perched them a whole foot above her eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake broke eye contact and seemingly finished his lesson.

Cant you see I'm busy explaining quantum mechanics as it relates to today's lesson, I mean, how don't you know about this Regina\" The female dragon she was conversing with seemed to blankly take in the impossibly technical lecture the super brained dragon was reciting. Dimitri watched as the veins on her head momentarily throbbed while Cynder began to sketch a diagram of colliding particles on her scratch paper.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynder, I need to tell you-\" Dimitri was cut off by Volteer. \"Ok class, time for a pop quiz!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri looked on helplessly as Cynders pencil practically burned through the paper as it scanned quickly across the page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done!\" Shouted the giant brained dragoness. She smugly whispered to Dimitri \"Man, that was an easy one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang, and Dimitri shuffled behind Cynder, his eyes drawn to the pulsing mass the help an unfathomable intelligence.

Mundane? Yes, that word was adequate if barely... such a funny thing words were... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked home for the day everyone seemed to be giving her a wide berth, and avoiding eye contact for some reason. Normally, this would bother her as she and Spyro had spent a lot of time healing wounds and reforging connections with the Dragon kind after the many adventures. Now though, it barely even piqued her interest. She kept walking the book in her telekinetic grip was flipping pages rapidly yet she was absorbing it... efficiently, and effortlessly. Just like that math problem earlier, \"So simple,\" she muttered as she continued on to her home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she read the advanced Thaumaturgical Studies of Elder Savolos the second she scoffed at some of his inferences and rolled her eyes at others. Savolos was a dragon from so long ago deemed to be a natural at Dragon magic that he'd written thirty books about it, but if this book was any indication, he was a fool, and even dumb! Cynder snapped the book closed with a thought, she still hadn't noticed anything amiss, no one said anything as the book floated along in her telekinesis effortlessly as she ascended the steps that lead to her home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such rudimentary thoughts from such... primitive minds,\" Cynder mused, briefly as the front door opened by her mental urging and archway expanded obediently to allow her enormous throbbing cranium access without discomfort before returning to its normal shape and the door shutting itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder sat at the desk in her room and let out a deep sigh. \"I do not know how it happened,\" she looked up into the mirror above her desk and lifted her claws, \"But I have grown an enormous brain, and rather than be concerned how, I merely wish to grow it further. To best achieve that I must visit the library but it is getting rather tiresome to walk around with this globe of a brain... I wonder what could be done about it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a telekinetic tug she pulled a spellbook down from her bookcase and flipped through it memorizing it's contents before shoving it back into the shelf... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing in there... maybe,\" her vein riddled noggin throbbed as she pulled out the extra thick scroll of ancient potions and unrolled it and again memorized it in one casual observance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, these might work,\" she mused looking at two spells in two different parts of the scroll .</span></div></div>",

Hell, I think you had a broken leg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did?\" said Ash, surprised. \"Come to think of it,\" the maroon dragon said, rubbing his chin, \"they did say I should have come worst of it, but for some reason I only sustained minor injuries. It's very odd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it is,\" said Dimitri, \"but the most important thing is that you're okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so,\" said Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey heard the sound of the bell ringing in the distance. They made their way down the hallway to their next class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" Dimitri continued as they walked, \"what happened while you were in the air before you crashed? I was...distracted a little when it happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, I don't know,\" Ash said, shrugging his shoulders, \"Something weird happened to my wings when I was up there. They, well, deflated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deflated?\" Dimitri asked, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Ash, \"they went all flat and stuff. It was really freaky. Anyway, I kinda lost function of them and fell. They're okay now, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wiggled his wing to show him. Dimitri didn't talk for a long while, his mind processing what he had heard. Deflating wings? Twisted limbs that sprang back to normal as if they were made out of rubber?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shuddered, for it reminded him about the strange dream he had, where Ash was as flat as a pancake and he inflating him like a balloon with his massive amount of cum...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething very strange was going on.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To the black dragon, he was exactly as he ones heard Volteer describe him: an old fart of a dragon. He didn't know why but the blue dragon was always on his case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyril always tried to humiliate Dimitri by throwing sly remarks at him. Sometimes it worked, leaving the black dragon's pride injured, other times he managed to give a clever retort, leaving the class laughing and receiving a detention because of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut today wasn't Dimitri's lucky day. He was shifting his his seat, his clawed hand scratching between his legs. He didn't know why but it felt unbearably itchy, and the more he scratched the more hot and itchy it got, like some sort of bee sting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri's movement caught Ash's attention, and he asked, \"Hey, what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so...itchy down there,\" Dimitri said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment that Cyril, who was writing his lesson on the blackboard, turned around and looked at the black dragon sternly. He had been watching him from the corner of his eyes and observed that he had been paying little to no attention to his lesson and scratching between his legs under his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyril had waited for the right moment, and now that it had arrived he said, \"It seems like my lesson is a little too boring for you, isn't it, Dimitri?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black dragon looked up and quickly replied, \"N-no, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then pay attention, young dragon!\" he said sharply, \"And I would appreciate it if you don't scratch your...jewels in my class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his horror, Dimitri realized that he was absent-mindedly scratching between his legs while the whole class was looking at him. They erupted laughter, and the black dragon wished the ground would open up and just swallow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was recess after English, and Dimitri was the first to leave class, glad that Cyril didn't call him back, but he couldn't avoid a few remarks being thrown at him. Ash followed him, struggling to keep up with his friend's brisk pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey came to a stop in a deserted hallway, and Dimitri let his anger loose. \"Stupid old goot!\" he shouted, \"Who does he think he is? Humiliating me in front of everyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you were scratching your junk in class,\" Ash pointed out, \"It was rather obscene.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri shot his friend a glare. \"I can't help that this thing's itching like crazy,\" he said, \"It's been so since we left the infirmary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, seriously, you need to go to a doctor for that,\" said Ash, \"It could be serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine!\" Dimitri snapped, \"I'll meet you outside. I'm going to the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked off, leaving a very worried Ash behind. Still scratching between his legs, the black dragon entered the bathroom and walked to the sink. He washed his face and and decided to wash between his legs, just to make the heat die down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then he felt something strange, a strange pressure like he had a full bladder. Only, the feeling was in his balls. Lifting one leg to investigate, he was met with a shocking sight. His balls were swelling larger and larger, the orbs making sounds that resembled that of a gurgling water tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his balls reached the size of softballs, his black member emerged from its pouch, fully erecting itself. Dimitri watched with a open mouth as his sudden growth stopped, his testicles the size of grapefruits and his member several inches longer than its previous size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: One of the bathroom stalls open and a dragoness emerges, and Dimitri realizes, to his horror, that he's in the girl's bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Ash enters the bathroom, worried about his friend, and finds Dimitri jerking off his huge boner, trying, but failing, to reach his climax. Ash might assist him find that problem...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Dimitri can't resist exploring his new size and finds his new member is not only bigger, but more sensative. In fact, it takes hardly anything to set him off and when he cums his member and balls start growing again.</span></div></div>",

Ash was only a few feet behind him, though he struggled keep up with his friend's pace, who seemed be ready to break the sound barrier as he ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow down!\" the maroon dragon called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" shouted Dimitri back, \"You speed up! Those fruit are selling fast, and if I'm not there in time they'll have nothing left. Again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only two things in the world that could get Dimitri this excited: one was a major ariel tournament, the other was the arrival The Cart, as the other students liked to call it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cart was actually a portable shop that brought exotic foods from all around the lands, such as sweet meats, candies, and strange fruit that, to Ash, seemed to have come from a different planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of those strange fruit were dragon fruit, something Dimitri was wild about. It was one of those few times that the black dragon tossed away his pride temporary to get that tasty treat, for the majority of dragons who bought at The Cart was mostly very young.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlder dragons saw it as silly and childish and only went if their siblings nagged at them enough. As expected, the area outside the school yard was packed with hatchlings, all waiting to place there orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere and there were older dragons, most likely brothers or sisters that were accompanying their younger siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit!\" Dimitri cursed, stamping his foot on the ground when he saw the long line, \"It's going to take forever to get to the front.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what could he do? Dimitri had to wait patently for his turn, growing more anxious each minute. After fifteen minutes he arrived at the front, but was met with a big disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, all sold out,\" the mole said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri felt his heart sink into his stomach. \"Come on,\" he whined, \"There has to some left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the mole only shook his head. \"Nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black dragon stomped away. He was furious. This had to be the third time this month that he was denied his treat. He just wanted one piece of dragon fruit. Was that too much to ask?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dimitri, feeling very defeated, headed to the benches in front of the school, one of which Ash was sitting on, he spotted a chubby, green hatchling who was munching on the very fruit he was so desperate to obtain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the several other half eaten fruit, it was obvious that he had bought and eaten a lot of them. So, Dimitri thought, \"Why should that fatty have anymore? He had eaten enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black dragon walked up the the hatchling and, as he was rising his paw to take a bite out of a fresh piece of dragon fruit, Dimitri snatched it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" the young dragon cried in surprised, \"That's mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now it's mine,\" Dimitri sneered, sticking out his pointy tongue at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hatchling burst out in tears and ran away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" said Ash, frowning angrily at him, who had watched the whole scene, \"Taking candy from a kid? Dick move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" said Dimitri, his mouth half full, \"That brat had enough to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black dragon wanted to take another bite, and the maroon dragon wanted to argue further, but then something happened that took both of them by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh saw a dark green blur, and Dimitri felt the air knocked out of his lungs as something crashed into him. The piece of dragon fruit flew out of his paw. The black dragon rolled across the ground, coming to a halt when he bumped into a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you think you can pick on my brother, you big jerk!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDazed, Dimitri stood up and looked at the being that had assaulted him. It was a muscular, dark green dragon, who was a head taller that the black dragon. Behind him stood the same green hatchling Dimitri had stolen from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis anger beginning to boil, he growled and said, \"Yeah, I did. You fatass of a brother had enough to eat, you stupid brute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you!\" the dark green dragon roared and charged at Dimitri like a steam train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the black dragon easily avoided him, years of ariel practice kicking in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stands still!\" the green dragon shouted, trying to ram Dimitri with his horns but missing every time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, chunky, can't catch me? Too fat?\" the black dragon tainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only served to make the bigger dragon even more mad, and he charged at him faster and with more fury. Now Dimitri only barely avoided his attacks. He knew that he won't be able to go on like this for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he had an idea. Jumping before the wall again that he had struck only a few moments ago, Dimitri stuck out his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, from now on I'll take food every time from your brother,\" he tainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sent the dark green dragon over the edge. With a roar he charged at Dimitri with such fury that he could have killed the black dragon if he didn't jump out of the way at the last moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bigger dragon struck the wall, sending a shockwave through the school so powerful that it felt like, to the people inside, that it was hit by a tremor, leaving a large crack in the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStumbling around, the dark green dragon clutched his throbbing head. It was now Dimitri chance to fight back. He charged at him, knocked him over, and pinned him down, holding him in a powerful headlock that threatened to choke the bigger dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For hell's sack, man, stop it!\" shouted Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Dimitri shouted back, \"I'm not letting go until he says he sorry for challenging me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let go, Dimitri, before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ash couldn't finish his sentence, for they heard the voice they dreaded the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop this immediately!\" Terrador's voice boomed over the yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragons, who had been watching the fight and pushing it on by chanting the word \"fight\" over and over, began to run away in fear of punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get out of here,\" Ash called over the noise, trying to pull him off of the dark green dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Dimitri didn't move. He remained motionless, staring with wide eyes full of fear. He would have moved if it was only Terrador coming down those steps, but it wasn't. It was Terrador AND his father. The purple dragon didn't look happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This was usually a sign that something important was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus' voice began to speak. \"All students, including the faculty, should assemble in school hall immediately to hear a very important announcement,\" he said, sounding quite cheerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students and faculty began to make their way to the school hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think the announcement could be?\" asked Ash, walking next to Dimitri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black dragon shrugged. \"Dunno,\" he said, \"but from the tone of the Headmaster's voice, I don't think it could be anything bad.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students took their seats on stone benches that stood below the stage, where the school's faculty sat. Headmaster Ignitus was there, watching the young dragons enter with a kind expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen everyone was seated and things had quieted down, Ignitus began to speak. \"Young dragons,\" he began, \"we do apologise that we had to interrupt your daily schedule to bring you this announcement, but it's quite important, like I said, and you may also like it a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Headmaster spoke, Dimitri noticed that their were three dragons on the stage that he had never seen before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to introduce you to three new members that will join our faculty,\" Ignitus said, \"They will also be hosting new clubs that you young ones can sign up for. Without further delay, here they are: Magnus, Bubba and Draco.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus stepped out of the way, and the three new dragons stepped forward. Dimitri raised his eyebrows. Their looks were quite interesting, but not too unusual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The first one was an orange and yellow dragon, who was quite short (even a fully grown dragoness would be taller than him) and obese, his big belly hanging almost past his knees. He had a strong jaw and handsome face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second was was taller and very muscular, even by dragon standards, his body rippling and twitching with power. He seemed even stronger than Terrador.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis blue scales had strange markings, and his underbelly was white. He also had a handsome face,but was slightly disfigured by scars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last one was the tallest and very thin, a cloak covering his lavender colored scales. He wore glasses and had long beard growing from his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, there was something odd about him. His head seemed a little...too big, like someone had stuffed some cotton inside his cranium. But maybe it was just naturally so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Magnus,\" said the short orange dragon, \"I'll be giving you cooking classes for whoever wants to join my classes Saturday afternoon. Also, I'm the head of the Lard Society Club. For does who want to put some meat on their bones, come and join me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Bubba,\" said the buff dragon, \"I'll be the assistant who will be helping Terrador during your training sessions. Also, I'm the head of the Musclehead Club. If there's anyone who want to become as big and powerful as me, don't be shy. sign yourself up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thin dragon stepped forward. \"My name is Draco,\" he said, speaking very sophisticatedly, \"I will be assisting your History and English teacher, Cyril. I am head of the Bookwyrm Club. Please, if there is anyone who would like to discover the infinite wonders of literature, sign yourself up and join today.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new dragons went to take a seat and Ignitus stepped forward again. \"That will be all, young ones,\" he said, \"You have chance to sign yourself up for these clubs this coming week. You can registrate yourself outside. Have a good day, students!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crowd had formed before the notice board, where students were trying to register themselves for the new clubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to sign yourself up?\" asked Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup,\" said Dimitri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich one did Dimitri choose?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Dimitri signs himself up for the Lard Society Club. He was interested in what they do. It could be interesting to get fat on purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Dimitri signs himself up for the Musclehead Club. He was hoping to get as buff as Bubba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Dimitri signs up for the Bookwyrm Club. He isn't very book smart. Maybe this club could help him.</span></div></div>",

The trees seemed dead, their branches bare and their wood black, yet, she knew, they were alive and well, and that it was just their appearance thanks to their surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolteer was right: this place had an eerie atmosphere. Of course, Spyro could have told Cynder that any day. He spent his childhood growing up here. Standing next to her on the mushy ground, the purple dragon scanned his surroundings. He was uneasy. And why blame him? Anyone would be nervous in a landscape as spooky as this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like the perfect place for some kind of abomination to lurk around. Perhaps the thing that were causing these explainable disappearances, the reason why the Guardians had sent them on this investigation, was hiding somewhere in the mist, waiting to pounce on them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder wanted to complete this mission and get out as quickly as possible, but she knew that it wasn\u2019t going to be easy.

She knew Spyro wouldn\u2019t aprove fighting amungst the members of his search party. He, also, was the one who suggested that Ember should tag along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive her a chance, Cynder,\u201d Spyro said before their departure from Warfang to the Misty Swamp, \u201cI heard she\u2019s a good fighter amd very talented at healing. She might be very useful to us in case of an emergency.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder doubt that this pretty dragoness, the daughter of some wealthy duke, would be of any use to them. The only thing that she did was complain about her surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter shaking the mud from her paws, Ember walked up to the two waiting dragons and stood close to Spyro. Far too close for Cynder. The black dragoness had heard somewhere that Ember was a big fan of the purple dragon, that she often fantasized being his lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, she had never made any moves towards him that she didn\u2019t know of, but Cynder still kept a close eye on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now she decided to focus her attention at the task at hand. \u201cSo, where should we go first?\u2019\u2019 Cynder asked Spyro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple dragon narrowed his eyes. \u201cWell, there are a few places we could start,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThere\u2019s set of caves that way.\u201d He pointed to the North. \u201cOr,\u201d he continued, turning and pointing to the East, \u201cthere\u2019s jungle that way.

She could barely look in Spyro's direction without the black dragoness threatening to attack her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber felt that Cynder's attitude towards her was just silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro nodded. \"And you, Cynder?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll vote for the caves too,\" she answered, the bitterness evident in her voice, \"I have no choice, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's go,\" said Spyro, spreading his wings and taking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey followed him, keeping him well in sight and being careful not to fly too high over the mist canopy, for they would get lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the sight of the mountain came into view. There were several caves on the mountain's side, and it was hard for the three dragons to choose which one to enter. Finally they decided to go into the one which, to them, seemed the biggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd big it was! Ember swore a large boat could fit inside with room inside. Also, it had a spooky appearance with it stalactites growing from the ceiling, the hole dark and ominous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three dragons stood before the entrance, scraping their courage together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Spyro cleared his throat and said, \"Well, let's not waste time and go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey entered. It took a while for their eyes to adjust to the darkness, and it was eerily quite. For a while the continued down a relatively straight path, but then they came across an obstacle in the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe path branched into two ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what now?\" Ember asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro rubbed his chin. \"Dunno,\" he said, \"I want both explored at the same time, so that we don't waste our time, but that would mean that we have to split up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But won't that be dangerous?\" Cynder asked. \"We don't know this place. We can get hopelessly lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I'm afraid of, yes,\" Spyro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" Ember suddenly said, smiling, \"I have a solution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out of her satchel (which she had brought from the city, which also contained her medical gear) a pink crystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bought this from the market before we left,\" Ember began explaining, \"It's a short of guide that helps find your way back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed it on the ground and it began to float up into the air and pulled out more from her satchel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basically,\" Ember continued, \"they begin to glow when they come closer, like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought the crystals closer to each other, which began to glow brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clever,\" Spyro said, \"by using this, we can't get so easily lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber allowed herself to swell with pride, although she could feel Cynder's intense glare again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go left while you girls take the right,\" Spyro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but are you sure that's a good idea?\" Cynder asked, \"I mean, what if something bad happens to you. There's strength in numbers, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber caught Cynder glancing at her, and she knew that this went a little deeper than Spyro's wellbeing; she really didn't want to be partner up with the pink dragoness, and nether did Ember with Cynder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll be fine,\" said Spyro flashing them a grin, \"I can take care of any kind of danger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but...\" Cynder mumbled, defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really didn't want to be alone with Ember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro didn't hear her. \"Anyway,\" he continued, \"we had wasted enough time. Let's go, and keep a sharp lookout for trouble.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

More importantly, what did it do and was it responsible for the disappearances?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only one way to find out,\" thought Cynder and bravely took a step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring Ember's warnings not to toy with it, the black dragoness placed her paw inside, causing the surface to ripple like glass. It felt like dipping your hand in ice cold water and Cynder reached her paw back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flexed it a few times. It still looked and functioned normally.

Do....do you think I might be...barren?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she said worried Spyro, for he had to admit that they had been breeding with each other for a while now ever since they came of age (which is around 20 years in a dragon's society).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prospect that they would never have hatchlings of their own was very bleak to Spyro, but he still remained positive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only there was a way to speed this up... An idea struck the purple dragon. There was a way! Though, the said way might mean that he had to dabble with dark magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro smiled at her. \"Don't worry,\" he said soothingly, licking her cheek, \"I don't think you're barren.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do?\" said Malia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro nodded. \"You'll be full of eggs, my dear,\" he said, touching her belly, \"And much sooner than you think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice one: After returning home from her gardening classes, Malia finds Spyro waiting for her in their bedroom, his testicles the size of two bowling balls, his member larger than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scented candles in the room also had an effect on Malia, causing her vagina to swell and her womb to become the most fertile on earth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice two: after messing around with a spell, Spyro casts a spell on his mate in order to get her pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut little did he know what nasty side effect it would have on Malia. Let's just say he will end up with a very bloated, horny mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Spyro looks for a magical solution but the spell he casts doesn't work as intended. Instead of growing new eggs in Malia, dragons around her age regress to eggs and then are 'unbirthed' into her womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Some other answer to their situation.</span></div></div>",

It was because of the size of his mate's belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen a dragoness falls gravid for the first time, the usual number of eggs she carried were between one or two. Come their next pregnancy, there would be more, a maximum of four, but Cynder carried a clutch far larger than any female should.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro wasn't sure how many were inside her womb, but if he had to make a rough guess, it had to be eight or nine grapefruit-sized eggs in total!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the purple dragon's worries, Cynder, on the other hand, was delighted. Her friends came to her house and visited her on the bed she was confined to due to her beach-ball sized belly, spending most of her time reading a book or sleeping. Spyro brought her meals and helped her to the bathroom, she would talk merrily about the many children she and her mate will raise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd no matter how much Cynder told him to stay calm and that everything would be alright, he was still worried, and he decided to consult an old friend for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus, who was sitting in his office behind his desk checking out a report from the academy he was Headmaster of, heard a knock on the door and looked up saying, \"Come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled when he saw Spyro enter. He was growing fast, nearly half the size of the Fire Guardian, Ignitus observed, and he looked a lot like him too, with the fins growing from the sides of his cheekbones and under his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iit's good to see you once more, young dragon,\" Ignitus said to Spyro, rising from his comfy cushion. He then saw the purple dragon's worried expression, and asked, concerned, \"What is the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro sighed and said, \"It's about Cynder. I'm very worried about her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus nodded, quickly understanding what he meant. He knew this day would come, and he had already a lecture prepared for Spyro to put him at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over to a nearby bookshelf, taking down a book that had the answer to the purple dragon's problem, and said, \"It's best that you sit down, young one. What I have to say to you might take some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro did as he said, finding a cushion and sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what's wrong with her? \" he began to ask, agitated, \"Is it serious condition? Will she die?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, calm down!\" Ignitus exclaimed, chuckling, \"It's nothing of the sort. In fact, what Cynder has can be considered as a blessing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat down on a cushion opposite of Spyro and handed him the book he opened on a certain page, indicating with his claw to a paragraph he should read, saying, \"Read this, my dear boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did,and as he read, Spyro began to frown. \"Broodmothers?\" he asked, looking at an illustration of an obscenely pregnant dragoness, \"Are you suggesting Cynder is one of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus nodded and Spyro said, \"But isn't that dangerous? A dragoness with so many eggs can't possibly survive birthing all of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Continue reading,\" said Ignitus calmly, \"All your answers of this subject will reveal itself in this chapter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued to read, and he raised his eyebrows in fascination. \"Wow...I never heard of this before,\" he said, \"So...for broodmothers the pain is less, and it lessens every time she gives birth?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus smiled, nodding. \"Indeed,\" he said, \"Also, if you read further, it will tell you that the amount if eggs will double by her second pregnancy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro bit his lower lip when he heard this. Being a father to one hatchling would be tough, but dozens? How would he and Cynder cope? It made him worried all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its great to know this, Ignitus,\" said Spyro, putting the book down, \"But...Cynder and I are new parents. It's going to be hell to raise so many children.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the real reason why I want to talk to you,\" said Ignitus, his expression very serious, \"You know the state of dragonkind after the war, do you?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro nodded, knowing fully well how the war had dwindled the dragon population.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we heard about Cynder's condition,\" Ignitus said, \"the Guardians and I began to debate amongst ourselves and decided that it would be a good idea to start a broodmother program to repopulate our species quickly, to gather those who are willing to help us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you want Cynder to be one of them, right?\" Spyro asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus nodded. \"Of course, that is if you and Cynder decide to do such a thing,\" he said, \"We're not going to force you into this. There are others as well.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are more dragonesses that have the same condition as Cynder?\" Spyro asked, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One or two...or three. Ember may prove to be a broodmother as well. The Ancestors have seen our plight and decided to help us in our time of need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need some time to think about it,\" said Spyro, uncertain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By all means, Spyro, go and discuss this with Cynder,\" Ignitus said, \"I'll wait for your answer. I'm in no rush.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro stood up and saying goodbye, he left. He went to talk to Cynder, but what was her answer to Ignitus' proposal to become a broodmother?</span></div></div>",

This is a good cause for all of dragonkind. Besides, I always wanted to have lots of children from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just not sure if this will be a good idea,\" said Spyro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suggest that you go think about it,\" said Cynder, \"You can make a choice about this as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro nodded and climbed off the bed, saying, \"I think I'm going to take a walk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, tell me if you made up your mind,\" said the black dragoness, \"I'll be here...not that I can go anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: as Spyro takes a stroll down the path of the temple's gardens, he comes across Ember and Flame.

It's not like I could carry some of the eggs...or could I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro's head percked up, suddenly struck by a crazy idea, but to him it seemed perfectly reasonable. He was  going to try and lessen Cynder's load by carrying some of her eggs, but how was he going to do that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a spell, of course. \"There's bound to be one somewhere,\" Spyro thought with a smile, jumping off the marble bench, heading to the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: After finding the spell, Spyro casts the it, reducing the amount of eggs Cynder carried, teleporting some into himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as time passes, weird things begin to happen to him. His hips and rear begins to grow wider and bigger, his male organs shrinking away, his masculinity disappearing, transforming into a dragoness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: After finding the spell, Spyro casts it, but something goes horribly wrong. Instead of transferring some eggs to him, lessening her load, Cynder suddenly has more eggs inside her womb, the eggs growing far more rapidly than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Spyro didn't think this through. He takes the eggs but more start growing in him. He's a male and he can't lay the eggs... can he? Just how many eggs can one dragon hold?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Something even weirder happens, like Spyro is magically put into all of Cynder's eggs, so when each one is born they grow into a exact copy of him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was late in the night, but Spyro was still up, searching through piles of scrolls and books in the library. He had searched endlessly for a specific spell that could lighten Cynder's load all afternoon, making up an excuse to Volteer that he was looking through books that would prepare him for parenthood, turning down his offer to help the purple dragon find the best ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hours of searching, he managed to find it. It was a teleportation spell, and, mixed with a body altering spell, Spyro could teleport the eggs into an artificial womb inside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow he was going to give birth was another matter, but he was sure that he would find an answer for that soon. Right now, he can finally lessen Cynder's load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrying two spell books under his left wing, he made his way to the small apartment he and his wife stayed in. She was fast asleep when he entered, laying on her back, her massive belly jutting high into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to cast the spell, chanting the words softly, careful not to awaken Cynder, and the air began to shimmer and sparkle. An aura began to emanate from the hyper pregnant black dragoness, which began to glow brighter, engulfing her, and soon her body was only a white silhouette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it went away. Spyro stared at Cynder. She hadn't changed one bit. Her belly was still the same size, and Spyro felt his belly. It was still flat. Had he done it wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro tried again, but this time nothing happened. He then tried it several times, but still nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The spell is a dud!\" Spyro said in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, he said that a little too loudly, for Cynder stirred, her eyes opening. \"Spyro, is that you?\" she asked sleepily, yawning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple dragon quickly hid the books under their bed and said quickly, \"Yes, love, it's me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled as he climbed on their bed and said, \"You're back late. So, have you decided?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's talk about this tomorrow,\" he said, \"I'm feeling a little tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave a yawn, for he genuinely was tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then,\" said Cynder, \"Goodnight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight, my love,\" he said, giving her a kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cynder settled down and fell asleep again, Spyro couldn't help but lay awake for a while, disappointed that his spell did not work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as he drifted off to sleep himself, he was unaware that his spell did work, though, not the way he wanted it to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens to Cynder?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: As the days go by, Cynder's belly gets even bigger as more eggs began to form in her womb in a rapid pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther weird things happen to her too, her body elongating, forming into taur train, each section filled with dozens of eggs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: As the days go by, Cynder's belly swells even bigger as more eggs form inside her womb at a rapid pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther weird things begin to happen too. Every time she touches a dragon, regardless of their gender, they end up pregnant like her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: As the days go by Cynder gets bigger and bigger. Not just with eggs (though that's certainly the case) she grows taller and heavier as her appetite grows too. She begins eating far far more as she soon outsizes the guardians and continues to fill with both mass and eggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Something really weird begins to happen...</span></div></div>",

It was no secret that she got cravings, like most gravid dragonesses did, but he noticed that she was asking him for bigger meals everyday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder always asked for something small, like a apple pie or hunk of ham, but now she was asking for triple the amount of pies and ham with dessert, such as a whole chocolate cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro was worried, and he consulted the books and scrolls in the library again, but he found nothing that mention a sudden increase of appetite for broodmothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus wasn't much help either. He was looks concerned when Spyro told him about Cynder's growing appetite, but he only told him that everything will be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, with all the food she ate while doing nothing but lay on the bed all day, it was only natural that she started to gain weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, there were other things happening to her as well, and Spyro got a clue to what it was the day he pushed open the door of their bedroom, balancing a platter that was heaped with food between his shoulder blades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder was laying on her back on the bed, gnawing on a chicken bone, a few of the plates from her previous meals stacked around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro tried his best to clean up after her, but it wasn't always easy with her perpetual hunger. When she saw him approach her, Cynder smiled, though, more at the food than her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's you tenth dish,\" Spyro said, but he wasn't exaggerating, for is was her tenth meal she ate that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you,\" said Cynder, grateful that she had more food to finally satisfy the hunger in her belly, \"You're such a sweetheart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she began to chew on the mutton, Spyro studied her figure. She was noticeably chubby now, her limbs much thicker, her face softer, losing its sharp features, and hips and rear wider. Even her tail seemed thicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, there was something else Spyro noticed about her. She seemed...taller? But the purple dragon couldn't really tell, for she was laying down, and he dismissed that thought as his imagination playing tricks on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her belly was definitely bigger, jutting up even further into the air, spilling forward into her thighs. It was less taut than before, with the extra layer of fat covering the maroon and black sphere, and Spyro was blissfully unaware that Cynder had three new eggs inside her womb, which had grown out of nowhere rapidly inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do mind getting some dessert for me as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an order, not a question, and Spyro picked that up as well. Another thing he noticed was that Cynder was rather rude lately, ordering him around like he was more like a servant than her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he still did as she asked, saying, \"Yes, my dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Spyro left the room and walked down the hallway, deep in thought, wondering why his wife was suddenly acting so strange, a small voice in the back of his head telling him that it was the spell he'd cast on her that was responsible for this, he was unaware that another dragon was just around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked straight into the dragon, staggering, but quickly regained his composure. Unfortunately, the other dragon wasn't so lucky, losing balance and falling on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I didn't see you there,\" he apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stretched out his hand to help the person he bumped into up, he saw that it was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: It was Ember, who was on her way to visit Cynder, for she was just as concerned about her as Spyro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: It was Spyro's friend Flame, the young dragon was stopping by to see his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: It was a strange dragoness he'd never seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: It was another dragon, who wanted to visit Cynder for some vague reason. </span></div></div>",

At the age of sixteen, Cynder still had to hit her first puberty.

She could smell that strange yet sweet smell on him every time he was close to her. It smelled kind of like flowers, but it also had a funny scent to it, which she couldn't properly explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis balls were filled to the brim with seed, swollen to the size of a hen's egg, and she swore she heard a faint sloshing every time he walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Spyro promised her that he would remain faithul to her until the next mating season, she occasionally saw his eyes wander and gaze dreamily at another pretty dragoness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt gave her all the more reason to experience her first Heat. Fueled by jealousy and desperation, Cynder decided that tonight was the night. She was going to force her body to experience its first Heat, and she knew just the dragoness to turn to for help.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The ring around Cynder lit up with small flames, and the smoke emanating from it formed into small hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey began to touch her body, stroking it, caressing it, before they moved down to one specific spot: her hindquarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt first began as a small tingle, like an inch, but it grew stronger, and Cynder was tempted to reach under herself and rub her now swelling vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next phase of the spell struck her like ice cold water being thrown in her face. She moaned loudly, the world suddenly dissapearing around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder fell to the ground, her tongue lolling out, and she began to rub and finger her vagina, feeling how moist her petals were, how swollen her labila flaps were, how hard her clit felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing she knew she was creaming herself, shooting cum out of her vagina like a small water gun. She didn't know how long she rode the dazzling feeling, seconds, minutes, hours, maybe, but she was snapped out of the pleasurable world she was reluctant to leave by Ember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! I never seen a dragon cum that much since the first time I gave Flame a blowjob,\" was the first thing the pink dragoness said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Cynder looked around her, and saw a trail of cum at her feet, which stretched on for quite some distance, nearly two feet long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her vagina and smiled happily, glad that the spell was a success. Her labial lips were as thick as one of her claws, throbbing faintly from her post-climax, her clit the size of a grape, the head visible between the folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, your vagina is even bigger than mine,\" said Ember in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right?\" Cynder said, giddy with excitement, wobbly rising to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are you going to do now?\" asked Ember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I'm going to bed,\" she said, \"befere we are caught. I'm looking toward to enjoying this Mating Season.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they tidied up, Ember closed the book and placed it back on the shelf.

She soon finds herself unable to satisfy her growing vagina and has to go out of her way to please her need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: As the days go by, Cynder's swollen vagina occasionally releases strange pink gas, which has odd effects on whoever inhales it.</span></div></div>",

It was a weak lie and Spyro was a little suspicious when she told him this, trying to get her to see a doctor, but she was able to brush away his suspicion when she suggested that they mate that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was horny and was easy to convince, Cynder even more so. Her cunt was practically on fire with need, dripping juices like a leaky roof. The sex they had that night was wild, but....it left Cynder oddly unsatisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the black dragoness laid that night in bed, staring at the roof, she could feel her lips throbbing, her clit still hard, aching for some more. But she couldn't do it, for Spyro was exhausted after what they did, sleeping next to her, and she didn't want to wake him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder had to satisfy herself that night by playing with her clit, stifling her moans of bliss with her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut things only got worse from there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the days went by, Cynder found herself horny every few hours, even in awkward places, like when she was in class, her scent strong enough to fill the whole classroom, and she was forced to leave to please her need with the excuse that she had to go to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took very little to arouse her, and a gust of wind between her legs was enough to activate her lady-boner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder's eyes began to wonder.

Besides, she would only look suspicious if she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sure,\" she said after giving herself a brief pause to think it over, \"The door's unlocked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and when Ignitus stepped inside and Cynder laid eyes on him, she, for a brief moment, imagined herself kissing his handsome face before she banished that thought out of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, Cynder,\" Ignitus greeted, \"Tell me, are you feeling well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder pressed her thighs against each other in order to conceal her vagina, for she could feel that her petals were growing damp again, leaking pre-cum. Being in the mere presence of a male was enough to turn her on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, I'm feeling well,\" she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good,\" said Ignitus, a hint of sternness in his voice, \"but I was wondering, if you are feeling so well, why are you absent so often at school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder felt her blood run cold. She hoped that her absence days at school would go unnoticed, but, she guessed, that it had happened to frequently that someone was bound to confront her about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she simply couldn't help it. There was certian days that her Heat was so bad, her scent so strong, that she had to stay in her room the whole entire day, using a dildo she borrowed from Ember to satisfy her needs. Even then it would take an entire day to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder's mouth opened and closed, unsure what to say. When the silence dragged on too long, Ignitus gave a sigh and chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Cynder, I know what you are going through,\" said Ignitus, \"Why, when I was your age and experiencing my first Heat, I was also sneaking away from classes and skipping schooldays to masterbate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder bit back the urge to moan as an image of a young Ignitus pounding his fat cock flashed in her mind, creaming herself a little, and she felt her warm juices run down her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't help either that Ignitus went to stand and gaze out the window, staring at the evening sky, his swollen jewels exposed for her to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike any other dragon, Ignitus, and the rest the Guardians, were not immune to the effects of Mating Season. Their balls swelled too and their cocks erected easily as well, but they controlled their desires better than the younger dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cynder stared at his gonads, she wondered if it would be possible that Ignitus could quench her need. She didn't care anymore if this was wrong. Her desires was forcing her to do it. But the main question was, was Ignitus going to go for her advances?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: When Cynder makes he advances, she is surprised that Ignitus actually complies. But as they begin their sexaul intercourse, the black dragoness' body began to shape and transform in weird ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Ignitus refuses her advances and something finally snaps within Cynder. Her body began to transform in a way that would make others do as she said, to please her in any way possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Before Cynder can act her body give a great lurch and a shudder. Something was wrong with the spell. Her body changes dramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Something else strange happens.</span></div></div>",

She groaned, rubbing her temples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was nothing coming to her? She had shut out all the noise, drawn the curtains closed and sat in the gloomy room, illuminated only by a candle on her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder had shut the world outside, making it so quite that one could hear a needle drop. Piece and quiet; wasn't that what I writer needed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat...and some kind of experience on life, which Cynder most certainly had after being known as the Terror of The Skies, fighting off hordes of evil monsters and defeating the Dark Master himself, even though all of that was four years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy all means she should be able to write some kind of epic tale or mournful poetry....but nothing came to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was pondering another story, she heard the door of her bedroom open. Cynder turn around, ready to yell at whoever it was to get out in sheer frustration, but she managed to catch herself before she did that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Ember, the pink dragoness who she shared a room with, who had entered. She froze when she saw Cynder and grinned sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Ember apologized, \"I didn't mean to bother you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder sighed and said, \"It's fine. I'm not coming up with anything, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm taking that the writing hobby isn't going so well,\" Ember said before gazing around the room, her snout crinkling up, \"And why is it so dark in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flung open the curtain, causing Cynder to flinch due to the sudden bright morning light that hit her eyes. Now with more light, Ember looked at the room again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne half of it was organized, which belonged to Ember, and the other half was untidy, the bed a mess and empty tin cans laying around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber looked at Cynder and saw that she was in the similar state as her half side of the room: there were dark rings under her eyes, a sign of a lack of sleep, and she could see her belly was bulging outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynder, when was the last time you slept.. or went outside?\" Ember asked, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder yawned and answered, \"Only a fee hours the last three days. As for going outside, that I'm not sure of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber sat beside her and poked her bulging gut, saying, \"Clearly long enough for you to gain quite a lot of weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder blushed and pushed Ember's paw away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you do this to yourself, Cynder?\" Ember continued, \"Is it because of the writing hobby? You know, you don't need to lock yourself up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I thought that's what you are supposed to do,\" Cynder said, \"Volteer said that a good writing needs piece and quiet, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" said Ember, \"but you also need inspiration, which I highly doubt you'll get cooped up in this room all day. Have you ever considered taking a walk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder thought about this qeustion. She wasn't really one for going outside, but it sounded like a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder nodded, and Ember grinned, saying, \"Good. Maybe you can work off the extra pounds while you are at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder rolled her eyes.</span></div></div>",

Enjoy.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all her life, Eember had never expected that she will one day gain an attraction to the same sex, let alone fall in love with Cynder. It all started when Ember went to visit the dojo one day. Cynder was busy training....actually, she was venting out all of her anger on some dummies who did not stand a chance against her fury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro had broken up with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being with her for three years after the war, he had decided that the relationship didn't work out for them and said they should remain friends instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder didn't take this lightly, crying herself to sleep and venting out her rage the next day. Something like this would have made Ember ecstatic, but, surprisingly enough, she wasn't happy at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the past she had a fangirl crush on Spyro, but Cynder back then made it perfectly clear that he was taken. Over the years she had lost the will to win Spyro's heart and simply moved on, growing out of her childish fantasies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was why she felt sorry for Cynder and wanted to cheer her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ember watched the black dragoness mercilessly slaughtered the poor dummies, she could not help but admire her. Cynder was slimmer than Ember but very curvy. She seemed quite attractive to the pink dragoness...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Cynder took a break, panting, standing amongst the ruined dummies, Ember decided to approach her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynder?\" she said timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Cynder said in a very irritated voice, shooting her a poisoness glare \"Have you came to gloat or something? That you can finally have Spyro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber whinced at the outburst, but she stood her ground. \"No,\" she said firmly, \"I haven't. I came to talk to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to talk,\" Cynder replied, \"That... Ugh, I don't care what he said about 'trying again' in a few years.... How could he do this to me!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder blasted one of the dummies with her poison breath attack, and the concentration was so strong the leather patchwork object seemed to partially melt from the green goo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After all we went through, all we did, I can't believe he dumped me!\" Cynder was torn between furious cries and anguished sobs. Spyro had seen it as more a 'time apart to discover themselves'. She felt it was a break up. But whichever was the truth it hurt Cynder deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt pained Ember to see Cynder like this, but she knew that she had to exercise some tough love. She couldn't stand to see Cynder moping like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping that she wasn't going to far, she took Cynder's head in her paws, and action the surprised the black dragoness, and said, \"Cynder, I know this breakup is tough, but you've got to move on. Believe it or not, I've moved on since I knew I can't have Spyro. It was tough for me as well, but I managed. Yes, I know you spent your whole life with him, but face it. He wasn't meant for you. Just let it go. Come with me to the kitchen. Let's whip something up to eat. Food always makes me feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, just an instant really, Cynder looked like she wanted to blast Ember in the face with one of her attacks. She calmed just as fast though as she pulled herself free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, I don't need snacks...\" she said stubbornly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach of course chose that moment to disagree, rumbling loudly as Cynder had quite unintentionally missed breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber could not help but giggle. \"You need food, silly. Wait here, I'll bring it to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, she trotted away to the kitchen. Cynder didn't know why, but she decided to comply and wait for Ember, sitting on the nearest concrete step and huffed. Did she really care about her predicament? Was this some kind of game?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber wasn't the best cook, but she was a good spellcaster. Using a spell on a huge piece of ham that will bring out the flavours more, she trotted back to the dojo, offering it to Cynder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder wanted to refuse it, but her stomach insisted otherwise. So with a few nibbles that soon turned into proper bites, Cynder worked at the ham, grudgingly admitting it was good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat neither were aware of was the spell Ember had used not only brought out the flavor, but massively increased the calories of any food it was used on. By the time Cynder finished the ham her belly was looking a bit less concave and more rounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing her paw over her mouth, Cynder belched politely and said, \"Thanks, I guess. As much as I hate to admit it, but I do feel a little better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber smiled. \"Anything for my new roommate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Ember, you aren't such a bad dragon,\" said Cynder, a hint of a smile on her face, \"Maybe I was wrong about you all these years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can be really nice and caring when I want to be\" said Ember, \"Do you want more? Perhaps we should retire to our room. It's getting pretty late.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed it was; The sun was setting over the walls of Warfang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really should practice more,\" Cynder replied but was cut off by a long yawn, \"But... I suppose I have enough for one day.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly the pair walked out of the temple and across the lawn to the dorm rooms for the young dragons at the school. Along the way Cynder felt a bit more lethargic than she would have guessed. Though she hardly realized part of the reason was her rear legs and rump had begun to thicken ever so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night Ember lay in bed, staring at the ceiling. She was fighting with her emotions. She was genuinely concerned for Cynder, but it appears that the feeling had grown a little bigger than that. It couldn't possibly love, could it? She liked males, but every time Ember looked at Cynder her heart beated a little bit faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes, believing that the lack of sleep was messing with her mind. Yet, her dreams were full of Cynder, who she was stuffing and pampering....</span></div></div>",

The black dragoness had once more returned to the gym to pummel the practice dummies, and though she was still bitter and hurting, the same intense ferocity was lacking by the time Ember found her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also looked different, not quite as 'hard' or as 'sharp' around her edges. Though she was hardly round either. There was just a more general soft curving shape about her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Cynder,\" Ember greeted cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, morning,\" said Cynder, her tone much more softer this time, almost casual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleep well last night?\" Ember asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes I did,\" Cynder half lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did catch a good amount of sleep last night, but she, at some point in the night, woke up from a dream that she remember had Ember in it, plus a lot of food. Whatever happened in the dream, it was pretty arousing, her lions burning. She had to satisfy them before she could go back to sleep again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you eaten breakfast yet?\" Ember asked, \"it's the most important meal of the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welllll....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder's belly rumbled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber chided Cynder with a glance, to which the black dragoness rolled her eyes and sighed, \"Fine, I'll have something to eat. But nothing too big, alright? I still can't believe I ate a whole ham yesterday...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair walked to the kitchens and while Cynder drank some juice at the dining table, Ember set to work making a nice, big extra cheesy omelet. Once again it was made with the special magic she'd used the previous day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, she focused more magic on the this, and it showed when Cynder ate the omelet, her eyes shooting wide open and humming in bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, this is the best dish I've ever tasted,\" said Cynder, \"Dam, you're real great with food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber blushed. \"Oh, it's nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you've got a real talent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber blushed harder and said, \"What do you want to do today. I figured you can't stay cooped up here like last time, so why don't we go out a little? We can go shopping or fly around in the valley of Avalar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Cynder replied, mostly focusing on the omelet. it was quite big. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber had used a good half dozen large eggs, a couple cups of cheese and milk to make it. She worked through it one bite at a time, her frame seeming to thicken just a little more with each swallow. By the time she was finished she was definitely looking soft. Not fat, not even chubby, but genuinely softer all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber watched Cynder eat, her eyes studying her body. Had she gained weight? The black dragoness seemed much thicker than yesterday, but perhaps it was just her imagination. Her spells could make the food taste better, not make one fatter, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether she was fatter or not, Ember had to admit to herself that Cynder had a good body, the thought making her blush. Cynder noticed this and pointed it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, Ember? You seemed a little hot, judging from the redness of your cheeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it's nothing \" said Ember quickly, traying to hide her blush with her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly thought of a way to change the subject and found one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Cynder, do you want some new jewellery?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder frowned. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well they seem a bit old, don't you think,\" said Ember, \"Old and a little dull.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder tucked at her chocker. \"Well, I guess they feel a bit tight lately,\" she said, \"I could go and buy a larger pair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\" Ember said happily, \"I know just the place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder wanted to protest, say it wasn't a big deal and she really should get back to the training room. However she'd barely finished her meal when Ember hauled her off and down the hill to the Warfang market. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day was nice with just a slight chill in the air and heavy clouds overhead that hinted at the possibility of rain later, but for the time being the market was wide open as vendors sat under canvas covered stalls and called out their wares from all sides. Cynder was not usually a fan of the marker, mostly because of the looks she got. While Spyro had vouched for her and the Elders had forgiven her, she still got the occasional nasty glare from folks who remembered her as a tyrant under Malefor's dark magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder was uneasy, her eyes zipping left and right at the passing shopping goers, and Ember noticed this. The pink dragoness knew very well about her past, and it was obvious that Cynder felt awkward in large crowds, with so many eyes staring at her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber decided to distract her by saying, \"Hey, look, there's a jewellery shop. Let's see what they have in store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jewellery were pretty, dangling off hooks and clinking together in the wind. Ember pulled them off and showed them to Cynder, making a fuss about it, but the black dragoness' attention where elsewhere. Through the crowd she spotted something purple, and soon Spyro emerged out of the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: She is able to keep her emotions in check, watching him walk by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: unable to handle her emotions, she marches up to Spyro and confronts him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Spyro spots her and either approaches or walks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Something else.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a long moment Cynder was torn. One the one hand she wanted to go over and thump Spyro good for dumping her. On the other she wanted to sob and beg and pled with him to reconsider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on the hypothetical third hand she just didn't want him to see her at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoor number three won out this time and Cynder ducked her head, hiding behind the jewelry cases as much as she dared without trying to look like she was hiding. She almost needn't have bothered though. Spryo was almost surrounded on all sides by adoring individuals, dragons and other species who recognized the legendary purple dragon hero and wanted to praise him. Some even offered him gifts in thanks. A few bobbles, a gem or two, but most common was simply a treat in the form of a fresh baked muffin, cookie, or kebab from one of the food stalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro did his best to accept such things politely even if he wasn't certain he could handle it all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynder?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black dragoness jumped when she heard an voice behind her, but relaxed when she saw it was Ember, who was looking at her with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" she continued, her eyes spotting Spyro in the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine,\" Cynder said, her voice firm with a hint of anger and bitterness in it as she watched a few dragonesses flirt at Spyro, and the purple dragon returning their advances a little as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething had cracked inside of her then, something that drained away her affection for Spyro. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile glaring at him, she said to Ember, \"I think I'll take those gold bracelets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Ember asked, \"They seem a little bit big for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure,\" said Cynder, \"Plus, let's go hit the nearest restaurant. I'm feeling a little peckish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, Ember and Cynder were sitting at the nearest dinner. The black dragoness wore her jewelry, which was threatening to slip off. Ember hardly touched her food, her eyes wide, not believing how much Cynder was eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about that moment in the market had pushed Cynder to a breaking point. She hadn't snapped, not completely, but some part of her had decided if she couldn't find the pleasure of companionship through Spyro, she'd find pleasure in other things. And unfortunately food was the easiest on hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder ordered three appetizers, two meals and four desserts. Although the implication was she'd share them with Ember, really she devoured them herself, determined to fill the aching hole inside her with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnion rings, fried chicken, pasta, burgers, and several ice cream sundaes all vanished down her throat until the dragoness looked positively ill from stuffing herself so much. Heck, Ember wasn't even sure Cynder could swallow towards the end as the food simply bunched up in her throat unable to make it to her tightly packed stomach as she stubbornly tried to force more inside her. It actually got to the point Ember could hear Cynders scales creaking as they fought to stay interlocked on top of her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Ember, for some strange reason, found the way Cynder stuffed herself like a Thanksgiving turkey, she was worried that that the black dragoness would get sick, or worse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Cynder,\" she said, \"I think you should stop now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder looked up and with a half full mouth and said, \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have a lot of money,\" she began, \"but not an unlimited amount. The bill the restaurant will give us will be straight through the roof.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter swallowing, Cynder said, \"Oh....Well, I guess we should go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we can still hang around town a bit, if you want to,\" said Ember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder shook her head. \"No, those clouds don't look nice,\" she said, \"Besides, I'm a bit too full. I just want to return back home and lay down for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter paying the bill, the two dragonesses went back home. Though, the going was slow due to Cynder's overly stuffed gut weighing her down, rather ominous sloshing and gurgling noises coming from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the clouds promised all day, it began to rain. Luckily, the girls made it back to their dorm, where Cynder laid down on her bed, her massive belly jutting high in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ember, do you mind doing something for me?\" Cynder asked, \"Do you think you can give me a belly rub, just to help settle down the food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber blushed and said, \"S-sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder gave a soft 'urp' as Ember placed her claws on her belly, the threat of some food coming back up there for a moment, but Cynder kept it down and found her stomach relaxed as Ember worked it over and around in her claws. Though she tried to stay awake, sleep suddenly hit Cynder like a ten ton hammer and the black dragoness was soon snoring away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment Ember considered stopping the belly rub but then an idea occurred to her. She'd been casting her magic on food she cooked and then served to Cynder, but she was beginning to suspect there were side effects. Cynder had been looking a little different after her last couple meals. What if Ember cast the spell on the food still in Cynders stomach before it fully digested?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite concerns, curiosity won out and Ember began casting the spell as her clawed hands rubbed and rolled over Cynder's large dome of a belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she theorized, \"not much. The spell only enhances the foods flavor. The most that can come out of it is that the food in her belly might digest faster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder seemed to experience some discomfort from her packed belly, judging by the grimaces she made in her sleep. She decided to cast it in order to relieve some pain, but little did she know she was half right about her theory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment she cast the spell, it altered her stomach and taste buds as well. It did make the food digest faster, her body switching it immediately over to fat, but it also made her stomach harder to full with its rapid digestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny type of food also tasted delicious to her, regardless its quality. Unintentionally, Ember had created a nonstop eating machine! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact even as she slept Cynder was dreaming about consuming more and more food. As her body softened and thickened with new layers of digested foodstuffs in the real world, in her dream she sprawled on a bed, consuming delicious cakes, whole roasts, buckets of buttery mashed potatoes and gravy, and loads more. It all floated to her mouth on after another in the dream and she swallowed it just as fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome part of her wondered what she was doing, but in the usual sense of dream logic she was only mildly concerned as she wondered about her expanding body. Her figure grew and thickened, limbs lengthened and her neck and tail stretched, but even as they did they couldn't keep up with her body which swelled into a massive hill of black and red scales. Her limbs were thickening into cones of fat as she seemed to just balloon in all directions. And still she had to have more....</span></div></div>",

The once graceful and powerful warrior she had been only a few days ago had been replaced by a fat dragoness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face had grown considerably round and soft, reducing her once sharp and intimidating facial features to something more kinder and cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned sideways and studied her potbelly that curved and reached towards the ground, the two black hills of blubber that was her ass, her thunder thighs, and her much thicker limbs which her new bracelets fit much better around now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy ancestors!\" Cynder thought, \"I'm turning into a pig!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ember thought otherwise. \"Hey, Cynder, look what I brought you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder didn't want to look. She knew she shouldn't look. Every remaining ounce of common sense told her to close her eyes and shut it out....but her nose would not be denied as it followed the smell of delicious baked goods that slowly turned Cynder's head to see the treat Ember held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a cake. Three layers, whipped vanilla frosting, topped with caramel, fudge, and strawberries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her feelings her stomach growled with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn it Ember,\" Cynder muttered biting her lip, \"I'm trying to lose weight. Look at me! I can't even go one round of training without collapsing in a sweaty heap. Your treats are amazing, but if this keeps up I won't be able to move, let alone fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet even as she said it Cynder felt a stirring in her loins. Every night for the last few days she had dreams of getting huge off of the sweets...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes in the dreams she grew so big she was enormous giantess, stomping across the countryside eating whole mountains. Other times she stayed the same height, but grew so thick with blubber she sank into a sea of herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Ember,\" Cynder almost begged even as she allowed the pink dragoness to bring the cake closer and cut her a slice, \"You can't keep doing this. I'll... I'll burst.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't the first time Ember heard this from Cynder and knew how to work around this. She only had to get one crumb into her and the black dragoness will would be broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Cynder,\" Ember coaxed, waving the slice of cake before her snout, \"Just this one slice, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder bit her lower lip. Her brain was screaming that this was a trap, but her stomach said calmly that she should just eat it. She listened to her stomach....</span></div></div>",

She could feel her lions begin to heat up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is so hot!\" She thought to herself, fighting the urge to reach under herself and stroke her hardening clit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber had made piece with the fact that she was attracted to weight gain and stuffing. It was her fetish, and she could do nothing about it except enjoy it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also made piece with the fact that she was bisexual. It wasn't something that was frowned upon in dragon society. Ember knew a few dragonesses who were attracted to females. She just never expected that she will be attracted to girls as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to take her desires further, but she wasn't sure if Cynder had the same feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder herself was beginning to fall into a daze. She had times of clarity where she remembered things like training and combat and... other things. But now nearly two thirds of her time awake were spent eating. And it showed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder was growing massive as she ate. All her limbs were forming cones of fat that she could only bend halfway at the knees and even less at her hips. The rest of her body looked more like a lumpy yam than a dragoness. Her torso was bloated almost as big around as she had been tall. Both her neck and her tail were tapering cones of adipose that extended out from her middle. Cynder's wings even looked smaller as they protruded from her hill of a backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder moaned as she slurped up another doughnut and moaned as her body gurgled and sloshed constantly. \"Pleashe, Ember,\" she moaned through apple sized chubby cheeks making her lisp, \"No hulp more...\" Cynder groaned and sloshed. And though she weakly begged not to be fed any more calorie heavy food, she still ate everything Ember put in front of her without control.</span></div></div>",

She loved stuffing the morbidly obese dragoness, watching her swell bigger with each morsel she consumed. Her burning cunt could give witness to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ignored Cynder's pleading, pretending that they were just having a polite conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking that we should go somewhere again,\" she said, \"Granted, mobility is hard for you, but I can hire a few porters to carry you around. But first, I think you'll need a bath to wash off all does sticky sweets from your...big body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder groaned. What was wrong with Ember? Why didn't she listen? More importantly, what was wrong with her? She, like Ember, were aroused too, up to the point where it was painful. She wanted release, but she was far too embarrassed to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder found herself in a vicious cycle of eating, arousal, and self-loathing (less so the latter). She felt good despite being so big but her mind couldn't reconcile the idea. Being big seemed wrong and so it came off as a guilty pleasure which made her wonder if there was something wrong with her. This depressed her so she ate whatever was offered which only fueled her growth and in turn fueled the cognitive dissonance of both liking and hating her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything Ember offered her now Cynder mindlessly swallowed. Or tried to. Sometimes now she was so packed with food it was like that day at the restaurant (Cynder couldn't recall how long ago that was) where the food packed into her so tight it filled her stomach and throat to capacity. The tightly packed mass inched along as she digested it, but she might as well have been hose fed all the food stuffed into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a matter of fact, Ember had figured out a way to do just that. Well, sort of. She had figured out how to make food levitate and fly up the the immobile dragonesses maw, who ate them without hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt left her only to watch as Cynder swelled bigger, het lions still aching. She decided to stop it for now and give Cynder her daily massage. Ember flew up to the black dragoness' massive buttcheeks and began to rub and knead them, causing Cynder to moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Cynder, it can't be fun to be stuck like this all the time,\" she said, \"Why don't I get something that will make you mobile for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder responded with ulp as she fought off the urge to fall into a food coma, like she did so many times before. Ember had an idea with a spell, and after returning back to her dorm with a spell book, she managed to cast it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder body began to shake, and to the black dragoness' amazement she stood up! Granted very clumsily, but she could actually walk again! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, she seemed like a black whale that had grown legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was less true walking or even waddling though as Cynder's belly refused to leave the ground by even so much as an inch. But the friction under her was greatly reduced and her legs had popped and cracked, extending out just long enough she could press her fat claws to the ground and push herself along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe term 'seal-like' might have been the best way to describe her movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two decided to get out of their dorm, heading down the street. The near immobile dragoness gathered stairs all around her, maws falling open and dragons pointing, but Cynder ignored them, dragging her massive body next to Ember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the made their way slowly down the street, they heard a familiar voice call in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynder!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it?</span></div></div>",

She wanted to crawl into a hole or simply vanish, but neither was a viable option at her size, and she could only cringe in mortification as Spyro looked over her massive near hippo sized frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ember?\" Spyro asked noticing the pink dragoness for the first time, \"What...? How...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber frowned angrily. Though she had had a crush on Spyro, she felt more cold towards him when she heard he dumped Cynder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping protectively in front of the seriously obese dragoness, Ember said, \"This has nothing to do with you! Back off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I...\" Spyro began, shocked at Ember's outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts!\" Ember said, \"You decided that Cynder isn't the right one for you anymore and pretend that she doesn't exist. Well, we can play at that game as well. Stay far away from us! We don't want anything to do with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that said, she turned around and walked down the street again. Cynder lingered behind, looking at a very confused and worried Spyro, but she turned around and half dragged, half waddled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder didn't even pay attention to where Ember was leading her after that. Her mind kept drifting back to Spyro and that look on his face. She told herself it was a look of shock and disgust. But no matter how much that petty part of her wanted to believe the latter, she just couldn't quite make it stick. Shock yes, but he hadn't seemed disgusted at her size. Maybe that was just hopeful thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder dragged her massive form along one lumbering step after another, looking like some giant lizard as she heaved herself side to side, twisting her massive girth to take one step after another.

She decided that enough was enough. She was going to get back at him. But how?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pondered this while she lay in bed late one night, Cynder's enormous form sleeping several feet away from her. Ember decided to resort to the best salution there was available. She was going to cast a spell on him, one that would, like Cynder, make him constantly hungry and double the amount of calories of whatever food he ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quietly sneaked out of her room and went to the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProwling the library at night was not an easy task. The tall stacks loomed like watchful sentinels guarding their precious literary treasures. And Ember was forced to carry a lantern rather than light any of the torches. After all, young dragons were not allowed in the library after dark without supervision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGradually she made her way to the stacks where she'd pulled the spell book from the first time, but right away she hit a snag, having a hard time recalling where she got the spell from or what book. She knew vaguely what it looked like and some of the spells inside, but beyond that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a groan Ember set down the lantern and pulled the books down one at a time and leaved through them.  It took a little over an hour before she finally found one. It wasn't the same spell, or at least it didn't match what she remembered or the book she'd pulled it from, but the effects were basically the same. The only real difference she saw was this one cautioned not to use it on male dragons. Though it didn't say why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBriefly Ember considered putting it back and continuing the search, but the sound of a door creaking somewhere put an end to those thoughts. Hastily she dimmed the light and made her way out of the library as quick as she could, the book clutched under one wing. It would have to do for what she had planned.</span></div></div>",

Dimitri, who saw the gem, was curious about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to look at it and touch it, but Spyro told him strictly that he shouldn't come in contact with it. But he ignored his order and snuck into his office late one night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifted up the lid of the case and peered inside. He opened it fully and studied the beauty of the gem in awe. He reached out to touch it, but suddenly something strange happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gem lit up and blasted him with a beam of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri yelped as he was knocked off his feet and hit the floor on his back. Shaking his head to get rid of the dizziness, he didn't notice the quick and sharp pain on his chest as he got to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back to the open case to stare at the gem cautiously, only to feel surprise and dread as he saw the gem disintegrate into dust, which disappeared as well.  Two thoughts went through Dimitri's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What the heck was that!?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Dad's gonna kill me.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran out of the office in panic and went back to his room, unaware of the gem protruding out of his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever it was, Dimitri knew that he was going to be in big trouble if his dad found out about this. But what could he do? The gem was gone, and the only thing he could do is play dumb and said that he had no idea what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, his father did wonder where the gem had gone and, the following morning at the breakfast table, asked everyone sternly in the house if they had seen it. Dimitri told him that he hadn't and his father, thankfully, didn't bother him afterwards about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe probably believed him and wasn't suspicious...or, at least, Dimitri hoped he wasn't. But he could worry about that later. Currently he had to go to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter arrival at the academy, greeting his friend Ash at the gate, and beginning his school day, he was called to Headmaster Ignitus' office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he made his way down the hallway, he grunted in discomfort and rubbed his chest, where the small gem had buried itself in his chest, becoming a part of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dimitri entered Ignitus' office, he saw the elder fire dragon doing paper work on his desk. Ignitus look up and smiled at him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Dimitri.  Right on time.\" Ignitus stood from his seat and walk around his desk to Dimitri. \"Terrador wanted me to discuss something with you pertaining possible career in sports and...Dimitri what is that on your chest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus stared in confusion at the glimmering jewel on Dimitri's chest. It seems to gradually shine brighter as Ignitus got closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri blink in confusion and turn to look at his chest and gasped.  \"Bu-but this is-wha?\" Dimitri stammered. \"I-I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri suddenly felt strange as Ignitus approached him, a warm feeling sprouting in his gut and moving downwards to his hindquarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just noticed it now. I-I have no idea what it is or where it came from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me have a look,\" said Ignitus, and he walked closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gem on his chest glowed brighter and the feeling in Dimitri's gut grew even stronger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly the white light of the gem quickly spread to Dimitri's entire body, surprising both the young and elder dragon. His body was quickly engulfed by the bright light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dimitri!?\" Ignitus yelled in shock and concern for the young dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped closer to the light shaped Dimitri, founding it strange that he wasn't blinded from the illumination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus made a big mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red elder yelped as the glowing mass of Dimitri suddenly shot towards him like lightning and slammed into him. Ignitus stared down wide eyed as the blob made of light on his chest began to... sink into him? The befuddled elder fire dragon had no time to get his bearings together as the most pleasant warmth and pleasure suddenly filled his entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus moaned as he taken by surprise from the growing pleasant warmth and pleasure, unaware that his own body was beginning to glow a reddish light till he too was a mass made of red tinted light. Both light masses began to mix together, the Dimitri one completely sinking into the Ignitus one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow as a single mass of light, it slowly changed shape, swelling and rounding out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs then the light faded, only a single dragon was in the office.</span></div></div>",

One eye was green while the other was red, and his horns were sleek ivory tusks that were yellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got shakily to his feet, the dragon was confused, looking at his surroundings. \"W-w-what's going on?\" He asked, \"Why are we...I mean...Ag! What in the name of the Ancestors is going on!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then spotted his reflection in the mirror and gasped loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange pear shaped dragon waddled to the mirror, wanting a closer look, not quite believing what he saw. studying himself, despite the confusion, he liked what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd seeing that magnificent fat ass hanging off of him was even better.  He couldn't help but smirk smugly at his reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at you, you handsome devil you,\" he chuckled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at the mirror, the dragon frowned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The question is what happened to me? I mean us right?\" the dragon said in confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the state of euphoria his body was in, the strange fat dragon look back at what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey (Dimitri) were called to their (Ignitus) office for something about academics topic or something. Then involving some gem on their (Dimitri) chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was confusing that he remember being Dimitri, son of Spyro and Cynder, while remembering at the same time being Ignitus, Guardian of Fire, leader of the Guardians and headmaster of the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the ancestors has happen to me....er....us?\" the dragon muttered, scratching his tubby gut while standing on his hind legs and using his very uber cushioning ass as a seat for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fusion sat on his ample rump, trying to make sense of this bizarre scenario. He raked through the memories that both belonged to Dimitri and Ignitus, and he suddenly found something interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like watching surveylance footage of a drone unfold. A young black dragon entered what looked like an office, messed with something in a box, and was shot with a beam of light. He got up and fled the room, a glimpse of what looked like a gem stuck in his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, interesting,\" thought the orange and red dragon, rubbing his double chin, \"Could that have been the gem Spyro found? Could it have this bizarre effect, to fuse two individuals together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he pondered, his belly rumble loudly, sounding like distant thunder on a hot Summer's night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that I'm hungry,\" he said, patting his huge gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitri, who the fusion decide to call himself, left his office for the school's mess hall in order to get some grub.  As he waddle way out of the office, his secretary, a young fire dragon adult named Blaze couldn't help but gawk and drool of the sight of the strangely familiar fat dragon waddling out of his boss's/master's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bu-wha...?\" Blaze stammered in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing at the door that led to the hallways, Ignitri turned to him with a sly smirk. \"Oh hey there Blaze. Just heading to get something to eat,\" Ignitri said with a seductive wink at the blushing fire dragon and left to the lounge<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mess hall was a cavernous room full of students eating their meals, and Ignitri waddled down the steps, few taking notice of him. He went to grab his portion if food when he heard a familiar voice spoke behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hello there,\" said Volteer, \"I'm afraid I haven't seen you here before. Are you a substitute teacher? I am Volteer, Guardian of Electricity and history teacher at this academy. Who may you be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around and smiling, he accepted Volteed's outstretched paw and said, \"Ignitri at your service. And yes, I am a substitute teacher here. Though, not for long. I'm grabbing my last meal for this semester. Say, are you busy this afternoon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I was thinking that we go out together for a chat at a bar this evening. What do you say?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolteer hummed as he thought it over as he look at the strange tubby dragon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, he felt that he should know dragon very well...and yet, he cwould not recall meeting this strangely familiar dragon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet Volteer found himself wanted to accept this dragon's request.  Looking subtly back at Ignitri's plump booty was another reason he couldn't say no.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon's friendly and familiar appearance added with the chub was quite a appealing sight to Volteer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not?\" Volteer said with a big smile. \"Can you wait at the front entrance of the school for me to pick you up after school is over?\", Volteer asked, looking at the clock in the mess hall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis next history class was about to start soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitri smile and nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Volteer exclaimed,  \"Now, help yourself to the facilities of the mess hall, my good sir. I best be off now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolteer then left the mess hall to his next class.</span></div></div>",

He looked around, searching for Ignitri, and spotted him sitting under a tree with those enormous butt cheeks of his, waving at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Volteer trotted over and said, \"Ready to go, good friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" said Ignitri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked down the street, Volteer asked, \"So, what establishment are you taken me to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I was thinking of someplace simple,\" said Ignitri. \"A local bar would be nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief moment Ignitri felt a tugging sensation within himself, but he shrugged it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere in Warfang, a pear shaped fat elder fire dragon and a Guardian of Electricity walk into a bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked around the bar for a seat for two and quickly found one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ordering some food and drinks from the waiter, they sat together in comfortable silence until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tell me,\" Volteer started, with a mischievous grin.  \"Why haven't I seen such a good lookin fellow such as you around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because there ain't anybody like me in this entire realms,\" said Ignitri, flirting back, \"There's no one like me, and you're pretty lucky to stumble upon me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drinks arrived. Ignitri kept himself under control, making sure to take his time with his mug, but Volteer drank like a fish. The more drunk he got, the more blunt his flirting became.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know HIC what?\" Said the drunk yellow dragon, \"That HIC ass of yours, I'll HIC fuck any day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you?\" said Ignitri with a lusty grin, halfdrunk himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolteer drunken smile widen greatly at hearing that and proceed to do just that. Getting off of his seat, drunkenly trotted towards the amused tipsy Ignitri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe surprised the lovely fat ass dragon by pulling him into his embrace along with a sloppy kiss.  After a good minute, Volteer pulled back from the flustered and blushing Ignitri with a gasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at him with naked lust, Volteer huskily whispered.  \"Let us go to my place.... NOW....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waddling down the street, the two dragons supporting each other, they arrived at Volteer's house. When they were inside, Ignitri was instructed to lay down on the bed while Volteer searched hastily through his closet for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling out a bottle full of blue liquid, he pulled out the cork with his teeth and downed the potion. Before Ignitri's eyes Volteer's balls swelled bigger and his penis grew fully erect, stretching a few inches bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, put that big fanny of yours up so that I can start rutting your donut!\" commanded Volteer, which Ignitri happily did, his own cock fully erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, Ignitri presented his large plump posterior, causing it bounce and sway enticingly to Volteer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...\", Volteer says breathlessly at the sight of the gorgeous rippling fat booty before him. The way that buttocks jiggled... the way it bounce and sway about at the slightest movement... the way blubbery surface of that ass rippling and bobbing... or how it would all be quaking in mere moments as he pounded away at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cwould not stop himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitri yelped as Volteer grabbed hold of his plush hips and felt the electric elder dragon's big dick slam right into him, his innards perfectly molding itself for Volteer's shaft, avoiding any painful stretching.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitri moaned as pleasurable sensations of being full of dragon dick.  Deep inside him, two beings that made up Ignitri, trembled from the pleasure. One began to embrace and love their current state of being, the other was reluctant and unsure but was definitely enjoying this new state of existence for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor them, the pleasurable was doubled than normal and Ignitri loved this.  The feeling of joy swelling within him and shared between the two parts of himself as Volteer pulled out somewhat and slammed back right in with force and repeated, causing Ignitri to mewled in ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitri didn't know how long the exchanged their sexaul intercourse, but he was very well aware about his bloated, cum-filled belly that was stretch to it's maximum after they laid down for the night, exhausted from all the sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could never have guessed that Volteer could cum so much, but it was probably due to the potion he drank. As he lay in the darkness of the room, Volteer slumbering next to him, his front paws wrapped around his big gut, Ignitri knew that Dimitri would be in big trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, Ignitus could have wondered off for a night of sex without anyone noticing, but his parents must be worried sick about their son, wondering where he is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't like he could unfuse, could he? It was fun being Ignitri, but he knew he had to try and become two separate beings again before everyone begins to wonder where Ignitus and Dimitri went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping out of bed, walking out of the room as silently as a fat dragon with a cum-filled belly could, he left the apartment and went down the street, heading to where Dimitri lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneaking into the house, he made his way to Dimitri's room, which was rather untidy. \"Messy rascal,\" commented Ignitri as he began to focus, trying to split himself apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt two forces this time inside him, trying to move away from each other, and his body began to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitri shed a tear before becoming a mass of light. The Ignitri shaped mass of light split into two, a smaller white light mass shooting out of the larger red light mass.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smaller one landed on the floor with a thud, groaning as the light faded, leaving just Dimitri on the floor.  The redish light faded and leaving Ignitus with a stunned yet longing expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at each other, they notice their time as a fusion still showed.  Dimitri, once a slender muscled dragon for his age, now sported pudge.  Heavily.  Especially showed on his bottom half.  Two large black scaled buttcheeks rippling and wobbling.  Looks like Ignitus went through the same thing, just not as great Dimitri though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stared at one another for a while.  The elder part of Ignitri with longing, affection, and lust.  The younger part with uncertainty, self conflicted, and badly hidden longing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor several minutes they stared awkwardly at each other, remembering the bizarre but strangely pleasurable experience they had when they were fused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus was the first to break the silence. \"Well, that was...interesting,\" he said, shifting awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Dimitri, \"It...was strange...but...let's not do that again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, let's not,\" said Ignitus, walking towards the door, \"Well, I'm going to leave now. Goodnight, young one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he left, he paused. \"Uh...Also, I'll keep it a secret that you messed with the gem as long as you tell no one about my or Volteer's...sexaulity. It could be rather embarrassing if someone finds out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" said Dimitri, \"I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nodding at each other, ceiling the deal, Ignitus left.</span></div></div>",

Eventually, he stood on four of his legs and made it out of his room, all while trying not to think about what happened to him today. The cold gooey seed of Volteer dripping down his ass didn't help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he made it down stairs and towards the kitchen,  he tried to ignore the strange emptiness in him.  An emptiness that he knew was tied to Ignitus.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was in front the enchanted cold pantry (a.k.a. magic refrigerator) and pulled out a carton of mill for him to drink before going to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, those plans to go to sleep and his attempt to forget the sensation of being Ignitri was derailed as a certain large purple figure walked into the kitchen and spotted him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DIMITRI!\" Spyro bellowed angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(With Ignitus)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ignitus flew over Warfang towards his home, he couldn't help but think about what happened to him yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHim and Dimitri together, souls laid bare to one another, forming the entity known as Ignitri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite how bizarre it was, it was also wonderful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he and Dimitri were separate again.  That... didn't felt wonderful. Not at all.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe emptiness within him gnawed at him.  An emptiness he knew was tied to Dimitri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed as he landed before his home and entered.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Maybe tomorrow, he could have Dimitri do it again and be Ignitri once again?  For scientific purposes of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(With Dimitri)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning sheepishly, Dimitri said, \"Ah, hi, dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro glared at him. \"Do you know what time it is?\" he said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know what to say. What should he say? That he tampered with the gem, which made him fuse with Ignitus? And then went out to have sex with Volteer? That sounded stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said Spyro, approaching him, \"You're mother and I were worried sick about you. We even considered  enlisting the help of the city guard to look for you. Where were you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri bit his lower lip, still not sure what to say. But then his father got even closer, and he felt his chest and his crotch heat up. His sheath bulged, the tip of his member emerging from its hiding place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was being aroused, aroused due to the prospect of fusing with another being!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he sternly approached his son, Spyro notice something glimmering on Dimitri's chest.  He paused as he narrowed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dimitri.\", Spyro said lowly.  \"Is that a gem on your chest?\", Spyro calmly ask, with a under tone of fury and worry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri flinched but weakly nodded, lowering his head. Too late to hide the gem in his chest, but hiding his erection from his father was still possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"The same gem that I told you to stay away from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother nod from his son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well then.\", Spyro says, moving towards his fidgeting son, an intimidating expression on his face.  \"I think it it time for a good old spanking and-DIMITRI WHAT HAPPEN TO YOUR ASS!?\" Spyro yelled, eyes wide as he now saw his son's very plump rumpus and the rest of his chubby lower body.  He didn't notice Dimitri's erection yet, too focus on the fact that son got fat in a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting over his disbelief quickly, Spyro shot his son a befuddled and worry look.  \"Dimitri, what happened to you?\" Spyro asked, eyes trailing back to his son's fat posterior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri didn't answer as he look at his father, trying to push down unwanted thoughts from his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting no answer, Spyro sighed and said,  \"I will get an explanation, Dimitri, but I am glad that your are back unharmed at least.\"  Dimitri looked up at his dad at this and started to smile.  \"You are still gonna get grounded for making us worry to death.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri's smile dropped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, he said, \"Yes, dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that his son was sad, Spyro felt guilty and smiled. \"Come here, son,\" he said, approaching him, \"Give your old drake a hug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri's eyes shot wide open, trying to hold back a moan, pre-cum starting to leak from his black cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad...please,\" he said, backing away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter,\" said Spyro worried, frowning, moving closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri backed away, but his big butt made contact with a wall. The gem in his gem was beginning to grow uncomfortably warm, glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dimitri, tell me, what is wrong,\" Spyro says with concern before his squirming son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then notice his son's... problem.  Spyro felt his face heat up and eyes wide open as he saw his son's hard shaft bobbing in the air.  \"Di-Dimitri?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri couldn't take it anymore.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAD GET AWAY FROM ME!\" Dimitri yelled and tried to make a run for it before IT could happen to him and his own father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was futile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gem's glow became blinding, which envelop Dimitri's form once more.  Spyro lunged forward to Dimitri's bright mass, hoping to stop whatever was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DIMITRI!?\" Spyro cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mass of light shaped like Dimitri suddenly flew toward Spyro, slamming into his chest and disappearimg into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro didn't have time to realize what just happened when his own body began to turn into a large mass of deep purple light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mass of white and purple light merged with each other. It grew slightly taller, the color shifting into a deep purple, large bulges forming across the new beings body as it morphed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the fusion was complete, the drake fell to the ground with a heavy thud, groaning. Getting shakily to his feet, he rubbed his head, looking around himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what happened?\" he asked, his voice a deep baritone similar to Terredor's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe froze when he saw his huge paw. \"W-what is this?\" He said, studying his muscular body, \"What happened to us...I mean me...I mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remembered that there was a mirror in the hallway and rushed to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon stared in awe at his reflection.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was mostly similar to Spyro's, he noted.  Most of his scale were dark purple. There was a swirly pattern of dark scales across the dark purple scaly parts of his body.  His under belly was gold, not anything unusual about that, the dragon noted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then noticed with smug pride that his body was bulging with muscles that are perhaps greater than Terrador's. He was confused as to why there was a sparkling gem stuck on his broad chest.  He also smugly noted that his family jewels have upgraded immensely, two large gurgling orbs near the size of his head, wrapped in the a gold pouch.  Standing stiff as a rock above the pouch, the dragon's dark purple dick was huge.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing something else about himself, he turned to the side and saw his posterior was large, enticingly round with fat that didn't sag from the weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the dragon turned to his eyes and marveled that his eyes were mostly purple, with his left one with a smidge of bright green in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill confused, the dragon mumbled to himself, \"Well, this is quite an impressive sight, but how did this happen...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then the dragon began to remember.  Through Dimitri.  He remember Dimitri touching the gem Spyro brought back when he wasn't suppose to. He remember what happened to Dimitri and the gem.  What happened when he fused with Ignitus, becoming Ignitri. He remembered how he had food at some bar and then sex with Volteer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the  name of the Ancestors!?\"</span></div></div>",

I heard a raucous out here. What's going on? Is there trouble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drake bit his lower lip, trying and failing to hide in the darkness. Cynder frowned and walked down the hallway. She spotted a large figure trying to hide behind a shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting more and more suspicious, she gingerly approached the crouching figure. The drake gulped, unsure what to do in this situation. Should he reveal himself and try and explain everything, hoping that she will believe him? Or perhaps he should just run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder peered behind the shelf and gasped <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing his wife/mother look down at him, he saw no point in crouching on the floor and stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even thinking, he spurted out the first thing that came to mind.  \"This is all just a dream!\" he yelled, unaware that his were eyes glowing for a brief second<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder's shocked eyes glowed for a brief second as well, and her surprised expression became....slack?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just a dream,\" Cynder repeated in a monotone coice, her expression becoming calm<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her in worry, he approached his mate/mom. \"Cynder, are you alright?\" he asked in concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to him, she smiled. \"Yes, everything is alright. This is a dream after all.\" Her smile grew into a smirk. \"I'm fine...now that you are here.\" With that, she lunge forward, forelegs wrapped around his thick muscly neck and her lips capturing his stunned ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cynder gave him the deepest, most passionate kiss she could muster, the drake was trying to figure out what was happening. Mother/mate was suddenly convinced that this was all just a dream. Had he used some kind of hypnotizing powers on her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could have. Perhaps this new form also gave him new abilities (he also wondered what he could do in the form of Ignitri). But that didn't explain why his wife/mother wanted to bang him on the spot, climbing underneath him and sucking his pride and joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid he have another ability he wasn't aware of?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon groaned as his mate/parent was currently sucking his large dick, somehow managing to swallow the entire shaft.   A heavily muscular hindleg was beginning to twitch upwards as the owner felt the black dragoness' tongue brushing against the sac containing his mammoth testicles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep inside him, a rather dominant part of him (Spyro) was beginning to enjoy this situation and this state of existence. The submissive part of him (Dimitri) was conflicted and confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed one of Cynder's horns with one big strong paw and thrust his meaty hips forward, nearly causing Cynder to gag on his cock.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was approaching climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he came, the drake roaring in pleasure, he shot out gallons of seed with the pressure of a fire hose. Cynder gagged and coughed, but she didn't let go, determined to swallow as much seed as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly began to bulge, swelling larger and larger until it touched the ground, lifting her up slightly. When his climax was over, Cynder still didn't let go, for she felt suddenly sleepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling her gently away from his cock, the drake carried Cynder back to her room on his muscular back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that was one wet dream,\" she mumbled as she drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled when he heard that and shook his head in amusement.  \"Oh Cynder, you never change,\" he said, kissing his mate/mother on the snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quietly walked out of the bedroom and back to the hallway leading to Dimitri's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got there, he thought back about what he was thinking of before Cynder found and gave him a blow job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignitus, you and Spyro are gonna have word,\" Dimiro, a name he decide to give himself, whispered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding before Dimitri's door to his room, he decided what his next course of action should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould he unfuse back to Spyro and Dimitri?  Well he should, but he really didn't want to. </span></div></div>",

Yawning, he went to check and found a large, hyper muscular, deep purple dragon on the other side, who was glaring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, ah, hello,\" he said, feeling a little uneasy, \"Who are you?

Now, close your eyes and concentrate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitro did as Ignitus instructed, closing his eyes and focusing hard. He felt a sensation, like something pulling in the opposite direction, and his body began to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt began to morph again as they split apart, and when the glow faded they had successfully separated into two beings again. Dimitri still looked as chubby as ever, but when Spyro got to his feet, Ignitus raised his eyebrows in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro had changed.</span></div></div>",

He didn't blame them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the one hand, he felt that this was getting out of hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other, the emptiness left by these two, in his perspective, gorgeous dragons was getting unbearable due to the fact that it could quench by fusing with them right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright!\" Dimitri shouted as he threw his arms up in surrender.  \"Just for a bit and only for tonight, okay?  I have school in the morning, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you are right,\" said Ignitus, \"And we also have things to do. We promise for only this night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to Spyro. \"Alright, are you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro nodded. \"Yup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey approach ed Dimitri, who shuddered in pleasure, his cock instantly erect. When they got close to him, he climaxed, shooting his seed  all over the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body began to glow and he felt like he was being pulled apart as his body wanted to fuse with both Ignitus and Spyro. But luckily the older dragons placed their paws on him, and their bodies began to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe process began as they fused into each other.The new being began to take shape, which was tall, muscular and sported a large rear. It also appeared to have extra wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the light faded away, a huge adult dragon sat on Ignitus' floor on his huge, very plush posterior.  He groaned and idly scratched his solid, round belly.  He got to his feet and calmly turn to the large mirror in the room and saw his reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smirked, liking what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the mirror was a huge elder dragon. Four large powerful wings adorned his muscular back. Dark purple scales covered most of his body, with the exception of his limbs, which were covered in flame red scales. His underbelly was gold with a orange tint to it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he was ripped everywhere. More ripped than Dimiro. Well not everywhere, he noted as he saw his firm round gut and that massive blubbery booty he had. He gave a shake and ooohed as he felt the jiggles, ripples and heavily swaying going through his magnificent fat buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd more well hung too. That throbbing dick was long enough for him to bend over suck himself off without fuss. And the way his massive bloated ballsack drag across the floor heavily....He shivered in pleasure feeling the friction created from that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his sight to his strong face, noting it was a combination between Ignitus' and Spyro's handsome faces with a slightly long goat beard attached. One of his sharp eyes was deep purple and bright green while the other was warm orange and gentle purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice,\" he said, even more pleased to hear his smooth, deep voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing the elder dragon did was give himself a name. Pyroxis, he decides, for he was a mix between two fire dragons, three, if you counted Spyro's basic fire element he controlled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second thing he did was to call in sick for both Spyro and Ignitus, using a letter system were he breathed fire, which turned into ash, and sent it flying through the window, where upon arrival at its destination, will transform back into the letter he wrote. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus' home was far too small for experimentation he wanted to do, and he decided to go elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing Spyro's time ability he knew from his memories, he slipped out of Warfang to the fields of Avalar. There he practiced, learning that he could control all the elements like Spyro, but it was much powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe learned that he also had psychic abilities, allowing him to lift small rocks and read weak minded beings, like animals, minds. It was a very interesting experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pyroxis was lapping up some water from a nearby stream, he felt the presence of someone. Looking up, he saw that a cheetah, a native of the land, was staring at him from a distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe searched his memory for who it was, and discovered that it was Hunter, an old friend of Spyro. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there,\" Pyroxis loudly said cordially to the cheetah.  \"The name is Pyroxis,\" he finished with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyroxis watch the cheetah approach him.  He tried to subtly read Hunter's mind but found that the cheetah is anything but weak minded.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow before him,  Hunter looked up at him with green eyes with traces of caution in them. Hunter cough before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you, Pyroxis.\", Hunter says warmly, eyes still filled with wariness.  \"May I ask what you are doing near my village's territory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just exploring,\" answered Pyroxis, \"I'm not from here. I come from far away and have recently made my residence in Warfang. I do apologize if I'm frightening your kind. A dragon my size can be scary. But I promise you that I'm completely benevolent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned at Hunter, who, for a brief moment, tugged at his kilt, as if he was trying to hide something. \"Well, then, Pyroxis,\" he said, \"Welcome to Avalar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyroxis smirk when he caught a whiff of arousal from Hunter but acted like he didn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for the warm welcome, Hunter of the Cheetah tribe,\" he said politely, before returning to lapping up some more water to quench his thirst, intentionally shaking his butt to cause both buttcheeks, immensely filled with lipid matter, to heavily bounce and quake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smirked as he heard a surprise groan behind him and caught the spike of arousal in Hunter's scent increase.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOoh, ah er, well then I-I will be on my way.\", Hunter stuttered, very enchanted by the bootiful sight before him.  Pyroxis heard him awkwardly shuffled away to the forest near him, not seeing the cheetah clutching the bulge in his kilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter had lied to Pyroxis. He intended to follow him around, hiding in the bushes. He was fascinated by this new dragon, if not attracted to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe proved to be a very interesting being, his abilities that he used at random shocking him. Who was this dragon, who seemed to be more powerful than the purple dragon himself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing he knew was that he was dam handsome!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, Pyroxis went to sit under a tree, closing his eyes, as if he was meditating. Under, who was hiding in the bush, lifted up his kilt and began to pound his rock hard cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hunter masturbated, Pyroxis was stretching his magical senses to all around him.  He smirk when he felt Hunter near him. His smirk grew sharper when he found out what Hunter was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunter.\", Pyroxis says calmly, his deep and smooth voice heard through most of the area around him, \"Please come before me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyroxis turned to the direction, and he sensed Hunter was watching him with a smug smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter paused his masturbations, eyes wide with shock, awe, and nervousness.  Not wanting to anger him,  he walk out of his hiding spot and awkwardly walk before Pyroxis, throbbing boner lifting his kilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at him calmly, noting his raging boner pressing against his kilt, Pyroxis said, \"Something tells me that you are attracted to me, hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter was blushing so hard that his fur was practically turning red. \"I-I'm sorry,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before he can began to spill out excuses, Pyroxis held up his massive paw. \"I know your bizarre kink,\" he began, \"And I'm not offended or weirded out. In fact, I'm flattered. So much so that I'm going yo give you want you crave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up, revealing his massive cock throbbing underneath him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave a sly smirk to the gaping blushing cheetah, whose own dick was leaking pre at that moment. He leaned down till his face was eye level to Hunter's.  \"Well? Go on, please me,\" Pyroxis ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter complied by quickly crawling over to the pulsing monster of a dick, marveling the sheer warmth it radiated and at how powerful it throb.  He ran his paws all over the huge shaft, causing the owner to groan in pleasure. He began to lightly nibble the cock flesh, lick it, snuggling it and joyfully grinding his own member against it.</span></div></div>",

Dimitri avoided Spyro and Ignitus, and they tried to avoid him in order to live a normal life, but, occasionally, they would fuse when the longing became unbearable, becoming once more Dimitro, Ignitri or Pyroxis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gem in the black dragon's chest didn't seem to bother him when he was around other dragons. It only urged him to fuse when his father or Ignitus was around. Other times it stayed silent, and Dimitri guessed that it had a mind of its own, choosing who it wanted to fuse with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a long time it stayed silent, and Dimitri tried to work off the weight he gained. Though, on one such day, as he was working out in the dojo, his best friend, Ash, came walking up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wanna take break and hit the bathhouse?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" said Dimitri, unaware that his gem flashed for a brief moment, deciding once more who it wanted to fuse with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that being was Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they bathed close to one another in the school's bathing chamber, Dimitri grumbled as he scrubbed soap across gelatinous plump rump.  Ever since he gained this weight, Dimitri tried everything to get rid of it.  Exercise and diet didn't seem to do diddly squat in burning off the fat, besides some muscle gains though.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was unaware of his gem giving off pulses of warmth through his body, but he contributed that to the warm water he was being soaked with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was unaware of the heated gaze his best friend was giving to him and his jiggly buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Dimitri, \" Ash started, getting his old friend's attention on him. \"I notice you have been acting a bit odd lately,\" he said, looking concerned. \"Is there anything that happened to you of late?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no,\" said Dimitri, turning his back to Ash, giving the maroon dragon a proper few of his jiggling rump, \"I-I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" Ash asked, taking a step forward in the warm water, \"You seemed rather absentminded lately. I got a feeling that you've got something on your mind that you don't want to tell me about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri bit his lower lip, pondering whether or not he should tell Ash about his powers and the strange beings he transformed into when he fused with Spyro and Ignitus. But would he believe him? If he did, would he freak out or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then he became aware of his gem in his chest, which was becoming uncomfortably hot. He also noticed he was aroused. Dimitri's eyes grew wide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The gem!\" he thought in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had chosen who it wanted to fuse with, and that dragon was his best friend!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri wanted to jump out of the bath and get as much distance away from Ash, but then he thought twice. What was the use keeping this a secret? He will only make himself look stupid and worry Ash even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" he said, turning to Ash, \"I'll tell you, but first you must come a bit closer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh blink owlishly at his friend with concern.  \"Er okay...\" Ash said, bewildered but did as Dimitri said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon as he was mere inches away, he heard Dimitri grunt and saw the strangest thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Di-Dimitri!?\" Ash stammered, feet frozen in place as he saw the light made mass that was in the shape of his friend shine mere inches from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he thinking of getting some help or getting away, the shining mass, in a flash, slammed into him, making him yelp in surprise and fright.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he too glowed and became a being of pink light. The masses of light began to mix and form a slightly shape that was quite curvy, slender and quite roundacious of the bottom part of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon that came out of the fusion had dark maroon scales, which had swirly, heart-shaped scale patterns. His under belly was yellow, his horns having  the shape of Ash's, but Dimitri's ivory white color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed, he was very curvy, sporting thick thighs and an ample rear. He could have been mistaken form a female. The new dragon was confused, but he soon learned from Dimitri's memories what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So us... I mean you...can fuse!?\" He said, hearing that his voice sounded surprisingly feminine, \"And you fused with others as well? That is so....awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon jumped out of the bath, grinning happily. \"This is so cool!\" He exclaimed, \"I wonder what neat things I can do in this body, like you did in the other fusions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter drying himself off, he left the bathroom, ready to test out his new powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through the hallways, Ashtri, which he quickly named himself, sauntered confidently to his class on his (luckily Dimitri's and Ash's) schedule, English.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he made his way, he notice the stares he was getting from everyone. Every dragon and dragoness were either gaping, drooling, blushing or a combination of them as he passed by. His gorgeous face turn into a seductive smirk, which made more of his fellow students become weak in the knees or hot and bothered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My oh my, look at all the attention I am getting today,\" he giggled as he made it to his classroom entrance.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering, he ignored the same looks as before sent his way and look at two particular desks.  Making his mind up, he chose the one in the front of the class. Which is his (Dimitri's) seat to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that moment, Cyril, the teacher of that class, entered the room in a regal manner.  \"Alright class, settle down and take your seats,\" he said sternly, taking his seat at his desk. \"Today we will-\" It was then that Cyril catched sight of Ashtri.</span></div></div>",

Welcome to our school and I hope you will have a good year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began his lesson quickly in order to hide his embarrassment. While he did this, Ashtri decided to use his powers, focusing his attention on Cyril. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he focus most of power on Cyril, it also affected those around him. Young drakes began to twitch and fidget in their seats, faces becoming befuddled and then embarrassed and end with a expression of ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same going for the young dragonesses in the room. They squirm in their seats, mewling quietly as possible.

When it was over, the young dragons stumbled out of the class, goofy expressions in their faces, reeking of hormones. All of them had lost their virginity in that 45 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyril was stood rooted before the blackboard in shock, cum still dripping from his cock, adding to the mess in the classroom. \"W-what happened?\" Was the only thing he could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshtri grinned as he left the classroom, his bulging belly sloshing, filed to the brim with seed from several dragons. \"On to the next class,\" he thought, \"Let's see if I can mess with Terrador and the students there as well.\"</span></div></div>",

Despite being bloated on food at the moment, he was able to feel some soft pudge around the food laden gut.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunder sigh, disappointed in himself.  \"Big bro is right, this can't be good for me.  If this keep up, I will be one fat dragon and then what will everyone think of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sunder shuddered at this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was nerdy and bit of a social recluse, so the idea of so many eyes on him made him quite nervous.

Sunder... wasn't one for exercises, prefers reading books or playing puzzle games than working up a sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother options is magic or potions.  Both that Sunder quite excels at and looks more appealing then the other option. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looks like his mind already decided for him as he went to pick up a book from his shelf labeled 'Potion for Geniuses'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book did not comtain very advanced potion, unfortunately. Those type of books were sealed off in the school's library, and you had to get special permission to access them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, it was way too late in the night. He would have to do something with the things he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, maybe if I mix this mundane potion with a spell, I could enhance it's effects,\" he said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what type of spell? Ones again, that was in the school's library. Sunder sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I have to try tomorrow,\" he said to himself.</span></div></div>",

The normally physically unfit young dragon perked up by being called on by his teacher and trotted towards him with no fatigue from the marathon he just gave his peers a short while back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey coach, what do you want to talk about?\" Sunder ask, a energetic smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cut straight to the point here Sunder; is everything alright with you?\" Terrador ask, concern coloring his deep voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything is okay,\" said Sunder, confused, \"Why wouldn't it be? Though, I'm feeling a bit hungry now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm asking, for you are acting not like yourself,\" said Terrador, \"usually, you are the slowest in the class, no offense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe I decided to work a little harder,\" said Sunder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rung for lunch time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" said Terrador, \"run along now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunder did just that, for he was suddenly famished.</span></div></div>",

Spyro wasted no time with the others, who raised their wooden shields in a futile attempt for cover. He blasted them with a fire ball, sending them flying like bowling ball pins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around and saw that Cynder was handling her fair amount of gremlins easily, cutting them to pieces with her tail and claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the fight was over, both dragons smiled at each other, and Cynder said, \"Well, that was easy. I was expecting a bigger fight from a place that hides some kind of \" priceless artifact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, me too,\" said Spyro, \"Gremlins are flimsy creatures. Who in their right mind would send them to guard a place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, shall we continue?\" Cynder said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll lead the way,\" said Spyro, but Cynder cut before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been leading they way enough,\" said she, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey trotted with caution down the tunnel in silence, their breathing and foot steps being the only sounds being made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder decided to make small talk to break the eerie calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Cynder started.  \"What did the Guardians want us to get from the gremlins again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a bit embarrassed to say that she lost track in paying attention to the mission briefing since it was Volteer who gave it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to remember Volteer's long winded speech about their mission, Spyro cleared his throat and said, \"Well, he said....hmmm....well, there's this ancient idol thing we should get. The Guardians said they want to study it for it's unique magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't that sound like tomb raiding to you?\" Cynder asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bit,\" Spyro said, \"but I'm sure the Guardians mean well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they rounded the corner, they saw in a large cavern the idol sitting on a stone pedestal. It was in the shape of some kind of corpulent creature, which was holding a golden sphere in it's pudgy hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were two more gremlins guarding it, and Spyro grinned, saying to Cynder, \"Let's take these guys out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was pretty much a one sided battle for the gremlins as they were beaten by the dragon duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnnoticed by them all, the crystal sphere the idol was holding began to softly glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(A few seconds later)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is that,\" Spyro said, standing over the gremlins' defeated forms.  Cynder, meanwhile, was walking towards the idol, wanting nothing more but to obtain it and go back home. This place gave her the creeps for some reason.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here is the ugly idol,\" Cynder said, grabbing the figure from the pedestal, missing the flare of light from the sphere it was holding.  \"Now lets get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Spyro and Cynder made it outside the cave, a new legion of bloodthirsty gremlins were there before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a little bit harder to fight them this time. There were a lot more of them. It seemed like the whole tribe that resided in the cave had decided to attack them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder and Spyro had decided that it would be better to fight straight through them and flee the cave. Putting the idol in a satchel Cynder brought with her, they fought their way through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a few weird things happened while they battled. Spyro, for example, let loose a belch when he wanted to use his fire breath, his flames coming out bigger and stronger than usual, but it did it's job, scorching several gremlins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder, as she was trying to pounce a gremlin, her rear in the air, let loose a fart, which, surprisingly, didn't stink at all. They brushed the weird events aside, focusing on fleeing the cave, which they did, flying into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind them, the gremlins were screaming in rage, throwing their spears, but missing them. Spyro and Cynder flew to their campsite, which was in another cave far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair landed in their camp in silence, a part of their minds lingering on the unusual things of their escape.  Both quickly shook their thoughts off as their stomachs both grumble simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey gave a awkward chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like our escape left us a appetite.\" , Spyro says.  \"Let me head out and find us some sheep to eat.\" He paused.  \"While avoiding the gremlins, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder nodded, eager to get some food into her belly.

He craned his neck to look down and gasp loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore his wide purple eyes was a large curved hill of golden belly plates, wobbling and bobbing slightly from the slightest motion Spyro made.  Without thinking, Spyro raised a paw to poke the large jiggly mass attached to his midriff and gaped once again at seeing his limb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis left paw and the limb it was attached to was bloated with sagging flesh that sway from the movements he made.  He then notice how heavy his left foreleg felt.  In fact, he felt all of him to be very heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the ancestors!?\" Spyro shrieked, waking up his girlfriend beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spyro?\" Cynder asked in confusion when she heard his cries, \"What's the matt-buuuurp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder was taken aback when she belched loudly. But she was even more shocked when she saw her body. She had fattened up considerable overnight. Her pot belly almost reached the ground, her limbs thicker, straining her jewellery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut most of the weight seemed to decide to rest on her rear. Her ass were to mountainous peaks of scaly black blubber, and perched on top of it was her tail, which looked more like some giant slug than a dragon's tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder began to breath rapidly, both from worry and effort from moving. \"S-Spyro, w-whats going on? W-why are we fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing his lover, Spyro calm somewhat and turn to her... and blush heavily upon seeing her... ahem robust form she had gained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damn look at her ass. I really wanna tap that now,\" Spyro thought before blushing a bit more, realizing what he just thought.  This wasn't the time to indulge such thoughts.  Though his body disagree just as he continued to ogled his girlfriend's ample caboose and bountiful curvy body, a certain part of him was peeking out of its hiding place and stiffening up gradually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing what was happening, Spyro panicked for a bit, not wanting his girlfriend to see him getting off of her recent gain in blubber.  Spyro quickly killed his erection by thinking of Apes naked and posing lewdly just as he got to his chubby paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling awkwardly to his love, Spyro said in attempt to assure her, \"I don't know Cynder but-BURP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro suddenly burped loudly, gaining more poundage on his frame as he swelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-maybe it's some k-kind of temporarily curse does gremlins casted on us,\" Cynder said, trying to calm herself down by reasoning logically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she let loose a small fart and her body, though, mostly her rear, swelled larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Cynder, I think it's probably something far different,\" Spyro said, \"No gremlin can do this. I-its impossible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what could have done this!\" Cynder exclaimed, panicking, \"By this rate, we'll be too fat to fly soon and never make it back to Warfang!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down,\" Spyro said, \"There has to be a solution to the problem. Maybe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe trailed off when his eyes fell on the satchel, which had a glowing light coming out of the opening. Waddling closer, Spyro pulled out the statue and examined it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The statue,\" he said, \"I think it did this to us. It's cursed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idol in his chubby paws had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce a statue of a undefinable obese creature, its new form has a few traits to tell what manner of creature it was.  A tiny pair of leathery wings on its rotund back, scale like texture covered a majority of it, and horns to the side of its skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the-BURP!- world?\", Spyro mumbled, ignoring the weight magically piling up on him as he examined the idol warily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back with a sigh to his love with a resign expression, he spoke. \"Cynder, I don't we have a choice.  We have to return to Warfang.\", giving a shaky smile, Spyro continued. \"Even if we turn immobile, I am sure the Guardians will send reinforcements of a sort to pick us up.\" His smile becoming strained. \"Hopefully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Cynder said, \"We will never reach Warfang in time. Even if they did send a search party for us, there's a good chance that the gremlins will find us first. I don't even want to know what they will do with us, especially if we are two mountains of juicy blubber.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shuddered, her fat body jiggling. \"No, there has to be a way to reverse this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's toy with the idol some more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure if that's a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's either that or be transformed into two mounds of fat!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We can get to Warfang quicker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's not waste time,\" said Cynder, \"Let's go and pray that the Guardians can fix this.\"</span></div></div>",

Seeing no explanation, Ignitus shrugged thinking it was nothing an-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUD!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the name of the ancestors!?\", Ignitus cried out in shock as everything around him trembled the Guardians barely managing to keep themselves from falling onto their faces as they headed to the exit the chamber to investigate what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the shaw nearly scared them out of their scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Terrador said in shock, looking at the two blobby of mountains purple and black making their way to Warfang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt caused quite a stir inside the city when the earth began to shake and two purple and black mountains could be visibly seen over the walls, like two approaching titans of doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Guardians wanted to gather an army and fight of these \"monster\", but then they heard a voice call out that they knew, a voice that sounded amplified by some unknown source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignitus!\" spyro called, sounding relieved, \"You gotta help me and Cynder. The weird thing you sent us to get, it turned us into...well, this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Guardians stared wide eyed at the obese giants, struggling to believe that these two were there students only a day and a half ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile still somewhat in shock, Ignitus flew up to face to giant face with Spyro, numbly noting the huge slabs of fat chins or the building sized cheeks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sp-Spyro?\" Ignitus stuttered with disbelief,  \"What in the world happen to you and Cynder?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The idol,\" Spyro said, his tone full of desperation, \"It did this to us. Help us, please!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, at his massive side, Cynder fell to the ground in exhaustion, causing a short earthquake to Warfang.  She then burped and swell with blubber.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I see,\" Ignitus said,  \"Where is the idol now?  With it, we might be able to undo what it's done to you both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro blushed and said, \"Well, it's stuck in my...rear. I accidentally sat on it and can't get it out with my huge claws. If you want it, you will have to get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough this was a very awkward thing to do, Ignitus knew that there was no time to waste. He had to save Spyro and Cynder before they grew too big!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlying over to Spyro's vast butt cheeks, he spotted an object clinging inside the purple dragon's canyon. Flying towards it, he, while blushing hard, stuck his paw into it and pulled out the idol, which now looked fully like a corpulent dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flew back to the wall and landed amongst his fellow  Guardians and said, \"Don't worry, we will find a way to fix this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just be careful,\" Spyro said, \"It might turn you into this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Spyro,\" said Ignitus, feeling a slight warmth between his ear fins, \"We are professionals with the arts of magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe departed, not knowing what will happen next. </span></div></div>",

The yellow elder dragon then gave his head a scratch with one of his fore paws for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well first off,\" Ignitus began, \"we need to know more about the idol.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gestured to the corpulent dragon statue.  Cyril grimaced at it with distaste while Terrador and Volteer gaze at it with caution.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Volteer go look through the library on anything from magical objects, curses or Gremlin rituals etc.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolteer nodded and left to the Temple's library.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus turned to the Guardian of Ice.  \"Cyril please give Spyro and Cynder a full examination. Medical and magical. Anything from your reports may help us with this.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyril reluctantly nodded and left to get his supplies for examination for the swelling blobs outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus finally turned to the fidgeting green elder dragon. \"Now Terrador, you will help with-huh?\" Ignitus paused, looking at the Earth Guardian with befuddlement. \"Terrador, what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe said dragon was lying on the ground, sweat covering his buff body and was wearing a weird  expression on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know,\" he said, ,\"It feels like...like...Ag, Ancestors! It feels like a seriously need to bust a nut!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus was very confused with Terrador's outburst, but then he saw something that made his jaw drop. Terrador's black prid and joy was fully erect, his plump balls drooping behind it...and his privates were swelling bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Ignitus said in horror, ''It's happening! How could I have been so incompetent? Of course the idol will infect us if we touch and stand around it without protection. I need to warn the others!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus made to leave the room, but then he stopped when he passed the a mirror in the room. \"Oh no!\" He whispered, seeing his much fatter his body and how strange his forehead suddenly look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, he said, \"And I better do it fast!\" </span></div></div>",

By the time we get there it will be dusk if you keep going like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming, I'm coming!\" Cynder snapped back at her, clearly annoyed as she staggered up the hill, her and everyone else packs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber only rolled her eyes. Cynder had insisted that she carried everyone else's packs, despite their warning that it would be too much for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd here she was now, panting and sweating, Spyro not far behind. The purple dragon grew ever more concerned as he watched Cynder struggle up the hill, clearly exhausted and about to drop to the ground at any moment. He had offered several times to help her, but each time she declined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe simply couldn't stand by and watched anymore. He took most the packs and put them on his back. It was very heavy, even for him, and he wondered how Cynder could have carried them for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Cynder said in protest, though, she was secretly grateful, \"I can carry them myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I beg to differ,\" Spyro said as he walked up the hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you don't think I can do it?\" Cynder asked, sounding offended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynder, you were on the verge of collapsing,\" said Spyro, \"You could have gotten yourself hurt. Please, I'm trying to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Cynder said with a sigh, \"I'm just trying to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been trying to help a lot lately,\" Spyro said, \"Teaching young how to fight and fly, helping the moles rebuild and taking up various sort lived hobbies. Why is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just trying to be active, that's all,\" Cynder said, \"It helps me forget.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" said Spyro, \"But it won't help that you break your literally break you back trying to help everyone. It's just silly. Besides, its good just relaxing for a while, like this camping trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you a re right,\" said Cynder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the reached the top of the hill, they could see the clearing Ember had scouting out the previous day for them, but it seems like someone had beat them to it first, much to Ember annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the grassy meadow stood two wooden trailers. They were colorfully decorated and plumes of smoke was rising out of their chimneys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber huffed and said, \"Dangit, now we have to share our grounds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so pessimistic,\" said Spyro, \"Let's meet them.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">It's sometime after 'Dawn of the Dragon', Spyro and Cynder are together and exploring the changed world after Malifor's defeat. Many strange changes await them in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother 'do anything' story. Feel free to play around with it. Cynder and Spyro can either be the age they were at the end of the game, adolescents, or full adults. HOWEVER, if they have kids keep the number minimal to keep things from getting confusing, no more than one or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, other characters may be featured from the games such as the Elders or Hunter's tribe. HOWEVER, <i>if</i> they are to be used they are to be treated with a certain amount of respect. The Elder dragons can have some changes effect them too (weight gain, inflation, etc), Hunters tribe on the other hand is to be largely excluded from such things. An original tribe member may be used for inflation, weight gain, and the rest, but Hunter himself and the tribe leaders are to be left out due to the extreme 'Out of Character' state they would be in then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, while it's preferred Sparx be left out of most of the stories, he may be used if need be. (I found him annoying, so sue me.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow here's the basic run down of DON'Ts:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- No excessive violence save in action scenes.<br>\r\n- No gory sights (blood may be used for injuries, but no characters are to be graphically killed)<br>\r\n- No popping<br>\r\n- No bringing back already dead characters (Malifor and the others villains are dead, so no sudden resurrections of them without good cause)<br>\r\n- All transformations and alterations must have a good explanation, no 'OMG tehy gain 10,000,000 lbs' chapters will be allowed.<br>\r\n- Keep it within the Spyro universe. Preferably the Dawn of the Dragon trilogy and not Skylanders. I won't crack down hard on Skylanders stuff, but I would like to dissuade it since (contrary to popular belief) not everyone can afford to buy thousands of little characters to play all the possible creatures in the game. (Plus I find Spyro and Cynders redesigns for it simply hideous.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>I reserve the right to delete any chapters I feel inadequate to the story and more of a distraction/waste of space than actually reading material.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDone, so read, write, be creative, and enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a different version from the other one I have of a similar name. This one will focus exclusively on more lighthearted 'fun' adventures' over something dark and serious. Preferable this one is to cater to the Weight Gain, Inflation and various other forms of alterations crowds. If you want exclusively serious stuff, go to the other interactive.</td>",
