His first Pokemon was a Salazzle he had raised from a Salandit.  And the two were in love with each other.  Andrew was a handsome man, buff from years of adventuring, with dark brown hair that he kept shaved short and stubble from a beard.  He generally wore sweatpants, boots, and a tattered t-shirt with holes in it.  Technically speaking, he was a gym leader.  Although his 'gym' was wherever he decided to be at the time, the Pokemon Leagues of various regions recognized his status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe liked living off of the land, although he had a house back in Maldash.  He was a skilled survivalist, he and his Salazzle capable of handling almost anything.  The thing was? Andrew was only mildly attracted to human females.  He was, however, VERY attracted to female Pokemon.  He never broadcast it, never made a big deal out of it.  But he and his Salazzle not only loved each other, they were also lovers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Salazzle was also a naughty sort, and tended to use her pheromones to find Andrew many Pokemon lovers.  He had girls on every continent, and wondered if he'd managed to get any of them pregnant.  As when he visted those regions again, his lovers always seemed to remember him fondly.  Life was good.  He had his Salazzle, he had his supplies, he had his lovers, and he had his freedom.  Everything was going to be fine...</span></div></div>",
