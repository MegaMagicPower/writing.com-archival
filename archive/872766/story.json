I stood there, transfixed while he looked me up and down. The cool night air slipping in through the open door danced across my body under the silk, pebbling my nipples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thin material did little to cover me, but I grew strangely excited by the way his eyes narrowed and his breathing quickened. He finally wrenched his eyes away from my chest and focused on mine. \"Hi!\" he whispered huskily, \"My name's Mike... Michael. I saw you earlier. I thought you might like to do something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything to do around here?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes were back on my chest, \"No. Not really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Amy, by the way. So, Michael...\" I paused for effect, \"What did you have in mind?\" While he thought about what to answer, I checked him out. He really was hot! He was about my height, just a bit taller. He had dark, wavy hair and I could tell he had some muscle about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis green eyes were back, checking out my breasts. Normally, I get really irritated when a guy does this. I mean, I'm more than a pair of boobs. Tonight, I could feel a strange tingle in my stomach. I wasn't sure where this might lead, but it sure as hell beat sitting around being bored half to death!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael said, \"Well, how about if...\"  </span></div></div>",

The knocking became madder and louder. She started to shake. The person broke the window and opened it slowly. She hid under the covers. The door opened. She heard the loud, slow breathing. She started to debate on what to do. She saw blood drip as she poked her head out, her cat was gutted and as dragged on the ground by a man. She screamed. The guy grabbed her and cut her tongue out. She started to thrash her arms around. He grabbed her right arm and broke the bone and made it snap through the skin.\" He stops once again, seeing that you are scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep going.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She slunk her arm around trying to get the guy, but he ended up cutting her arm off and her legs off as well.

Why don't you go back to the hospital where the doctors can treat you?\" He says it in the tone one would use with a nine-year old.
