The club was closed for the night, Batman grappled to the rooftop to see if there was a more \"subtle\" way in, and when he got up there he was surprised to see a ceiling window open, like someone wanted him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman decided to go in anyway and has he landed on red tiled floor he saw that there was light coming from a room behind a bar, he went in to find another door with a flight of stairs going down; as the dark knight went downstairs he saw a wrestling ring but before he could properly investigate a arm wrapped around his neck and squeezed tight and before long; he passed out.      </span></div></div>",
