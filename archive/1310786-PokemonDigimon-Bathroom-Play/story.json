If you prefer Pokemon or Digimon being dirty; this interactive is an excellent match for you. Comments and criticism are always appreciated.<br>\r\n============================================================================ <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn exciting new display has been established at the downtown museum; everyone's invited to the grand opening!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The strange message came without forewarning, this morning, in their junk mail. The unexpected note arouses their interest. Dashing up the unsteady, oak stairs leading to their bedroom; they searched through their worn dresser with incredible speed and found a ragged collection of dusty, tattered threads. They throw them on at once and snag their keys from the nightstand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They dash out the entrance and hurry to their waiting car. They spring to the driver's seat, shift the vehicle into motion and drive through the bustling streets. A huge, disorganized crowd greets them, so they hurry to the queue's end. Hours go by, and their excitement continues to increase, as they stay in the shrinking queue of museum patrons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Getting to the beginning took more time than they imagined; they dart through the unlocked doors nearly upsetting a couple of younger patrons. Maneuvering through the boisterous, crowded halls, they come to their destination. The exhibition's comprised of various sections; they never envisioned its staggering size. They question what section to visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They spy an elderly, shriveled man moving toward them; he wanders with a heavy limp and the support of a large staff. He sets a shaking hand upon their shoulders. They take note of his delicate health; he is at least 100 from their best estimate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You received the notice! Good, please explore any hallway you wish, and enjoy the latest display.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Momentarily disregarding their manners; they turn back to the display's gate. They look here and there, but the stranger has disappeared from view. They shrug their shoulders in bewilderment and set out toward...</span></div></div></span></div></div>",

The hallway is long and confusing; they begin to grow fatigued before stopping dead in their tracks.

Charmander was once a wild Pokemon, so he should have no trouble. Charmander gathered up all the supplies he could carry and followed the map left in his former trainer's bags to the nearest city. He is tired when he first arrives, but Charmander wanted to explore his potential new home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There is a strange lack of humans in the city, but Charmander preferred it that way. Charmander walked around the city streets and managed to stumble upon a Pokemon center; the center is quite busy, and all sorts of Pokemon are happily wandering about the large lobby. Charmander headed for the front desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Excuse me.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charmander politely remarked to the nurse Joy on duty. Charmander had originally thought all the humans were gone; it looks like a few may still be here. She turns around to greet him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Are you lost?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She inquires helpfully and looks delighted to see the small fire type. Charmander took some offense to her question; he tried his best to stay friendly, so he did not scare her off before getting some answers about his new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">I am not lost; I came here on my own.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She nearly fell out of her chair upon hearing the fire type speak. Charmander assumes he is the first talking Pokemon she has seen. Maybe Charmander should have taken a different approach. Nurse Joy looks Charmander over in amazement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You can understand human language?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Why of course I can! What can you do for entertainment around here?</span>\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charmander tried to keep up his friendly demeanor. Nurse Joy takes a couple of minutes to recover from the earlier shock. She finally regains her composure and answers the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I am new here and do not know much about the city; I just help to run the Pokemon center, but you could look around if you like.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nurse Joy replies honestly. She may not have been the best help, but Charmander did not hold it against her. Charmander decided to take her advice; he did not know what else he would find in the city, but it was better than staying here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nurse Joy quickly turns around and continues her work. Charmander wandered through the streets, and soon arrived at the local city gym; he headed inside to explore. Many Pokemon are busy training, or just sitting around and relaxing. A Treecko is laying in a folding chair; he does not notice Charmander, so he tries to get his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Can you tell me anything helpful about this city?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charmander hopes Treecko may have some answers. Treecko has his eyes tightly closed and looks as if he is fast asleep.  Treecko evidently heard him because he slowly turns over in the chair and looks up at the fire type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Almost all the humans left this city long ago. No one here remembers much else about its history.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">So the Pokemon...</span>\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Treecko is taking his sweet time; he is not in any hurry to answer Charmander's questions. He has all the time he needs, so Charmander pulls up another chair and sits next to Treecko. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">The Pokemon run almost the entire city by themselves. They were all abandoned by their trainers or never had one at all. Feel free to stay here, and do whatever you like.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Treecko stands up before stretching himself awake and starting to walk around the gym. Charmander thinks it over and decides it would be a good idea to stay here. Charmander just has to decide what to do first...</span></div></div></span></div></div>",

A Hitmonchan sees the two sparring, so he volunteers to referee the match. Charmander attacks first with a flamethrower, but Treecko easily dodges. He turned to attack again but noticed Treecko is already standing in front of him. Charmander is stunned by Treecko's amazing speed. Charmander is hit with a bullet seed before he can react; he is sent flying across the field, and nearly knocked unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">I give up.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He thought not having a trainer around would be a lot of fun, but Charmander never envisioned things going like this.

He always said Charmander needed to get stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">I may have overdone it a bit.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Treecko turns and smiles at Charmander. They find a place to rest and talk for a while; they end up learning a lot about each other in a short time. Charmander explained how he used to have a  trainer, but decided to run away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">It was the same for me. I never could seem to please him.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charmander eventually confesses how he would sometimes pull pranks on his trainer. Treecko shakes his head. He sighs a little before continuing the conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Wish I had thought of that.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After talking a bit more; they knew almost everything about each other. They even learned each other's darkest secrets. Treecko is the perfect match for Charmander, or so it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"<span class=\"cgreen\">I did not know we had so much in common!</span>\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The thought actually starts to scare him.

Adam inhaled Charmander's scent and received a strong odor of sweat and musk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Adam's tongue crept from his mouth and licked gently against the cream-colored sole. Charmander's small feet are warm and sweaty, but they are still surprisingly well-kept. Adam did not mind the slightly bitter taste of his Charmander's feet. Charmander kept a close eye on Adam as he licked his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">How do you like being a slave?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Adam did not respond; he just kept to his appointed task. Adam finishes Charmander's left foot in short order; Charmander swiftly switches feet. Charmander grins gleefully and enjoys his newfound position of power. Adam remained obedient as he continued his work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">That is a good slave; make sure you get every inch of my foot.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Adam cannot tell if Charmander is praising or mocking him. Adam repeated the former process but went a bit faster this time. Adam did not admit it to Charmander, but he was starting to like this odd form of torture. Adam finished his task after a few more minutes of hard licking. Charmander raised his feet and observed Adam's efforts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Not a bad job, so I think I will...</span>\"</span></div></div></span></div></div>",

The taste of Charmander's rear is almost overwhelming to Adam's senses, but he carries on with the job. Charmander began to moan from the rimming of his orange butt. Adam managed to finish his task with some intense licking and freed his tongue from his Pokemon's backside. Charmander looks pleased by Adam's determined efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"<span class=\"cred\">You are getting good at this, so now you have to finish your task!</span>\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What happens next takes him by surprise.

Adam gathers his things, and they head out. They walk a ways into the forest and find a lone Pidgey in a small clearing; he looks lost. This Pokemon looks perfect for whatever Charmander has planned.

The whole thing is too easy; Charmander should not need Adam's help. Pidgey still remains unsure but decides to take the offer before Charmander changes their mind. Adam quickly throws out a pokeball, and Pidgey does not resist capture. Charmander is happy for the moment, so Adam remains free for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"<span class=\"cred\">That is only one, but we need a few more!</span>\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charmander is excited; he must be enjoying this.

The pair turns to Adam and chuckle menacingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><span class=\"cred\">I want to go first!</span></b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charmeleon announces eagerly; Blaziken sits down on the floor and happily watches the events unfold. Charmeleon lifts his dusty, blackened right foot and forces it into Adam's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><span class=\"cred\">Lick It!</span></b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charmeleon orders sternly. Adam sighs before sticking out his tongue and licking hastily at the Pokemon's filthy foot. The smell is horrible, and the foot is very stained. While Blaziken got up from his position on the floor, Adam kept licking. Blaziken wanted a better look at the action; he sniffs at the damp foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><span class=\"clred\">Man your feet stink!</span></b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Blaziken mocks Charmeleon jokingly. Charmeleon laughs at Blaziken's little observation; while his servant kept tending to the foot in front of him. Adam tried to say something, but his face remained muffled by the fire Pokemon's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">I always keep my feet dirty, so I can torture other Pokemon whenever I like.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charmeleon boasts; obviously taking great pride, in his unhygienic habits. After a couple more minutes of constant licking; Charmeleon takes his foot off Adam's face and allows him to breathe. Charmeleon carefully inspects his cleaned foot, until he is satisfied with the results. Adam secretly enjoyed this form of torture but said nothing about it to Charmeleon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Now for the other one.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charmeleon shoves his other equally grimy, strong-smelling foot into place. Adam started licking again without so much as a single word of complaint. A few minutes later the task is complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><span class=\"clred\">I want mine cleaned to!</span></b>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Blaziken strolls over ostentatiously, and shoves his right talon Against Adam's face; he remained silent. The smell of the bird Pokemon's foot is more bearable, but the layers of dirt are far thicker. Charmeleon takes a quick sniff at Blaziken's uncleaned talon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Mine are better, but your feet are not bad.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charmeleon boasts in triumph; while looking at Blaziken. The large fire type just waves off the bravado and flashes Charmeleon a smile. Charmeleon is confused by this odd gesture but says nothing of it. Blaziken takes the brief opportunity to boast in his own defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clred\">Just wait until later.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Chimchar continues to helplessly watch the scene. A short while later; Blaziken's feet are spotless. Charmeleon switches places with Blaziken once more; he shoves his red ass against the Adam's face. Adam takes the hint and begins licking. Blaziken bends over and sniffs Charmeleon's butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><span class=\"clred\">Phew, and I thought your feet were bad!</span></b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Blaziken backs away, so he will not interfere. Charmeleon lets out a huge smelly fart, right in Adam's face. The smell quickly fills the room. Adam tries to prepare himself, for the inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clred\">The earlier action was good, but this is even better.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Blaziken chimes in with a quick comment. Charmeleon pushes as hard as he can; Adam's eyes lock onto Charmeleon's flexing pink anus. Log after log of smelly shit; slowly falls from Charmeleon's ass. Charmeleon sighs in delight; as he defecates on his unfortunate victim. After a couple of minutes Charmeleon turns around; he surveys the scene in front of him and finds it satisfying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><span class=\"cred\">Much better!</span></b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charmeleon sighs with relief; Blaziken walks over, and he hurriedly presents the slave with his red feathered ass. Adam knew his task, but he sighed from fatigue. Charmeleon sniffs at the bird Pokemon's red butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"<span class=\"cred\">I thought my butt smelled bad, but not that bad!</span>\"</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charmeleon stumbles backward at the foul smell; Blaziken laughs and takes his turn to mock the other fire type. Charmeleon concedes defeat; he watches the coming show with great interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"<span class=\"clred\">This is going to be a big one; I can feel it already!</span>\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Blaziken boasts in triumph and lifts his tail with a wink. Blaziken presses his feathered ass tightly against the waiting face; Adam's nose is trapped under the Blaziken's tail. Every time Adam draws a breath; the stink of Blaziken's ass ends up filling his lungs. Blaziken grunts loudly, and his asshole begins to twitch; liquid white shit soon pours from his rectum. The smelly assault is brief, easily exceeds Charmeleon's efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><span class=\"cred\">Wow, and I thought I had to go!</span>\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charmeleon applauds and holds his nose. The overpowering smell of Blaziken's shit is all Adam can perceive. Charmeleon and Blaziken step in front of Adam and aim their limp cocks before starting to piss. The urine spurts fourth in two equally powerful jets and quickly adds to the overpowering smell of the room. A minute later the pair have finished; they turn to Chimchar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">How did you like the show?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charmeleon laughs, but Chimchar does not respond. Each Pokemon is satisfied with the results of the punishment and happily leave the room. Adam rises to his feet and is still covered in filth; he wipes as much of it away as he can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">Are you okay?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Chimchar weakly asks. Adam nods and sits down on the bed. He takes a minute to compose himself before he turns to Chimchar; who looks back at him meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was that Blaziken anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Adam questions Chimchar, while continuing to clean himself off a bit more. Chimchar looks embarrassingly at Adam, and averts his gaze toward the ground; Chimchar mumbles a nearly unintelligible response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">He was an old friend of mine.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Chimchar admits shamefully; while continuing to look away from the human. Adam turns Chimchar around, so he is facing him directly. Chimchar's embarrassment is only made worse by the forced confrontation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He does not seem like much of a friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Adam notes coldly; Chimchar just nods his head, while staying completely silent. Adam eventually clean up the room, and decides what he wants to do next..</span></div></div></span></div></div>",

Adam opens the crate; a Muk jumps out and tackles him to the ground. Adam pushes Muk off of him and realizes they are the missing patient in room 420.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not know what you are doing down here, but you need to return to your assigned room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Adam advises sternly, but Muk does not move an inch.

Charizard loved receiving the unexpected foreplay from his two partners. To them, Charizard was the best, the leader of the pack. and no doubt the most dominant one. Buizel began to gently suckle on one of Charizard's balls making him groan in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm... oh that is new.

Noticing the Buizel's soft slurping noises and the lapping of his partners balls; Jolteon becomes very distraught. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Hey, Buizel, I was gonna do that for him.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Well, it is too late now, I did it first.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two of them continued arguing while Charizard lets his cock grow to its massive length.

Charizard motions for Jolteon to assist Buizel and he gladly strides over to the opposite side of the fire Pokemon's cock. Charizard gently lounges as the duo began to lick and rub up and down his cock. Charizard pats the pair on the head, and they smile in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys are the best.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Anything for the big guy, I mean you do pull most of the weight for our team.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Yeah, you are the best part of this team.

Especially this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charizard strokes the backs of the two Pokemon, both of them already sporting some hard bobbing, throbbing cocks. The two wag their respective tails and keep pleasuring him. Though Charizard was a natural Pokemon, his size was almost double the average for his species, and, unfortunately, he dwarfed his two companions by comparison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But that did not stop Charizard from appreciating their hard work and charisma. They were small, yes, but at times were needed. Charizard grunted in surprise; Buizel mashed his muzzle against Charizard's cock tip and began to french kissing the huge Pokemon's cock slit, it was pure bliss. Jolteon looked upon the scene in envy. The two Pokemon were always handy; their sized helped with a lot of things Charizard could not do, like calming the nerves of smaller Pokemon or even crawl into smaller spaces that he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*poke*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jolteon's hind leg had slipped again, but this time, it happened to push Charizard's balls out of the way, and his small paw came in contact with the lizard's quivering pucker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Oops, sorry Charizard, I lost my footing again.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jolteon resumed his licking, Charizard was almost half way to his orgasm and Buizel sure was doing a good job. This left his other small companion without much merit to his rubbing anymore, but Charizard had an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jolteon, would you mind...\"</div></span></div></span></div></div>",

They moved silently under the water,  and towards the unsuspecting kid who was soon to be their next unwilling meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Hey Plusle, let's find out who can hold their breath the longest!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Pokemon nodded to his trainer, and both submerged themselves under the water for 30 seconds. They both had their eyes closed, the moment they were under the water. It was the perfect moment to strike! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They grabbed the Plusle by its head, opened their maw as big as they could, and swiftly devoured him. They closed their mouth cutting off the unfortunate Pokemon's escape route; their cheeks now round and full. The Pokemon discovered what was happening all too late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He started to struggle; his efforts only made small bulges in the larger Pokemon's cheeks, as they finally tilted their head upwards and swallow. The bulge travels into their red throat until it merged in their belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plusle? You win, you can come out now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The kid announces worriedly; he feels something grabbing him by his ankles and starting to pull him back under the water's surface. He lets out a last scream before descending into the water's depths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Ah! what the?! help!!! burrrhbbu.\" </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The cry for help was cut short as they pulled him under the water and stuffed his head into their maw. They force him down their throat and bolt towards the surface. They wanted to further enjoy their captured prey, but they could drown if they did not hurry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With a final swift push; you finally get the wriggling feet of the kid into your throat and tilt your head upwards. The kid's sent falling into their throat, and straight into their belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A moment later they finally emerge from the water and take a deep breath. Their belly is bulging with their recent prey. They noticed the kids belongings and grabbed them, before tossing them into the fire to destroy the evidence. They contemplate Their next move...</span></div></div></span></div></div>",

I used to belong to a trainer, but he is a complete asshole. One night I swallowed him when he was sleeping.

Armadillomon is about to take charge of things, but Veemon stops him before he can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cnavy\">Why not start with a simple fetish.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Veemon suggests calmly; he wants to take a slower pace. The other Digimon nod in agreement, but Wormmon looks depressed for some mysterious reason.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbrown\">I am too small to take part in the games.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cnavy\">You could digivolve.</span>\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Veemon suggests cheerily; Wormmon is clearly embarrassed by not having considered the obvious solution. Wormmon nods happily and likes Veemon's suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A short time later; Stingmon is standing in Wormmon's place. Veemon sits in the middle of the room; he calls everyone to him. They quickly take a seat; Veemon begins to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cnavy\">Who wants to worship my feet? Sit in front of me, and I will explain what to do.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0None of the Digimon volunteer, at first so Hawkmon takes leadership, and volunteers. The others look on nervously; they wonder if Hawkmon will change his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">I will be first.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hawkmon sits in front of Veemon; Veemon places his unwashed, three clawed feet, into Hawkmon's waiting lap. Veemon prepares to explain things, but Hawkmon interrupts him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Everyone watch me and follow my lead when it is your turn.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hawkmon takes Veemon's left foot and brings near his face. Hawkmon takes a long sniff and covers the entire surface of the foot; including the white claws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hawkmon sticks out his small tongue; he licks Veemon's foot in the same routine. Hawkmon puts each of Veemon's white claws into his mouth and sucks on them. Veemon repeats the same procedure on the right foot; he releases Veemon's feet after he finishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">That is all you have to do.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cnavy\">Good job Hawkmon, so who is next?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Each Digimon approaches Veemon one at a time and takes their turn; they all paid close attention, so no one had any trouble mimicking Hawkmon's thorough demonstration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cnavy\">Good job, so what did everyone think?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Your feet are too dirty for my liking, but I still had fun.</span>\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Armadillomon took the lead in stating his opinion. Gatomon turns bright red; she tries to hide it by covering her face. Gatomon overcomes her momentary embarrassment and offers her own opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cviolet\">I never tried a fetish before, but It was exciting.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Stingmon is next; he was not shy about giving his honest opinion. Each Digimon turns their attention to Stingmon; they are eager to hear his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbrown\">The experience was strange, but I still had a good time.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Almost everyone had given their opinions; Veemon thought Patamon might be nervous. Veemon ends up being pleasantly surprised; Patamon energetically jumped into the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cborange\">I would love to try that fetish again sometime in the future.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hawkmon is the last one to go; Veemon watches Hawkmon intently. Veemon was eagerly waiting, for Hawkmon's opinion, and Hawkmon was more than happy to share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">You have wonderful feet. I adore them no matter how they are.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once everyone had made their opinions known; Veemon takes the lead. Veemon was not shy about asking his next question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cnavy\">Who wants to suggest the next idea?</span>\"</span></div></div></span></div></div>",

Veemon can always do other things later. Gomamon starts moving again after a few seconds of silence. Gomamon is in complete darkness; he has no choice, but to accept his unknown fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gomamon soon lands on the freezing ground and sees the familiar sight of Veemon's blue ass. Gomamon gets to his feet; he is fine, but still a little wet. Veemon stands nearby while Gomamon cleans himself. Veemon did not tell Gomamon he enjoyed his exit almost as much as the entrance. Veemon starts to imagine other fantasies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cnavy\">Using that route was quickest.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">I was wondering if I might take a turn.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gomamon's response was completely unexpected; they can satisfy both of their desires at the same time. Veemon did not want to volunteer, so he suggested another idea to the small seal Digimon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cnavy\">We can go find other Digimon, and you can experiment with them.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"<span class=\"cteal\">That sounds fun, so let's go!</span>\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cnavy\">Where should we look first?</span>\"</span></div></div></span></div></div>",

He arrived with no trouble and quickly landed. Exveemon grasped his aching stomach once again, to avoid spilling the contents of his bowels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"<span class=\"cplum\">Hey Exveemon! What is up man?</span>\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Said Impmon, and faked a smile.

Exveemon did not take it as much of a compliment, though. Instead, he retorted harshly at the wolf Digimon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Funny, you never invited me. How come nobody invites me over to parties or shenanigans as much as they used too?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gabumon scratched his head in confusion and stood there speechless for a few seconds.

Instead, Exveemon just replied with a snide remark, and an unforgiving glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suuuuree...you forget to invite me...all the time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Exveemon growled, not buying the excuses for one minute. He laughed, before taking out a smoke grenade. None of the other Digimon noticed what he had done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"<span class=\"corange\">Hey, we get enough of you during the day!</span></b> <span class=\"corange\">Do you have a problem with us hanging out without you? What the hell--?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before Agumon finished, Exveemon chucked the grenade and fly away. The other's fall unconscious from the gas. The Digimon woke up in a dark room and are tied to the wall. There is little lighting, and one door locked tight. Exveemon was standing in front of them and laughing evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"I am going to have fun tonight! Gatomon!

Exveemon whipped out a bunch of chains; he wrapped her up, so she remains tied to the floor and had no chance of escape. Exveemon chuckled and walked right behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cviolet\">Y-yes?

Eric's ready to leave the room, but he spies something under the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Ah-ha!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eric yells, and briefly startles Guilmon.

A powerful stream of strong-smelling urine shoots out of Guilmon's cock. The flow continues for a full minute, before stopping altogether. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Guilmon lifts his tail; this gives Eric an unrestricted view of his ass. Eric watches the red anus as it flexes and opens wide; a thick brown log slides sluggishly, out of Guilmon's ass. The log of waste grows to an impressive ten inches, before dropping into the waiting toilet with a loud splash. Guilmon pushes again, and three four-inch logs fall from the red lizard's ass. Guilmon pauses for a moment and lets out a sigh of relief. Eric thinks Guilmon is finished shitting, but he pushes one last time. Eric watches Guilmon's asshole stretch wider and wider. The head of the massive black log finally frees itself from its fleshy red prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Oh, my stomach hurts!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Guilmon whines in protest as his colon worked to dislodge the immense blockage. The log reaches 12\" before dipping into the water. Guilmon starts to pant as the shit coils inside the bowl. 30 painful seconds drift by; the tail of the 24\" serpent exits Guilmon's rear with a splash. Guilmon farts one last time in triumph, wipes himself and flushes the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">I feel so much better! I Hope you enjoyed the show.

Growlmon lets out a grunt; a couple more turds slide out of his ass and make a small pile on top of Eric's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">How is it...having fun.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Growlmon adds another huge turd to the pile; Eric wanted to answer Growlmon's question, but Growlmon groans loudly, and Eric becomes concerned for Growlmon's safety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Growlmon gave no response; a stream of brown sludge pours from the dinosaur's ass and completely covers Eric's body. Growlmon moans in pain as shit keeps flowing. The hot sludge feels soothing; It resembles a mud bath. The flow of waste soon comes to an end, and Growlmon rubs his filthy ass against Eric's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">I was going to warn you, but I guess I need to clean you off.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Growlmon aims his large twin cocks at Eric's muck covered body, and a strong torrent of urine pours over him; the sensation is comparable to being sprayed with a firehose. Eric now reeks of Growlmon's piss but is otherwise clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Did you have fun? If you want; you can have a turn.</span>\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eric did not mind the mess; he remains intimidated, but Eric knew Growlmon could never hurt him. Eric motions, for Growlmon to lay flat; he does so, with no argument. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eric points his flaccid cock at Growlmon's face and starts to piss; Eric gives Growlmon a good soaking. Growlmon willingly opens his mouth and tastes Eric's warm offering. Having held it for so long; it takes Eric a while to finish relieving himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Are you finished?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eric nods at Growlmon and pushes the button on the wall. A hole opens; a strong flow of rushing water washes everything clean, and a strong blast of warm air dries the entire room. Growlmon returns to his normal form, and they happily exit the room. Guilmon suggests they go explore the city and find something else to do. Eric had a lot of fun, but he did notice many other Digimon; they were still looking for partners when they left the waiting area. Eric keeps Guilmon's idea in mind and decides he wants to...</span></div></div></span></div></div>",

Greymon points out the nearby window, and Eric walks over to it. Eric remained too engrossed in today's activities to even notice the time, and now it was way too late to leave. It was by sheer luck, that Eric had a bed tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then, thank you for taking me in for the night.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">No problem at all.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Greymon turns on the tap and waits for the bathtub to fill. Eric takes off his clothes and puts them on the other side of the room, close to the bed. From the corner of Eric's eye, he catches Greymon checking him out and assuming Eric is oblivious to his staring. Eric turns around to try and catch Greymon in the act, but Greymon fakes invest in the ceiling lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The tub is about fifteen feet long, and five or six feet deep. It has a raised bench on one end and allows them to sit down and keep their head above water. Eric does just that as he climbs into the tub, and sits down to enjoy the hot water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Greymon lays down on the other side and faces Eric; he puts his feet up on the bench on either side of Eric. Greymon stretches out and lays back, so he is reaching across the length of the tub. With the particular pose he is laying down in, with his feet propped up and his back nearly flat against the bottom, Greymon gives Eric a clear view of his tailhole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eric notices Greymon looking at him, and he has a smirk on his face. Blushing, Eric grabs a bar of soap and begins to clean himself. Greymon closes his eyes and begins to nap. While Eric cleans himself; he sees a few bubbles rise in the middle of the tub. Eric looks over at Greymon; his eyes are still closed. Eric focuses his eyes on Greymon's tailhole and waits for it to happen again. Ten seconds later; Greymon's hole opens again, and a bigger bubble comes to the surface of the water. Eric observes Greymon's face again, and this time he is grinning madly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eric laughs as Greymon shifts, and, not even trying to hide it, rips a huge fart into the tub. Greymon farts again and then pauses. After a brief silence, Greymon sighs in relief, with a low fart to accompany it. Eric notices a yellow cloud billowing from Greymon's groin. It diffuses quickly, filling the tub in a matter of seconds. It is very warm, and Eric almost considers adding his own to the mix. Greymon and Eric are both smiling ear to ear, loving every minute of their messy time. Greymon grunts for a second and Eric gazes at Greymon's tailhole, excited for what was going to happen next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Greymon grunts a fart bubbles out from his tailhole; a bit of poop, starting to poke out. Greymon keeps pushing; a glob of dung falls out of his tailhole, and on to the floor of the tub. Greymon sighs and a constant flow of brown mush starts to come out of his tailhole, piling up at the base of his tail on the bottom of the tub. The pooping is suddenly interrupted by a loud fart, followed by another gush of poop. Finally, after the poop has buried Greymon's butt and the base of his tail, he slows down. Greymon finishes up, with one last glob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eric sits awestruck, amazed and turned on by what just happened. Greymon seems very satisfied and very happy. Greymon stands up in the tub, and, with a mischievous look in his eye, turns around, bends over, and sticks his tailhole right in front of Eric's face. Greymon releases the last glob of dung he has right in front of Eric and farts loudly. Turning his head to face Eric, Greymon grins widely at him. Eric stares totally speechless, back at Greymon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">So, all clean yet?</span>\"</span></div></div></span></div></div>",

Eric had a lot on his mind and are not really all that tired. Greymon had since repositioned his large tail so that it is raised, and running parallel with his spine, going right over the top of Eric's head; this gave Eric an excellent view, of Greymon's tailhole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Eric idly looks at it, it flexes outwards and sputters hot air in his face. It smells rotten, but Eric deals with it. Greymon farts again, this time a loud trumpeting sound. Eric laughs at himself a bit; he sort of likes it now, and Eric hopes Greymon keeps farting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Greymon's sleeping body is happy to oblige. As he keeps farting in Eric's face, Greymon stirs a little. Eric hears a flowing sound, and a wet patch starts to form. Eric realizes Greymon's wetting the bed, probably because he does not own a toilet. The warm patch grows until it covers most of Eric's body. Eric did not think the night could get better. Greymon wakes up, looks down at himself, then looks at Eric. Greymon laughs warmly; Eric stares back at Greymon, as he jokingly replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Having fun back there? Great, because I'm not finished.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Greymon blasts a wet fart in Eric's face. Eric looks at Greymon's tailhole right in front of his face and breathes in another very wet fart. Greymon starts grunting; the tip of a large brown log of dung slowly makes its way out, landing on the bed with a wet plop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It rests about six inches from Eric's face. Another fart and another plop of dung, but this time, softer. The dung starts coming out at a faster pace, piling up. Eric scoots backward in the bed to avoid getting buried. It keeps coming out faster, piling up to the point where it reaches Greymon's tailhole. Greymon is panting with a huge smile on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The flow slows down and stops, and Eric surveys the area. Eric's section of the bed is flooded with poop, which piles up to Greymon's butt. Greymon's already fast asleep. A fart bubbles up from Greymon's butt, and Eric decides to follow his example. The air is moist and stinks like a sewer. Just the way Eric likes it.</span></div></div></span></div></div>",

Eric grabbed a slice of toast, and a glass of orange juice while he awaited Guilmon's return. Ten minutes passed. Guilmon rose from his seat, and Eric followed behind him. The pair entered the bathroom and Guilmon approached the miniature toilet.

Guilmon's tail was too long for the toilet, so Eric held it out of the way. Eric quietly enjoyed the perfect view of Guilmon's asshole.

A six-inch light brown log fell from Guilmon's ass with an audible thud. Guilmon deposited a second six-inch log into the bowl. A stream of piss trickled into the bowl. Eric felt his erection growing as he witnessed Guilmon's defecation. Guilmon continued voiding his bowels, and each log piled into the toilet. 15 minutes of grunts and relieved sighs passed. Guilmon rose from the toilet and presented his rear to Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">I need you to clean my ass with your tongue.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Guilmon bent over, and Eric sniffed his Digimon's dirty ass. Eric's tongue shot out of his mouth and slid over each spot of filth. Eric stuck his tongue into Guilmon's backdoor and licked every spot he could reach. Eric retracted his tongue and knelt down in front of the loaded toilet. The smell of Guilmon's fresh shit was overpowering, but Eric sucked the scent into his lungs. Eric bit a log of Guilmon's scat in half and chewed it before swallowing. Eric found Guilmon's waste a tad bitter, but easy to keep down. Eric ate log after log and managed to clean the entire toilet of its contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Wow, you ate my entire load of shit without throwing up. I'm impressed!

Eric and Guilmon got out of bed and had breakfast. The party started at noon, so Eric and Guilmon went over their list of things to finish before leaving the house. Eric called Exveemon and had Guilmon explain his solution to the broken plumbing. Every guest was bringing a dish to the party; Eric decided to bake a chocolate cake. Two hours remained before the party began, so Eric had plenty of time to prepare his dessert. Guilmon decided to bring some games everyone could play after they finished eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eric made a final check of the chore list. All the party preparations were complete, so Guilmon and Eric left the house. Exveemon lived at the end of the block, so Eric and Guilmon arrived 20 minutes before the party started. Eric rang the doorbell, and Exveemon opened the door a minute later. Several other guests were already talking amongst themselves when Eric and Guilmon entered the living room. The first thing Guilmon noticed was the food. Eric restrained the red lizard as he reached for a snack. More guests continued to arrive, and the house was full by noon. Eric didn't feel nervous about being the only human at the party. Eric observed the guests. Rookie's, Champions, Ultimates, Megas, even a few armor level Digimon crowded the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Exveemon gave Eric and Guilmon a tour of the house while the other Digimon entertained themselves. The second level of the house consisted of several spare bedrooms. The kitchen, living room, master bedroom, and the only bathroom were downstairs. The backyard contained a large cement pool, but the weather was too cold for swimming. The trio returned to the living room, and everyone sat down to eat lunch. The food was set out like a buffet, so each guest helped themselves to whatever they liked. Two hours passed, and everyone had finished eating their meals.

Eric is sure that if he stays with Guilmon; everything will be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Let's leave now.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Guilmon happily declares and leaves the room in a flash; he returns with a strange-looking device. Eric never saw it before and wondered what it does. Guilmon pushes a small red button in the center of the device; a moment later, a voice crackles to life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I help you today?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eric did not recognize the strange voice; it almost sounds like another Digimon. The voice is quiet, and Eric can barely make out the brief conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Can you send a transport, for two please?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One moment.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The voice confirms quickly. About 30 seconds later, a glowing portal appears in Eric's room. This is the strangest thing; Eric ever saw in his entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Come on let's go!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Guilmon waves his arms excitedly. Eric makes sure they have everything they need, before going any further with this spontaneous adventure. The pair enters the portal to the digital world. Do they arrive safely or does something go wrong with the portal?</span></div></div></span></div></div>",

Eric gawks at the giant hotel towering in front of them. They walk up the long pathway and see a large Digimon standing guard at the front door. The doorman waves as they approach. They walk up to the glass doors, and they slide open automatically. Eric gazed in awe at the highly polished floors, the leather chairs, and the huge stone fountain in the center of the lobby. Eric does not have time to admire the sights; Guilmon heads, for the front desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cviolet\">Checking in?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A Gatomon at the front counter questions, after noticing the unfamiliar guests.

A long line of other guests soon forms behind Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">We need a room for two.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Guilmon gets straight to the point, so he does not hold up the growing line. Gatomon hands over a pair of room keys;  Eric takes his key and puts it away for safekeeping. Guilmon excitedly snatches his key from Gatomon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cviolet\">Room 301, and enjoy your stay.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eric gives Gatomon a friendly wave and the pair heads for the elevator. Guilmon calls the elevator, and the doors instantly open. Guilmon presses the button, for the third floor. A short time later; the door slides open, and they walk down the hall to their room. Eric slides his key, and the lock clicks open. The room is huge and decorated in the same style as the lobby. A king size bed rests in the center of the room. Guilmon is more than happy with the accommodations and is already eager to explore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Yes! we got a suite. Why not meet some other guests, and take a look around the hotel at the same time.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope we don't disturb anyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eric suggests, not wanting to just barge into another Digimon's room unannounced. Just then, there is a loud knock on the door. Eric is about to get up and answer the door, but Guilmon is quicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Come in!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Guilmon shouts excitedly and doesn't mind the intrusion. A huge Exveemon walks in, and Eric eyes the large blue Digimon suspiciously. Exveemon wastes no time making conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Hi, I thought I would see who had the room next to mine. There is a human staying in this room? You'll love it here; I just know it! You want me to show you around?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Sure, sounds good.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Guilmon agrees immediately since he is feeling adventurous.

Eric runs up to Guilmon, and he notices the excited look plastered on Eric's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I met another Digimon just now, and he told me about this new place close by. <b>\"It sounds like fun, so let's go!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eric motions for Guilmon to follow and he starts to walk away. Guilmon follows Eric closely, and he hands Guilmon the spare ID. Eric follows the directions Agumon gave him, and they arrive to find something strange. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is nothing here, but this has to be it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eric exclaims in shock; he is sure he followed the direction correctly.

A scanner of some sort; rests on the wall of the booth. Eric and Guilmon go over to the device and scan their ID's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Okay, you're clear to enter. Enjoy the ride, and your stay.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eric hangs up the phone and wonders what the stranger meant by enjoying the ride. The mystery is soon solved; the floor falls away, and Eric and Guilmon fall down a long dark tunnel. The ride is fast and lasts mere seconds. They land with a thud and rise to their feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They scan the cavern to make sure the coast is clear and then enter the enormous building in front of them. They step through the doors and enter a huge lobby; there is a Biyomon sitting at a large receptionists desk. Eric and Guilmon walk up to the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I haven't seen you two before.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They produce the pair of ID's, Biyomon looks them over closely, smiles, and hands them back to Eric and Guilmon.

Garurumon lifts his long tail; Eric gawks at the wolf Digimon's fully exposed rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Smell my ass and get used to its scent.

Eric's newfound bravery builds, and he licks Garurumon's asshole. It has a strong, sharp taste; the bitterness soon fades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Are you ready? Here comes the first one.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Garurumon squats down and gives Eric a closeup of his anus. He lets out a low groan and Eric gapes at the flexing anus. Garurumon's asshole quickly opens, and he farts again. Eric hears a crackling sound, and a long brown log emerges from Garurumon's butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Play with it...if you like.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eric reaches out and touches a finger to the log; It is hot and quite sticky. The waste falls into the toilet with a loud splash. Eric gets an idea and slides a finger into Garurumon's ass. Eric feels Garurumon's hot shit pressing against the intruding digit. Garurumon gazes at Eric with a mischievous grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Garurumon turns back around and continues to shit. Eric's finger slides out of Garurumon's filthy ass, now completely covered in wolf dung. Garurumon continues dropping several more large turds; each falls in the toilet with a loud splash and a satisfied sigh from Garurumon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Garurumon rests a second before he starts pushing out one last log. The enormous log grows to more than a foot long before it finally breaks. After one more huge fart; Garurumon gets off the toilet; Garurumon beams proudly and steps back to show Eric his hard work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">So, what did you think; did you enjoy watching me take a shit?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I certainly did. You must feel a lot better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">I am glad you enjoyed it so much, and yes, I feel better; thanks for asking.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Garurumon notices Eric's finger, still coated in his crap. Garurumon takes the finger into his mouth and licks it clean with his big canine tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Now that I have cleaned you; it is your turn to repay me. You get to experience what it is like; to clean a wolf's dirty ass.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Garurumon demands as he turns around and shows Eric his shit stained rear. Eric gazes at Garurumon, but he is not sure what he desires. Garurumon notices Eric's confused, so he clarifies his intent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Clean me, and use your tongue.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eric gives a small lick to the canine's ass and tastes the slimy waste. Eric slowly cleans the rest of Garurumon's furry ass and moves to his filthy hole. Garurumon looks over his shoulder and gives Eric an approving nod. He shoves his tongue up the wolf's butt and cleans away Garurumon's leftover shit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">You did an amazing job. If you want to keep practicing; I am sure Falcomon would be delighted to teach you more. His teaching methods are quite different from mine, but it would be a great learning experience.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eric is not sure what Falcomon may have planned for him.

A few seconds go by before Falcomon finally greets him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Hello, I will be giving you your next lesson, so just do everything I tell you.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Falcomon jumps up on the toilet, before turning to face Eric. He makes sure to get comfortable; Falcomon clears his throat before he begins conversing openly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Have you ever taken a good look at a bird's ass?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eric shakes his head; he never thought about bird Digimon. Falcomon soon fixes the problem; he turns around, and Eric receives his first look at Falcomon's black feathered butt. Falcomon lifts his tail high in the air and treats Eric to a better view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Get familiar with my scent; you will find it much different than Garurumon's</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Falcomon sternly commands; he lifts his tail once more and waits eagerly for Eric to act. Eric cannot see anything, besides Falcomon's black feathery rear; he moves closer and investigates more thoroughly. The search through the mass of dark feathers is difficult, but Eric succeeds in finding Falcomon's small, purple anus. He inhales the scent of the falcon's hole. A strong fragrance enters Eric's nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your rear isn't so bad.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eric slowly backs away from the bird's rump and takes a deep breath of fresh air. Falcomon does not show Eric any sympathy; Falcomon locks eyes with Eric and wears a serious expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">It's going to get worse; we haven't even started the best part.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Falcomon remarks bluntly and shuffles backward. Eric opens his mouth to comment; Eric's unplanned action only aids Falcomon further. Falcomon forces his dirty asshole straight into Eric's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Your a fast learner, so now, for the next part of the lesson.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Falcomon wiggles his ass playfully and forces Eric to inhale more of the unpleasant stench. Eric tries his best to breathe, but the odor of the bird's ass fills his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">I see my new toilet is ready; I intentionally held this load in for several days, so this will feel great.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Falcomon starts grunting, so he can push the waiting load out of his ass. The pungent smell of Falcomon's ass used to sicken him, but now Eric loves it. Eric's tongue shoots out of his mouth, and he begins rimming the bird's asshole. Falcomon didn't give Eric any such order, but he doesn't object to the impulsive action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Get me nice and wet; this first part is always difficult.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eric stops rimming the avian's butt; he senses something hard touch his tongue. Falcomon has started to relieve himself; a small log of dry, green poop, squeezes out of his ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eric watches the greenish waste as it slides arduously, from Falcomon's open hole. The log soon lands in Eric's mouth, and he chews it hastily. For a brief second, Eric catches a glimpse of Falcomon's flexing passage. With some difficulty; Falcomon deposits another dry log into Eric's mouth, and he disposes of it with no problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">3...4...5.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Falcomon counts out loud and continues to push each small log into Eric's mouth. Eric hoped Falcomon is almost finished; he cannot take much more, and his mouth started dehydrating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Falcomon lifts his ass off Eric's face; he seizes the abrupt opportunity and breathes in some more fresh air. The air smells great; in comparison to the intensified stench coming from the avian's ass. Eric looks over at Falcomon; he holds his stomach and has a pained look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Here comes a nice fresh load, so get ready.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eric gets back into his position, and Falcomon rests himself on top of Eric's face. Eric observes as Falcomon pushes hard, but nothing comes from the bird's rear. Eric tries to assist Falcomon; he shoves his semi-moist tongue into the avian's rump and resumes his licking. Something soft pushes against Eric's tongue; he cautiously withdraws his tongue and seals his lips over the falcon's anus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eric sucks on Falcomon's asshole and tries to encourage his efforts. A nice soft log slides into Eric's throat. The waste feels like a thick paste and has an offensive and stinging taste; It takes Eric some real effort to swallow. The flow of waste increases in speed, and after a few more minutes; Falcomon finishes emptying his bowels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Now clean me.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Falcomon says in a stern tone. Eric pushes his tongue back up the bird's dirty ass and licks up the remaining shit buried inside Falcomon's feathered butt. Once Eric assumes he succeeded in getting everything clean; he frees his tired tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Good job; most others never make it.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Falcomon admits with a coy smile and jumps down from the toilet. Eric heads back to the main room, after getting himself cleaned up. Eric sees Garurumon and Falcomon waiting for him...</span></div></div></span></div></div>",

Each hand gripped one of Guilmon's fat balls and rolled it around. The invading nose and tongue made Guilmon moan in delight. Eric gave the lizard's cock a couple of quick taps, and Guilmon's heart started to race. Eric loved the sharp contrast in sent and flavor of Guilmon's cock and balls. Guilmon spun around and Eric moved on to the last two areas of Guilmon's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eric moved over Guilmon's back and shoulders and towards Guilmon's tail.

Eric looked at the toned, red ass and felt a lump in his throat. Eric's hands ran over the red cheeks and gave them a firm squeeze. Eric's tongue left a trail of saliva as it glided along Guilmon's butt. Eric took a deep breath and plunged his nose into Guilmon's waiting hole. Eric's lungs started to burn from the combination of heat, sweat, and musk. Eric wasn't giving up and began furiously eating out Guilmon's ass.

The intoxicating aroma fills Eric's nose; Guilmon watches as Eric extends his tongue and drags it along Guilmon's unwashed sole.

Eric considers changing his mind, but the foot remains far too tempting to resist; he survived licking Guilmon's sole, so Eric assumes he can manage to clean Guilmon's toes. Eric slowly licks between the two white claws and tastes the leftover dirt and grime. Guilmon lets out a relaxed sigh as Eric licks his foot. Eric tries his best to get the claws clean, but it proves difficult. Eric succeeds in making the first pair of claws spotless after two minutes of hard licking, and he reaches for the remaining foot. Eric gives it the same treatment; the second foot takes longer than Eric originally anticipated, but he manages to finish the job.

Guilmon's nuts are perfectly round, and each orb is the size of a tennis ball; Eric rolls them gently in his hands and gives each of Guilmon's testicles a gentle squeeze. Guilmon emits a sudden gasp of pleasure. Eric brings his face near Guilmon's sack and rubs against the warm, sweaty flesh. Eric inhales the potent scent; the fragrance is captivating. Eric takes one testicle into his mouth; the sensation is strange but enjoyable. Guilmon's musk lingers in Eric's mouth, and his tongue begins to burn; Eric ignores his gut reaction and sucks harder on the fleshy, white orb. Guilmon is clearly enjoying the treatment; his eyes remain closed, and his tongue hangs from his open mouth. Eric's drive increases and he gives the other testicle the same enthusiastic treatment; Guilmon happily wags his tail in response. Eric's tongue is numb by the time he finishes.

Twin fountains of golden piss are spurting from Guilmon's exposed cocks. Eric is shocked and can hardly speak; he springs forward and grabs both of Guilmon's members. Eric maintains an iron tight grip on each of Guilmon's shafts. However, Eric only succeeds in slowing the leaking fluid; he cannot stop it completely because of Guilmon's constant squirming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A huge stain soon soaks into the wood underneath Guilmon's butt, and he begins to laugh.

Eric lets out a deep sigh and decides to let Guilmon finish pissing himself; Eric releases Guilmon's twin shafts and lets the built-up piss flow once more. Guilmon suddenly jerks forward upon being freed from Eric's grasp and sprays him in the face with twin jets of strong piss. Eric coughs and shields his eyes from the stinging assault. 30 second later the flow comes to an abrupt end. Eric surveys the mess Guilmon made, and he...</div></span></div></span></div></div>",

Without a word, he floats near the ground and turns his back. With minimal effort, he raises the back of his chiton and displays his round little cheeks. The worry disappears from the first Agumon. Lucemon ignores him and turns to the other; this Agumon carries a look of dread. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My idea will be much more enjoyable. Your task will be simple.

The tongue moves swiftly and fills him with a tremor of delight when it crosses a new point.

Agumon's snout remains buried between his butt cheeks, and his tongue forced deep inside his ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In absolute bliss Lucemon rests his hips against the first Agumon's head, forcing the second Agumon to take a few steps back to keep up his work. The tongue deep inside him moves at the Agumon's leisure, so Lucemon rubs his hips against his head. Agumon understands the command and begins to lick harder, Lucemon can sense the thick crust inside his colon beginning to evaporate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lucemon senses his belly turning, from his movements, the gasses building. The Agumon were wise to wish avoiding direct aim, his farts are the things of legend. Many stories say the rancid gas can suffocate towns and shatter Mega Digimon instantly! As Lucemon relaxes his stomach gives a low gurgle, and the two Agumon pause, risking a second, and know what is coming...</span></div></div></span></div></div>",

You were in a dark, warm place that smelled absolutely horrible, but your chest and everything below it was still outside, rapidly sliding further and further in. The walls or your fleshy prison shook again as the Archen murres with pleasure and you realized where you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You started kicking wildly and thrashing, trying desperately to escape the clutches of the Archen's butthole, but it only made the Pokemon moan louder, clenching harder and making you slide faster and faster inwards to your doom. Archen's hole was a one-way street, and he was never going to give up his prize. You screamed, desperately pleading with the Archen to let you go, the Archen flopped forward onto its chest, it's beach laying on the ground and it's ass raised to the sky, making your legs dangle out of its rancid butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not think so... *pant* ...slave. You just feel so good in my ass, and I have not had a meal like this in a long while. There is only one place you are going, and that is IN. Forever.

All your memories, friends, family, gone as you were devoured by the heartless bird's rump. You were her's now, You had no name, no identity, you were just that human that Archen slipped into her tailhole. As lack of oxygen began to cloud your thoughts, Archen...</div></span></div></span></div></div>",

The Archen continued pleasuring herself until she finally climaxed, showing the pile of shit where you once were with her juices. She sighed in the afterglow of her ass meal, tickling the ends of your toes with her tail feathers before giving one final clench before your body slid entirely within her butt, leaving no trace of your existence apart from a large bulge in her midsection, but she soon takes care of THAT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Teasingly, the Archen raised her butt in the air, with you inside and shook it a little, as if flaunting the fact that your existence had been consumed by her butt. Not her beak or her claws, but her plump, feathery ass. Truly the highest form of humiliation. She was exhausted however, and laid down to sleep off her ass meal, planning to dispose of it in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Overnight, your unconscious body was attacked by acids and broken down, you fats, nutrients and very being absorbed by the walls of her intestine, whilst he remained blissfully asleep.

She admired the extra layer of fat that your body had added to her form, particularly her ass, but then felt a pressure in her gut. It was time to let what was left of you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She crouched where she stood, and after a few grunts, steaming logs of shit poked their way out of her ass, exiting the same way you can in. You were completely unrecognisable, just an amorphous mass of Archen shit, now. You were worth nothing to her, and now you were worth nothing at all. Her rump had slurped you up and reduced you to nothing but faeces. Then came the bones, which he grunted and spat out of her hole onto the pile, and finally your bleached skull was forced out of her rancid rump onto the pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She promptly urinated on the pile, and the little Archen wandered off, not thinking about you or even looking back at your remains, and why would she? You were just a pile of shit and a layer of fat on the same ass that had stolen you away from the world.</div></span></div></span></div></div>",
