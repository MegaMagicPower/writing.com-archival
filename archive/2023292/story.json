You are nearly pulled in the nose as air goes in, and knocked over when air comes out. \"G\u2026.Good dog, Toto.\" You said. You reach out to touch his nose and rub it. He seems to like you rubbing his nose. Toto barks with glee, making Dorothy stop and you cover your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Ohhh what is it Toto? Did you find something?\"  She asked bending forward towards the dog  Toto barks and nudges the ground where you are, slightly covering you in mucus and dog spit. Dorothy walks over to Toto to see what he\u2019s barking about that got him excited. \"What is it?\" She said. Toto looks at the ground and nudges you. \"Is something right there?\" She said. Toto barks to confirm this. Dorothy crouches down to find what it is when her eyes land on you. \"What's this?\"  She said. You look up at her giant, cute face. (Man. If this is her as a kid.

You could be a alien from a distant planet or...\" But she interrupts him half annoyed and wanting to get out of these steel restraints \"I'm telling the truth sir! I'm not a....what was it alien from space. And if you would please let me and my friend go and release me from these binds...\" The general laughed \"Yeah right keep her restrained soldiers!

They're not affecting her at all!\" Screamed a scientist also in the room and they backed away as the young giantess towered over them but rather than attack them Dorothy merely gave them a stern look informing them to leave her alone and exited the room searching for her new friend finally after a whole two or three hours and her booming footsteps shaking up the whole facility she managed to locate you and fortunately you were alright just a bit bruised following your directions Dorothy locates the exit to the outside world and bursts through the skyline to the astonishment to all who are busy fleeing for their lives as all of Area 51 comes literally crashing down in a pile of rubble  all the hidden files,recordings and supposed spaceships and captured alien specimen lost forever!

Her cheeks puffed out before the gas literally pushed her lips apart, blowing her hand away from her face in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\"><u><i><b>~*BBBUURRRRRPPP!*~</b></i></u></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn uncouth burp erupted from the polite little girl. It rang through the air, sounding akin to a feral roar that made you plug your ears. Scents of partially-digested soda, a frankfurter slathered in ketchup, yellow mustard, relish, chili, white onion, sauerkraut, celery salt, pepper and shredded cheese (she was <i>really</i> hungry), and acidic stomach gas were expelled from her body, morphing into a faintly green cloud. Close passersby heard the gaseous explosion and turned their heads toward the two of you. You hated the unwanted attention, and are somewhat relieved when they disgustedly covered up their noses after taking a whiff of Dorothy\u2019s beastly belch and quickly departed. For three unbelievable seconds, the epic eructation made her flamingo pink lips quake, until it finally fades. Dorothy once again shielded her mouth with her hand, but it was out of embarrassment this time. A deep crimson tint lit up her face, making her look even cuter than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh dear\u2026 Excuse me!\u201d She apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stood there for a moment, trying to register what happened. After a few seconds, you snapped out of it, removed your hands from your ears and pinch your nose with your left hand, using your right to fan away the lingering fragrance of Dorothy\u2019s burp. You approached her  and wrapped a comforting arm around her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry,\u201d You said. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothy turned to you. \u201cReally? That was very unladylike.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s your day. You\u2019re allowed to act differently if you want,\u201d You assure her. \u201cBesides, it was kind of funny watching those people\u2019s reactions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothy takes a moment to think about it and giggled. \u201cAlright, you may have a point, but doesn\u2019t the smell bother you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s not too bad.\u201d You replied. \u201cIn fact, I wouldn\u2019t mind if you did that more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothy\u2019s blush reddened further, making her resemble a tomato. \u201cWell, if that\u2019s the case\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

If she wants the roller coaster, then that is where you will go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe track of the rollercoaster is a long one, with plenty of rises and dips, and a fair share of right turns. You feel sure the ride is not one that will be over quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a small queue, but when you get to the front of it, the two of you manage to get a seat to yourselves. She encourages you to take a seat first, then she joins you, sitting down next to you, particularly close you notice. You wonder why she was so insistent that you got on first, and why she is sitting so close you can feel her body touching you but you have no reason to suspect any sort of ulterior motive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the attendants puts the safety barrier down just before the ride starts up, and you notice that although the barrier will keep you safely in your seats, it does not prevent any side-to-side motion upon the seat. Dorothy notices this too, and it pleases her for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride starts, slowly at first but quickly picking up speed, and then you come to the first of the right turns. As the ride turns, at the speed it is travelling, you and Dorothy are both pressed to the right, only the edge of the seat prevents you from moving any further. Dorothy however is pressed against your side, squashing you against the seat as you turn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" she exults as she feels the effect? Was this her plan all along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that was your plan then?\" you jokingly smile at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should feel lucky!\" she replies \"if it wasn't for the barrier I'd be sitting on you right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can sit on me if you want.\" you point out, it is her day after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now, silly... the barrier, remember. For now I'll just have to make you nice and squished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she says that, another right turn comes up and yourself being squashed once more. Curiously, each time she gets closer, she makes no move to move back afterwards. After several turns, you feel that Dorothy is firmly grinding herself into your side, your hip starts to ache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are many rises and falls, and you and Dorothy both love those, but it seems that it is those right turns that particularly please her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the ridge comes to an end.</span></div></div>",

You were in total and outright disbelief of what just happened. First the young giant Alice appears and now she is going to start eating the town out of its food.  She was seen going to any building that sells food, and what not, and she was seen ripping the roofs right off the buildings, and then eating all the groceries, fast food, and what not. She was first seen going to an ice cream shop, where she grabs the building and then just devours the whole thing in one big bite. Luckily, everyone was able to get out before she ate the building. \"I am so hungry, I cannot stand it or control myself.\" She said just as she stomps through the town, heading to the market. You run, trying to chase her. \"Hey... stop!!!!!!\" You said, but to no avail. She was now seen eating a building all together again, this time devouring a McDonald's, then more stores one by one. No matter how many buildings she ends up eating however, she never gains any weight at all. However, the most horrifying thing however came though when you see a customer grabbing onto something that Alice is about to eat. \"Oh my, please help me....\" the customer said before he falls to Alice's mouth, and then down to her stomach and what not. Alice then replies... \"HMMM... that was....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, in another surprise... Alice begins to grow right again, this time to 200ft tall... but what did she think of the human taste?</span></div></div>",

She was looking for something tasty. Though Alice wanted to stop eating, she couldn't control her hunger. It was lucky she didn't like the taste of humans, because otherwise she would have gotten you by now. As Alice looked around, she saw some baskets of apples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, what tasty looking apples.\" She said, licking her lips. As soon as she had seen them, she couldn't think of anything else. She skipped over and picked up every last basket. She tossed them in her mouth, crunching loudly. As she gave a delightful sigh, she heard a noise and turned around. She saw a farmer who had a cart full of bananas. \"Goodness, those bananas look tasty.\" When the farmer saw her, he immediately knew what she was after and tried to get his horse to move faster. The horse galloped away as fast as it could go, however, Alice wasn't about to give up. She jogged after it and picked up the cart with her left hand. She dumped all of the bananas into her mouth  enjoying their creamy taste. The farmer yelled at her but realizing he couldn't do anything about it simply and rode his horse back to town. \"Oh dear I'm so terribly sorry sir but they were delicious though.\" Alice said, calling after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She slowly followed him back to town. She looked around and saw a bucket of vegetables. She dumped them in and swallowed. Everybody stared up at her in horror. If they didn't hurry, she was going to eat all of their food, and worse, what if she tried to taste a human again and enjoyed it the second time? The thought was too terrible to think about for most of them. Alice's stomach suddenly rumbled throughout the city. She put her hands on her stomach and opened her mouth, releasing a mighty burp that destroyed most of the windows in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's attacking again!\" One of the villagers yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to do something!\" Another yelled. Meanwhile Alice's entire face turned a bright tomato red as she covered her mouth with one hand<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodness excuse me! Oh my........ I-I didn't mean to do that.

You soon heard the noises again but this time they sound more clearly. They sound like splashing and oddly enough, voices. These voices all range from talking, laughing and even singing. You quickly remembered that it came from high up, near the water surface. You soon looked up to that direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the surface, you saw what looked like seven oddly-shaped beings swimming across the water. You watch as they swam around each other almost like they were playing with each other. The reason they looked so odd is that they, at first glance, looked like fishes but at closer inspection, they look more humanoid than fishes. \"Hmm...weird\" you thought as you look on. You suddenly spotted a long, rocky, tower that was tall enough to reach the surface. On it, you saw a pair of fish tails sitting on top of it. You looked closely and saw that the tails were connected to human bodies that were high up in the overseas. \"What...kind of sea creatures are they?\" you wondered as you wanted to get a close look at them.</span></div></div>",

They're all seen occupied with each other; not caring less about what's going on the seabed. \"Alright, here I go!\" you said as you swam towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you swim closer, you slowly began to notice strange. The closer you are to the creatures, the bigger they seem to appear. Are they giants or are you small? Finally, you stop just several feet away from them. You noticed that, even though you are not very close to them, they still look just as big from where you are right now. If you go near them, you will be nothing more than the size of a plankton in comparison to these giant creatures. Now that you can see them quite clearly now, you discovered that they look even odder from before. The creatures have the upper bodies of human but at the bottom, they all have tails of fishes to go along with it. \"Wait a minute...are these...giant mermaids?!\" you said with a shocked look on your face. They sure look like them, but they all seem to look quite young too. \"I'm guessing they're just young mergirls,\" you said as you watch them play around with each other. Afterward, you looked at the rocky tower where the two giant sea creatures are sitting. One appeared to be a giant merman and another appeared to be a giant mermaid. \"I'm guessing those are the parents of those mergirls...\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are still quite curious and wanted to observe them even closer, but you began to have something else in mind.....</span></div></div>",

You look upwards and see that you hit the flat chest of the the red tailed blonde girl with the hair bang. She felt you hit and was about to look down. Although it was your initial idea to get her attention and have fun , you swim fearfully and quickly into her long blonde bang. She saw you and quickly flipped her hair screaming. \"Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to hold as she throws her head around, trying to get you off.

You know that you need to hide somewhere else. Using momentum as her head rocks back and forth, you get launched through the water towards a girl with a green tail and red hair. She looked like the youngest of her sisters. You landed into the long flowing hair and Immediately got tangled up, not being able to move anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArista stopped freaking out because whatever was on her hair was gone now. But now Ariel also felt the small thing in her hair too. It was struggling and trying to escape.

You watched as the youngest talks to her sisters about what she found but unfortunately for her, she couldn't find it anymore. The others became skeptical about this mysterious thing she finds and soon all of them left the room. \"But I swore I felt something on my head.\" she said to herself \"Oh well, it's probably my imagination I suppose.\" The young mermaid also left the room, leaving you all alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, that was close.\" you said \"Who knew those merpeople can be ridiculously huge!\" Suddenly, something pop up out of your head.

They won't see you and they would be far to asleep to even feel you. Thats your plan and your sticking to it, you just have to hang around the giant children until one of them gets tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took long, very long but one of them got tired. It was the one with the red tail and the blonde bang over her eye (Arista). You hear her yawn and tell the other little girls that she's going to take a nap. As soon as she was away from the group you sprung into action. She swam away from you and it became painfully obvious that you weren't going to be able to catch up to her at all. She's far too big so your gonna have to try something risky. Once she passes over you, you grab the end of her mermaid tail, making sure you have a good grip as you get pulled through the tides by her tail. The giant Young blonde didnt crane her head to look back so you were thankfully still not seen. You get pulled through the palace as she arrived in a very large room. With small cots for all the young girls. You can only assume this is their own room which means your on the right path. Letting go of the tail you very sneakily swim to the wall, trying to blend in with the fancy walls as you were almost there and almost having your chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant girl swam down and cuddled herself into a bed, looking comfortable as you need her to fall asleep. After a little bit to your happiness, it looked like she was fully asleep. Moving forward you cautiously approach her, taking glance towards the door making sure her sisters or even any guards won't spot you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you got to the girl and carefully touch down onto the girl\u2019s stomach. Landing on it as you look back at the giant red scaly tale, it twitched slightly in her sleep while you turn around to her face. She looked asleep but you need to make sure she's fully asleep.

Which means thankfully and finally you can have fun with a mermaids bdoy. But what to do is the question?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally if you were with a giant girl, the first three places you would go to would be their feet, their butt and their breasts but with this girl you cant. She's too young, so young she hasn't developed breasts yet. She doesn't have feet, but a fin instead, and she's laying on her scaly butt right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, guess you'll go to her fin. Swimming down to the end of her red tail, you paddle down to land on her fin\u2019s surface. Its weird, the gravity in this place. You can swim around this place like water, but it seems to change to actual ground when your feet land on something. It makes it easier to move thats for sure. On her fin you look up at the mountain of a girl. Getting down onto your knees you feel the skin of her tail. It was really scaly. You'd love to play with this girls feet if she was human, but your not really sure how much you can do to her fin. Her scales seem to be stronger then your muscles so your pretty sure theres not much point staying down there. Maybe if you do end up getting her attention, it could be fun to play with, but until then your gonna have to swim away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKicking your legs you left back up to her body, you swim closer to her to make sure you wouldn't get spotted if anyone came in, just in case. Going to her stomach you take a detour through her small chest. Like you said before she doesn't have breasts but that doesn't mean you can't take a detour. Swimming down you pull open the strap of her top, whats covering her nipples as you swim in. It was tighter then you expected and honestly you almost got stuck. Thankfully you managed to avoid that sight, and you got to look at her childish nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be nice to be here if she was older, but still beggars can't be choosers. Swimming away from her chest you go right over her face. Even though she was young, you could still tell that she was going to grow up into a beautiful mermaid. Your pretty sure all of them will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwimming pass her face you land straight onto her bang, which was right over her face. Just like you suspected she didn't feel you do to the hair in between her face and your back. Laying down you couldn't help but marvel at how soft and smooth her hair was. It was like the comfiest thing you've ever laid on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying down you try to think about what else you could do on her body. Swimming around you found out your options were really limited with a young mermaid<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking some more ____________</span></div></div>",

Just like that, you began bouncing on top of the giant mermaid's belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woohoo!\" you (quietly) shout as you spring up and down on the stomach like a trampoline. This was pretty fun alright. You even made some tricks while in air as you came back down. While all of this, you look at the blonde mermaid and saw that she's asleep despite your little playtime so you decided to bounce even harder while this is happening. The strange gravity was at it again, but this time you were having too much fun to even care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, you end your bouncing with a belly flop on the belly. \"That...was...cool.\" you panted and slowly got up from the surface. Once again, you turn your attention to the young mermaid and what do you know, she's still fast asleep. \"I guess there's still time for more activities.\" you said as you swim towards her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her bang and remembered how incredibly soft it felt. You thought of another way of fun and jet your way into her blonde hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin her hair, you swam through the yellow \"branches\" and along the way, touch a few of them. It was like moving through a pile of soft pillows and you wanted to stop and rest for a moment but you don't want to so. You thought that the mergirl will wake up and finds you sleeping in her hair. You remember what happen before so decided not to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got out of her hair and wondered what to do next.</span></div></div>",

Once you came to the first thing you noticed was that everything was utterly enormous! At least a hundred times larger than your current height which was probably around 2 inches \"What the hell just happened? What was that bright white light and where the hell am I?\" You wondered as you looked around your enormous surroundings it appeared to be a castle of some kind but with pictures and displays of numerous monsters,old-fashioned monsters like Dracula,Frankenstein's Monster,The Wolfman,The Mummy and some ghost of some kind in 1920s attire plus everything was there was no other word for it in a 2D hand-drawn animated formation like...like from the late 1980s then it slowly dawned on you \"Hold up I've seen this before this is the castle setting for Scooby-Doo and The Ghoul School why am I here of all places?\" You thought horrified it was bad enough that you were a tiny human within a castle aka school academy for monsters what would happen if one of them caught you at this helpless,defenseless size? You got your answer a bit later as the Booming footsteps sent you toppling to the ground \"OH NO!!\" You thought who could that be?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You followed the fanged student's footsteps, each wide enough to cross one of Gatlin's cornfields. The sway in her hips made her moth-torn dress flap - sending brief gusts of chilled wind across your body. Or was that just a draft? The miles-high walls looked as if they hadn't been maintained for at least two centuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing Sibella's prestigious heritage - why was she walking, not gliding in bat form? Not that you minded. Though the pounds of her gigantic red flats made it seem like they'd tear the worn black-and-white tiles from the creaking floor - and sent you off-balance more than once - you had the feeling that she'd be much harder to pursue in midair. From behind her curtains of messy mauvre hair, it looked as if she was holding something in her arms. Even if her walking speed was breathtaking to you, she kept a slow, measured rhythm to her motions - like a somber dirge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr a ghoul carrying something fragile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, she reached over the doorknob. It seemed to complain a bit as she pulled it back; you took the moment to break into a sprint, nearing Sibella. In a flash of purple, and with a groan of old hinges, the vampire slid inside. The door shut in your face, knocking you back almost to the end of the hall. How much strength was in those delicate, lavender arms?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the decaying architecture worked to your advantage. You swoonced in through a hole in the wood. On the other side lay Sibella's dorm room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow to describe it? To anyone else, the dimly-lit room would seem cramped and claustrophobic; but at your height, the vampire's living area stretched amazingly far and high. Seeing the halls was one thing; knowing that the bookshelf and table towering above you you were actually things that Sibella used everyday was unbelievable. Huge clumps of dust lay around you, clinging to your soles as you entered cautiously. By the breaks in the wall and accumulated dirt, you would guess that this room were abandoned, if you hadn't seen the monster of a girl entering just a second ago. At the same time, there was a sense of order to its disarray - the torn tablecloths spread out neatly, all of the ancient tomes of madness ordered carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in the center of the room, upon a wobbly chair, Sibella rested. She was rested over a bowl several times your size, stirring with an old wooden spoon. At her scale, it was hard to think of her as a living person - she was like another landmark in the fields of dust before you. In fact, you weren't sure if she'd even qualify as \"living\" at full size, but that was beyond the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn open book dangled on the edge of the table. You saw the title: <i>Guide to Home Eeek-onomics</i>. Despite your calls, the enormous vampire kept focused on the contents of the bowl - only occasionally peeking to the yellowed pages. Leafing across one with a slender finger, she spoke out loud:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Insert cream of scream, blood orange, stir until slimy... I hope everyone likes this goulash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, that was what was in the bowl. A little off, but nothing bone-shakingly terrifying. Knowing that she was so careful with the food, and preparing it for friends, actually renewed your will to get closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped forward, and immediately regretted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cobweb was strung across the floor, its silky threads embracing your leg. The dim lighting had hidden the sticky trap until you were right in it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the shifting shadows of Sibella's stirring, you couldn't tell what was in the distance. You thought you could see legs moving, about to pounce on you. Every little wind that touched the webbing shook you to the core. Your muscles tensed up, ready for a spider to appear from the shadows... And nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yelped, tugging away at your trapped leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, look what the bat dragged in.\" The smooth voice slid out from above, piercing into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw the delicate curve of the woman's immense palm overtaking you. Her green eyes stared in your direction. Finally! Sibella noticed you! You felt the threads from the web lift upwards as she grasped them, pulling up with a gentleness remarkable for such an overpowering creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I needed more webs for texture. This will be fangtastic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hopes sunk faster than a ship hitting an iceberg. In an instant, she dropped you into the bowl. A foul-smelling substance clung to your body. Whenever you tried to wipe them off, more of the viscous brew clung to your arms. It weighed you down, making it impossible to climb out. Whenever you opened your mouth to shout again, sickening fumes rushed into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Sibella kept stirring. You were caught in a whirlpool of what could only really qualify as \"food\" through a twisted, inhuman lens. Struggling against the tide did nothing to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you felt the ground lift from under you. Still unable to move, you found yourself staring up at Sibella's glance - blue eyelids half-hiding the immense eyeballs. They came closer. She was lifting the spoon up, moving it towards her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little taste test, before anyone else sinks their teeth in...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl opened her mouth wide. You could only see a dark chasm past the sharp fangs, glistening gently in the moonlight. Higher and higher, you saw more details of her mouth. A thin pool of saliva forming under her pink tongue, building in anticipation. Perfectly-straight rows of teeth, all ready to suck your life away. You could practically feel her breath now - cool like a night breeze. It made you shake and shiver. The spoon tilted underneath you, and you felt as if you'd slide right in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be swallowed by a cartoon character... how did you reach this point in life?</span></div></div>",

Struggling for attention just left you panting, legs sinking deeper into the warm, murky brew. Teensy droplets of it fell from the concave wood, down to the distant floor below - at the base of Sibella's dress, draping across her mountainous figure. Her hips swayed like majestic sea waves, ready to drown you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you'd just be fat on those hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmn... I can't wait to sink my fangs in!\" Her voice chilled you, shaking the mixture. The woman's wet tongue peeked out from its cave, a monster emerging from the darkness. The slimy muscle traversed her blood-red lips and snow-white teeth. They both shimmered in the pale moonlight, reflecting the ancient, cobweb-kissed walls. Your own reflection peered back in the smooth ruby pillows; and the sheer difference in scale shocked you. The gigantic orange slices and cobwebs surrounding you were bad enough. Seeing yourself floating in the mix, suspended in a canopy high above ground level, as the ghoul student uses only her index and thumb to hold the handle... You felt your hope draining, and your blood rushing, as if a vampire were sucking you dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampire held your life in a kitchen utensil... And she didn't even see you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, with a bone-chilling slosh, her jaw opened wide. She thrust the utensil right into the gaping bat-cave, with you on it. Darkness draped the organic walls. You tried climbing out, but there was nothing but pink organs everywhere. Past her luscious lips. Over her pink gums. The air grew sticky and humid. An ominous coldness floated in it. Your puny struggles grew weaker. The vampire's mouth became your sky, your floor, your whole realm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wet slurp, her jaw closed off the last remnants of light. Intense suction tugged at you - messing up you hair, sending ingredients splashing across your shirt, and finally pulling your body off the spoon. You clutched for the wood again, but it the mighty tongue suplexed you. Your last chance for escape slid out past her teeth, and out of grasp. Floods of saliva splashed you away - you sunk in them, feeling leaving your nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark confines of Sibella's maw had you trapped!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh...\" Your captor's pensive voice rang from below. You expected to hear more - hungry groans from her digestive track, the low pulse of blood through her veins. But her internal organs were inhumanly still, as if she didn't need them to survive. It left you in eerie silence, broken by naught but the echo of your own racing heart, and the splash of her moving saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe organ slithered around you, taking in the texture of your goosebumped skin. You tried to punch back; but it was so covered in thick, translucent liquid, that your minuscule fist simply slid off. The massive tongue constricted you so tightly that merely twitching was painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Plop.</i> A bit of the cobweb descended to her throat, swept in by cold waves of salivation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer chomping teeth ground other ingredients - ones bigger than you - to mush. Juice from it splashed on your face. You tried diving away from the terrifically sharp fangs, but she held you in place subconsciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden jerk from the constraining organ snapped you from your petrified daze. It pushed you easily across the organic chasm. You were flying and falling at the same time. In the shadows, you could see the shimmer of her molars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Sibella squeezed you into her cheek. The surface receded easily against your shrunken frame. From every side, pulsating muscle and flowing wetness surrounded you. She'd also licked some blood orange from the spoon, which splattered across your torso. The student's taste buds roughly brushed up and down your spine, lathering you in even more drool. From all your thrashing, you'd gotten some of the strange brew's flavor on you. Though it smelt terrifying to a human, this vampire indulged in it. She explored and savored every little corner of your body, steadily jostling it side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gulp.</i> The orange slice slipped past her dangling uvula. You squirmed at the slick sound it made in her esophagus. There was only one more ingredient from the ghoulish goulash still in her mouth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tongue's tortuous touch released. You dropped onto the slimy platform, drenched in misty, cool saliva. Despite your exhaustion from the harrowing experience, you had enough strength to stand up... Though the wet, squishy floor made you slip to your knees. It wobbled with each clumsy step you took. Amid the silence, you could hear tiny giggles from below, within the woman's depths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd stumbled as far away from the sloshing noises as possible. You made it to the tip of the surface right near Sibella's gums. From the continual motion, it seemed like she was stirring the bowl again. The slightest flick of her wrist jostled you. She hummed a haunting tune, quaking through her lips and to your chilly bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wall of teeth stood before you, pale and flawless. These incisors were all that kept you from the outside world, the Ghoul School's halls, freedom. Both your fists pounded on them, the reverberations echoing through the enamel. They *had* to open. She *had* to pull you out. You wailed away, until your knuckles grew blistered and weary, and sweat coated your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scarlet carpet beneath you tipped up, tripping you backwards. You reached out for something to hold - but the pink roof of Sibella's mouth was far out of your grasp, a sky in itself. The water slide of a tongue welcomed you down, tilting vertically. Gravity twisted at the command of the soft muscle, spinning your world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gulp</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sloshing sound burned your ears. She swallowed! The vampire's esophagus pulled you in head-first. Broken by your struggles in her jaw, you found yourself unable to resist the masticating tunnel. With a steady, rhythmic pulsation, it tugged you deeper into her towering form - further from escape. You felt as if her entire throat was intricately probing you, from head to toe. Sometimes, the muscles closed in tight enough to strangle you; only for the next throb to release you, letting its tiny passenger slide closer to the destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, at last, it came into view. From an organic aperture, a murky wind. Gently swaying, opaque waters lay dozens of meters below, bearing the ruins of the vampire's prior taste tests. Slowly, the tight contractions loosened. The valve welcomed you into the pulsating room - in reality, a belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Plop.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, you felt acids eating at your scalp, crawling up yo your face, and then your neck. By the time you pulled your head out of the acidic lake, you were already drenched in the undead woman's fluids. You swam for dry land. But the sway of her hips as she stirred her bowl created sweeping tidal waves, which swallowed you again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pull on your arms grew heavier. You sunk deeper and deeper, touching the spongy seafloor. After being tossed to and fro so much by this cartoon character's mouth, and twisted by her esophagus, this felt more manageable. The faraway stomach walls slowly vibrated; you didn't feel cramped. Her gut was still, and quiet, giving you time to take large breaths. The air itself was heavy, but cool - like being in a forest at night. A strange sense of relief washed over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was peaceful. You'd be able to think of an escape plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling left your fingers and toes. The rose and yellow-green colours slipped out of view, to darkness. But you'd find a way out. After a moment to rebuild your strength...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slow sway of the internal world rocked you. Sounds of low humming faded into the distance. You could get out. Or at least, you'd be part of someone nice - someone far bigger, someone encompassing your entire world...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you gave yourself up, the enzymes welcomed the extra meat and blood. Not a hint of panic remained as your last bit of consciousness fell, leaving you floating loosely within Sibella's full stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were digested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spoon stopped moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSibella stood still, admiring her work. She put a hand to her hip, and licked her lips. A sense of fullness rushed through her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This ghoulash tastes fangtastic! I can think of a certain teacher and his dog who might like a bowl...\" She giggled. \"And I'm sure it'll be a scream with the girls, too!\"</span></div></div>",

Behind you, the last credits of your favorite movie were playing on your TV, Little Nemo. Since you had turned ten you had loved the movie; you'd gotten a posted of it from your aunt the year before as a Christmas present and tacked it up over your bed. Every time you saw a shooting star you wished that you could travel to Slumberland just like Nemo and go on an adventure plus you had a crush on the beautiful Princess Camille.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaron, time for bed!\" Your mom calls through the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" you reply. Turning off your TV you listen to your parents close the door to their room as you tug on your white pajamas. As you bring the comforter up to your neck you turn to look out the window and up into the night until you feel your eyes getting heavy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up slowly, seeing it's still nighttime. A noise, faint like rushing water catches your attention. As quietly as you can you tip toe down the cold floor of the hallway to the bathroom. If your little sister left the water running in the sink she'll try and blame you like always. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nose stops just as you reach the door, but the light is off and no other sounds are audible. \"Sarah, are you in there?\" You whisper. No on answers. \"I'm opening the door,\" you warn. Slowly you swing the door inward, revealing an empty bathroom. \"What the what?\" You ask yourself. You knew you had heard water running, but no one could have snuck past you. \"Maybe I'm dreaming, just like Nemo,\" you giggle. As you turn to leave the sound returns, and this time you're shocked to see running water somehow behind the mirror. Hesitantly you press your hand against the glass. \"This is weird,\" you smile. Your smile vanishes when you try an pull your hand away but find it stuck. You pull harder, but the glass is like glue. Then something pulls you forward, your feet slipping on the rug and giving you no resistance as you are dragged through the mirrored surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor what is either a few seconds or hours, you fall down a raging waterfall. Sights pass by the tube you seem to be in, many too fast for you to get a look at. Finally you see a large pool below you and brace yourself for impact. As you hit the surface you sink fast, the surface fading from view. Strangely you can still breath, and soon you see the bottom. Just before you hit it though, your vision fades and you black out. When you open your eyes again, you find yourself in a room you easily recognize as....</span></div></div>",

Not to mention that the buildings around her are way smaller than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on? Why am I outside my house? And why are all these buildings so small?\" Jamie asked herself in sheer confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie then looks down and sees her house completely crushed and sees that she's bigger now. Possibly, 50 feet tall. Jamie then starts freaking out by her new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the- I.... I'm a giant! How did this happened?\" Jamie asked herself scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie then thought back on last night when she wished on the amulet that she thought was worthless. It turns out that it's indeed worth something after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The amulet.... It did worked! My wish came true! Though, I don't see how this is something that I would wish for. Oh well, at least my clothes grew with me and that's a relief but my stepparents are going to kill me when they see the house in ruins and me like this...\" She said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie then gets up and walked around town slowly but the  tiny people of peaceful town Haddonfield saw the giant girl,realized who she was and they got very scared and ran for it but Jamie barely paid attention even as she noticed a few were the same kids at school who mercilessly teased her During her walk, she accidentally stepped on some cars and keeps hitting the buildings with her butt by bumping up against the windows causing them to shatter and the occupations inside to scream and run out in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops! Sorry! Excuse me! I'm so sorry! Oh please....Really worry about your car and.... Oh no! Sorry again,Ohh soooorrryyyy! Pardon me! Watch out!\" The massive 7 year old cried out as she keeps hitting cars and buildings she only hoped her stepparents and stepsister wasn't somewhere in the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people now got very scared and they start running for their lives while screaming \"Ahhhhhhhhh Run! A Giant!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to scare you! Honest!\"  Jamie tried to reason with them. But, it's no use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then got really hungry as she can hear her stomach growling so loud it shook the ground and people struggled hard to keep their balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh No Sorry I'm so hungry! I wonder if I can get some food while I'm like this.\" Jamie suggested as she clutched her rumbling stomach with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then walks to a fast-food restaurant and ripped open the whole roof! The workers and customers got freaked out to see such a enormous little girl and a local one like sweet little Jamie Lloyd and runs out, screaming but swallowing hard she slowly reached down and grabbed some of the numerous big juicy burgers,fries and shakes right off the table and in the deep fryers in the back of the cramped kitchens  to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, everyone. I'm starving. I can't help it.\" Jamie said as she eats more of the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then went to a small diner and ripped up it's roof too. She grabs the food and eats everything that's in it while the people are screaming and running in fear. After a while, Jamie eats the food from almost every resturant and diner in town until she gets stuffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh finally. I'm full. Too bad I had to eat almost all the food here. I hope these people would forgive me for this.\" Jamie said as she rubs her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then hears her stomach grumble again. But this time, it wasn't hunger, she feels gassy and it starts to go up inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh.\" Jamie said as knows what this means: \"Buuuuurrrrrrpppppp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then unleashed a burp so powerful, it causes the small town of Haddonfield then the state of Chicago itself  to shake violently and have earthquakes all over everywhere else! Jamie gasps as she sees the damage that the burp has caused like people getting hurt and windows in the buildings destroyed and is embarrassed by this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no....ex.... Excuse Me!\" Jamie cried out as her face turns red while covering her mouth with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that done, Jamie....</span></div></div>",

One that could get a little bumpy. But, it'll be safe regardless. And the other one is, well, gonna be a little uncomfortable for her. But, it'll be fine too. Jamie chooses her</span></div></div>",

On the other side of the house a colossal pair of feet exploded through the kitchen and into the yard. Jamie's growing body quickly started collapsing the house as her legs and chest breached the walls. A cloud of dust filled the air as the house was reduced to rubble, leaving 7 year old giantess at least 100 feet tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Jamie woke up, the first thing she noticed being the fact that the sun was in her eyes instead of being blocked by her blinds. Then she felt a breeze blowing over her body which alerted her to the fact that she was completely naked. \"What happened to me?!\" She asked as she sat up and looked around, seeing that all the houses barely came up to her belly button. \"The talisman, my wish!\" She realized. The flash of cameras drew her attention, and she instinctively covered her sensitive areas. \"Her, stop that!\" She shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, her shadow fell over most of the street.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After Jamie lifted her arm to scratch the top of her head, a thought occurred where she may find something to cover her nude form, \"Oh wait, my School! There is a game on this weekend and they should have banners up all around the building!\" Jamie exclaimed to herself. So she rushed off into the direction of her school. However, she had forgotten her new size would have a greater impact among the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left huge foot prints in the dirt she stepped on and lite cracks across the streets she stepped on. She even took out a few light posts by accident, but didn't feel them when she brushed against them as she was just too big. It didn't take her long to reach her school as it wasn't too far of a walk to begin with and given her new stature. It was a cake walk for her. Just as she made it to the property. She paused and looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie wanted to make sure there was no one at the school or at least no one that would recognize her especially all those mean kids who constantly teased her about being a orphan and having a crazed psycho maniac killer for a uncle. She scanned the area and saw the school was empty from the looks of it. So she let out a sigh of relief. Which caused the flag pole next to her to clang noisefully and blew around from her breath. Jamie was amused by this and blew a few more times against the flag pole. Causing the flag to whip faster and faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so much fun!\" Jamie giggled, she continued to blow till she was met with a cold draft of wind. She shivered and remembered she was still nude. Jamie blushed softly and started to look around for something to wear. As luck would have it, there were some banners promoting the game next weekend and the family outing tomorrow. She walked over and tried to see which ones would she even be able to wear. As they were all different shapes and sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game one was just short of wrapping around her waist or her chest. Jamie let out a sigh and noticed the family outing banner looked bigger. She was kind of hoping the sports banner would be sufficient, but to her dismay, it was more than enough to wrap around her waist and chest... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, it's better than being naked I suppose...\" Jamie said to herself, She was now wearing an tube top banner and skirt banner. It was pretty funny looking, but again it was better than being straight nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie looked around and wondered what she should do now. However, before she could answer her own question. A loud rumble came from her stomach. She looked down and squeezed her skinny belly, \"Are you hungry?\" she asked softly. Another rumble was heard and she smiled, \"I guess that makes sense. I haven't had breakfast and I did grow a whole lot really quick. But where should I look for food?\" she asked herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, she remembered she was at her school, so perhaps the cafeteria? But then she remembered how awful the food could be at any school honestly. So she shook her head with her tongue sticking out in disgust. Another thought was heading into town to see if she could get something from some fast-food chains. After getting her barring. She headed off to the nearest fast-food chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the fast-food chains, she wondered what she was in the mood for. So she went up to a burger joint that was visited a lot by her step-sister and the other members of her family. So she walked up slowly  to the drive-thru speaker and got down on her hands and knees. She stared at the menu and thought about what she wanted. The worker came on the speaker and cheerfully welcomed her to the their establishment. Jamie smiled and thanked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what would you like today miss?\" the worker asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie wondered for a second and gave her order, \"I would like one Jr. meal, with some extra fries..... but it quickly occurred to Jamie, that won't even come close to feeling her up. Not as big as she is, so she quickly changed her order, \"Actually I need 200 Jr. Meals with extra fries on all of it please.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worker paused and asked, \"Ummm, did you say 200 Jr. Meals with extra fries in all miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie nodded and replied, \"Yes ma'am, please.\" after responding, Jamie crawled forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, your total will be, $850.00. Is that correct miss? Miss?\" the worker explained and repeated, but got no answer. The worker frowned and said to herself, \"Dang pranksters...\" but just as she finished that sentence. A huge face appeared in front of the pick-up window. The worker gasped and attempted to scream, but nothing came out but a gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there, ummm, I don't have any money as I got really big this morning, but I can come back later and pay you if you like.\" Jamie explained politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worker just couldn't think of anything to say. She was scared out of her mind. Jamie looked at her through the tiny window and felt bad, \"Oh I'm sorry, did I do something wrong?\" the worker just stood there and could react. It was just then...  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Jamie was staring through the pick-up window at the drive-thru of the miscellaneous fast-food restaurant and starting to eat a few two dozen burgers and fries  A loud boom of sirens and cars racing could be heard. She rose up with a total of 10 or 12 burgers in each hand,her mouth half way open while sitting on her knees and turned her head. Looking behind her back, she saw a dozen cop cars rushing towards her and a couple local news crew just behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh... did I do something wrong? I  hope it isn't not because I can't pay for my order...\" Jamie asked and then said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter parking and forming a barricade. Over a dozen officers took positions and aimed their pistols and shotguns at the giant little girl. All of them couldn't believe the call they got was legit, and a lot of them having reserves of pointing a gun at a little... errr, ummmm... Giant Little Girl. But orders were orders and their job is to protect and serve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the cops set up, the local news crew behind them started up their cameras, \"Alright, we are just in and you are watching Local 11 News. Behind me is not a movie folks, this is real! A real life giant little girl! How she grew to be so big and if she is friendly is yet to be concluded at this time. We will continue bringing this all to you live! So stay tuned!\" the female reporter explained to the viewers who were watching fortunately Jamie's step-sister Rachel and her parents happened to be out of town this particular week(set a few months prior to the 4th film;Jamie had just turned 7 the other day) and the local babysitter was watching her at the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the officers... one of them stood in front of his car with a megaphone and shouted, \"Miss! Turn around and face us with your hands up!\" Jamie heard this and quickly listened to the officer. She lifted her knees slowly and turned herself to face them and then sat on her knees once more. All the officers were nervous as they've never dealt with such a odd threat and hoped that she was friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Now we are going to send a few officers to you and place you under arrest for questioning. resist arrest and we will open fire on you!\" the Officer explained over the megaphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Jamie worry as she had done nothing to deserve this. She just made a wish and grew really big, how was that a crime? But she didn't want to be shot at, so she complied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm okay sir...but you should know I have no idea how I got this way(not wanting to let them know about that mystical amulet) and I have no intention nor do I want to hurt anyone or see anybody hurt!\" She said truthfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree Officers approached her with long strands of high grade rope. They threw the strands over her wrist and quickly pulled in different directions to tie her wrists together. However... Jamie's stomach started to make noises. This time it wasn't from hunger, but it was for a different reason. She quickly put a hand over her stomach to keep it from grumbling so loudly but it was no use without warning, Jamie's mouth opened up and she let loose a loud burp!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BUUUUUURRRRPPPPPP!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEchoed across from her and caused all the windows at the fast food restaurant to shatter, alongside all the police cars and the news crew vehicles as well not to mention part of the street cracked and a few members of the camera crew screamed and leapt aside to avoid getting sucked into the ground itself everyone near by her had to cover their ears from the bass of the sound she gave off. Jamie blushed bright red afterwards and quickly clasped a hand over her mouth \"Ohhh EXCUSE ME!! I\"m really sorry about that honest!\"  But the officers panicked and considered this as a attempt at assaulting the public. So with a swift response, the lead officer shouted, \"Aim and Open FIRE!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the officers took aim and started opening fire on the giantess Jamie! Bullets went flying and hit her whole body! She lifted her arms to shield her face and believed she was going to die from a bunch of hailing bullets. After the Officers ran out of bullets, they felt bad for having to open fire on a little girl, regardless if she was huge or not. But to everyone's shock... Jamie was unscathed!! The bullets just hit her skin and due to her size, it was like spit balls hitting her. Jamie lowered her tied arms and was relieved to see she was unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe news crew saw this and immediately reported this, \"As you just saw everyone! The monster sized little girl is resistant to bullets! What will our brave men in blue do now!? And will this possibly mean she's about to wreck havoc on our fair town or the world?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officers looked at each other and worried what Jamie would do now...  </span></div></div>",

The officers shootings didn't harm her physically, but it did really upset her as she had done nothing to provoke them to act on such an extreme. I mean all she did was burp, she didn't mean to cause damage, how was she suppose to know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie stood to her full erect height and decided to show them what happens when you decide to shoot a little girl for burping. She started off by picking up a police car and tossing it far. It zoomed past a street and smashed into a sidewalk. She then pulled back her left foot and kicked a news truck! Causing it to flip several times before kissing a tree at full force. Luckily no one was in it, but the one of the news's crew lost their single to their station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean to damage your cars with my burp you jerks!! I may be 50-feet tall, but I am still a little girl!\" Jamie shouted at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police decided to attack her once more as she seemed like a bigger threat now, \"Move around and open fire!\" the lead officer ordered. \"Bu-but sir, it didn't work the last time and she's a little girl!\" one officer protested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's just a little girl? Boy! Little girls don't grow 50-feet tall! and attack the town! Open fire now!\" the lead officer ordered once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officers complied and started shooting. but just like last time. It was of no use. The bullets would just hit her skin and fall flat on the street mushed. Though they continued to fire at her. This only served to anger Jamie more and she decided to start plucking up officers and dealing with them that way. However, she didn't want to harm or kill them as she wasn't a monster, but she wanted them to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRounding up a handful of officers, she tossed softly into a nearby tree. Which caused them to drop their guns as they attempted to not fall out of the tree. The others, she picked them up and place them on roof tops near her or toss them into the park's lake that was just a stone throw away. It didn't take her long to defeat the entire police force. After she was done, she went back to getting some food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the lead officer wasn't through and rushed up to her with nightstick in hand and beat her right ankle. Jamie didn't even feel this as she was talking to the drive-thru staff and was wondering if she could get even more food. They didn't want to anger her in fear of what she may do to them, though Jamie wasn't a violent person and would have done nothing, though they didn't know that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting her massive ton of food. The staff was nice enough to leave the wrappers off and this allowed Jamie to shovel the food in large quantities into her mouth, \"Yummmm, this is so good!\" she said with a pleased moan as she chewed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lead officer grew tired of hitting her ankle and was out of breath, \"I-I'm not gonna... gonna give up! You missy are under arrest and will be--\" the officer was cut short as a large shadow appeared over him and Jamie was aiming to sit! The lead officer screamed as...  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Slowly opening his eyes, he saw Jamie's butt just missed him by a mere inch!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge sigh of relief escaped his mouth and he was so grateful to have been spared from being crushed by a giantess butt. To some now, this would have been an ultimate fantasy come true, but for him... a embarrassing and humiliating way to go. After collecting himself, he decided to continue his attack. He aimed his night stick at the back of Jamie's head and tossed it as hard as he could. It missed, but instead hit her left ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't much of a attack, but was enough to get Jamie's attention as she rubbed her left ear, \"Huh, did something just tap my ear?\" She turned slightly and looked behind her to see the lead officer had a stance like he threw something. Jamie narrowed her eyes as she quickly recognized the man and lifted her left arm towards him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lead officer saw this and decided he needed to retreat now, but quickly found himself flying quickly off the ground and into the air! He yelled, \"Ahhh, hey, hey, put me down!!\" but his shouting went unheard. Jamie turned back and hung the officer with her index and thumb. She stared straight at him and she looked mad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you are the one who had those other officers shoot me?\" Jamie asked with a upset tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer tried to break free as he replied, \"You sure bet I did missy. You are a threat to the community and you need to be placed under arrest or taken down by any means!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing this, Jamie grew more upset, \"Ho-how could you say that!? I am just a little 8-year old girl! I've done nothing wrong and that burp was an accident!\" Jamie yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis hurt the officer's ear drums as Jamie's voice was a lot louder than she realized. After seeing his expression of pain, Jamie apologies for being too loud, but then demanded he apologies for shooting her and trying to arrest her. The lead officer heard her and shouted, \"In your dreams brat! You destroyed a home and several other property as well. So no way, you will be dealt with one way or another!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie frowned after hearing his response, but then got an idea. She opened up her makeshift toga like top and the officer got a full view of her undeveloped breasts. With a big grin, \"I think it's time for you to have a time out.\" Jamie cooed. She drops the officer into her chest area and...</span></div></div>",

She opened up her makeshift toga like top with a big grin on her face as she dropped him while saying, \"I think it's time for you to have a time out.\" she cooed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer falls into her chest area and gets covered in darkness as Jamie closed up her top. Jamie smiled and already felt better. But now with the problem taken care of, Jamie want to burn off some energy and feel happier. It was then she got another idea. She's 50-feet tall and everyone is now like dolls to her... a big grin formed across her face as she stood up and traveled to a certain place to play some dolls and houses...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo her first thought was, 'Where should I go to play around?', with a little bit of thought, it came to her! \"Oh I know where I want to go!\" she said out loud. With a quick sprint, she headed off to her destination. Although when she sprinted, she caused the lead officer in her top to be thrown around and around. Bumping into the tarp's plastic and then her bare skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All this spinning is making me sick! Cease and desist now missy! Do you hear me, cease and desist!!\" the lead officer shouted at the top of his lungs. But Jamie couldn't hear him between her foot steps and some property damage she was unintentionally causing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was then, the lead officer flew up and bumped one of her nipples... this caused Jamie to suddenly jerk from the being hit there and she tripped! Flying forward, she crashed straight through a house! Literally carving a path through it! Thankfully no one was home at the time, but it sure got the neighbors up. The local neighbors stepped out to see a giant 8-year old wearing banners for make-shift clothing!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, what is that!? Is that a little girl!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That isn't a 'Little' girl man, that is a massive girl!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, wasn't that the Loren's residence?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas some of the commotion being exchanged among the concerned and frighten neighbors. Jamie rubbed her head as a large bruise formed,but faded soon there after as being gigantic had its advantages \"OUCH!\" Jamie cried out, but she quickly remembered the officer in her chest area! She pushed herself up and sat on the front lawn to check and see if he was alright, or... crushed. Being a little hesitant, she peaked open the banner wrapped around her chest and saw he was alright. What little bit of mounds were even there, her chest cushioned him from being crushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, I am so sorry officer. You just hit me in a sensitive area and well threw me off...\" Jamie explained to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lead officer looked up and tried not to vomit as he demanded she let him go now and they would forget this all. Jamie heard this and smiled, \"Okay then deal!\" She pulled open her top and picked the officer up with a pinch of her index finger and thumb. She softly placed him on the front lawn and the saw all the people out of their homes staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, so many people... maybe it would be more fun to play with everyone here instead? HI!\" She sweetly greeted them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe neighbors heard this and decided to flee. This disappointed Jamie, but not for long as she realized she was close to where she wanted to be. She stood to her full height and continued on, but not before saying goodbye to the lead officer. After Jamie was gone, the officer just shook his head and walked off mumbling to himself, \"I am going to retire... this is just too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie had finally arrived to her destination and it was a upper scale neighborhood with a Olympic sized swimming pool! Jamie had always wanted to play in that pool, but never had the chance with school and other things. But now, she had two choices... play with some doll houses or take a dip?  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The 100-foot 7-year old Jamie stood to her full height and was curious as to which she wanted to do. A dip in a giant pool would be so awesome and it would allow her to clean some of the dirt that was on her skin. Even given her massive size. She had collected a lot of dirt and other miscellaneous debris on her and the tarp she had wrapped around her slender young giant body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut quickly a thought came across her mind and a huge grin perked across her face, \"Well the officer was a lot of fun to play with, I bet messing with others would be just as fun and I have houses to play alongside as well. Plus I can always take a bath alter tonight.\" she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she began to walk around softly as a 100-foot 7-year old  giantess could and scouted for her targets. She remember coming by this neighborhood once and there was a really nice 3 story house she always like. With the stray she was pacing, it didn't take long till she spotted the house she was looking for. But it was on the other block!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie pouted as there was a bunch of structures, fences, and what have you between her and the other block. So with her best attempt. She tried to cross between everything, but given her size. This was next to impossible! With her first step, she crushed a bird bath and a large flower garden all in one step! Then with her next step she tried to lean to the left to avoid a picked fence. But in doing so, she leaned into a 2 story house with her left leg and left a imprint of destruction into it's siding. Causing a few windows to burst from the shock and pressure she placed on it. Even though she barely pressed into the house, though her given size was just too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused her to be startled and so she quickly swayed to the right to avoid causing any further damage to that house. Though, when she did this. Her right foot stepped directly onto the picked fence and even though it didn't hurt that much, given her foot was as big as a car! It was enough to throw her off balance and cause her to fall backwards! She crushed half the front lawn and crushed a car parked on the street with her right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe care alarm on it blared, but was quickly snuffed out as the weight she placed on it trying to stand back up just flatten it like a pancake. Jamie stood to her full height and dusted herself off. She turned her head and saw what she did to the parked car and then noticed she left a butt print in half the whole lawn of that person's property!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie giggle softly, \"Whoopsie, oh well, no one was hurt.\" she turned her head and attempted to make her way over to the other block again. This time, she lifted right foot and gave a quick kick to the remaining fence she stepped on and sent debris flying like a shotgun blast. Causing minor damage to property beside it. Her second attempt worked and she was able to reach her destination. After arriving to the property, she was amazed how this once 'Huge' house to her now crested above her knees!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow! This is, this is so amazing!\" Jamie cried out with joy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she did this though, her voice was a little too loud and caused the nearby window to crack! Jamie held her mouth after witnessing this and felt a little silly. But it wasn't long till she heard commotion coming from inside the house in front of her and that brighten her face up really quick. She saw the porch light come on and heard the front door begin to open! The owner didn't see anything but minor property damage across the street and the picked fence was complete destroyed! Jamie couldn't see the front door as the porch awning was blocking her view. So she decided to drop to her knees quickly and see who was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she dropped to her knees, this caused a good sized earthquake and set off several car alarms, some over a block away. Jamie then leaned forward and laid her chest down on to the front lawn, which pulled up her tarp and began to reveal her bare rear to the world slightly. She finally was able to see who was standing there. She then saw three people laying on their butts due to the earthquake she caused and it was what appeared to be a young girl, around her age, a older sister, and a older brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yippee, two girls and a boy to play with!\" Jamie said out loud with a huge grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe occupants panicked and the older brother was able to get to his feet and slammed the front door and locked it. Jamie saw this and frowned, \"Hey, that was rude...\". Jamie grew a little annoyed. She sat back up and messed with her tarp and pulled it back down to cover her rear properly again before she attempted to get the dolls out to play. Her first attempt was trying to get the door open, but with no luck as her fingers were just too damn huge. So she sat on her knees and tried to think of a way to get her new playthings out, without harming them or out right destroying the house either. one thought was to rip the roof clean off. As for her height that would be a joke for her to attempt. It would be so easy, but wouldn't solve her issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a thought came to mind. She remembered a doll house she had back at home. It had a exposed front where you could see all the floors and everything. She grinned as she ready herself to do some 'remodeling' so to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile inside the house, the occupants were scared beyond belief. The youngest sister was crying her eyes out and asking why there was a giant girl her age sitting outside their house and if they were safe. The oldest Brother didn't know how to answer his littlest sister. As the pre-teen sister explained, the giant freak must have been the cause of all that commotion they heard earlier in evening and just now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the brother decided to call the police. However, just as he picked up the phone to dial, the three heard what sounded like a loud slam into the side of the house and then heard creaking and breaking sounds of wood splitting! The grew worried and wondered what was about to happen, but got their answer quickly as the whole front wall of the 3-story house was ripped clean off!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three screamed at the top of their lungs as this happen and screamed even louder when they saw Jamie's face staring straight at them from their front lawn!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi there! I wanna play with you three so what do you say?\" Jamie grinned as she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie first plays with the sisters as she's already played with a guy already. She pinches the youngest sister's night shirt with her index and thumb. Then brings her to her face as she sits back up while sitting on her knees, \"Hi there, you look to be the same age as me. My name is Jamie and your's is?\", she asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little girl tried to stop crying and replied, \"M-my, my, my name is April!\", she cried out between sniffles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge grin appears across Jamie as she replies softly, \"Nice to meet you, April. I want to play with you and your family tonight. But don't worry, I won't harm you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis eased the frighten April a little, but her siblings where not eased as they weren't so swayed by the giant 7-year old. They worried for their little sister's safety, so didn't do anything to that they'd think would upset this mighty giantess. Jamie lifted April higher into the air and this caused her to let out a scream. Fearing the height she was now taken to! Her siblings asked her to put down their little sister. Jamie was confused as she placed little April on top of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just giving her a good view of the neighborhood.\" Jamie explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two siblings sighed a breath of relief, but still worried as their little sister was still really high up. Jamie then leaned forward slowly and pinched the older brother's shirt back with her index and thumb. She held him over her chest and Jamie giggled, \"I think I''l drop you between my chest, the officer seemed to enjoy it, so maybe you will too.\", she explained as she released her grip and he fell between what ever buds the young girl even had. The tarp was so tight across her figure, given the way she was sitting, he was resting between her flat breasts and the tarp. He could see her face above him, but that was it. He was scared what was going to happen to him and if he could even escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Jamie looked up and then gazed at the pre-teen sister, \"So what am I to do with you? Hhmmmm, I guess I could play dress up with you maybe? Though I'm too big to interact with your properly. Although I could just have you do it for me?\" Jamie questioned out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE! Just give me back my younger sister and older brother and leave us in peace! We didn't do anything to you and we aren't your playthings! Just because you grew HUGE! Doesn't give you a right to do this! I know you're just a kid, a really, really BIG kid! But please, just stop!\" the Pre-teen sister pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie frowned slightly and didn't really like being yelled at. The pre-teen sister saw her expression change and grew worried. Wondering if she just sealed her life away and was gonna be crushed by the giantess or what. She imagined two scenarios that could happen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn scenario one, Jamie was gonna life one of her hands and ball it into a fist and then... SLAM! She would crush her beneath her huge hand and she would be just a messy indent on their living room floor. While in scenario two, Jamie would pinch the back of her tank top and hang her above the giantess's head. She would then lean her head back as she opened her mouth wide and drop her in! Then she would either chew her to death or swallow her whole alive. Either one being awful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Jamie decided...  </span></div></div>",

She then focused her attention on the teen. \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d She stroked her cheek with a massive finger, \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt any of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m...um...June,\u201d she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s so cool!

The oldest brother decided to cover April's eyes as Jamie continue her little game. But April just cried out, \"No John! I want to see what the big meany is doing to our sister!\", John struggled, but April broke free of her older brother grasp and just watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie stared at the now half naked June. Who now had no top or bra on. She leans in and tells April to remove her panties. \"What, no way am I'm going to do that!\", June yelled out. This quickly upset Jamie as a scowl formed across her face, \"That was a demand...\", Jamie said with a calm, but stern tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearing for her life, June wrapped her fingers around her panties waist bands and started to pull them down, till suddenly someone yelled, \"Knock it off you giant JERK!\". Jamie turned her attention and saw this shout came from the June's younger sister, April. Jamie then leaned over towards her and stared for what seemed like a minute and then simply replied, \"Buzz off\". Before Jamie turned her attention back to her little plaything, April went and responded with a childish sticking her tongue out loudly. Jamie stopped and saw this rude gesture and this concerned both John and June, but to their surprise, Jamie retaliated with the exact same manner!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, given her massive size, both April and John where sprayed with giant girl spit. More so April as she was closer. April replied with a loud, \"EEwwwwww!\", and was drenched. Jamie giggle and was pleased with her come back and focused her attention back on June. Moving her face closer in, she told June to continue what she was doing. With a heavy blush, June did so and stripped the last bit of clothing on her. She was now fully nude in front of anyone to see. Jamie let out a soft giggle at her being so humiliated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up and into Jamie's eyes, \"So what do you want me to do now?\" June asked with such shame in her voice. Jamie paused and wondered what did she want to do now, but it quickly came to her. While looking over to June's siblings she responded, \"I want you to wear your little sister's clothes and she wears your clothes!\" while smiling. June picked up her clothes, even the torn parts and walked over to her little sister. April began to strip, but June blocked Jamie's view as she stood in front of her little sister. This upset Jamie as she demanded she wanted to watch and ordered her to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first June was reluctant to move aside, but she remembered quickly, they really didn't know what this girl would do. She said she wouldn't hurt them, but her actions earlier between her younger sister and her, showed she still was quite childish, so there was no for sure way to tell what she would do if she was continuously disobeyed. So she did as ordered and stepped aside. April was given the panties first which really didn't stay on without assistance from at least one of her hands and the shredded top just covered her chest really, but wasn't much given how torn up it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow came the fun part, June was to wear April's clothes now and well... being a pre-teen, her body was not only taller and bigger, but also more developed as well. So she first tried on April's panties and got to about mid thigh and struggled. She pulled really hard and heard fabric ripping as the difference in physique was quite different, even if the age difference was only by a few years. After a while, she was successful and man they were tight! Her butt cheeks popped out as the little panties formed into a thong and made some more sensitive areas unpleasant. This however amused Jamie greatly and she demanded she continued with the rest of the clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune did so as ordered and the next piece of clothes was April's shirt. This article of clothing wasn't as hard to get around her body, but when it came down to pulling it over the rest of her body, this is where she struggled. June's chest was wider than April's and she also had broader shoulders as well too. When she got it over her small puffy breasts and shifted her shoulders, a loud ripped occurred from the back as a huge spilt formed straight down her back. \"My favorite shirt!\" April cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie laughed hard as this reminded her of what she went through earlier as she was growing into the towering Giantess she is now, Although June wasn't getting bigger, it was just the size difference between her and her younger sister. June felt awful for ruining the shirt, but she had no choice. Next June went for April's pants and struggle even more than the panties. As they didn't stretch while she pulled them up and it was impossible to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune paused, \"I'm, I'm sorry, but I can't get them on! I'm simply too big for them\". At first Jamie frowned and then sighed, it was clear to even her, there was no way she was going to get them on, but she was amused that she got the rest on. But what else was there to do now? This dress up game had finally reached it's climax it seemed. So Jamie dropped to the ground to sit. She caused the whole ground and almost 3-blocks to shake from her action. The 3 kids fell onto their butts when this happen.</span></div></div>",

While the brother could only tell they were moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sisters could see the whole neighborhood! It was quite a sight. They still had major concern as to their fate, but they couldn't help but be awe stricken by the sights. Never in any of their wildest dreams did they imagine this would be happening to them. Jamie soon reached the rubble of her house. She kneeled down and then sat on her knees while she dug through the debris. She found the amulet and smiled ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now who should get the giant size treatment?

In fact, it just felt like she was being hit with spit balls like she gets a her school. However, she worried what they may try and decided to stand and run away. Jamie changed positions and stood to her full height of 100-feet tall! This worried everyone in the area and the officers quickly started reloading in response to a possible retaliation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe news crew saw this and responded with, \"Alright folks, it appears the giant little girl is preparing to possible strike back at our police force!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie looked around and decided to run pass the fast-food restaurant to prevent the officers from getting a clear shot. So she bolted to the left and rushed off. The officers took aim and were about to open fire, when their captain ordered them to stand down as their wasn't a clear shot any longer. Jamie continued to run and was in trouble as her wrists were tied now and she was still so hungry... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she needed to lose the cops first, so she just kept running and running till she reached the local park. After finding some thick group of tall trees. Jamie took a seat between them. However, just as she took a seat. She overheard a helicopter flying overhead and she tried her best to remain unseen and conceal herself. The helicopter hovered just overhead and Jamie feared, they were going to find her for sure. But to her surprise, they didn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Helicopter hovered for a bit and after seeing nothing of real evidence of her passing through, but some foot prints. They continued the search for her. After flying by, Jamie let out a sigh of relief and was happy they didn't see her. But she was still so hungry. Her stomach let out a growl of hunger and Jamie softly told her stomach to quiet down. She started to look around her surrounding and wondered what she could possibly find to eat but first she pulled at the thick strands of rope until they fell apart,simply no match for her newfound titanic strength!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen like almost on queue! A hotdog vendor was crossing though! Jamie quickly looked her eyes on him and watched him rolling his cart by. He then stopped suddenly as he called a buddy of his at the local payphone while his hotdog stand lay unoccupied and unguarded and started talking with the person on the other line. Jamie wondered now, if she should just snatch the cart and eat it's content or wait till his back is turned and make her move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some thought, she figured it would be best to surprise him. That way she could possibly remain hidden just a little longer. The vendor was talking and Jamie overheard him saying certain key words like, \"A giant little girl?\", and \"Cops searching for the monster\", as well as, \"Plans to capture and study her?\" Jamie heard this and this made her worry. What would they do to her if they caught her, but her hunger override her concerns. So she focused on the goal at hand, to get some food!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vendor started to walk away from his stand and continued to talk at the payphone he seemed to think the whole thing was a hoax the news was trying to boost ratings. While his friend on the other line argued that it looked too real to be a hoax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh and they expect us to believe a little girl just suddenly grew really huge? No way man, no way...\" the vendor chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then the vendor turned his back! Jamie saw this and knew this maybe her only chance, so she quickly leaned from out of the shadows and snatched up the hotdog stand and flipped all of it's contents into her mouth! She laid it back on the street as she chewed the hotdogs and everything else that fell into her mouth. It tasted really good and brought a smile to her face. She then moved back into her hiding spot and the vendor turned back to his cart and walked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie felt bad for stealing food, but she was just so hungry.

As her stomach growled loudly in protest that it was still indeed hungry and it demanded to be fed now! Jamie looked down and held her thin belly and begged it to quite down and that she would feed it now. Scanning the immediate area, she saw nothing of interest or at the very least, nothing she could eat... like people and what not. She was hungry, but not some cannibal or honestly that desperate either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo upon standing to her full height, she bashed her head on a local tree branch that was just above her. She rubbed her head and was annoyed, \"Gosh, being so big is kind annoying.\" Slowly she left her hiding spot and made sure no one was around before leaving. Not a person was in sight. However, she could still hear police sirens and helicopters off in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really hope they don't find me, I don't want to be punished for doing nothing wrong.\" Jamie said to herself trying not to cry or get upset. Walking out into the open park, she caught a smell that was just simply divine. She licked her lips softly and rushed to where the smell was coming from, completely ignoring any attempts of being subtle or sneaky. Causing the ground to shake softly with each step, she quickly arrived to the destination of where the smell was coming from.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a Pizza Joint that was really popular amongst the town's folks and she knew the manger who ran the joint. She was so hungry and wondered, would he fear her and turn her in or would he accept her changes and help out a giant little girl? So she crossed the park and stepped over to the front of the Pizza joint, which was just about to close up for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie kneeled down to her knees and softly tapped on the front window, \"Hi Mr. Joel, can you please help me?\" Jamie softly asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Joel heard Jamie's voice, but didn't see pass the windows as the lights where on, \"Oh why yes little Jamie, what do you--\" Joel paused as he saw a giant little girl's face staring back at him!

Wha-what happen to you dear? You're HUGE!\" Joel explained in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie's feelings were slightly hurt, but she explained to him what had happen and that she was hungry. Joel shook his head and sat in the nearest chair, trying to assess the situation, \"I-I wouldn't believe it, but I have to seeing you in the flesh...\" as Joel was trying to calm himself, Jamie repeated herself and asked again if he could feed her as she was so hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel paused and nodded, \"Why yes dear, I can't turn down such a sweet face. Even if it's giant sized now...\" he trailed off near the end, \"But I can only give you some screwed up orders that I was just going to throw out, is that alright?\" Jamie nodded her head quickly and responded with licking her lips again. Joel chuckled and told her to meet him around back. As to not attract any unwanted attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie stood up and made her way to the back, which was a tight squeeze as there was a neighboring building on the side and also in the back. It made for great cover, but bad for space... but Jamie didn't mind, she was just happy to eat again. It took a few minutes, but Joel came out with almost three dozen (36) pizzas! Jamie's eyes just lite up and she was overjoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing the  three dozen stack in front of her, Joel wiped the sweet from his brow, \"Damn Collage kids making prank orders they never picked up... at least they won't go to--\" Joel paused as he watched Jamie scarfing down pizza after pizza in just one bite! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, your size isn't the only thing that grew I see.\" Joel chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie didn't hear him as she was too busy chewing her mounds of cheese, crust, sorts of toppings, and dough she was stuffing into her mouth. With in just a mere 10 seconds, the young giantess had costumed enough food to feed someone a full week and possible then some! Jamie smiled as her stomach seemed satisfied for the moment and she let out a loud belch! Joel had to cover his ears from the depth of her burp and he shook his finger at her, \"Young lady... say excuse me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile blushing now, Jamie softly said, \"Excuse me, sorry Mr Joel and thank you so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel threw his hands responded with a kind voice, \"Don't worry about it missy, glad I could make sure a child didn't go hungry tonight.\" Jamie stood back to her full height and dusted herself off. Joel was taken back by just how tall Jamie was. He knew she had grown, but he didn't see just how tall she was now. Jamie looked down and felt a little embarrassed, As Joel looking at her reminder her at what happen at her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you please stop looking at me like that Mr. Joel?\" Jamie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, Joel apologies for his rude behavior and then asked what Jamie was going to now. Jamie looked around and found Joel's pizza joint just reached past her waist, with the other buildings not faring too much. Jamie then shrugged and said she was unsure as the police were after her for accidentally  burping at them and wreaking some stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel shook his head, \"I swear, some people just take things too seriously... you've done nothing wrong dear. Maybe try to hide some more till it cools down perhaps?\" he suggested to Jamie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie liked this idea and decided to go hide back in the park. She waved goodbye to Mr. Joel and hid behind the trees where she was before. She laid on her side and tried to get comfortable and rest her tired eyes. It was hard at first, but she was eventually able to fall asleep. Morning arrived several hours later and... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What happens next?</i></span></div></div>",

All the adults and kids who had made fun of her, shoved her and made her life so miserable were now no larger than plastic army men to her. She could see the tree she'd once been forced to climb to get away from some boys, now it barely came up to her knee. 'Now I'm the one standing over all of them,' she thought. Taking two steps brought her in front of the people who had been taking pictures of her. \"It's not nice to take pictures of a girl when she's naked,\" she frowned. \"Drop the cameras and run away, or I might just get mad.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group did as Jamie ordered and sprinted away as fast as they could move. The gigantic girl grinned at how easily she'd gotten her way. Raising her foot she crushed the dropped cameras to scrap, erasing the embarrassing pictures. \"Why was I  embarrassed though?\" She said to herself. \"It's not like anything can fit me anymore.\" Maybe if she found some big circus tents she could make something to cover herself, but she had no idea where to get some. The sun shone down through the clouds again, the light a pleasing warmth against her bare skin. Letting her hands fall to her sides, she felt a naughty thrill as she imagined all the people who were seeing her naked from inside their houses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out into the street, she felt something crunch under her foot. Looking down she saw that she'd stepped on a bike, compacting it into the street. \"That felt nice,\" she giggled. Stepping forward, she brought her foot down on a parked car, the metal crumpling under her sole and the glass shattering. \"It doesn't hurt at all,\" she said, knowing that the sharp metal and bits of glass would have cut her badly if she'd stepped on them at her old size. She suddenly imagined herself standing over all the other kids at school who had always made fun of her, fear in their eyes as her foot hovered over their heads. Now THEY would be the ones afraid of HER!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that I'm a giant, it's time for some things to be different,\" she smirked. First things first, she decided to...  </span></div></div>",

This was so strange that you were not able stand straight and fell down on the ground. In about thirty seconds, the world around you changed so much that you could not believe it is real.  The pebbles on the ground were as big as massive boulders, the rare grass looked taller than trees were before. Then you heard and even felt powerful tremors, coming somewhere on the other side of the road. With a fear, you realized that these tremors are getting louder and stronger \u2013 so strong that it became difficult for you to stand on your feet. When you looked at the direction of these, you saw something incredibly scary \u2013  a unbelievably huge little girl, about seven or eight years old, wearing light blue overalls and a pink shirt. She was walking down the street and her face had an expression of sadness. For you, she looked like the biggest thing you ever saw in your life.<br>\r\nYou immediately decided to run away from her path to avoid being stomped on and crushed beneath her white shoes, but your plan had one flaw in it \u2013 your size. As you started to run, you saw that it would take too much time to get out of this girl\u2019s path. When you thought that, everything became dark as the girl\u2019s humongous shadow covered the area around you. You looked up only to see the giant girl looking directly at you. This made you a little bit relieved, because you were saved from her foot crushing you, but from the other side, you felt scared, because you could not think of what will happen next.<br>\r\nFor Jamie it was another hard day in school, because she was bullied again by her classmates. When the school time ended, she ran out of school building and, while waiting for her parents to pick her up, decided to walk around the street for a little bit. Then she saw something tiny on the ground, right on her path, about ten feet from her, \u201ca bug\u201d, this was the first thought that came in her mind, but as she approaches, she is completely astonished, realizing that this little figure is not an insect, but a human, but a really tiny human. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d, she asked you as she crouched down in order to see you better. \u201cHey, please don\u2019t hurt me, I don\u2019t know what just happened, I just got shrunk somehow\u201d, you screamed to her, hoping that she will hear you, but instead of answering, she reached for you and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know how you got so small, but you are very cute and I should\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

This was a new level of punishment \u2013 Jamie\u2019s gas was so strong that it sent you flying towards her panties fabric, pressing you against it, getting inside your body though your nose, and mouth and even though your skin. Without any way to escape, Jamie\u2019s gas was filling the entire space inside her panties.

She had decided to go over to the park to do the only thing she could do when her aunt smirked and endlessly belated her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night back in her small room at the top staircase the short haired blonde began to cry as she glanced down at herself while pulling out her small golden locket,the only thing she had left of  her father,only just now noticing just how badly hungry she was. While her Aunt Figg thankfully wasn't truly physically violence(this was a kids' cartoon after all!),she was stone cold to her supposed niece and despise having a huge buffet of food especially both for herself and her equally plump dog,she only gave the girl mere table scraps and Robyn of all things was forced to steal food in order to survive a simple night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer spirit was broken and her clothes were much worse for wear, Her headband had been broken in half when the beating had began leaving her hair disheveled and unkempt, her shirt and pants had been ripped and torn in many places  from her aunt pulling at her as she attempted to and failed to get away..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn sighed as she glanced up at the dark cloud filled sky, \"At least it's not raining..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had she said that did it begin to rain. \"Oh come on! *sob sob*\" That was the last straw for Robyn, not being able to stop her self she began to weep, hot tears fell from her face along with the cold rain drops pelting her as she shouted to her self \"WHY WAS I THE ONE WHO HAD TO BE GIVEN SUCH A CRUEL AUNT!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking no one heard her she continued to cry wincing ever once in a while, as a tear or raindrop fell into her already wrinkled red shirt with the thin white stripe on her body. However unbeknownst to Robyn someone HAD heard her earlier  outburst and was coming over to check on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me child, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh W-Who said that? Huh?\" As the young girl jumped with a start as she struggled to make out the owner of the voice before her, until she noticed the person in font was actually an old man! he was clad in a black raincoat and had an umbrella in his left hand while he held onto a cane he had in front of him with his right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Robyn asked quickly wiping away her tears with the back of her hand, the man smiled happy to see that he had her attention. \"I'm William my dear. but you can call me Will..\" He said trailing off as he noticed the state the child was in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello I-I'm Robyn,Robyn Starling. H-how did you get in my aunt's house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh I have my ways my dear Robyn..For you see, I'm no ordinary man....\" He replied smirking putting up his umbrella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What's that supposed to mean?\" As she quickly stood up as he offered his hand to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Just take a hold of my hand and you'll no longer have yo see this horrible place...it's perfectly alright my dear no harm will come to you.\" He said kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn stayed silent for a moment before she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well normally both my father and A-Aunt Figg always told me to never talk or go anywhere with strangers...but you do seem like a very nice man so...yes...I accept. Anywhere's better than here.\" As she tenderly took his hand and he led her to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill smiled as he nodded saying \"Nice to meet you Robyn..\" He expected the child to say something instead she stayed quiet but watched astonished as the man took out a really thin stick,gave it a wave then both of then vanished into thin air!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem cold, and lonely might I add. Would like for me to sit with you?\"  Robyn glanced down at the wooden bench in the isolated park  she was currently sitting  on in amazement then to the man in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how did you do all that? A-are you a....\" She gibberish unable to finish as he nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my dear,I am indeed a magician or a wizard if you will. I practice magic but very good magic not evil.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic? So you can do spells and things like that?\" The girl's jaw dropped open as she took a step back in shock as Will nodded and went about siin the bench leaving the umbrella open over him and Robyn to keep the rain off the two of them. \"So ,Robyn if you don't mind me prying who did this to you?\" He asked wanting to know her full story, Robyn glanced down at her feet barely covered by her shoes and socks which looked to be about in tatters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My cruel Aunt Figg,but she's not really my aunt,only my guardian...\" Robyn finally said with a sniff as she carefully explained everything to the strange old man finally Will nodded with a somber expression, \"I feared as much..\" <br>\r\nRobyn quickly asked \"Can you help me?!\"<br>\r\n \"Help?\" Will repeated wanting her to explain. <br>\r\n\"Yeah! Can you do something? Take my Aunt somewhere so she can't get too me or maybe even send me somewhere?\" <br>\r\nWill blinked before he smiled \"I may be able to do just that Robyn..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn looked at her new friend in confusion, \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill laughed, \"Let me explain..\" He said as he brought up his cane which upon closer inspection was actually a magic wand! \"I'm not just an old man, I also know powerful magic, like being able too send someone or something somewhere else..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girl took a moment to process what she had been told before her eyes widened in realization, \"You mean you could..\"<br>\r\n Will nodded somberly. \"Yes I can do this for you..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn began to squeal and bounce up and down saying \"Thank you! Thank you sir!!\" Over and over  before Will spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'll send us too the town I'm from but only if you do something for me..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn quickly nodded saying \"Anything just name it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a grandson the same age as you named Miles. I want you to be his friend for me. Can you do that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn nodded within seconds before she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes of course! I'll be happy too!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Will chanted a spell and in a flash of light he and Robyn disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later they reappeared in front of a small house on top of a hill, overlooking a small town. \"Where are we?\" Robyn asked in wonder, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill turned to the house saying \"We're in the town I grew up in that is my home..\" He said trailing off as he went too open the door, \"Come my grandson is expecting us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the two of them went in before they were greeted by a small boy with light brown hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandpa!\" The boy shouted in glee as he wrapped the older man in a hug, \"Did you enjoy your trip?\" <br>\r\nWill nodded and said. \"Yes I did and I brought a friend for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really who?\" The boy asked before his sight landed on Robyn, he blushed \"Hi, I'm Miles. What's your name?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn blushed in return and said Hello I'm Robyn.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the introductions out of the way, Miles quickly turned to his grandpa, \"Hey grandpa, Can I go practice my magic with Robyn?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill nodded saying \"I don't see why not just be careful okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the two ran outside shouting \"We will!\" However  while the two were outside..                                   </span></div></div>",

Well I-I think it says Giantess Maximus. Make anyone a giant with this spell and simply say the spell again to turn the giant back to normal.\" The pretty eight year old forgetting about her evil aunt,missing father and virtually everything else gushed as she finished reading the page's spell, \"Wow! S-So this magic stuff is f-for real?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles glanced at his wand as he asked aloud \"I wonder if it will work?\" Robyn eyed him curiously, \"You mean you've never tried it not even on a harmless animal?\" <br>\r\nMiles shrugged as sweat dropped from his foreheadas he retorted. \"Uh no because most animals won't be so harmless if they turn into a giant..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn blushed at that and said \"Oh that's true hehe sorry. Well how's a good time as any to try it out don't you think?\" <br>\r\nHowever Miles just brushed it off saying \"Don't worry about it..\" <br>\r\n The two stayed quiet for a moment before another question came to mind, \"W-Who's gonna test it?\" Miles asked suddenly, <br>\r\nRobyn thought about it and said a bit slyly feeling a tad braver.<br>\r\n\"Say Miles I-I think you should use it on me.\" <br>\r\nMiles blushed a bit at the sudden decision as he voiced his concern, \"Y-You? Bull.but..are  you sure Robyn? You're just a little girl....I mean what if something goes wrong? Like what if you grow but your clothes-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe asked before he cut himself off to stop himself from saying something embarrassing, however Robyn knew what he was getting at and blushed bright red looking off to the side in a shy manner. \"Ohh it will be perfectly alright Miles! I mean you are a very talented young wizard aren't you? *Giggle* I have complete faith in you!\" She muttered making Miles squirm in an embarrassed manner, after the awkward exchange the two children got their nerves under control. <br>\r\nMiles was the one that broke the silence as he said \"Okay I'll recite the spell let me know if anything happens!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn nodded and said \"okay!\" Taking a moment to steel him self, Miles waved his wand in the air with a shout of \"Giantess Maximus!\" <br>\r\nThe moment he said it his wand blasted off a green beam that hit Robyn square in the stomach area of her bright red with the small white striped shirt,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...Miles...Offffffffff!\" She moaned,after the beam hit Robyn fell to her knees as she felt a large rumble emit from her belly before it began to expand, soon her arms and hands fallowed as well as her legs and feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What's happening......Ohhhhh! I-It's Working!\" Before long,the young girl's entire body had expanded until she was the size of a building! , \"GASP!! I-It worked Miles! I'M A GIANT! Ohhhh but this is weird!\" Robyn said before another rumble came from her however this time it was a rumble of hunger. \"Uh oh!\" Escaped her pretty red lips as she quickly clutched it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like you're pretty hungry.\" Miles said nervously, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn giggled a cute one and replied lowly as she stood to her full terrifying height of 50 Feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but don't worry Miles, I won't eat you.\" As she gave him a sweet smile<br>\r\n Miles nodded and said looking up at the young giantess. \"Right how about I poof up something for you to eat? And we teleport to somewhere more open!\" Miles asked getting a nod from his friend, \"Okay let's see..\" Miles looked through his spell book before he instantly transported him and the young giant girl to a small crowded town in the middle of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we....\" Robyn began before she looked around at dozens of tiny doll sized people on the ground and instantly blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er hello..p-please don't be alarmed...I-I won't....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhh RUN GIANT MONSTER!\" As they all ran off and she looked miserably at the boy at her feet Miles just shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well that was to be expected Robyn Starling! What did you think was going to happen? Anyway as long as you take baby steps,nothing should go horribly wrong...let's get you something to eat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh...you're right...I just wish everyone wasn't so scared of me!\" Robyn muttered lowly as she picked Miles up and put him on her shoulder before she began to carefully walk throughout the tiny town,watching where she was stepping as she actually sniffed around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wait I smell something! *Sniff Sniff* Mmmmm.....Smells like fresh popcorn!\" As soon as she said this,she began to go to where the smell was coming from which was a popcorn machine that you would find in a county fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er Robyn Wait...I-I really don't think that's a good id....\" The boy muttered worriedly.<br>\r\nHowever as Robyn ran over, she accidently stepped on a car crushing it flat under her left sneaker and knocked over a small office building. \"Oops I-I'm Sorry!\" Robyn shouted clutching a hand over her mouth as people's names the ground  began to complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Uh oh, I think we're in trouble.\" Miles said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn right you are boy!\" A new voice spoke startling the two, on Robyn's other shoulder, stood a man that looked like him  but much older.<br>\r\n \"Umm hello I-I'm guessing your Miles' father?\" Robyn asked nervous,  and the man nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Indeed I am lassie, or Miss Starling, I overheard your little conversation back in our hut yes I'm Markus, Miles' father. Who might you be?\" \"Robyn sir, it's nice to meet you.\" She said trying to be polite by bowing however another voice spoke.<br>\r\n \"There's no need too be so formal Robyn dear.\" The voice turned out to be Will whom was floating in the air on a cloud<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mr. Will!\" Robyn said with a big smile. Will nodded as he turned to address Miles whom seemed to be shrinking in the presence of both his father and grandfather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Miles, You should have known better then to use magic so carelessly!\" His father said sternly Miles squeaked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes Father I promise I won't let it happen again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth  adults nodded as Will spoke next, \"We know you won't. That's why we're letting you off with a warning this time..\" He said as without casting a spell he undid all of the damage Robyn had caused moments ago, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkus then spoke addressing Robyn this time.<br>\r\n \"That also means shrinking you down to normal young lady.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking the young girl sulk a bit. As she slowly nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh A-Alright.....\" She moaned utterly disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ready-!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever before Markus could cast a spell Robyn stopped him \"What? Don't tell me you don't want to be shrunk down little girl?\" He asked Robyn thought over his question for a moment before she said...             <br>\r\n                    </span></div></div>",

Sporting a blush of her own Robyn asked him \"Were you worried about me Miles? *giggle*\" Hearing no repose from the boy in question she decided to be a little braver and mess with him a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How sweet of you Miles..\" She said before she suddenly leaned over and kissed the boy's cheek making him sputter in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the exchange Will and Markus shared a laugh as they noticed the flames of a relationship building between the two children before a thought occurred to the adults (Could Robyn be able too use magic as well?) Taking the initiative Markus cleared his throat drawing the kids attention, \"Excuse me Robyn, do you mind if I ask you something?\" Robyn nodded, \"Sure What is it Mr. Markus?\" \"Do you think you might be able to use magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn's eyes widened in shock for a moment before a thoughtful look crossed her face \"I don't know if I can, before today I honestly wasn't sure if magic was real.\" She said as Miles whom had gotten over his embarrassment earlier placed a hand on her shoulder, \"One of your relatives may have been able use magic like your father or maybe even your mother.\" Miles said trying to be hopeful. Will nodded, \"All though with your aunt Figg around I don't blame you for not knowing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you hate her?\" Miles asked curious, \"Heavens no, I just wish she could have been a bit nicer too me..\" Robyn said with a wishful look in her eye. Markus nodded then before speaking up \"Right Now then let's see if you have the ability..\" He said as he stood in front of Robyn holding out his wand, within seconds the wand began to blink a green glow slow at first but then it got much faster as Robyn began too glow as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that answers that.\" Markus said as he put his wand away, Robyn just looked confused. \"Wait what did you do?\" Markus grinned \"The spell I just used acts as a magic detector if my wand gives off a red glow that means the person it's pointed to can't use magic but if it glows green..\" Robyn gasped as realization came to her \"Then that means that I can use magic! Yay!!\" She shouted in glee before wrapping Miles in another hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkus then spoke \"Hold on now Robyn just because you have ACCESS to magic doesn't mean you know how to USE it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing where his son was going with this Will spoke next, \"Which is why you need these.\" With a flick of his wand two envelopes poofed into existence. \"What are these letters for?\" Robyn asked however Miles gave her a look of shock \"WHAT?!? You don't know??\" Will quickly steeped in to calm his grandson \"Calm down Miles my boy, haha! Let me explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Grandpa.\" Miles said sheepishly as he rubbed the back of his head, \"Now the, the letters I just gave the two of you are invitations to the best magic and wizards school in the country: Garreg Mach Academy.\" \"Wow..\" Robyn said in starry eyed amazement. Markus then spoke up adding \"The best part though, I'll get to be one of your teachers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that the two children began to bounce in joy before a new voice spoke up \"What'd I miss?\" Knowing exactly who the voice belonged too Miles shouted \"Mom!!!\" before wrapping the woman in a hug. \"*giggle* I missed you too Miles honey. Oh, hello who's this?\" The woman asked noticing Robyn. \"Hello Miss, I'm Robyn Sterling.\" The 8 year old girl said bowing before the woman spoke \"There is no need to be so formal with me Robyn..\" She trailed of as she held her hand out \"I'm Melody Miles' mother. As Robyn greeted the woman she took in her appearance she was a mix between tall and slim with fair skin crystal blue eyes and ginger red hair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day was spent with talking about the academy as well as explaining Robyn's story to Melody, \"Oh Robyn, had I known how your aunt treated you I would have done all I could to stop her!\" Melody said from her spot at the dinner table. \"Melody honey you know as well I do that we can't use our magic on normal people.\" Markus said from his seat at the head of the table. \"I know and I hate that!\" Robyn spoke up wanting to change the way the conversation was going, \"Thank you for caring but you don't have too do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear ol' Will has invited you two to the academy himself?\" Melody asked as she turned to give the old man a stern glance, Will nodded,  however instead of her praising him she began to scold him, \"William Amadeus Wolfgang, as headmaster you know full well that you aren't allowed to play favorites!\" However Will just laughed, \"I should be the one telling you and my son that!\" That shut her up Markus however didn't let it stop there, \"He has a point considering Miles will be in my class about magic defence and your broomstick flying class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got Markus a pout from his wife and a playful slap on the arm, \"Hush you..\" \"Love you too honey.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that funny exchange dinner was uneventful, Then Miles and Robyn got ready for bed Miles' mother had made Miles's bed into a bunk bed so they both could share Miles' bed without things being weird. Miles walked into his room after Robyn finished changing into a spare set of his pj's for her to wear as sleepwear. \"Looks good on you.\" Miles said making the girl giggle with a blush on her face, \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Robyn can I ask you a favor?\" Robyn nodded, \"Sure Miles, What is it?\" Miles thought about what he wanted for a moment before he said..                                                        </span></div></div>",

You slowly crawled forward and by the looks of it, she was going to scratch on whatever she felt that itches her.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you looked up to the towering Amazon Princess' head, her attention turned to you, too. The bright eggshell eyes opened wider in concern. Her skyscraper-scale boot tearing the plain as she shifted it away slowly, one hand raising to her lip. A huge purple amulet lay between her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a gargoyle swept for the gem, about three times your size. The Raven-haired league member, who was even larger, slapped it aside with a quick grunt. She watched it fall to the ground before looking back to you. Diana's concerned gaze turned to frustration, elegantly-shaped eyes narrowing and nose curling up. \"Don't stand there, stupid! If you're gonna stare, go with the others where it's safe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others? What did she mean? She pointed a huge index finger behind you, before kicking away another attacking beast. Her boot soared in the air, like a cheerleader's - but with more weight, tossing her whole narrow-but-huge hips into the motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned back, running out of the fray. In the distance was a whole crowd of children: staring, pointing, and chattering in shock. A few of them cheered or pumped their fists in excitement. Behind them lay a series of castle towers, houses that looked medieval, and classical-style statues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the bizarre architecture, it was clear that Wonder Woman had grown. You looked to be at normal size, but... When you dashed forward, your legs didn't reach nearly as far as you thought with each gallop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFight sounds reigned the air behind you, full of clashes and the occasional deafening stomp. You didn't want to look back - but from the rhythm and feminine-but-booming grunts, it sounded as if the creatures were pushing Wonder Woman closer. Exhaustion tugged at your lungs and legs, and you still hadn't quite reached your destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd looked over you, some tykes rushing up to help the home stretch. Their chubby arms grabbed your shoulders.. You panted - then gasped, realizing your voice pitch was much higher. Just like the League in Kid Stuff, your body had been reduced to that of a child!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA boy screamed \"Look out!\", pointing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge portion of the children shouted, rushing away. They trampled over you in a desperate frenzy, but something worse was about to come. A set of gargoyles and dragons were beating down on the mountainous superhero, dodging her swings and kicks. You tried to get up, but the dizzying display set you off-balance. One rammed her bare leg - Diana stumbled back. Her boot's heel fell from above, marked with dirt stains, overtaking your body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>FWOOSH</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden blur pushed you back. Wonder Woman's sole hit the ground right before your eyes, carving into the pavement with a loud <i>THUMP</i>. The dust lifting from the ground entered your eyes, blinding you. You felt another pair of arms around your back, and couldn't touch the ground. When you opened your eyes, an oddly-familiar smile met you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuperman, in pint-sized form, had carried you out of harm's way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I'm late! We're all busy with Mordred and his amulet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe set you onto the ground, in a circle that opened up for him in the crowd. What else could you say, but a bemused \"thanks\"? He nodded to you, as if understanding the absurdity of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd members started chattering, a few looking down or away in shame. The young Clark Kent passed his eyes over them with his arms crossed. \"Careful. It's good to get away from danger, but you also have to pay attention to other kids. Someone could've been squashed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA string of apologies with varying levels of sincerity rang out, muffled by the fight sounds. Diana swung and missed a monster, which rammed into her forehead. She fell back into a marble tower, letting out a grunt. Her flat rear end tore the sturdy bricks apart, making the structure crumble onto itself. Some rubble rained down from above...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore a glowing emerald butterfly net caught them, throwing them back at the flying creatures. Green Lantern shook his head, letting the beam recede back into his ring. \"Aww, I did that too quick! I should've made it a cool shield! Or a stunt net! Butterfly nets are girly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonder Woman got back to her legs, feet placed firmly in the ground. One of them crushed a stone monster under it. \"Girly's fine by me.\" She forced a smile, looking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two other league members flew up to help, smashing some of the aerial threats. You noticed a subfuscous figure riding on one's wings, steering it to crash into another it into another. This thing then used a grappling hook to cling to safety on Diana's ear. The amazon tossed herself forward - body-checking the last gargoyles. They collapsed into a spray of rock to the ground, some sediments staying on the yellow mark across her costume. No more of the creatures were in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flopped her hair back, a cocky smile pulling her lips as she wiped it off like dust. A few bits fell near you. \"That was kinda fun! Too easy, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcited chatter sprouted from the crowd. You could only make out fragments here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see that laser?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just standing there, and then a zap, and then these people dressed like comic book characters suddenly-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Grew her soooo big! Wasn't it Mordred who was supposed to be the one who-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-like that episode where GL met the Justice Guild! 'Legends'. So the amulet brought us from another universe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder Woman's carrying the rest of the team, just like the movies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, a world without grownups? It'd be awesome to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Hypercrisis, man! Grant Morrison is behind this! The absolute madman, he killed the Fabulous Killjoys, and now we're next!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-It's so meta, even this acronym -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shape emerged from the shadow of Diana's hair. A little kid, cloaked in a cowl. Batman looked over her, his mask's eye holes somehow widening. \"Where's the amulet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana lifted her empty hand. \"Right here!... wait.\" The realization struck her like a punch to the time-space continuum. Her smug smile shrunk to a confused \"o\" shape. She leaned over crowd, looking across the square. Under her scrutinizing gaze - like a Greek deity passing judgement - they hushed to a gentle whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a slight pressure in your side. Something cold hit you. A bystander in a large jacket shoved you while walking, accompanied by a mumble: \"filthy peasant...\". You grabbed at him - only for his coat to slide off. It hid was the amulet; held in the sleeve of a fancy purple outfit; accompanied by cool poofy hat; and a punchable face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! It's Mordred!\" You yelled up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah! You fool!\" The self-named king started shaking the stone and chanting a spell. Nothing happened. Apparently, the magic artifact needed some recharge time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that brief second of fumbling, Wonder Woman was already reaching down. With a skillful leap, Mordred dodged her mighty grasp. The same couldn't be said for you and a handful of other kids. You felt squeezed against the segments, into the small wrinkles between the phalanges, and against fellow bystanders. When she uncurled her fist and scanned you all, a blush crossed her looming face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That way!\" Clark flew after the purple blur, followed closely by John and Bruce. With no time to lose, Diana simply kept you all in her palm as she went after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young king slipped into a hut. The heroes instantly assaulted it with a mix of laser eyes, a green cannon blast, and batarangs. All were deflected back at off the hut's walls. They were flying directly for Batman!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana dove out in front of the projectiles, arms stretched - her wrist-guards shielding the cloaked terror. It took her a second to notice that she'd clenched her fingers, squeezing you again - and that her guarding move had also compressed the rest of the child-sized Batman tightly into her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the crowd came down safely - but the by in her arms stayed there for a second. She giggled, despite herself. \"I never many dolls back on Themyscira. You know... You're really soft.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman struggled, kicking around. \"Stop hugging me! I'm not a toy!\" His face turned red, but it was hard to tell if it was from pressure or embarrassment. \"I-I am the night! I am vengeance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreen Lantern turned back to the castle, groaning. \"Look, you two can play mommy and daddy AFTER we've saved the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear Mordred laughing, even behind the sturdy walls. \"I'm still the greatest magician on the planet! Reflection spells are child's play - so to speak. And soon, I'll have the amulet's powers once more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting back up, the young Wonder Woman kicked through the hut. The whole west wall groaned at the tip of her boot. It flew a huge distance away, a testament to the strength in her lithe-but-gigantic legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuperman gazed into the distance, impressed. \"Well, guess I'll have to fly over for -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha! Missed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy was now standing atop a tower. Teleportation magic! Wondy swung at it, knocking the building in two pieces. The crowd below fled again, being careful this time to ensure you were with them as the rubble hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taunting voice came from another house. \"In here, big shot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dashed over to it, crushing the structure easily under her boot. \"You can't run forever!\" She ground the heel down, ensuring he couldn't re-use the hideout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I just need to run for another few minutes, and then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis laughter was cut off by another stomp - but he teleported to safety once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreen Lantern groaned. \"Is she going to have to tear the whole town apart to get us back to normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman started plotting, drawing shapes in the ground. \"Quiet. I can't think of a plan with -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>STOMP</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come out!\" Diana shouted, destroying another structure.</span></div></div>",

In a flash of green, the young king vanished once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over there!\" Clark pointed to a small hut, decorated with menacing spikes. Indeed, the magician's grinning face was in the window. The titan lept forward, lifting her leg from the dust - rubble tumbling from it - and stomped the roof. The jagged edge of the spike pierced her sole. She stumbled backwards in pain, her star-spangled tights slamming into the earth. The impact generated a massive earthquake. It sent you, the other dimensionally-displaced kids, and the pint-sized Leaguers bouncing in the air. She groaned, rubbing her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred's laughter echoed again. \"Pretty big butt for such a baby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only because of your stupid stone!\" The titanic girl tore out her Lasso of Truth, and expertly twisted it at a set of buildings. Despite her delicate frame, she was nevertheless an Amazon; she pulled swiftly, and tore the structures from their foundations. They collapsed into her sturdy torso, wooden splinters falling across her underwear and chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut once again, Mordred had vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoung Diana leaned onto her shoulder, peering over Bruce's sketches in the ground. \"I don't have time to crush EVERY hiding place. Any plans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can throw buildings at him...\" The cowled hero slashed his dark glove against his sketches. \"... No, that's stupid, he'll just zap away! Urgh, his powers aren't fair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreen Lantern tapped his ring. \"I'll make a fake amulet to distract him! But wait, that rock's purple...\" John lifted his finger up. \"I'll fool him by making a fake giant Wonder Woman! But wait, that'll make him teleport more! We need to think like a hide-and-seek expert...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana groaned, the landscape shifting as she brushed her black hair. \"Easy enough. Bruce's been hiding for years now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce slammed a fist into his drawing. \"Shut up! I can't think with all this talking!\" He sketched in the sand furiously. \"How can we hide when she's so big, and we have these noisy kids to keep out of the way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd murmured, looking down, ashamed. They shuffled their feet. Some of the smaller ones cried gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark, scanning them, thought. \"Hm. What if we didn't have to keep them aside?\" His cape fluttered. \"Is there any way you could use these guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heroine shook her head. \"He probably wouldn't trust them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe darknight detective looked over their worried faces. \"No way. It's not right to force kids without superpowers into our fight. Someone could get hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn patted his shoulder. \"Uh, Bruce? How many Robins and Batgirls have you had, exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second, the young Batman bore something that almost resembled a smile. \"Okay, I thought of something.\" He turned to the crowd of diminished travelers. \"But you guys better stay in line!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chorus of voices emerged from the crowd, with nods and salutes:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roger, sir Batboy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've always wanted to save the day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I get a go at the ring?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just let me punch that Mordred guy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, Batman with preptime, this is good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grant Morrison, please grant us this victory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hut's table, surprisingly, had enough space for you underneath it; reminding you how much smaller you were as a kid. And Diana's continual stomping outside didn't help. The glimpses of red and blue through the window worried you. Even if you knew she had your best interests in mind, Wonder Woman was awfully temperamental earlier...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...No, you had to stick with the plan. You remained hidden. As Batman said, someone who's good at hiding makes a good seeker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the League chased the sorcerer, the rest of you had gotten to work. The pieces were in place - more or less. You hoped everyone else was ready...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, Mordred appeared in the house beside yours. Clark floated nearby, watching. The blond sneered at him, arms crossed. \"What's wrong? Are you finally bowing to your King?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom within a cupboard, a pair of girls jumped at Mordred, seizing his cloak. His eyes bulged in shock, then rage. \"Hey - remove your grubby hands!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy teleported, leaving them holding nothing. But at the next place he appeared, a boy hiding under a bed held him by the legs. Mordred kicked helplessly. \"Filthy - after everything your king's done for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe disappeared again - and again. Each time, the wizard child was beset by the grasp of hidden children, beating him at his own game. The plan was working so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a shockwave shook the pots and pans above you. Mordred's tights were right in front of you. This was your chance. He brushed his shoulders, grumbling: \"I've had enough of this game...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lunged up. He stumbled in surprise, falling to his stuffed buttocks. You grabbed for his necklace - the one that held the Amulet of First Magic to his chest. He wrestled against you. \"You're cheating! This isn't fair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gem reflected candlelight off the table, and into dark clouds. Briefly freeing your hands, you made shadows with them - a Bat-signal, then a \"W\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, this gave the magician in mauve the upper hand. He punched a solid blow to your cheek. Pain surged through it. Mordred clenched his teeth together, and clutched the gem. \"At last! It's recharged. And I know the brat I'm going to start with...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe conjured a gigantic axe. With a wave of his fingers, you floated in midair, upside-down. He aimed the weapon for your neck...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And stumbled, dropping the amulet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground shook. Both you and the villain lifted into the air, as if the hut were an elevator rushing to the fifty-second floor. The chairs slid back and forth  Bits of floor and wall crumbled, torn from their foundations. Outside the window, you passed by a pair of blue shorts; followed by a red top with a small bulge; a lean neck framed by raven hair; and finally, a girl's face with blue eyes and a coy smile. Diana was lifting the house up with her bare hands! With a small breath to prepare, the gigantic girl pulled the walls from either end, ripping the building apart like cardboard. Mordred, the gemstone, and you, all landed in her hand, cushioned by its softness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile crossed the titanic lips before you. \"Thanks for the help, little guy! We knew Mordred's pride would get the better of him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded to her, beaming. But soon, something cold fell on your neck. The wizard held his axe - and was holding it to you, twitching. She yelped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still king here!\" He shouted. \"Drop me, you big dummy, or I'll execute this child!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour shoulders felt weak. Diana winced. \"That's dirty!\" So close to victory! Her shivers transferred over your body. You readied yourself to take the blow, and sacrifice your life for the other travelers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...When Wonder Woman winced harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd started laughing, shaking your unsteady platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" The magician snarled, ready to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat small lump within the girl's top bulged. It wiggled, and clawed its way to the neckline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom within Wondy's outfit, the toddler-ized Etrigan emerged - and grabbed the Amulet of First Magic, cooing with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred's axe crumbled to bits. The storm clouds gave way to blue. \"No! No, traitor! I am your - Arrrgh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis screaming continued as Diana plucked him up, and stuffed him into her chest. \"There we are, nice and comfy.\" She smiled to you, placing you and the demon down safely on a great castle's wall - as it shifted into a theme park's decoration, like they were before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark flew in, giving high-fives to the kids who helped - and headpats to those shaking from the battle. \"That's a job well done, you three! Giganta could learn a lesson from you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged. \"Hey, heroes come in every size, don't they?\" She gave your head a brief stroke, feeling its texture and touching her lip. \"And besides, we had a little mastermind behind it! Thanks for the cute necklace, Bruce!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-whatever!\" Bruce did his best to hide in the shadows of amusement park rides, beset by crowds of cooing admirers and shippers pushing him. \"Just bring us to normal with that jewel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn approached, grabbing the Amulet of First Magic. \"Not yet - we gotta send everyone back to their own universe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmid a fluffy of groans and sighs, everyone watched as the jewel shone brighter, and brighter. Everyone waved goodbyes. The last thing you remember is seeing Diana saluting you, as she slowly returned to normal size, and her adult proportions...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And, exactly like how you came in, you were sitting before a screen. Credits in washed-out colors flashed across it. You rubbed your temples, dizzy from the travel. Out the window, stars shone. Your cheek had a bruise By your feet lay action figures you're pretty sure you'd never bought - with Wonder Woman's figure larger than the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe never had a chance to play much with dolls. Hopefully, someone would be able to play with these...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scratched your head briefly. Was that adventure merely... your imagination?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but isn't imagination all we are?\" A voice asked. \"With the right spark, any fiction can become a living, breathing thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice came from your closet. You opened the door, and blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant Morrison blinked back.</span></div></div>",

Uh oh.....\" she thought and before she knew it, her mouth slowly opened up and at first, it was just a simple small hiccup which slightly shook the ground a few people screamed and Luara whispered \"Sorry....\"  but later on her worst fears realized,her stomach rumbling even louder  her mouth opened much wider and came out an very powerful burp. \"Uh oh buuuuuuurrrrrrppppppp!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe burp was very loud indeed. So loud that it caused many windows to shatter, the ground rumbling and shaking like crazy any objects such as cars to explode or their alarms to go off some parts of a building to collapse, people to cover their ears, and many other things. This goes on for a painful 12 seconds until it finally slowed down. Luara tomato red blushed in complete embarrassment and covered her mouth after witnessing the destruction below. \"Ahh..I'm so sorry everybody! Excuse me!\" she said still embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura then got up from the ground and wondered what to do next, but she was interrupted by a loud sound coming close to where she is. \"Huh?\" she wondered when the sources later revealed to be military forces who have come to capture her for destroying the city. \"I wondered what do these people want?\" she asked herself.</span></div></div>",

Sheltering behind a stack of crates, you watched the underwear clad giantess step over the running people and looking over her shoulder. \"Perhaps I can see what these tiny sprites feel like underneath me,\" she said as she braced herself against two buildings and lowered her rear end to the ground. Over a hundred people were caught beneath her descending ass and reduced to gory pancakes. The sound alone caused you to vomit, and you heard Laura giggle. \"Oh, it feels warm,\" she said. Rising to a crouch, you couldn't help but look at her almost nonexistent blood strained underwear she must have reduced the tiny crowds to dust rather than goo explaining why there was hardy any amounts of splattered bodies on her rear end. Then an even more horrifying thing happened, her eyes came to rest on you. \"Oh, a little one is watching me,\" she said as her huge hand reached out for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to run, but she easily reached you, a hand the size of a car wrapping around you and lifting you dozens of feet into the air. \"Hello there tiny one, can you tell me the name of this dream city I am currently in? Perhaps you are a piece of my mind in this dream world with me?\"  You were far too scared to speak, and Laura frowned at your silence. \"Hmph, perhaps I was wrong to pick you up and hold you like this. No matter, I shall explore my dream without your aid.\" Keeping you in her hand, Laura stood up, seemingly growing a few feet taller as she did so and causing her clothing to tighten on her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA roar came from her stomach, and Laura placed a hand on her belly. \"Oh dear, it seems my digestion has caught up with me.\"  Spying a building where many of her dream sprites were sheltering, the giantess stomped over and crouched down over the roof of the grocery store. \"Some sort of marketplace?\" She wondered, seeing the billboards of fruit and cereal. \"Not for much longer,\" she giggled. Placing you carelessly on a rooftop you nearly fell from, you  watched her pull the roof off and move her  undergarments over the hole. \"A little gift from me,\" she laughed as she let loose a monstrous explosion of gas from within herself. The fart filled the store in an instant, sending countless items and shoppers flying out into the open air. Windows shattered, and even the walls bulged out under the force of the released gas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my! That was impressive, even by the standards of a dream,\" Laura smiled. She felt her remaining clothing grow tighter on her once more. \"Am I gaining even greater height?! I love this dream,\" she exclaimed. \"Whatever shall I do next?\" She wondered. </span></div></div>",

While some tried to run away and hide, some just decided to wait and see what happens. Laura with a small smile upon her face suddenly got so close to the building that all they could see was her massive waist and her rather chunky thighs. Laura then got on her knees so she could see the people inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she  looked inside and saw people hiding behind desks and running down stairs, Half-Pint couldn't help but let out a earth-shaking giggle \"Don't worry I'm not going to hurt any of you.\" She whispered as she continued to slowly look around noticing all the strange shiny modern era devices and objects then back at the tiny people cowering in their cubicles or running around she doesn't care about them. She wants to play with the ones that are just standing there. Not being so rude. Laura wants them to get closer so she slid down so the people inside the window couldn't see. The people standing there was confused as where the young giantess went. They walked closer to the office window and looked for Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BOOOO! GIGGLE!! GOT YOU!\" Laura said as she got on her knees again and suddenly popped up out of nowhere with her hands up in a childish scary motion  and scared the living daylights out of the people some falling over or clutching their chests or even ears for protection as the mere sound of her voice was louder than ten jumbo jets combined Laura laughed at them, now that she can get a closer look, she sees that they all seem to be very attractive like little dolls she can pick up and cuddle and although part of her wanted to do that. Laura instead  made a kissy face to all the little people in front of her. She then puckered up her small pinkish lips and brought her lips closer to the window and kissed it. Leaving a huge wad of  saliva kiss mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden Laura's stomach rumbles shaking a few department store windows and she looks down at it and puts one hand over it  and she is surprised. \"Ohhh.....I didn't think I could get hungry in a dream.\" Regardless she thinks about what she can eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she eat? Does she do the unthinkable and eat the tiny  people. Or does she eat all the hotdog shaped vendors?</span></div></div>",

No the-they can't be. These look more like they might be made from pigs or cows and Pa always said whatever doesn't try to bite you back is completely harmless...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reaches down and grabs the hotdog vendor, scaring the crap out of the young blond  cook as he ran away. \"Hey what the AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! G-GIANT MONSTER!!\"  The giant young country  girl also called Half-Pint didn't pay any mind though it was almost as big as a small chicken wing to Laura. She takes a bite and although it was mostly metal. It was there still was other parts and it still tasted good.<br>\r\n\"Pffftttt Yuck! that's the metal part! I don't want to eat any of that!\" She said to herself as she actually spat out tiny shreds of metal the tiny,panicking people dove for cover to avoid getting swekered by the falling debris before dumping all the hundreds of steaming,juicy weiners into her wide open mouth and dropping the empty cart where it shattered to bits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLaura started to walk around the entire town. Gobbling every hot dog vendors she could see. After eating about fifteen of them Laura was starting to get thirsty. She thought maybe she would have to walk all the way towards a lake or a river. However Laura seemed to be lucky about it, for there was a truck driving through the streets like crazy driving a truck filled with ice cold Pepsi-Cola although Laura had no idea what it meant she could tell it was probably sort of like water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh can I have that? Whatever it is please?\"  Laura asks the driver as soon as he caught sight of the 10 year old giantess in his rear view mirror and stopped dead in his tracks giving the same reaction as all hot dog vendors did but she again paid no mind. However that only indicated the driver that he needs to quickly drive away. Although the truck was going fast, Laura was much faster. She quickly caught up with it <br>\r\n at a slow and steady pace and grabbed the truck with the driver holding onto the steering wheel for dear life and screaming his head off, she brought it up and ripped the back part where the gallons and gallons was contained  she then dropped the truck part to the ground not caring about the mean truck driver fortunately he survived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura ripped open the back with a thumb and index finger and dumped  all the liquid in the container into her mouth one big gulp. \" So Refreshing!\" She moaned happily before feeling her stomach gurgle and wobble \"Uh-oh................\" She thought as her soft brown eyes grew wide and  she felt a eerie sensation surging through her stomach all the way up through her mouth  Laura then let a loud burp \"BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRPPPPPP!!\" out of her mouth as it could be heard from all around shaking the whole city as  the people on the ground are screaming and holding on for support as for the young giantess...............</span></div></div>",

That was by far the most loudest and destructive burp in history. As young ten year old Laura Ingalls aka Half-Pint looked partly ashamed at first, but she eventually did accept that it wasn't that bad. She's simply playfully  rampaging through the town, who cares what they all think. She could run naked through the city and no one could do anything about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh, that was a loud one. I don't usually burp. I'm a lot more polite than that.\" Laura said to no one in particular. She just spoke out knowing that the small people could hear every word. \u201cBut you know, I'm having so much  fun so you can't really be angry at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughed for a while more,every bit of her annoying wild laughter causing more mild tremors for the tiny unnamed city and it's inhabitants below and literally scaring the shit of out everyone in the area. Who knew that such a nice little girl from the late 19th Century could let out a monstrous laugh and be so damn destructive? Laura however stopped,suddenly clutching her stomach area as she felt another burp coming up. Smiling to herself she quickly looked around. Scooting around planning to grab something before she started burping loudly again feeling that not all the limitless gallons of soda had not fully digested inside her tummy. After a few more steps she spotted a fancy businessman screaming his head off while trying to hide under some rubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura wanted to taunt him, but she didn't have time. Reaching down she grabbed him between her fingers before he could run. Her two fingers pinning his legs. Twisting him upside down as she hung him right at her mouth. He just kept screaming as Laura opened her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...no pl...please let me go!!\" He pleaded fearfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giggle! You're all just so cute...I could just eat you up or else keep you all as my little doll collection but I have something else in...uh oh I feel another burp coming on........\" Half-Pint groaned clutching her stomach with her free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen right to his face, Laura burped a massive breath. Not only being somehow louder then before, but pretty much destroying the man dangling from her massive tree trunk sized fingers as he looked really funny the way his hair was whipping around within the high wind and he mostly resembled a cartoon character the way he was constantly screaming but paying no mind Laura continued this burp for about five seconds. Once she was done she wiped her mouth to get the left over saliva off. She looked at the man she plucked and burped at. He looked pretty dead, not to mention completely covered with her saliva. After laughing at the sight she merely tossed the man to the side. Why would she want to play with a broken toy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe feels another coming up. Looking around she looks for her new toy. Spoting a young teenage blond girl scared out of her wits near by she smiled. This young chick looked like the typical city folk she often heard about from the simple country folk back home with all those fancy clothes, high heels, thick makeup and of course running around  like a prissy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pa and Ma always said those certain high rising city folk were weird,the way they lord over everyone else! Maybe I can even out the odds!\" Laura said as she rubbed her hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde girl screamed once she saw the gigantic little girl coming for her and took off like a bullet but unfortunately didn't get far, with her fingers coming for her, she got lifted off the ground. Up to her face the blonde screamed at the little  country girl\u2019s gigantic face. She tries to wiggle her way out, she couldn't move anyway at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhhhh please...please Miss Giant...l-let me go!\" The tiny girl began openly crying and pleading for her life. But Half-Pint giggled loudly causing another earth quake shaking her head enjoying this wild dream where she was far larger than anything on Earth more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you mean ole little prissy girl you all think you're better than us simple folks from the country.....you're gonna hate this!\u201d Laura said with a innocent smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which will make me really happy!\u201d The girl  kept screaming, however Laura didn't care anymore. Her stomach rumbled as she felt another one coming up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buuuuurrrrrrrrrrrrppppppp!!\" Once more the ground shook and even more car alarms went off  and windows exploded with a big smile she let her burp come up and hit the girl, not as much as it hit the man but still pretty hard. During her loudest belch the girl didn't stop screaming. It actually being much louder than even she expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura finished and saw the girl still hanging there, still alive and beyond terrified. Good thing she didn't try to burp her to death like she did the businessman. \u201cOhh my, you're pretty sturdy aren't you?  I'd thought all you uptown girls would break easier than babies would.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, let me go! Let me go you brat!\u201d The girl yelled in complete fear. Laura frowned at the tiny teen's rude  comment, which sealed her fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're very rude you know that? Just like my old rival Nellie back home! All I want to do is play around with you all! So you want me to let you go, fine. I'll let you go _____________\u201d</span></div></div>",

I-it is! It's the little girl Emily from Little bear!\" You choked out breathlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment,she was fast asleep in her hot pink, long-sleeved, floor-length nightgown with a blue bow, frilly white collar and cuffs and a pink headband as you couldn't help but think how incredibly adorable she really was,in her completely hand drawn cartoon format and as she snored softly,the whole bed shook like crazy and you had to latch onto the bottom of her night gown just to prevent from flying off and hitting the floor! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you decided to make literal contact with the massive 7 year old giantess but where do you start? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\">On a calm day in some unnamed city in the United States of America in the year of 1991 A.D., people went about their day-to-day lives. Children rode to school, adults to work, and cheap businesses were trying to sell their low-quality products to unsuspecting customers. However, the arrival of a \u2018larger-than-life\u2019 individual would promptly shatter by that livelihood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA puff of purple smoke suddenly manifested in the middle of the city, swirling and rising ominously like a storm cloud. The daily traffic halted and dozens of civilians pointed and gawked at the unnatural phenomenon. The fog grew to encompass the space of a city block, blinding anyone unfortunate enough to be caught in it. Eventually, the opaque mist dissipated, but what took its place was equally, if not more, attention-grabbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-where am I?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question came from what took the place of the smoke. It was a giant eleven-year-old girl \u2013 fifty feet, to be specific \u2013 whose name was Hermione Jean Granger. Her brown eyes widened in shock as she was trying to process her new situation. Last time she checked, she was back at home in the United Kingdom of Great Britain, practicing a few spells before attending the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Apparently, she screwed up a couple spells, because now she was teleported to the other side of the pond and towered over the average human by almost tenfold. Thankfully, her clothes grew along with her, so this was slightly less embarrassing than it could have been. The prepubescent took a cautious left step forward in the narrow, crowded streets, taking care not to crush the frightened Muggle populace. As she walked, her feet formed print-shaped craters in the dark gray pavement and she could not stop herself from crushing a few cars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cI hope the owners have insurance.\u201d</i> Hermione thought, wondering if any company of that nature would cover damages caused by giantesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe puny humans continued their frantic fleeing from the adolescent titaness, spouting insults like \u2018Monster!\u2019 and \u2018Freak!\u2019 and her. Hermione\u2019s lips quivered and her face began to redden as she made an honest effort to assure the masses that she had no intentions to harm them, but they fell on deaf ears and hysteria only increased amongst the crowds. One of the scared denizens even suggested calling in the military, a sentiment shared by fellow chaotic huddles. Hermione was about to try to calm them down, but was interrupted by a monstrous growl that echoed throughout the city. The cute witch clutched her belly in pain, assaulted by a hunger that matched her new size. She shifted focus away from the screaming mob and on sating her nigh-crippling famished state, continuing her accidental rampage through the generic city, this time in search of sustenance. More property damage was caused on her way to her desired location: a closed McDonalds. Seeing no other way to gain access to the diabetic-inducing delicacies inside without essentially destroying the building anyway, Hermy simply opted to tear off the roof and sit it on the parking lot before stuffing her hands inside to grasp the feast of fast food. After scooping up several handfuls and shoveling them into her mouth, the entire restaurant was now barren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mega-sized magic user rubbed her now full tummy, smiling sweetly. However, eating all of that food had an unintended side effect. The literal tons of air that the Brunette Brit swallowed along with her meal mixed with the digesting nourishment and boiling stomach acid, forming a maelstrom of gas that made her belly growl once again. Said maelstrom also ascended through a valve at the top of the stomach, making a bulge in her esophagus that shoved aside her chest organs on its way out. Hermione clasped her right hand over her mouth to contain the explosion of gas, but it was too powerful to be held back, and the wave of foul oxygen shortly puffed out her cheeks before blowing away her hand and leaving her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><i>\u201c<span class=\"cgreen\"><u><b>*BBBBBBUUUUUUUURRRRRRRPPPPP!*</b></u></span>\u201d{/i }</i></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione\u2019s red lips quaked from the force of her beastly belch. It created a shockwave that collapsed and blew away the Golden Arch sign in front of the restaurant, as well as the restaurant itself and several other buildings. The exhaust of air shattered all of the windows in the entire city. Trees had their leaves blown off, car alarms went off, and most cars were turned over. Everyone within a one-mile radius went permanently deaf as his or her eardrums immediately ceased working and they tried covering their ears to block out the sound to no avail  Even the very ground itself shook before the power of Hermione\u2019s apocalyptic eructation, as her head was swinging uncontrollably from side to side and tremors led to spider web-shaped cracks in the road. The windstorm that shot out of her mouth flung dozens of people into the air. However, the worst aspect of the booming burp was the <i>smell</i>; a sickly jade haze drifted out of her maw, and people was puking their guts out, knocked unconscious, or outright killed when they inhaled it through her mouths or nostrils. The loud burp clocked in at ten seconds or more, and Hermione highly embarrassed slapped both her hands over her mouth when it ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>WHOOPS\u2026! OHHH MY GOODNESS! I\u2019M SO TERRIBLY SORRY ABOUT THAT! EXCUSE ME, EVERYBODY! I DIDN\u2019T WANT TO LET THAT OUT, BUT I JUST COULDN\u2019T KEEP IT DOWN!</b>\u201d The witch loudly apologized with a shocked expression while her face blushed crimson like a tomato in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione surveyed the effects of her Burp-quake, but her reaction wasn\u2019t as horrified as one would expect in fact it went from highly embarrassed to downright creepy,mischievous smile. She saw the bodies that littered the streets next to the rubble of once multi-storied structures, though she was appalled and horrified by the monstrous disaster she caused  a now dark thought popped into her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cHmm, so just one burp did all of this. I wonder what other things I can do at this size.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething shuffled on the ground beneath her, pulling her out of her pondering. She looked down to see a man, barely eighteen years old, crawling out of the wreckage. He looked up to see a right hand come down on him and pull his heavily injured body off the ground. A lustful smile from a girl with long, bushy brown hair greeted the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello cutie!\u201d She opened up her palm slowly smiling innocently as the tiny teenager curled into a tiny ball<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh God, please don\u2019t kill me!\u201d He shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d The giant British witch whispered tenderly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man stared in disbelief until Hermione pulled up the front of her black skirt and yanked out her panties. Then, she dropped him into said panties, trapping him next to her closed vagina. Hermione felt a wave of pleasure wash over her, and she decided to walk to a part of the city that was not destroyed her footsteps again causing mild tremors and leaving shoe shaped craters in the roads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A few minutes later\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione arrived at a point near the edge of the city to sit and play around with her new toy, near a relatively intact mall, and the presence of several tanks and helicopters met with her. Leading them was a general who gave the colossal witch a scornful scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFire!\u201d She ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer forces complied, launching a hail of missiles, bullets, bombs, and grenades at the fifty-foot soon-to-be schoolchild. Upon collision, Hermione was engulfed in a multitude of explosions. The general looked on at the results and smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that smirk faded when she saw the smoke clearing. The firepower had left not a pile of ash, but a giantess who was rendered to a simple T-Shirt and underwear. Fortunately, the man in her panties was unhurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, some of my clothes are tougher than I thought.\u201d She mused. Then, she gazed down at the antagonistic army and smirked. \u201cNow, it\u2019s my turn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione clapped her hands together, creating a sonic boom that knocked a trio of helicopters out of the sky. Thankfully, the pilots ejected themselves before the downed choppers hit the ground. A tank was the next target, as Hermione ran and kicked it into the air like a soccer ball. She was about to repeat the maneuver with another tank but the brunette accidentally tripped on it, and fell butt-first onto the mall. Though people filled the mall, no one was hurt for some reason. On the other hand, an unlucky soul(who looked a little older than the other boy)ended up stuck in her butt somehow. Another feeling of euphoria overtook Hermione, which was even better than having the man in the front of her underwear. Therefore, she released that person from the front and pulled out the one in her booty, bringing him up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhat are you going to do to me?\u201d The second man asked in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giggle answered him and he received repeated kisses from her puckered cherry lips. He tried to struggle and fight against her but even without a magic wand Hermione was relentless and her grip like the incredibly strong jaws of a snapping turtle After the fifth smooch, Hermione changed tactics and chose to cuddle him against her left cheek, smothering him in her somewhat pasty skin. A few minutes passed before that stopped too and she initiated her next method of torment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCoochie Coochie Coo!\u201d She said as she playfully tickle-tortured him stroking his stomach with her index finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the dire situation, he could not help but laugh and wiggle in response to this. \u201cPlease stop! Hehehe\u2026 I can\u2019t take it anymore! Hahaha!\u201d He begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione shook her head horizontally. \u201cTickle, tickle, tickle!\u201d She taunted as she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the military was pondering how they were going to defeat this massive \u2018little witch\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m open to suggestions.\u201d The general admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the soldiers gave an option\u2026</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So, let me get this straight. You want us to power her up by feeding her so she burps and damages the city even more?\" The general asked, getting a little upset. The soldier shook his head. His idea had worked on creatures at home, like stray cats or bunnies, so why wouldn't it work on a little girl?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, if we could lead her away, we get hit her with stronger bombs and get her away from the citizens, it may be the only way to defeat her. Can't we at least attempt it?\" The soldier said, standing up straight. The general thought about it for a minute. The other soldiers stayed quiet. Though they didn't like the idea, they silently agreed that it might be the only way. However, they needed the general's permission on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, we'll give it a shot.\" The general said. He spoke into his walkie talkie and told them to bring food, a LOT of it. While they waited, they kept an eye on Hermione, who was still having fun with the little man she was holding onto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought the man was really cute, and didn't feel like letting him go so soon after getting him. She decided to save him for later, so she opened her panties and dropped him in with the other male. She closed her panties up and patted it. She could feel both of them squirming in there, and it felt amazing. She turned towards the soldiers. A couple took a step back when their eyes met.<br>\r\n\"So, which one of you cute men is next? Are there any volunteers? If you volunteer, I might be kind to you. I might even have something 'special' planned.\" She said, winking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! The food isn't here yet!\" The general said, gritting his teeth. One of the younger soldiers piped up, saying they could volunteer and distract her. \"Are you sure?\" The general asked, looking at him. The soldier nodded and ran towards Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I volunteer, oh beautiful queen!\" The soldier yelled. Hermione took a giant step forward and picked him up. He was raised up to her face. Her breath smelled nice and warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good little man, because you volunteered, I'll give you special treatment.\" She said and placed him in her mouth to hold. She then took her shirt and bra off. She dropped them to the ground and pulled the soldier out. She pushed him against her breast softly. \"Go ahead and drink little man.\" She said. The soldier hesitated, then did as she said. As he sucked on her nipple, she moaned a little. She then pulled him away and kissed him. \"I think I'll put you in another place where no one has ever been to.\" She opened her panties in the back and dropped him in. Hermione put her bra back on, just as she smelled something tasty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to see a helicopter holding a large bag full of food. She took a step forward and reached for it. The helicopter moved away, making her a little mad. She followed it out of town. She eventually couldn't take it anymore and jumped. She grabbed it and made it crash. The pilot got out and ran away, not that she cared at the moment. She only cared that she had tasty food. She started to gobble everything down. Almost immediately after she started, she gave a huge burp. Suddenly stronger missiles came down on her. They threw everything they had at her. They even threw a couple nukes at her. Once they smoke cleared, the army was eagerly waiting to see the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, once things cleared up, they saw Hermione still eating, as if she never even noticed she was being attacked.<br>\r\n\"You have got to be kidding me! Can nothing stop this beast?!\" The general yelled. Unfortunatly, she should have kept quiet because as soon as he said that, Hermione stopped moving and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in Hogwarts did you just say? Did you just call me a beast?\" Hermione said, quickly losing her temper. She gave a large burp, making everyone fall down. Hermione then stomped over and stepped on the general. He yelled with pain, however, she didn't care. Not after what he just called her. She picked him up and burped in his face. \"Do you like that? You're the one who fed me, so consider this your 'reward'\" she said, giggling.</span></div></div>",

I know this because my kid\u2019s a massive follower of the series(both the books and films)  She\u2019s a witch,no really she is one who can perform powerful magic and she must\u2019ve grown to this size because of it. anyway this girl Hermione is obsessed with books,completely loves them so we could lure her to the Public Library in the heart of downtown  and then ambush her.\u201d The soldier suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe General thought that this was ridiculous, but given that the giantess had decimated their forces so easily, any option would be better than nothing. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Hermione was feeling in a very childish playful mood and continued her innocent tickling of the tiny man (who is going to be called Willy). All the while, she was playfully taunting him\" Tickle,tickle little Muggle * giggle*\" She sweetly taunted as she gently stroked his stomach as he thrashed and screamed with wild laughter  as he begged her to stop to the point he\u2019s about to wet himself <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha Please No More! I-I'm going to soil my clothes if yo-Hahahaha you don't stop Ahahahaha!\" This got the Big Brit to ponder her actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh I actually kind of feel really bad for him. This must be so humiliating. This\u2026 this is wrong. I shouldn't treat him this way but I can't help it......\u201d The brunette considered stopping her tickle torture, but there was something driving her to keep at it. It was a newfound sense of power that her giant stature granted her, these innocent people\u2026 these muggles were utterly helpless against her dominance, and it felt great! This thrill of subjugation was so strong that she can\u2019t force herself to stop, so she keeps at it until he finally falls unconscious in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh\u2026? Hello? Little man? Ohhhh Oh No......\u201d Hermione thought horrified growing highly concerned and worried that she might have literally killed him by tickling him too hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she heard some flares being shot into the sky. Out of sheer curiosity, the titaness walked in their direction. Eventually, she reached one of the city\u2019s largest libraries. She was completely enamored by it and became really excited as she stared through the windows at all the hundreds of books, literally scaring everyone out of the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Hermione was distracted, a platoon of soldiers held their weapons at her. \u201cLet the man go!\u201d One of them demanded, referring to Willy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione turned to the group and shooed them away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I won't! I was merely having a bit of fun with him he's in no real danger.\" She protested <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Miss....who was it again Hannah....Heather? Whoever you are!\" The female general spoke through a megaphone \"This boy needs medical attention he's in a state of shock!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No he's merely unconscious but I'm taking good care of him no harm will come to him now please leave me alone!\" She ordered in her usual bossy know-it-all tone However, the general refused and opened fire on the young giant witch <br>\r\n\"She's not cooperating quickly OPEN FIRE!!\" <br>\r\n But of  course the colossal girl with the bushy brown hair  was not harmed by all the bullets,bombs and missiles a few did sting her though but these military blokes from the States were annoying her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you! I said I wouldn't harm him and still you attack me! You all need to be taught a lesson. ....\" She saw a nearby soda truck and a crude idea popped into her head. Hermione grabbed it and gulped down the soda inside. Immediately, she felt the effects that soft drinks tend to have on people as her stomach rumbled loudly making the ground shake  and emitted an enormous eructation that blasted away the entire army. Unfortunately, the big burp also did massive damage to the library, upsetting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh that's really bad I really wanted to read some of those books too!\" Hermione groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe booming burp was loud enough to wake up Willy. He was still scared of Hermione and once more tried to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't be scared little one! No harm will come to you. My name is Hermione Granger and I'm really,really sorry about before I was just having a bit of fun with you, you understand? I didn't mean any harm alright what's your name?\" She informed and introduced herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was still unsure, but Hermione eventually gained his trust by tenderly kissing him her puckered up pink lips covering his body completely he struggled faintly as she tenderly kissed him then broke away blushing tomato red<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name\u2019s Willy.\u201d He said and  the giant 11 year old witch smiled showing her braces <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Willy,Once more I apologize for all that tickle-torture I put you through I was merely playing with you but now that I know you're alright I would like to..........</span></div></div>",

Well the tremors were big booms in between each other, and they intensely in size and damage  as they got closer and closer. \"RUN... it's a giant creature of terror and destruction.\" Said one person just as the people took one look and all fled in terror. \"And it's...It's... it's a.... Girl?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are right on that, the giant creature that is coming right out behind a building is a nearly 50ft 11 year old girl named Hermione Granger only wearing her traditional British clothes or rather dressed as this: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fs-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com%2Foriginals%2F3c%2F4d%2F4b%2F3c4d4b5ccacd9b3fdcf3d518caf3703f.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinterest.com%2Favalonbearneces%2Fhogwarts%2F&amp;docid=ER35yguvRRWnbM&amp;tbnid=XxuO894WE2YdmM%3A&amp;vet=1&amp;w=816&amp;h=1016&amp;bih=662&amp;biw=1366&amp;q=hermione%20granger%201st%20year&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi96oOi76jRAhWBdyYKHZwOB5YQMwhHKBEwEQ&amp;iact=mrc&amp;uact=8\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=htt...</a> give or take she was wearing aboard the Hogwarts Express at the start of the first HP film how she grew to this height, well she and her parents were taking a vacation in the States right before the eleven year old would eventually start her education at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry while her parents were in one of the numerous  American Muggle shops Hermione chose to practice a few magic spells and charms far away from the norm and unknowningly created one that managed to increase her regular height and size a hundred times fold \"What? Oh No! I...I'm growing!\" She cried out as soon enough there was a bright flash of light and next thing she knew here she was peeking nervously behind one of Manhattan's tallest buildings luckily her clothes remained intact or this would be highly embarrassing for the soon to be 'Brightest Witch of the Age'  and slowly she began to make her descend looking down where she was stepping and at  the screaming,running tiny Muggle citizens her face gloomy yet highly worried for both their and her own well being her very footsteps  caused powerful tremors also broke apart the pavement like tissue paper leaving massive foot sized craters in the concrete and even flipped over a few cars. Some even exploded when they come in contact with her feet Hermione blushed and gasped as she realized the damage she was causing \"Oops sorry! I'm terribly sorry about that!\" She muttered but even the sound of her voice caused mild tremors \"Oh this is horrible and I haven't even begun my school year yet what am I going to do now?\" She wondered <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow before we continue, do you wanna explore how she grew, or just continue on?</span></div></div>",

This happened for several minutes before Hermione's tummy begins to rumble loudly shaking  the ground andwhich is not good for any poor soul that usually sees a giant. \"Ohh... I am soooooo hungry, but what can possibly I eat that can satisfy my stomach?\"  She wondered as she definitely didn't want to eat a human that would count as totally barbaric!  Taking a chance to quell her raging stomach rumbling louder than a tank the giant 11 year witch slowly makes her way  to a nearby McDonalds where people were running out of the building just as she rips the roof right off the building. She then picks up anything she can grab and proceeds to devour all of it right before their very eyes hundreds upon hundreds of burgers of various sizes,fries,mcnuggets,and shakes and soda were shoveled into the young witch's mouth  \"Mmmmmm delicious American food is just as good as British!\" She thought while the employees were panicking like crazy \"Holy crap a giant monster! And she's eating all of the merchandise, guess I am out of a job for good, but who cares it's a lousy job anyway and the pay's poor!\" Which was said by one employee just as he runs away followed by the others trampling over one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat unfortunately doesn't satisfy her at all, and Hermione proceeds to  head for another restaurant nearby, her footsteps causing powerful tremors to most of Manhattan a Subway, which again people run out of the building screaming for their lives unable to try and calm  them down  Hermione uses both of her hands and picks out some sandwiches and takes a bite out of them a single bite in fact soon enough there isn't a piece of bread crumb left However though, unknowningly to the giant girl a tiny human was picked up in the chaos and it was a man he tried unsuccessfully to get her attention but it was in vain as he was tossed into her mouth along with the numerous tiny Footlongs over 100 of them to be exact \"Oh no... someone help me.....I am going to be eaten, AAAHHHH!!!!\" He said just as he was covered in tons of sandwiches and he was then inside her mouth, and then he hits her tongue then slides off her tongue,down her throat and right into her stomach, where he unfortunately dies a horrible death in the pit of Hermione's massive stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione then realizes something.... was horribly wrong with a odd taste in her mouth and she gasped loudly that she just ate a actual human being \"Oh no....What have I done?\"  How does it really  tastes to her though? </span></div></div>",

And that...that poor person I...I....\"  Hermione groaned as the very nasty thought of her eating a human was beyond replusive  and now she is wanting to throw up so hard but can't force herself to. However, she was going to get more than what she bargained for as she begins to feel something building up in her stomach the numerous gas exploding in her gut as she clutched her raging stomach in agony \"Oh no.... Please.... not at this time.... I really don't.....\" she said as she tried to cover her mouth from what is about to come up. \"NO!!!!\" She gasped in her very head... and then a tremendous burp then erupted from her mouth \"Buuuuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrppppp!\" Her eyes closed and head swinging from side to side uncontrollably   all of the young witch's worst fears were coming true  as the burp was so loud and powerful, that it emitted shockwaves from her mouth, that proceeds to obliterate parts of the city as if it was from a Michael Bay film people screamed as they tried covering their ears to no avail. But that wasn't the worst part as car alarms went off and windows from numerous department stores and skyscrapers exploded plus the ground shook violently as people fought for balance  be all that happens however, as now she quickly covered her mouth with one hand utterly shocked \"Ohhh My....Excuse Me!!\" She shouted, as tears appeared in her eyes and she attempted to apologize for her dire horrible actions there was a fleet of tanks and planes,jets and helicopters swarming the streets and Hermione gasped as she was becoming surrounded by tons of the military that comes in all shapes and sizes. From tanks, to jets, to helicopters, to battleships, to soldiers, hell... even to giant robots that are now sent to detain the giant witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your reign of terror is over now monster... either surrender to us or face the consequences...\" they ordered her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

Deciding it at least had to be warmer in the castle you slipped in through the slightly open doors, immediately slipping into the shadow of a suit of armour when you see it's full of giants most of them kids around age 11 or 12 in black robes milling about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce things quiet down you take a moment to try come up with a plan of action: you knew you would need to get assistance from at least one of the giants, you knew you couldn't survive at this size by yourself, but you also knew trying to get help from them when grouped together will get you nothing but crushed, so needed to find a way to get the attention of one by themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the coast clear you decide to head for the steps, thinking it would be easier to find a single person where there was less traffic, heaving yourself up and over each step with some effort. By the time you reached the top you were panting, needing a break but glad you had done it. The happiness was short lived as you heard the thunderous noise of more of the giants coming, both their footfalls as well as their general chatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Hiding between the banisters of the staircase you were lucky the giants were apparently oblivious to anything that wasn't in front of them, or in your case anything below them. When everyone was gone you breathe a sigh of relief but then a enormous shadow appears over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'\"Hello, what do we have here?\"' you nearly jump when you hear someone speak, more so because you're pretty sure it's directed at you. Turning slowly you see a girl with thick, bushy, brown hair dressed in the black robes with a red trim and her arms full of heavy looking books,she's most definitely talking and looking right at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'\"Um hi, I'm Henry. Sorry about this but who are you and where am I?'\" you ask, trying not to be rude to the  young giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'\"I'm Hermione Granger and this is Hogwarts, located in ... well somewhere in Scotland they weren't exactly specific'.......\" she answers and you just stare at her in shock<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'\"Scotland? But I was in Maine like an hour ago, I was also normal size an hour ago'\" you say, mostly to yourself but apparently she heard you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'\"Maine? That's in America isn't it? Wait! Oh my, you're... you're non magical aren't you?\" she asks with a frown on her face <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'\"Non magical?'\" You repeat arching a eyebrow \"What do you mean by that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Henry it means you're what we call a Muggle or nonmagical person this castle you're in is called Hogwarts, and it's a school for witches and wizards. I should have realised from your clothes you weren't a student but getting shrunk feels like a advanced spell or curse that wouldn't happen around here.\" she answers as she put down the books at her side and bent down to study you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait? Wizard,witches? You're....you can do magic? This is crazy...then what am I saying...... I don't care if you're from outer space! Can you help me? Mostly my size but probably my being here too?\" you ask, pleading with fate this girl can help you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione shrugs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well normally that would be a problem as we of magical nature aren't allowed to help people of nonmagical origins but I can...I will  try. I first need to put my books away, then after lunch I have class and then a free period where I could go to the library and try find an answer to your problem alright?\"  she asks and you nod vigorously despite her sort of bossy like tone she seemed really friendly and trustworthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, then lets go...\" But she stops and looks embarrassed, while you most likely look confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Hermione?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um it'd be quicker if you just came with me, can I pick you up?\"  she asks without looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes anything to make things easier for us both.\" you answer and she smiles before picking you up, her fingers the size of tree trunks gently wrap around your waist before she places you on top of her books and continues to the common room, meanwhile you watch in awe at the magical odds and ends Hermione either ignores or is used to after a couple of years in a magical school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she reaches the stairs leading to the dorm she hesitates, then when she looks down you know she can see the question on your face <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The stairs are jinxed so boys can't enter the girl's dorm. Hopefully you'll be too small to be detected but I don't want to fall and accidentally crush you on the way down.\" she explains in a worried tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is probably the safest place for me, let's take the chance.\" you answer and your enthusiasm seems to pass on to her and Hermione straightened her spine and upper body and steps onto the stairs, making her way to her dorm without issues. Once there she drops the books on her bed and places you softly on a lone pillow and goes to grab the next ones she'll need, meanwhile you sit on her pillow where she left you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do now?\" you ask curiously <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Hermione begins<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is her plan?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) She plans to leave you here and come back at free period, thinking the less chances for people to see you the better<br>\r\n2) She thinks the best place for you to be safe is with her, so plans to keep you with her for the next few hours, be that in a pocket or on a part of her body is up to you/her.</span></div></div>",

And who are your friends?\" She brought you closer to her billboard face <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah school's not so bad except I'm horrible at math and science as for friends yeah I have a few and mostly we just go out and play baseball,ride bikes and stuff baseball is a sport where you.....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what it is and bicycles as well.\"  Hermione interrupted you calmly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo...you're familiar with nonmagical things like baseball?\" You ask taken back <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah as a matter of fact both of my parents are nonmagical or as you would call them dentists people who fix teeth I grew up around Muggles-oh sorry I mean nonmagical people! I'm sorry Henry I don't mean to keep saying that it's not usual used to offense people of your status I'll just call you by your real name Henry if you don't mind but anyway yes I'm sort of familiar with your sport of baseball and a few other things as well alright you described a bit of yourself to me now it's my turn as you can tell I love reading books and studying all the time you'll hardly find me doing anything else on a daily basis so now that we know a bit about each other....\" Hermione giggled <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this mean we can be friends?\" You ask nervously as you told a little white lie earlier you weren't that great at making friends at your school but she nodded eagerly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!

Go ahead.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said this place Warthog was a magical school? For real? You're not joking this isn't a school for regular British children? I mean I watched television and...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First it's called Hogwarts and yes it is indeed a school of magic where young witches and wizards learn all about magic and the Wizarding World in general or the hidden society of magical people who remain hidden from the nonmagical popluation of London for centuries.\" She carefully explained <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah anyway do you think you can show me a bit of this magic?\" You asked eagerly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Hermione arched a eyebrow \"Show you a bit of magic?\" As she took out a stick from her robes pointing it at you but then decided against it \"No,no I shouldn't!\" She shook her head <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bu...but why not?\" You asked confused as she sat back down on the bed facing you with a somber face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remember what I told you before about witches and wizards hiding from the nonmagical popluation right? Well that's sort of the reason we're not allowed to use magic in front of Muggles unless it's a dire emergency or very important that's the number one rule degreed by the Ministry of Magic who makes all the laws here in the Wizarding World! So you see Henry as much as I'd like to show you I can't I could get into serious trouble,I could be expelled....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand okay bad idea! I apologize Hermione.\" You reply feeling a little disappointed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't feel bad Henry I did say we can do a bit of magic in front of nonmagical people if it's a emergency and considering your current tiny state it actually is!

Thinking it would be safer to sleep on her bed rather than the dresser in case Hermione or more importantly anyone else came up you jumped the gap between the dresser and the bed, liking the springiness of the mattress before finding a spot where her pillows met the bed, curled up and took a nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're sleep was interrupted by what felt like a strong tremor, quickly you shot up and prepared to run for safety, before remembering where you were, the red panty clad ass helping to speed the process up in that regard. You couldn't see anything past Hermione's  even for a twelve year old's sizable rear but you guessed it was quite late, especially given the brunette appeared to have forgotten you.

Honestly why would anyone want to transformed into a pair of girl's undergarments?\" She said in disgust yet looked down at you with a small smile \"But anyway let's continue shall we?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Hermione found something that sounded like what happened to you, but there was a problem...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was it?</span></div></div>",

Any strange objects you normally wouldn't see in your everyday life?\" She asked curiously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No if I did I would have made sure to stay away from it.\" You replied \"Boy I could really go for a cheeseburger right now..\" As you rubbed your stomach <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheeseburger.....Ohhhh Oh dear I completely forgot you must be starving aren't you?

Hurry Henry get into the bed and hide!\" She cried you did as she ordered just as a dozen of other young British girls dressed in similar black robes came racing in giggling and chattering up a storm none of them seemed to notice Hermione and it was oblivious to you she really didn't mingle with girls her age that often a few did say hi though it was time for bed anyway as Hermione climbed into it pulled back the curtains of her four poster bed hiding her and you from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I would be sleeping somewhere else like on the dresser?\" You ask as the giant girl softly set you on her pillow she turned over to look at you calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too dangerous Henry what if you fell off or worse?

On saying that it did seem safer to be in that snug looking crevice than bouncing around in Hermione's underwear, so pushing off the undergarment you dove in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione had made it from the Great Hall to the main moving staircases when she felt an intrusion followed by a warm sense of fullness, she supressed a moan as she felt  Henry move inside her(now she knew it was him who else could it be) she needed to get him OUT now. She quickens her pace but that just quickens her heartrate and in turn the squeezing of her inner muscles with the shrunken boy inside her, getting pulled deeper as she runs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry found himself in a world of musky darkness, the walls around him pulsed rhythmically, at times gently squeezing hm... at other times not so gentle. Still, despite the slick goo forming everywhere he knew there was little he could do to get out, it seemed Hermione was both his doom, prison and saviour, all in one. Still you made the most of it, rubbing against anything you could feel and hoping the good will out weigh the bad. If the loud moans were anything to go by it appeared to be working, as well as the increase of salty goo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione reached the bathroom, found a empty stall, sat on the closed lid and pulled down her skirt. Now free of obstructions she slid her fingers in, in the hope of finding Henry and pulling him out, but it was clear both that he was too far in/ small for her to reach, but the act itself was heating her up as well as causing her to drip nasty stuff inside her unmentionable place While not really thinking too much abut Henry, at least not in a literal way she began to piston her fingers between her legs, massaging her swelling bosom with her free hand and letting all the tension building inside her have a release. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Ohhhhhhhh please stop moving! Although it tickles a bit it's still very unpleasant ...ohhhhhhhhh.........</b>\" She lets out a loud moan and cums, hard, when she regains her focus she sees a small, familiar looking boy soaked to the skin and laying in her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry groans in pain as he felt like he'd been in a car compressor, and the light in front of him at least means that he was free from Hermione's inner world.

This won't happen again.\" she promises<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw really, I was going to volunteer.\" you grin and watch the nearly 13 year old go even redder \"As long as I'm like this I don't mind being your little doll, in fact it might be kind of fun.\" you realise your own cheeks were starting to heat but didn't care, Hermione seemed really nice and was cute, plus it felt weird but good being pressed against her chest last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you, we'll see.\" she smiles playfully and pokes you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, can you leave one of your books here so I don't die of boredom? preferably one where the pages don't weight more than I do?.\" you ask and she laughs at the playfully poke and does it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh Hermione stop it!\" You cry out but she giggles cutely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhh blimey this is so fun *giggle* POKE,POKE!\" Finally she quits and pulls you to her beaming innocent face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I think I still carry my Year 1 books in my trunk now where is it again awwww here.......\" she places you on the pillow before scrambling to the end of her bed \"Oh here it is'!\" she says happily, placing a book open in the centre of the bed \"You remember what I told you last night don't you? I can't show you magic,I wish I could though.....but you can do potions even as a muggle. Would you like to do that?\" She asked eagerly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Hermione, it does sound particularly interesting thanks.\" you say with a smile as you turn away so she can get changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back at lunch and we can share some food then again at dinner. But until then I'll bring you up some food from breakfast in the Great Hall.\" she says now fully dressed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think we can revisit the 'stay here' plan in the near future, I'd go mad trapped in one room all day everyday.\" you ask and she has to think about it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'd love to but I do have a busy schedule Henry,school work you know but whenever I get any rare moments I'll come up here alright?\" she answers you nodded and she told you she would see you later before picking up her bag and leaving the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo let's take a little time skip, but what events should the next chapter focus on? Getting you back to normal, or how things stand with you and Hermione?</span></div></div>",

Guess she wasn't kidding when she said she had a extremely busy schedule!\" You mutter dangling your feet off the really massive dresser of the 12 year old know-it-all witch true to her word Hermione would occasionally pop in just to grab a book or two but at least she would check up on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Henry how are you doing?\" She asked grabbing a really large book and pausing to beam sweetly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I guess just you know really bored being stuck here.\" You replied truthfully she shook her head <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I apologize Henry I wish I can take you with me again but I can't there's too much of a risk you could be spotted and I want to be the only one to know of your existence but please remain calm as soon as I find a rare moment I'll come back up here so we can spend some quality time together. I really want to learn more about you.\" She also admitted truthfully <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" You replied and she looked at you with solid compassion and sympathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's really boring here doing nothing but hmmmm what can I do to make your stay here more interesting......\" She thought then pulled out something from her bag showing it to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here this is a useful charm I just discovered in one of my books it's basically a small sphere or circle of light that constantly changes color it's not much but it should keep you entertained for a while I wish I could do more but...ohhhhh I'm late! Sorry Henry I have to go but here....\" As she tossed the small sphere of light into the air and it began floating around turning from red to green,from blue to yellow and the giant girl picks you up gently giving you another kiss on your whole body \"I'll be back as soon as I can alright?\" She whispers <br>\r\ntenderly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay thank you Hermione sorry if I'm a bother or a distraction to you....\" But she shook her head <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you're not! I actually like having you here to keep me company whenever I'm in my dorm room now I'll see you a bit later.\" As she stood to her full terrifying height and walked to the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione did appear every once and a while and the two of you spoke for a while(basically about five or ten minutes)before she had to leave again she asked you all about life in America and you explained how ordinary Muggles lived day by day although she was familiar with nonmagical people you were still able to surprise her with interesting tidbits <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh that sounds very interesting Henry and fascinating!\" Hermione exclaimed as you explained how you went on your first ever plane ride at first scared to death 5000 feet in the air but then you grew to like it \"That must have been terrifying at first to you! But I'm glad you eventually grew to like flying on a airplane.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah it was but enough about me can you tell me a bit more about yourself? I mean surely there's a lot more to you than just constantly studying and knowing magical things?\" You said she gave you a puzzling glance <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why would you say that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I can actually see a whole 'another person' beneath that clever smart girl you're displaying all the time. You're probably the most fasincating person I ever met and by fasincating I mean utterly kind,clever and yes even pretty.\" You admitted truthfully <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...you think I'm pretty?\" She choked out her brown eyes slowly filling with tears as no one Harry or Ron included had actually said that to her before and she never even considered her physical appearance that much importance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I do even with your very bushy brown hair and braces in your teeth and the fact you like reading books like crazy and are so incredibly intelligent you could put Nancy Drew and Sherlock Holmes out of business I think you're a very pretty girl Hermione. And I'm being completely honest with you.\" You said <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant British witch was really struggling not to burst into tears now but it was hard to do so as concealing her emotions was one of the few things Hermione wasn't so skilled at as the tears slowly fell she quickly grabbed hold of you and clutched you to her chest with you struggling to breathe like crazy <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhh thank you so much for saying that Henry!\" She sobbed hugging you tightly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thank you....Hermione b-but you're....you......GASP!\" You choked out <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh Sorry!\" She cried letting go of you so you could breathe properly \"But that was so kind of you to say so! You're also a very kind and shall I say handsome person Henry I don't care if you're nonmagical it doesn't mean anything to me if you can't do magic I really,really like you!\" She admitted truthfully granting you another hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing this conversation she had to leave again to go to her History of Magic lessons and you attempted to get some sleep as being cuddled by a giant magical girl was a bit taxing but the moment you lied down for a good nap you immediately had a terrifying nightmare involving a gigantic Hermione Granger looking similar to this:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://giantessstudios101.deviantart.com/art/Giantess-Hermione-Granger-Arafa-Ianuae-Magicae-666978158\" target=\"_blank\">https://giantessstudios101.deviantart.co...</a> wandering around in a American town looking desperately for you..........<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then you heard high above you very loud voices it from the looks of it sounded like kids' voices or to be more specific British kids' voices from the snippets of hushed conversations between what sounded like two males and one female with a bossy know-it-all tone you heard words like \"Magic\",\"Hogwarts\",Harry Potter\",\"Ron Weasley\",\"Hermione Granger\",\"Dumbledore\",\"Snape\", \"Fluffy\",\"Sorcerer's Stone\",and \"He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named\" none of it made any sense and you still had no earthly idea to where you were if there was a thing such as magic you thought you really needed it now to get you out of this serious jam after a hour of endlessly wandering around this enormous eerie forest you felt everything turn nearly 360 degrees as it felt like you were falling between two objects that was squeezing the very life out of you \"AHHHHHHHH! LET GO!!\" You shrieked before you realized the two objects holding you firmly were giant fingernails you were on someone's hand and they whoever they were slowly lifted you up to eye level you flinched as you saw a pair of enormous brown eyes staring curiously back at you<br>\r\n\"Oh My.....\" The creature's voice whispered softly its eyes wide you realized it was the female Hermione or whatever her name was,the one with the bossy know-it-all voice \"What are you supposed to be? We haven't even learned about faeries or pixies in our classes yet.\" Despite her incredibly loud voice breaking your eardrums she sounded nice enough but what did she mean by faeries and pixies? Just where in the world were you at \"Hermione?\" Came one of the male voices she turned and you saw one of the two boys around her age(11)tall but lanky with red hair and freckles \"You Coming? We're going to be late for Professor McGonagall's class! I want a good seat today.\" The giant girl called back while shielding you from him and the other boy(a much shorter boy with jet black hair and glasses)'view \"Alright Ron I'll be there in a minute I just need to pick up my books...save a seat for me!\" As the two boys took off somewhere it was hard to see anything for you were getting a really bad headache just by attempting to squint at this girl's eyes she returned her attention to you looking over you curiously \"How did you get in here fairy? How did you get into Hogwarts?' You blinked at her then finally you spoke<br>\r\n\"H-Hogwarts? Fairy? What are you talking about Miss? I....I never heard of such a thing I'm from America and....\" At this Hermione's eyes grew wider than usual and you felt her pressure on you increase<br>\r\n\"You..you're a Muggle? How could it be possible fo...\"<br>\r\n\"Muggle? What's that?\" You ask curiously<br>\r\n\"Its what we of the Wizarding World call non magic folk like yourself no offense...\" She added softly<br>\r\n\"Wait did you say Wizarding World? As in wizards are real? You're kidding right?\" Looking around the corridors to see if she's alone Hermione shakes her head<br>\r\n\"I'm not we have been in existence for ages,decades hidden from the normal non magical population but you're not supposed to know its a serious crime for a Muggle to uncover our secrets of magic and such.\" She frowned and you shivered this was it you were done for<br>\r\n\"So what are you going to do to me? Turn me into a frog or....\"<br>\r\n\"Don't be stupid I wouldn't dare do that to you!\" Hermione snapped annoyed taking out a long stick from her robes pocket \"I however can take you directly to our headmaster Professor Dumbledore so he can possibly help you but I feel for some reason its a better idea for you to stay with me for the time being as long as no one discovers you and you don't go babbling to what you saw when and if I can get you out of here and back to where was it you said you were from the United States?\" You nodded feeling you can trust this Hermione Granger<br>\r\n\"You have no to worry about Hermione I'm good with secrets I won't tell a soul...\" She gave you a stern look as she set you on the ground you looked up highly bewildered at the young giantess<br>\r\n\"I'd expect you to be true to your word on that promise too now since I'm going to be watching over you for now on the least I can do is make you easier to see as a mere 1cm is smaller than a thimble stay perfectly still this won't hurt a bit.....\" As she waves the long piece of stick in her left hand and a few red sparks fly out of it you do as she requested and you hear her mutter a funny word you never heard before \"Engorgio!\" Then you felt your whole body stretching like taffy until you were at least two inches tall a lot taller and more easier to see compared to your previous microscopic height Hermione beams as she reaches down to pick you up her face is far easier to see and her voice is no longer ear splitting loud \"It worked! And That was supposed to be a 6th Year Charm too! Oh I must admit you do look rather cute at that size little Muggle so much for the easier part now I got to hide you while during my classes but once I reach the girls' dormitory I'll have some private time to get to know you better(you didn't like the sound of that but had little choice or chances of escape from this point on) so come on I'll sneak you in my robe pocket you stay perfectly safe and there should be no problems whatsoever.......\" As she departed for her Transfiguration class....</span></div></div>",

You wanted to look around your brand-new surroundings, but that's too risky since this was too new for you and you could end up getting stepped on or something even worse than that so you decided not to and stay inside Hermione's pocket. So far, she was the only person that was nice enough for you to protect you from getting spotted by everyone around this mysterious school. High above you, you could hear Hermione talking with her friends on stuff like \"He-who-must-not-be-named\" or something like that and among other things you don't really know much. About two hours, Transfiguration class has finally ended and you feel your captor have left the class and is going straight to her dorm room. You peek out of your shelter once again to see many other features of this school such as some gargoyle statues, large chandeliers, and some other things that you'll usually find in some old-fashioned European architectures. Afterwards, Hermione finally reached her room, picked you up from her pocket, and placed you down on the floor. You look up to see her on knees looking down at you \"Okay now that's over with, can you tell me more about your self?\" she asked. You begin to tell her all about your life, interest, history, and other things as she seemed to grow very fascinated about you and your life. \"That's very amazing, you're such a interesting Muggle!\" she said \"perheps you're interested in knowing my life.\" You told her to go right ahead and listened to her story. Hermione tells you about many of her ongoing life such as how she became a witch and the time her friends rescued her from a troll. After her story, you also got very interested of her life. \"We both have very amazing lifes, don't we?\" you asked as Hermione agrees. Suddenly, she picks you up from the ground and said \"I can't really help that you looked very cute mister. I wonder if I could have some little fun with you....\"</span></div></div>",

You had been shrunk to a height of mere inches, and from your perspective, it felt like a female mountain had dropped on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe darkness was obvious, there was no possible way that any light could ever reach you, and there was a feminine fragrance, not a body odor for Hermione kept herself clean and presentable, but some talcum powder, bath salts or perfume that was a of a brand favored by girls. It was a flowery aroma, not overpowering but it hung all around you, as her ass cheeks continue to press down hungrily upon your shrunken form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was your main concern, her butt cheeks; or more specifically the one butt cheek which held you prisoner. Hermione shifted all her weight onto that one spot, giving you the full force of her ass pressing itself down upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe force you were required to endure as she sat was beyond your wildest comprehension.

But I don\u2019t want to be down there!\u201d you could not believe what you just heard,<br>\r\n\"it\u2019s too bad, because this is the point of the game \u2013 me having some fun!\u201d, she replied and with a giggle started to bring you closer to her gigantic skirt. You tried to struggle, but it was pointless, because her massive fingers were too big and too strong, \u201cwhat\u2019s that, little guy, can\u2019t wait to get inside?\u201d she asked you, grinning widely and then added, \u201cneither can I\u201d.<br>\r\nIn a moment, the eleven years old girl\u2019s huge hand transported you in front of her massive gray skirt, so big, like a sky, covering everything over the horizon, this humongous gray blanked was lifted a bit upwards by her other hand, revealing the front of  the girl\u2019s gigantic panties. You looked in terror at the massive underwear piece, which was going to become your prison in a matter of time. \u201cSay hello to my panties.....\u201d, you heard a booming voice, coming from above, \u201cyou are quite lucky, little guy, I never showed these parts of my body to anyone, but let\u2019s proceed and play my game!\u201d, finished her voice and her massive hand pulled her panties out a bit and other hand, which was holding you, quickly dashed right above the opening of her panties. Moment later,  the giant hand released you and you started to fall down, but, when you were about to fly head first into the depths of Hermione\u2019s panties, your leg was pinched between her two giant fingers, \u201cnot so fast, I like your enthusiasm, but every game requires some patience in order to get most fun out of it!\u201d, she said with a serious look on her face, \u201cI think that I should teach you couple of lessons after I finish playing with you!\u201d added the young girl. <br>\r\n\u201cPlease, don\u2019t put me in there!\u201d, you begged her, but she looked like she is not going to listen to anything you say as she dangled you above the warm and steaming abyss of her panties. Then she slowly started to lower you down, it looked like she really enjoyed this process. When you were as low as her waistband, you saw her humongous private parts \u2013 completely without any pubic hair, because of Hermione\u2019s young age. You stared at this giant cave in a mix of fear, shock and amazement, because you never in your life saw a sight like this<br>\r\n\"yes, you are looking in a right direction\u201d, she announced, \u201cThis is a right place for you to be\u201d. Then her fingers released your leg and you fell down onto the thick canvas of Hermione\u2019s panties. Immediately, you felt that air all around you became extremely hot, thick and very moist, which made breathing harder. Suddenly Hermione\u2019s other hand released her panties and they, lightning fast slammed, making you smack into the girl\u2019s clitoris. \u201cWhoops, I accidently released my panties, I hope you are ok, because we are not finished yet.\u201d, when Hermione finished her sentence, she felt something really pleasant \u2013 your body squirming around her sensitive parts in attempt to break free, \u201cHehehe that tickles-ohhhh, I see that you are trying to make this game not only fun, but also pleasant \u2013 very good, I see that you are learning now, but let me help you.....\u201d, she said and rubbed her privates with you using her hand through her panties for a good minute. Then she pulled out her panties again and curiously looked inside. When Hermione looked inside, she could not hold her laughter because of scene she saw down her panties \u2013 your little body, completely soaked in her juices was half way inside her vagina, \u201dHahaha, it looks like you are rushing again!\u201d, she said and squeezed you in her fingers, \u201cif you can\u2019t wait then \u2013 in you go!\u201d with these words she thrusted her fingers with you between then right into the cave of her pussy making a splashing noise.<br>\r\n When Hermione inserted you inside her, air got much hotter and wetter and in additions, her giant fingers were holding so hard that it looked like they squeezed the last air out of you. For some time, Hermione was enjoying the feeling of you squirming inside you and then she\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When you were brought quite close to the massive round objects, a rank strong odor hit you. This odor reminded you the one that was coming from Hermione\u2019s front part, but this, new one was much stronger and even hotter. Then, suddenly, you were  slammed right into the back of Hermione\u2019s hot panties and her voice proclaimed from above, \u201coops, looks like I forgot to open the gate\u201d, she giggled and pulled down back of her panties, just a bit, in order to show her massive butt cheeks and humongous valley between them. <br>\r\n\u201cHow is the view?\u201d, Hermione asked, with a wide grin on her face<br>\r\n\"Put me down, right now!\", you screamed, but the giant young girl made a confused look on her face, like she could not hear you,<br>\r\n\"what? Are you asking me to show you a bit more, wow, you are strange little man, but ok, if you are asking\u2026\u201d, finishing her speech, Hermione pulled one of her cheeks to the side, revealing the scariest thing you had ever seen in your life \u2013 Hermione\u2019s massive asshole, which looked like a big and hungry black hole, ready to devour anything on it\u2019s path<br>\r\n\"No, no, no, please, Hermione, anything, but this.......\u201d, but Hermione, again, made this confused look and asked,<br>\r\n\"wow, do you really want to get inside, you are very creepy one, but I cannot refuse if you are asking me so much....\"  she giggled, but then made a thinking expression on her face, \u201cyou know, for me, granting your rather strange wish is not difficult for me, but you should ask permission from my butt hole\u201d, Hermione could not hold her serious face and laughed.\" you know, my butt hole is used to giving everything away, but not taking something inside, so you should try your best to convince it to let you in\u201d. \u201dWhat are talking about?\u201d, you screamed,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"what, you are saying that you are too shy to ask, well, let me help you, I believe that a little kiss would convince my back entrance to let you inside, so let\u2019s try it.\" with these words, flying by, Hermione moved you really close to her anus, which, at this size and being so close to it, looked quite dirty and disgusting, not to mention the smell, which was so putrid and strong that each breath became a challenge for you. Then without even saying anything, Hermione pressed your face right into her asshole in such way that you could only breath in the air that was inside her, right through the small opening in the middle of the massive anus. You tried your best to not pass out from the smell. Hermione was holding you in that position for a minute and then pulled you away a bit, letting you breath in a bit fresher air. \u201cMy butt thinks that you are the great kisser and grants ability to get inside\u201d, without letting you to restore your breath, Hermione positioned you head-first in front of her asshole and started to insert you,<br>\r\n\"Noooooo, please, let me out!\u201d, you screamed, but disgusting air of Hermione\u2019s asshole made you cough. Hermione pushed your whole body inside her and her asshole, with a disgusting plopping sound closed behind you, leaving you in complete darkness, suffocating from the air inside you.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Hermione was enjoying the feeling of you, squirming inside her butt,<br>\r\n\"*Giggle* this is so good, please, wiggle harder!\u201d, she moaned.

Eat you.\" <br>\r\nYour heart drops at her choice of words, this girl can't be trusted with your life so you quickly turn around and start running but it was no good as her large fingers quickly wrapped around you and trapped you in her grip.

With your body halfway into her mouth, she releases you from her fingers and your whole body slides into her mouth.

You're not pleased with the idea of hiding out in a girl's underwear, but it's that or fall back into the snow below you and freeze to death. Thinking quickly, you slightly pull back the top of the garment and climb in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this whole time you were climbing up Lucy and getting to safety, the events at Mr. Tumnus' home take place and Lucy is on her way back to the area where she came to Narnia through the wardrobe back to the Real World Let's just say time moves quicker in Narnia for someone as small as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself in front of the young girl's butt, slightly freckled on the cheeks and, fortunately, it appears she keeps herself clean for a girl her age. However, you could still feel the cold air coming in from outside. \"Damnit, I can't catch a break?\"  You groan to yourself. \"I really didn't wanna have to do this, but I guess I'm gonna have to go into this girl's butt if i wanna keep warm.\" As  you slowly with all your humanly strength pull apart Lucy's massive bubbly  buttcheeks and crawl deep into her crack. The smooth fleshy walls surround you as you make your way as deep as you can go in. Eventually, you find yourself in front of Lucy's butthole, the pink pucker orifice serving as a gate barring your way deeper into the young girl's body. Thankfully, the area around you was plenty warm from Lucy's body heat, so you really didn't have to go any further. Breathing a sigh of relief, you lie back against her butthole and relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Lucy feels an itch coming from her butt and stopped dead in her tracks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange. Why does my...my butt feels itchy all of a sudden. Ohhh it really itches I-I wonder  what's gotten in there? A bug? No....what then?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks around quickly to make sure the coast is clear; the snowy area of the forrest was deserted except for her. Lucy then quickly sneaks her hand down to her old-fashioned(it was the 1940s after all) panty-clad butt to investigate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour relaxation is suddenly interrupted with the presence of two huge fingers the size of tree trunks slowly coming your way. Lucy must have felt you in her butt and is going to see what's going on. The only way out of this is letting her get you or going up this girl's butthole and into her rectum in order to avoid getting captured!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich scenario happens?</span></div></div>",

This causes Lucy to gasp and a strange arousal sensation to emit from her crotch area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what's happening? That actually felt.......good. Pleasurable even.\" Lucy pondered. She ducked behind a nearby tree and snuck her hand down her panties to her vagina and starts rubbing slightly, as if to test her now awakening sexual urges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you survey your surroundings from inside Lucy's colon. The area had a bit of a smell to it, but was mostly clean. However, the walls around you start to pulsate around you and moaning can be hear from above you. The area was even starting to get warmer, too. Lucy was masturbating! Not wanting to be crushed, you pound the rectal walls around you to try and get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, outside, this made Lucy even hornier. \"OH! OOOOOOH my butt feels so good!\" she moans harder. Lucy moved her free hand to her butt and started rubbing her butthole profusely. She struggled to keep her voice low to avoid anyone hearing her as her body began to finally build to an orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside, you were in a living hell. The place was sweltering and the walls were pulsating harder, causing you to lose your balance and bounce around Lucy's butt. Finally, Lucy let out a low cry of pleasure, as she finally orgasmed, keeling over from the sudden release of pleasure. This sent you deeper into Lucy' towards the start of her colon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of recovery, Lucy finally came to her senses. \"That felt pretty good, but what WAS that feeling coming from my butt? I must find out what exactly that was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Later she returned to the wardrobe in the center of the strange wintery wonderland that was Narnia and returned through the secret room where the ancient wardrobe was kept and quietly crept through the hallways while everyone was still sleeping so she walked silently to her room and closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehmmmm listen ehmm little  girl ..... Lucy...Whatever your name is..when you think that ...... can ...\" As you tried reasoning with her but  she simply giggled as she sat down on her bed with a loud PLOP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Giggle..No! You're the one who snuck into my behind without permission so from now on,you are my new little friend forever hehehe!\" As Lucy lied on her stomach,sighing happily as she finally had someone to talk to and play with because her brothers and older sister always ignored her and now her new tiny friendl would remain with her forever and knew how to make her feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you completely terrified and stuck between two massive blubbery mounts were trapped in a house that you don't know and inside the ass of a young English girl that you don't know.

I should think about what to do with you later!

It was a long night but when Lucy woke up she decided to take you out. She finally put her left index finger and thumb in(apparently not ashamed of doing so)and managed to get you out while she went to the bathroom to wash you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh are you alright? I'm awfully sorry to have kept you in there for so long!\" She apologized sheepishly as she,gently  started washing and drying you and threw you on the bed and jumped next to you,causing the whole bed to shake violently while you held on for dear life and for a long time, she just played with you with her fingers and put you in a clothes drawer for safe keeping while explaining. \"This is going to be your house when I'm not ok little friend..but you should be safe in here and I promise to take very good care of you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you kept quiet while she just smiled thinking about what to do with you now as she commented that she had many games in mind but among all she decided to take you and put you in her butt again ... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck because again ......Why are you doing this?

What is that!?\" As the stunningly,beautiful teenager Susan suddenly leaped up,startled.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehmmm nothing! ........ it's nothing!\" Lucy said worried as she tries to grab you but you ran away very fast \"Hey! ..... come back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOhhhhh Myy..L-Lucy was..was that a tiny man? A real tiny man?\" Susan suddenly clasped a hand over her mouth in shock as her younger sister nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and I found him wandering around here..I don't know where he came from..\" Lucy bit her lower lip as she told this little white lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And y-you have been taking care of him ever since..\" The older sister asked curiously. As again her sister nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he certainly is quite adorable if I do say so...\" As Susan slowly bent over to get a better look at you and at once you began running at top speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh LUCY! LUCY! Quickly we must catch him! With all the dangers here,there's no telling what might happen to him!\" shouted Susan,also leaping up  but also curious as she ran after you too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA you ran all over the room,gasping and screaming frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,No GET AWAY! L-LEAVE ME ALONE!!\"  Trying not to be with these two giantesses for your safety and avoid their massive stomps as both girls were running at top speed,chasing you around and around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,No C-come back here little friend!\" Lucy shouted worried about losing you while you kept running,panting like crazy as you made a dive for underneath one of the old-fashioned armchairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Susan dove down and caught a hold of you as she got you up and slowly brought you up to her huge face to closely to see you better. \"Pant..Pant..Caught him...You shouldn't have ran away like that little one! Don't you know how incredibly dangerous it is? Hmmm.. he certainly looks strange Lucy..Look at what he's wearing..what odd types of clothing. I wonder what he is and how he came to be this way...I don't know what's going on but this is strange and fun. And he really does look cute!\" says Susan playfully as Lucy runs to see you too. \"Mmmmm what should I do now?\" Susan says now flashing a small smile  as the stunning beautiful teenager simply tossed you into the air and caught you with her quick reflexes. \"Giggle This is FUN!\" She gushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooo Susan! ........ stop! ..... that's my friend!\" Lucy screams and cries as she tries to get you back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Your friend? ....... how? ....... when? .... and why?\" Susan asks as she rarely looks at you. \"So how did you find this little human?\" Susan curiously  asks Lucy as the little girl looks down at her feet and blushes.<br>\r\n \"Well that is..I-I... ...... well it's a ....... long story and you wouldn't believe a word of it if I told you....\" She falsely confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Lucy told Susan how she met you, she looked at you very angry, thinking you were a damn little pervert. \"T-then you little creature! H-How dare you.......... you tried to do something dirty with my little sister..didn't you?\" Susan screams as she starts to squeeze her fist and you start screaming in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ANSWER ME OR I'LL SQUASH YOU RIGHT HERE AND NOW...\" She orders angrily as she squeezed a bit harder and your eyes nearly popped out of their sockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy finally explained everything. \"No no Susan,please  listen ..... it was an accident ..... just an accident ...... ..he didn't do anything unpleasant to me honest! Really he didn't...I can tell he's not that type of person...he apologized to me and made me feel so that I was not alone! .. .... he became my little best friend.\" Lucy quickly explained  while Susan gave you a annoyed,bewildered look and then calmly  just handed you back over to her and she hugged you, laughing that you were okay because she wanted to play some games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I-I'm sorry Lucy..I thought but listen y-you had better keep him out of sight if you want to hold onto him...we don't want Peter or Edmund or especially Mr. Digory finding out about him! I-I'll check on you later and I feel I also owe you a apology as well,but you better stay close to Lucy as she'll take very good care of you alright?\" As Susan gave you a sweet smile before leaving out the door. \"I'll see you at dinner Lucy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well since my sister's certainly taken a liking to you... heheh.. we better start playing!\" Lucy happily while Susan having just returned back into the room, just watches thinking if is a good idea leave you alone with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Susan do? </span></div></div>",

Please come back this instant!\" She cried annoyed as she calmly walked after you,her huge feet crunching up piles of deep knee snow and you were literally knocked off your feet due to her booming footsteps! Until eventually,Lucy became slightly angry. \"Hey hey come back please,you'll freeze to death! Come on,you won't make it for too much longer! This isn't not fun anymore ... . Come here now or I'm going to have to seriously punish you! \" She ordered sharply as she carefully stomped after you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept screaming and walking after you until finally,she simply reached forward just as you were about to hide under a frozen bush and grabbed hold of you and as she slowly rose you towards her face,her expression became happier but she was still a bit peeved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why did you run away like that? You can't make it on your own out here! Not at that size! Tsk,Tsk....now I'll have to really punish you for disobeying me but how.....hmmmmmm...\" As you were literally shivering both from the 30 below zero weather and from pure fear in general as she kept thinking and thinking about whether she should punish you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh I can't do it,I'm not that kind of person who goes around punishing little creatures just for disobeying me! But you could have stayed put. I can help keep you warm! Alright? I promise nothing bad will happen to you! And I do forgive you....\" As Lucy tenderly hugged you against her chest to keep you warm and as she slowly walked back towards the wardrobe,she continued playing and hugging you while she rubbed you with her right chubby cheek to keep you from freezing and laughed sweetly while you couldn't do anything. Hehehehe...You're sooo adorable! You can stay with me in my room in the mansion,my name is Lucy,Lucy Pevensie by the way,I'm sorry I didn't introduce myself eariler.\"  As she gave you a sweet smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce back in her room,Lucy calmly dropped you on her dresser,staring at you with the usual childlike curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how did you get that way little one?\" She asked concerned as you struggled to reply,busy looking around at the massive large bedroom which looked like it came right out of the 1940s!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know honest! I just woke up like this and suddenly surrounded by nothing but snow and frost in that strange icy place!\" As she stared calmly at you before replying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I do believe you're telling the truth and past events aside,I assure you will be safe alright?\" She said,smiling sweetly at you. \"But here,let me get you something to sleep in and some food as you must be starving by now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the days passed,you found Lucy,the youngest of the recently orphan siblings who lived here to be incredibly nice and kind-hearted as she,true to her word,fed and even bathe you,letting you sleep on a tiny cot but still,she still resorted back to that highly playful person as when you first encountered her from time to time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's have a little bit of fun together! Hehehe .....Now don't be scared,I'll only be playing with you alright?As Lucy hugged you tenderly against her chest and placed you at her feet,letting you see how enormous they were compared to your own tiny height! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe are they large enough for you?\" She sweetly teased,wiggling her largest toe in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut mostly,Lucy remained her very sweet,innocent self as she had to constantly hide you from her other siblings as she stated she didn't know how any of them might react upon seeing such a tiny person in their midst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n But still,she would still play a little too rough with you. \"Hahahaha it's great to have you as my new little friend ohh you're just sooo cute..no one ever pays any attention to me at all. But luckily,I have you here to keep me company and ohhh I just have to..... hehehe!\" As much to your utter surprise,the titanic little girl simply puckered up her lips,leaned forward and  started repeatedly kissing you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh..STOP! STOP IT!!\" You screamed as she had you practically covered from head to toe in thick girly spit but still, Lucy refused to let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hhehehehhe..NOOOO You're just sooo cute....MWAH,MWAH!!\" As unable to help herself,she continued until you were finally covered with spit and giggling, she finally pulled away as she used a bit of her dress sleeve to carefully clean you off as she made herself comfortable on the bed to read a book while you rested,exhausted on the dresser. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while,Lucy put up the book and turned back to you with another mischievous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh No..Now what?\" You thought,still exhausted as she leaned over and picked him up again. \"So now what are you going to do to me Lucy?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she didn't reply right away but walked over to her dresser and pulled out some surprisingly really small doll-sized clothes.  \"OHHH Noooo Y-You can't Be Serious...\" You choked out as her smile grew wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once again,I'm going to have a bit of fun with you since all my siblings are busy cleaning the mansion and I have been told to simply stay in my room for the time being..but it's boring just reading books so I decided to do something fun with you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But playing dress-up?\" You moaned as she giggled and started to remove your pants and shirt,as you knew it would be pointless to resist or fight against her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it will be really fun for both of us and look,they even look right about your size!\" Then she started dressing you like a doll and started showing you off. \"Hahahaha Ohhh you look so lovely in that sailor suit!\" Then she dressed you again back in your normal clothes and to add insult to injury,Lucy simply, threw you on her bed and sat on top of you as you screamed in horror as the young British girl's enormous ass came right on top of you like a ten ton SUV,unable to move or breathe. \"Hehehehe Oops..Sorry but I always wanted to do this...hope it's not that much of a bother....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to scream and fight but there was nothing you could do to stop Lucy's massive ass covered skirt  while she just cutely laughed with your freedom attempts. \"Hehehehe you feel great down there ..... you are a good little cushion ..... hehehehe!\" She kept teasing him gently as she playfully moved from side to side to annoy you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now..I can either simply continue to sit on top of you or you can give my..skirt and undergarments..a little <b>kiss</b> so which will it be?\" She giggled.<br>\r\nWhat does Lucy decide to do?  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You are a twelve year old boy, a student at the comprehensive school called Experiement House.<br>\r\nYo<br>\r\nThis school had an unfavourable reputation and never seemed to perform well academically. This was in many ways the fault of an utterly incompetent headmistress who utterly failed to manage the children who attended the school. As such, many of the children were out of control and bullying was commonplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe largest and most troublesome gang of bulleis was simply referred to collectively by the rest of the schoo as 'them', and everybody knew who 'them' were, and tried to avoid them' wherever possible. You, however are one of 'them'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really aren't a very pleasant person at all, and none-too-bright either, you were just the right kind of person to join in with a gang of bullies, for you loved to torment people who were better or brighter than you were, and being one of 'them' meant you had your group of like-minded companions to hide behind or call on for support for 'them' would always act as a group, ever alone for numbers gave you strength - or so you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of your latest victims was a girl called Jill, and she was everything that you and your little band of cronies dispised. She was a bright girl, normally friendly and open but you hadn't failed to notice that through your efforts she had started to become withdrawn, nervous and defensive. This was fine by you though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your band of misfits spotted her again, trying not to draw attention to herself, and clearly failing. You started to tease her and call her names again, and as some of your fellows were nearby, they joined in as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill ran, you lost track of her for a little while but eventually you saw her together with a boy called Eustace. Of couse you didn't care for him either. He used to be one of your gang, but he left and anyone who leaves' them' is simply marking themselves as the next target. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them were talking toggether, and you were not close enough to pick up the whole conversation but you picked up one word clearly enough... 'Aslan'. Was that a name, it was a silly name, you were sure and you burst out laughing as soon as you heard it. You called to the rest of 'them' who were nearby. This was something else you could mock Pole about, something else you could beat her with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill and Eustance moved off, and you and your group followed after them. You were closest though. The pair moved towards the wall of the school and to a wooden doorway that you knew was alwys locked. They were surely trapped, and you knew it. You would be upon them at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened though, it never opened. Beyond was a green,fertile land, not the greenhouses or waste ground you would expect to see beyond that door. The moment that Jill and Eustace stepped through the door they seemed to disappear but that was surely a trick. The boy, Eustace closed the door behind him but you had watched them, you knew where they had gone... you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later you too were at that door. You tried the handle. It opened. Beyond was that same green, fertile land.You passed though the entrance and turned to close the door behind you but you could not feel the handle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you didn't know was that the instant you passed through that door, you shrunk down to just six inches in height. You had been a small boy trying to act big, and as you entered that other place, somehow you revealed yourself as just how small you really were. You did not know that this was Aslan's doing, Aslan, who you had laughed at earler had shrunk you the moment you entered his country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door was massive, more huge that you could imagine and the handle was way above your head. What on earth?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the dirstance you could see a cliff edge, and Jill was standing very close to it. She seemed huge. Eustance came forward to try to pull her back from the brink and he fell over the edge. He too looked massive. What was happening here? You look out over the cliff and see clouds below. Below? How high up were you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lion, a huge lion bounded towards the edge of the cliff, let out a huge breath and ran back the way he had come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill starts to cry. She was liking Eustance, her was nice to her and now thanks mainly to her own showing off, she had lost him. She did not know that he wa still alive and was falling towards Narnia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Jil lwas alone, you seemed to forgot how large she appeared and you started teasing her again. Jill looks in your direction, she can here you but she can't seem to see where the voice is coming from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, recognition dawns on her face. She reaches for you and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You simply nodded, pleased with the results you managed to get from this giant fox. Just goes to show what a little smarts and creativity can accomplish. Of course, Tails had the same thought in mind. Though he had planned to find a way to grow  you at some point, your trick and the ear damage it caused threw those intentions right out the window. As he finished plans to prevent you from trying such stunts on him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I think I have it ready.\" He said excitedly. You stood up waiting for him to grow you back. What you got however was a painful sting throughout your whole body as he held the button down. You rolled around in pain until he finally let up. \"You thought I'd be willing to help you after what you just did to me?\" Tails said in a somewhat annoyed tone. \"Oh and don't try to pull the collar off. It binds with your skin and can only be safely removed by me.\" You lust laid there looking up in fear as the fox leaned in smirking. \"Oh and this thing cad do a lot more that that sting so you better not get any smart ideas unless you want to see what else I'm capable of doing with it.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But this couldn't be right at all the people staring up at the young giantess smiling down at them were in total shock beyond belief surely this had to be some type of weird kooky experiment cooked up by the U.S. Government but that in itself was nary impossible and bringing someone back to life and having them reprocess back to childhood and causing them to grow Godzilla size belonged in science fiction novels and Hollywood the people didn't have time to ponder whether this was the wildest dream or hallucination as the giantess spoke sounding exactly like Shirley Temple \"Ohh look at the cute little toy town! It even has little cute dolls too!\" Whoever created this lifelike model,robot or whatever she was supposed to be did a heck of a job getting every last detail of America's greatest child actress to complete perfection but this didn't ease the citizens' fear as the young actress began walking in a marching band's beat every-time her foot would come crashing down tings people included would end up ten feet into the air the giant Shirley apparently was totally unaware that she was in a actual city and that she was causing actual damage! She began to everyone's displeasure starting singing several of her classic songs including 'Animals Crackers In My Soup,Good Ship Lollipop among others' causing a few skyscraper windows to explode on contact and people's eardrums to bleed \"AHHHH Stop Singing My Ears!\" A few screamed miserably but the giantess paid no mind her singing did far more damage than all her marching around crushing nearly everything in her path.<br>\r\nFinally Shirley came to a full stop when she saw a person who didn't appear to frightened of her in the slightest in fact the young man was a complete fan of the young actress having collected nearly piece of memorabilia from plastic dolls to every film she ever did of course she didn't know this and smiling at him reached down slowly to pick him up \"You seem to be the only cute little doll who doesn't appear to be afraid of me do you want to play a game with me?\" The man clutched in her enormous sweaty hand cried out excited \"HECK YEAH!\" Apparently he was thinking that she wanted to play a simple childhood game like hide and seek or tag but Shirley smiling mischievously to herself had another type of \"fun' game in mind for her new tiny friend</span></div></div>",

The man widened his eyes as this wasn't what he has in mind and he had to re-think this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait here, Kid! This isn't what you meant, right? I thought you want to play tag or something like that. Come on now, you're only joking.\" The man said with a little fear in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not joking, Cutie. Besides, I want to feel what it's like when your in there. Don't worry thought, you'll be fine. Have fun!\" Shirley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drops him in and he is stuck in between her young buttcheeks. She closes her panties and can feel him squirming in her ass.  She was in a blissful mood as the struggling goes on. The man tries to get himself out of his fabric prison. But, it was no use. Shirley then left town to have fun with her new 'toy'. She makes sure that she doesn't step on anyone or anything in her way. She manages to get out of the city and found a cave to have some privacy for a bit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. This will do just fine. Hope you're having a great time in there.\" Shirley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! Let me out of here!\" The man pleaded for his freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so. You feel so good in there. Maybe I'll keep you in my undies for a day. Or a week.\" Shirley said mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Please don't! I'll do anything!\" The man pleaded again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything?\" Shirley wondered with a devilish smirk and an arched eyebrow on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Anything!\" The man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you want out, the give my butt some kisses.\" Shirley ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man widened his eyes in disbelief. This girl of the  late 1930s is officially nuts. But, he doesn't want to make her mad when she's at the size where he can squish him with little strength. He then do what she says and starts kissing the gigantic young girl's behind. Shirley feels it and likes it. This seems relaxing for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good, Cutie. Keep on kissing and don't stop until I say so.\" Shirley ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is indeed humiliating for the poor man. Here he is, trapped in a young 1930s girl's(the most famous child star actress of all time much less) panties and is kissing her backside. Thank goodness that no one else is around to see this. Shirley, however, is having a blast. She had never experienced something like this in her life. She could probably get used to this. The kissing went on for about 10 minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. That's enough of that. You did good.\" Shirley said in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean you can let me out now?\" The man asked with hope in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to give you something first. Hold on.\" Shirley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then grunted and the man hears grumbling in her bottom. He widened his eyes as he knows what's gonna happen now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Wait! DON'T!\" The man tried reasoning with her. But, too late...... PFFFFFTTTTTTTTTTTT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirley unleashes some big farts on him. The man smells the gas and his nose starts burning. Shirley laughs her butt off at what she just did. To her, it was funny. But, to the man, it was disgusting from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That felt better. Don't you think?\" Shirley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man! It stinks. Can you let out now?!\" The man asked as he holds his nose from the stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirley thinks about it and</span></div></div>",

She brought them up to her lips and sucked it off. It had a superior, and sweet taste to it. Unknowingly to her though, one of the men had also been on her finger.

She dropped them on the ground and sat on them so they couldn't go anywhere. Her gentle, but swift, hand went for the men still trapped in her butt. She pulled them out and looked at them. They looked pretty scared, except for one individual, the same one that she had the very first time. She took notice of this and dropped that man in between her hot melons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry if you had a hard time back there.

She kept a couple to play with. She dropped them right in front of her panties. She kept her legs around them so they could escape. The first little man from before also went there. \"Since two of you wanted some pussy, how about you get some of my breasts as well.\" She picked up the two privates and dropped them in the space between her breast and bra. They struggled a bit, but that made things extra fun. Shirley paid attention to the one man, her first real toy in this situation. \"Ah, my favorite man.

The man decided to listen to his id and started to rub. He started with the balls of her feet. He rubbed up and down, trying to get every spot on both feet. Shirley sighed with happiness. The man went for the middle section next. As he rubbed there, he expected a sign of appreciation, but got something unexpected. She started to laugh. \"Please, . . . Teehee . . . careful there . . . Haha . . It's my ticklish spot.\" Shirley said, trying to contain her laughter. Her breasts jiggled from her laughter, making the little men there bounce a little. The first man smiled and continued to the top, the wiggly toes. He rubbed all ten of them, making sure to get each one individually. Throughout all of this, her feet hadn't smelled bad, if anything, they smelled pretty good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked him up and brought him up to her face. Rubbing her feet had taken quite a bit of energy from the man. He hoped he had satisfied her enough.<br>\r\n\"Thank you for rubbing my feet. I promised you a reward, and I shall deliver.\" She said. The man expected a kiss, or some time with her breasts. Instead, she pulled his little shirt off, exposing his squishy tummy.

You thought that she was a monster out to destroy the city. But, you were damned sure wrong about that. She looks like she's caring and harmless to people. You also noticed the twinkle in her eyes and you take a wild guess that she's in love with you. Before you can ask her about that, you feel the ground shaking and it's obvious to you on what this means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that noise, Steve?\" Shirley wondered in concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like the military's coming back with a vengeance.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe military then showed up with tanks and jets that are ready to open fire at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna pay for what you did to our men! Ready to fire on my mark!\" The Colonial ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldiers pointed their guns, tank cannons and missiles at her and locked onto her. You feel like you need to do something and you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready! Aim!\" The Colonial was about to give the order to fire until.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Stop! Don't shoot!\" You pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steve?\" Shirley wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing, Son? Get out of the way!\" The Colonial demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look! She's not what we think she is.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? How would you know?\" The Colonial wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At first, I thought she was someone out to destroy us all. But, it turns out that she's a person capable of sense of emotion and kindness. Let's try to have her live as one of us, please.\" You pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirley was touched by your words and smiled at you nicely. The Colonial was shocked by how you're defending the gigantic actress. He took a moment to think about this and comes to conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand down.\" The Colonial ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldiers were shocked by his decision. But, they've go with his order and lowered down their weapons. The Colonial came to you for some sort of agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you truly thinks so, okay. However, we'll have to secure her in a place to keep her safe. And you, you're gonna have to watch over her. Deal?\" The Colonial suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal.\" You said with a handshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's move on out, Men!\" The Colonial ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey've managed to take Shirley to an isolated area to keep her safe from the population. On the inside, you're watching over her in a room that's big enought for her size. Shirley was pleased by what you did for her and wanted to say thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much for what you've did for me, Steve. You're a real gentleman for doing that.\" Shirley said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad I can help. Listen, I'm sorry for judging you before. I just got scared and all.\" You apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. It's all in the past now.\" Shirley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Shirley smiled at each other and then Shirley</span></div></div>",

It's much more better to the radios and motion pictures my era had.\" Shirley said.<br>\r\n\"Things did change over 3/4 of a century. Here, let me show how this works.\" You said. You grabbed the remote and show her the buttons and shows on it. Shirley was rather impressed by what she sees and soon got the hang of learning how to flip through the channels while looking at the TV Guide Channel which allows you to order all types of movies On Demand she also sees her a few of her movies on the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They have a few of my movies on here too!

So, you decided to tell her anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my great grandfather was in the Marine Corps during his time fighting against the Japanese forces. He and his comrades managed to win the war by bombing Okinawa, Japan.\" You started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Bombing......My goodness!\" Shirley said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was the only way. It's not right. But, we had no other options.

But again, you did, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two more wars came into play. The Vietnam and Korean Wars . It was absolute hell during that time and it took many lives away.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My goodness! What was the Korean War?\" Shirley said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know much about it but much of the Cold War I did know of.\" You replied <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what was that?\"  Shirley wondered.<br>\r\n\"It was not really a battle or war-war but more of a political word battle against the United States and the Soviet Union or Russia it took place in the 1950s.\"<br>\r\n\"And what is this Vietnam War?\" Shirley asked even more curious you took your time replying <br>\r\n\"Well it was one of the worst wars not as bad as World War II or the Civil War but a lot of people,soldiers fought in Vietnam throughout the 1960s and a lot saw pure horrors overseas...here let me show you a few pictures...\" You brought out a book of the early 1960s and showed her a few pictures of the war Shirley gasped at a few of the gruesome sights <br>\r\n\"Ohhhh that's awful! But what are these other pictures of?\" She examined a few pictures of the Civil Rights Movement and you explained all about that she nodded <br>\r\n\"Well it's good that there's no longer prejudice anymore my friend Bill Bojangles Robinson would have loved to see this day and age...where people aren't...\" But you interrupt her<br>\r\n\"Yeah I remember him he's the one who taught you how to tap dance didn't he?\" She nodded <br>\r\n\"Yes he was! But tell me a bit about women...\" Shirley asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, back then, the women of this country weren't being treated equally as us men. So, they banded together for a revolution for women. They succeeded and we got the Woman's rights on the bill of rights in the early 1970s.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know all that Steve except that last part but tell me how they act,how do they dress things like that?\" Shirley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the thing you're wearing now is called a bikini it's a two piece bathing suit a lot of girls/women wear them while swimming although one piece swimsuits are used but I can see why it makes you feel a bit exposed and nowadays most girls or women wear long or short pants called jeans or shirts of all fabrics and designs In fact, you're no different from modern day girls Shirley. You're smart, talented and beautiful in fact many people look up to you both as a child and your later life as a inspiration.\"  You said and stopped at that in case you accidentally created a time paradox or something <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirley gasped in surprise as you called her beautiful. She blushed a little as she was flattered by your honesty.<br>\r\n\"Really? I....I'm that beautiful?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't be telling you if it weren't the truth Now then are you hungry by any chance?\" You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please. I'm famished.\" Shirley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be right back I'll order us a pizza.\" You said going to pick up your phone <br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Shirley asked<br>\r\n\"You'll see.\" You tell her <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to the phone and ordered a pizza to your house for delivery.

Your friends are coming in to see you for a bit. \"Shirley, my friends are coming over for a bit. Would you like to meet them?\" You asked.<br>\r\n\"Of course! I love to meet new people.\" Shirley said happily. Soon, your friends arrived but strangely Shirley remains in her bikini one is a small Irish boy named Jason. He's a top member of the school's local newsletter. Next to him is your closest friend Troy. An African-American male who is the star quater-back for your school's football team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man.\" Troy says.<br>\r\n\"What's going on guys?\" You said happily.<br>\r\n\"Nothing much, Steve. Just stopping by to say what's up and all.\" Jason said. You smiled at them until you see a big black haired kid. You recognized him as Dustin. He used to be your best friend back when you and him were kids  that is until you saw him do terrible things and betrayed you. Now, he's the school bully who mostly picks on you and other less popular kids you wondered on why he's here. \"What are you doing here, Dustin?\" You asked<br>\r\n\"What? I can't stop by to see my old buddy at his house?\" Dustin asked sarcastically you shook your head in dissapointment but lead them in the living room and they see Shirley sitting on the couch.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Stevie boy? Who's this you got here?\" Troy asked as he messes with you a bit.<br>\r\n\"This is Shirley. She's just staying here for a while.\" You said not wanting to tell them the absolute truth but thankfully none of them watch old black and white films anyway and are barely aware who Shirley Temple is so they don't think much on her familiar appearance but Troy does give you a raised eyebrow on her attire(\"It's not what you think\" You mutter \"We just back swimming.\") However Shirley gets up holding out her hand to each boy <br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you all.\" Shirley said politely.<br>\r\n\"Steve. Are you holding out on us man?\" Jason asked playfully. You want so badly to knock him on his head for that. Shirley, on the other hand was trying to understand the odd lingo the guys were talking about as they joked around with each other she gave you a puzzled look but you mouthed to her you'll explain later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you hear the doorbell. It was the pizza man and you payed for your order with the tip. You brought the pizza in and you and your friends enjoy it. Shirley looks at it with suspision although she was familiar with the classic Italian dish she had never seen pizza like this in her life but upon taking a bit and she likes it as she was eating, Dustin came to her with a sly look on his face.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Baby. You looking sexy tonight.\" Dustin said coolly. Shirley doesn't like how he's looking at her and looks the other way. \"Come on now. Don't be like that. How about we leave this loser's dump and you and I can have an alone night together? Just you and me.\" Dustin asked  in a sickly seducetive.<br>\r\n\"No thank you, Sir. Now please leave me alone.\" Shirley demanded getting a bit annoyed despite her petite appearance and personality Shirley was no fool she could be feisty when the situation called for it \"You can't deny it. I know you want some of me.\" Dustin said.<br>\r\n\"The answer is no.\" Shirley said angrily before you came up.<br>\r\n\"What's going on here?\" You asked.<br>\r\n\"This boy here doesn't know when to take no for an answer as he is bothering me and try to hit on me.\" Shirley said angrliy.<br>\r\n\"That's because you refused to go to bed with me.\" Dustin said disgustingly.<br>\r\n\"Look, Dustin. If she says no, it's no. Now, give her some space.\" You said.<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Dork? Oh that's right. I know that you know that she sees you as a pathetic, wimpy loser that she'll leave with me when she gets the chance.\" Dustin said with a sick smile on his face.<br>\r\n\"Shut up.\" You said as you gritted your teeth.<br>\r\n\"You know it's true. I know it's hard to face reality. But, that's how it works in this world.\" Dustin said. You were about to show him who's boss until</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, the man started to struggle a lot more than before. He was terrified at what he thought he knew what Shirley was about to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! Don't eat me! Do whatever you want, step on me, make me lick the dirt off of your feet. ANYTHING! Just please don't eat me!\" The private pleaded. The giantess simply put her finger to his mouth and shushed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, I won't eat you. You're a human, so if I ate you, I would become a cannibal. Besides, I doubt your little body could satisfy my hunger.\" She looked down at the unconscious men, thinking about what to do. \"Here's what I'll do instead. I'm sure I can find food at another town, but I won't just let you go either.\" She grabbed the rest of the men and dropped them all into her panties. She then walked for a while, looking for somewhere to eat. After a while, she finally tracked down a busy city. She licked her lips in anticipation. All of that food, waiting to be devoured. As her big bare feet stepped through and caused mild tremors,cars came to a screeching halt. Everyone was amazed at her beauty and size. A little boy even waved at her and in a sunny yet ravenous mood she waved back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirley's first stop was a stopped ice cream truck. She picked it up and looked inside. A small brunette woman was at the steering wheel screaming her head off at the sight of the teenaged young actress.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry miss, but I need your truck. Well, I need what's inside at least.\" Shirley pulled the female out and set her softly on the ground. She then ripped the back of the truck off and threw it behind her, almost hitting another car. She opened her mouth wide and dumped all of the ice cream in. She could feel the cold, creamy substances land on her massive tongue. She swallowed all of it and set the truck down. However, it did almost nothing to weaken her hunger. She looked around and saw a grocery store. She clapped her hands and licked her lips. \"Perfect.\" With all of her strength, she ripped the roof off and threw it behind her with great force. The roof sailed through the air and landed on the river, making a surprisingly good bridge. In the store, people started to leave their carts and run out screaming Shirley simply shrugged. She started to stuff everything down her gullet. She grabbed boxes of cereal, fruit, bread, doughnuts and many more things. She was so busy eating, she didn't see a woman who was still there. Shirley accidentally grabbed her and tossed her in as well. Though the woman screamed and panicked  in her large mouth, the oblivious giantess didn't hear her and assumed she was tasting a random piece of steak. The poor woman fell down her throat and into her stomach, trapped with everything else. Shirley kept stuffing herself until there was nothing more in the store.<br>\r\n\"I just need one more good meal. I'm sure of it!\" She thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer search continued throughout the city. She didn't mind that people were watching. She smelled around, hoping to catch a whiff of something tasty. Just when she thought there wasn't much more, something quite  lovely caught her eye. A fancy restaurant! She skipped over and took the roof off. Just like before, she got the same reaction as before: Everybody running out. However, this time, it was more beneficial. The food was now in the open.<br>\r\n\"Finders keepers, as they say.\" She said. She started to grab plates and devoured the food. Despite all of this food, she didn't grow any fatter. Possible the same magic or whatever it was that had brought her back to life and made her a giant. She was looking around the building to see if she missed any when she heard a small voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, excuse me, miss?\" Shirley looked down to see a small child, no older than 11 years old. She brought him up to her face. The boy was holding another plate, this one with a lot of turkey, stuffing and even french fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you, little boy?\" Shirley asked, though she was eyeing the plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I saw you were hungry. Here, you can have my plate.\" The kid said. Shirley was a little confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? Once it's in my mouth, there is no getting it back. It'll be gone forever.\" The boy nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, if it will help your hunger, then I'm glad to give it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, put the plate on my tongue.\" Shirley opened her mouth and brought the boy very close to it. The boy did as he was instructed. As soon as he stepped back, the mouth shut tight and swallowed. \"Thank you, my child. You will be . . . . Hold on. I think I'm about to. . . .\" She lowered the child and turned towards the city. With her other hand, she put her hand on her stomach. It rumbled more than ever before. \"Oh my, here it comes.\" Shirley then gave the loudest belch ever. Her burp went throughout the city. Buildings were damaged, cars went flying and Shirley could hear car alarms going off. People and soldiers (ones that came after a report came in about a giantess taking all the food she could find) were blown back by the stinky air. The ground even cracked a little. Shirley started to blush as she quickly covered her mouth with her free hand \"Oops, excuse me.\" Shirley started to giggle, not caring about the damage that was done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted the boy back up to her face. The boy was smiling, and even giggled a little as well rather than disgusted.<br>\r\n\"Now, as I was saying, you will be rewarded for feeding me.\" She brought him close to her face and gave him a big kiss. The small child blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you miss.\" They boy said. Shirley carefully put him down onto the ground. She saw the boy reunite with his mother. Together, they walked off.

Luckily for her, she came across an ice cream factory. She pulled the roof off and saw huge containers of ice cream. She saw many kinds of ice cream, like Rocky road, Vanilla and Mint. She pulled up the containers and poured all of it in her open maw, ignoring the people yelling. She ate a total of 5 containers, filled with ice cream. As she started to leave, her head started to hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Ow, brain freeze!\" She said, accidentally sitting down on a red car. While waiting for her brain freeze to go away, she opened one eye and saw a cake eating contest at the park. It hadn't started yet, making it even better for her. She gobbled the cakes down without a thought. The judges who were watching weren't sure if she was a contestant or not. Shirley looked around and saw a birthday party, with a very large cake. \"I'm sure they'll survive without cake.\" She said and grabbed their beautiful cake. What Shirley didn't know though was that the cake wasn't completely real. It was a pop out cake, with a sexy lady inside waiting for the signal. The poor lady got a big surprise when her hiding spot suddenly broke in half, and revealed that she was in a gigantic mouth. Shirley swallowed, thinking it was a normal cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next stop Shirley went to was a high school. She carefully looked in the windows until she found the lunch room. She then opened it up and took everybody's food. She also took all of the food from the cafeteria. No matter how much Shirley ate, she didn't grow any fatter. This went on for the next couple of hours, until there was almost no food in the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirley's last meal was many packets of jelly beans. After she swallowed, she sat down in the city's stadium and relaxed. Though she had interrupted a football game, she didn't care. She had complete control at the moment. She suddenly started to feel something in her butt. She just assumed it was the tiny men she still had in her panties. However, the feeling started to grow. She put her hand on her butt, wondering what on earth was happening, until she gave a massive fart. It was so big, it expanded throughout the whole city. Most of the buildings that were still standing came crashing down. Most people, especially the soldiers in her panties, passed out from the smell. Shirley pulled everyone from her panties out and set them at the edge of the stadium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, sorry everyone.\" She said, giggling, though most weren't awake to hear her. She reached over and grabbed the people in the stadium that were still awake and laid down, setting the little ones on her belly. \"How about you do something useful and rub my belly.\" She said. The tinies realized there was no way out of this situation, so they obeyed. A couple could hear very faint screaming in her stomach, but ignored it. After about 5 minutes, Shirley felt the urge to laugh. The reason was some of the men and women got stuck in her belly button and were having trouble getting out. They kept struggling until the whole place started to rumble. Shirley's belly button was one of her most sensitive spots. She laughed really hard, making it impossible for the tiny people to climb out. She was so loud that the whole city shook, making large cracks appear. As Shirley got up, the tiny humans from her belly button fell out right in front of her underwear. Shirley wiped the tears from her eyes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After Shirley got calmed down, she gave a friendly smile. The little humans hoped she wasn't about to do anything mean to them, especially after she destroyed the city. Luckily, making Shirley laugh put her in a good mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, my friends, for helping me have a good time. For this, I shall reward you with whatever you want.\" Everybody started talking at once, making the requests hard to hear. She brought her finger up to her mouth and shushed them. \"One at a time please.\" She carefully listened to what they wanted. Most of the boys wanted to feel her breasts. She happily took her bra off and laid down, giving them easy access. For the next few minutes, those men tasted and rubbed her boobs. She didn't mind at all, she even liked it a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got a response from the females next. Most of them wanted her to humiliate the boys. She shrugged and took all of the pants from the males, leaving them in their underwear. They were all embarrassed. All of the girls laughed at them, even Shirley joined the laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last requests came from a boy and a girl. The two of them wanted to be as high as they could possible be in the sky. Shirley nodded and let them step on her hand. She then stood at her full height, lifting her hand as high as it would go, making sure they wouldn't fall off. The boy and girl hugged each other, as they saw how high up they were. The lady even commented that the people on the ground looked like ants. Shirley put them safely on the ground, happy that everyone there was pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the army was thinking of every way they could to defeat Shirley. The only option they had left was to fire the rest of their missiles on the giantess, especially after what she did to the city. The general targeted her and hit the emergency button. Everything went after her in a moment. Before she knew it, she could feel explosions on her back. At first they stung a little. However, as more and more hit her, they eventually only tickled her. She started to laugh, and it only got worse. She kept laughing, making the city shake a little. The people from before simply backed up and left. She didn't care, she was having fun now, and didn't need those tiny people now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shirley eventually couldn't feel any more missiles. She waited to see if more would appear, when suddenly more soldiers showed up. They demanded that she stopped. Though they had guns, she wasn't scared. She simply slammed her foot down, making them drop their weapons. She picked them up, and tossed them away.<br>\r\n\"You'll have to do better than that.\" She said, giggling. She leaned in and softly blew on them, making them fall onto the ground. She then happily tickled them, making them all laugh. <br>\r\n\"No please not that!\" Several of the soldiers cried out wiggling as she stroked their stomach area with her index finger one at a time<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tickle,tickle!\" The giant 14 year old actress teased such in a good mood she didn't care about anything else including if she ever returned to her own timeline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we have to fight back! We have to! For the world!\" The commander said, not laughing. It was kind of annoying Shirley. She decided to give him the 'special' treatment.\" She picked him up and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you seem like a tough guy. However, I think I know what you need. You just need some love.\" Shirley said, bringing him closer. The commander was confused for a second, until Shirley started to kiss him. He struggled with all of his might, though Shirley didn't care. She kept kissing him until he stopped struggling. For him, he felt defeated, unable to stop this monster. \"There you go, see? Just put a smile on your face and you'll be fine. It's not like I'm going to hurt you.\" The commander was a little confused from hearing this. This was coming from the same person who destroyed the whole city with her butt? This was really strange. Meanwhile, . . .</span></div></div>",

I guess you're right, I'm clearly not giving you a proper hug.\" Shirley then hugged him tighter, enough so that the point got through, but not so much where she was killing him. After she was done, she grabbed him by the leg and dangled him. \"Alright little man, how about I give you some time in my 'waiting room'. She said. The general was confused, until he was dropped. The commander screamed and fell right into her panties. She closed them up, and looked at her other toys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all looked adorable, and perfect for her next game. She clapped her hands.<br>\r\n\"All right, time for a real game. I want all of you to start climbing me, whoever gets to my head first, gets a kiss.\" She got in a comfortable sitting position. \"Alright, everyone . . . <u>START!</u>\" she said. The men started climbing her. She could feel on them getting higher. They reached her panties, belly button and breasts. When they got to that height, she squirmed a little bit. Her breasts jiggled, making a couple fall back down. One of them pushed another out of the way hard and reached the top of her head. She pulled him down to her face and . . .</span></div></div>",

Shirley thought for a minute about what they should play next. \"I don't know, what do you guys want to play?\" She asked. The others weren't sure how to answer. Finally, one spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we play Hide and seek? We would be able to explore around.\" One of them suggested. Shirley thought about this. She could make a barricade around the city so they couldn't escape. She also would be able to stretch her legs out. Shirley nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, give me a minute.\" She said. She got up and arranged buildings around in a square so they couldn't escape. The giantess walked back to them and grabbed them. She set them down on the road and explained the rules. \"The rules are simple, hide around in this part of the city. Don't go beyond the barricade, of you do, I will punish you. Don't hide in the building either, it'll be too hard for me. Whoever I find last will get to feel my breast. The area isn't that big, but I will count to two-hundred to be fair. Ready? Start.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirley covered her eyes and started to count. Despite not being able to go into buildings, they found some good spots, like under a car or in a trash can. Soon, Shirley hit two-hundred and started looking. The first man she found was hiding in a tree. She giggled and grabbed him. She kept searching, trying to see movement.</span></div></div>",

She brought him closer and kissed him. He kissed her back. Shirley kissed and licked him, loving this feeling. \"What a noble man.\" Shirley said. If only she could do this forever, but she had other games to play. She stopped and set him down. As for the man she was sitting on, she felt he learned his lesson.

The giantess looked down at the tiny people, who were also trying to get a hold of themselves. She thought deeply about what to do with them. Though they were small, they were very useful and fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you think you can get away with tickling my belly button. Even though you didn't ask?\" She said, looking serious (though she wasn't actually that angry, just looking for an excuse to have fun). \"How dare you. I think I need to teach you some manners.\" She laid down on her stomach and grabbed some people, dropping them in the back of her panties. \"Since you stayed awake after my fart, I'm sure you'll like this place. It should still have the same smell as before.\" She could hear the complaining, and just laughed. \"It's what you get for making me laugh like that. Especially after going somewhere where no one had gone before.\" She gave a little fart to 'please' them. Though it wasn't nearly as big, it definitely was almost as stinky. The tiny humans almost fainted from it. Meanwhile, she turned to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew exactly what to do with the others. Their punishment would be just as stinky, and have them in a position where she could see their reaction. She grabbed the few people left with her left hand. She used her right hand to grab one person. The first victim was an adult man. He was pulled up close to her mouth. As she opened it up, he resisted a lot, afraid that he was going to be her next meal. Instead, she breathed on him. Her breath still smelled from all of the food she ate. She breathed on him until he passed out. \"Night night little one. Go ahead and join the others.\" She carefully placed him in the back of her underwear. She did this to the rest, making each one pass out from her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She finally got to the last one, a blond teenage girl. As Shirley opened her mouth to release the stink cloud, the girl suddenly jumped in, catching Shirley off guard. Shirley completely stopped moving, and carefully opened her mouth. She pulled out the girl (who was soaking wet from the saliva) and looked at her.<br>\r\n\"Why did you jump in my mouth? You weren't trying to kill yourself, . . . were you?\" Shirley asked, a little worried. The girl shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm sorry. It's just your mouth looks amazing, and the thought of being inside . .  I just wanted to take a look.\" The girl said blushing. Shirley looked surprised for a minute, then smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's fine. Just be really careful.\" Shirley said and opened her mouth. The girl eagerly crawled into the darkness. It felt really weird for Shirley, knowing that a human was inside her mouth willingly. This wasn't the 'punishment' Shirley thought she would be giving. The girl, however, loved every moment. She loved to be dominated, being rolled around by the tongue. Shirley finally pulled her out. She put her to the side and got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since, you took your punishment willingly, I'll let you go if you want.\" Shirley said, thankful that she didn't accidentally swallow her. The girl decided to stay though, wanting to serve Shirley more. Shirley . . .</span></div></div>",

They looked at her, afraid.<br>\r\n\"Don't be scared, I won't hurt you. However, I do want to have fun, so I'm going to give you a quiz about me.\" She said. A couple of them started to get red, not knowing if they could succeed. \"If you win, I'll give you anything you want. If you lose, I'll have my way with you. Whoever gets second place, you get to go back into my underwear. Sound fun? Good, because we are starting.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game started and involved fifteen questions. Some of them were obvious, like her hair color. Others were about her past, which weren't as easy. The men kept turning red when she told them answers that they got wrong. After about five minutes, the game finally ended. As for the score, the first man got seven questions correct. The second only got two correct. As for the last one, they didn't miss a single question. The first man was placed back in her panties. She looked at the winner.<br>\r\n\"You must really like me. What is your wish, my servant?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh beautiful giantess, I want to be naked inside of your pussy. I want to be placed in there, and crushed to death, for you see, I have a condition that will kill me anyways in two weeks. I want to die happy.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure, once you enter my vagina, there's no going back.\" The man nodded. Shirley gave a creepy smile. She took her underwear off and dropped them nearby. She placed the loser with it. Shirley pulled off all of his clothes and tossed them behind her. She then held the man in front of her private spot. It was a little wet already just from the thought of having a little man inside. \"Ready or not, in you go.\" She said and pushed him in. She was getting wet from feeling his little naked body. \"Goodbye little human, I hoped you enjoyed your stay here.\" She twisted her legs, making her pussy close up tight, crushing him instantly. She could hear a little pop from where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing she did was look over at the loser,who was currently cowering.<br>\r\n\"Come here little man, it's your turn with me.\" She grabbed him and pulled him over. \"The last one didn't excite me enough, I need you to finish the job.\" She lowered him and used him to pleasure herself.

She is currently wearing both a black &amp; white striped shirt and white panties right under it as she wants to impress the group very well. The audition today for the young 12 year old today involves her being a giantess in a city and being a monster attempting to destroy it. It takes a while for the auditions to go through since they have to bring out a new tokusatsu city set every time a young girl destroys one. It was a very popular one as they are many girls who did made the cut, and Charly is hoping to be the one who does. Her mother wants her to become a model like her, and Charly doesn't want to disappoint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharly's picture: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20050206023910\" target=\"_blank\">https://web.archive.org/web/20050206023910</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charly, we are waiting for you now.\" Said by the announcer. Charly knew that it was her turn and she finally gets up, ready to stun them with her looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming,\" she smiled just as she comes right into the room and starts walking right onto the miniature city that has her scaled around 129ft tall when the exact measurements in her head(she was incredibly smart) are done. \"Very good, you seem to already got the looks, just the shirt and panties?\" The announcer asked. \"Yes.\" She smiled to them. \"Well nice, well now I am going to ask you to destroy the city using any method you would use, and this is just for fun, so please don't take it seriously.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharly then smiled and look at the city that she was about to destroy right before her. She decides to start by stomping on a few miniature cards, also shaking her rear end just as she does that, getting the cameras on that shot as well. She then goes on the offensive by even stomping the bridge right in front of her, causing it to collapse. She then punches and kicks a few buildings, and even butt crushes one of them. Within a few minutes, the entire miniature city was destroyed and Charly said. \"This city is no match for a goddess like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good, very good. You are easily the best one all day, you are hired on the spot, and to show you my gratitude.\" The deal person said, impressed by her rampage, he snaps her fingers. \"Enjoy your new life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why... uh...\" Charly said just as she begins to notice the world getting smaller around her very fast. The people around her the director included were beyond flabbergasted \"Holy crap....she's..she.....growing,actually in full view growing!\" Charly herself noticed her sudden change <br>\r\n\"Umm why is everything getting smaller? Mom! I...I'm scared....\" Suddenly forgetting about wanting to be a model and everything else the young beautiful 12 years old screamed out in panic as she grew larger and wider still \"Oops sorry!\" She called out as her foot flattened one of the camera film crew \"So very sorry!\" She called out highly concerned but no one was paying attention as the young model to be was growing literally out of control<br>\r\n\"Ahhh Everyone Run for it! She's going to destroy the whole building!\" The director screamed got out of the room just as she then really grows out of the room her body parts and limbs going everywhere by a miracle her shirt and panties remained intact \"Ahh Oh no I can't stop growing Please someone help me!\" Charly slowly then shoots up right to the roof and brings the building collapsing to the ground. Everyone who wasn't in there was mainly crushed by either the building debris of the burst of Charly's growth spurt. Suddenly, Charly soon finds herself outside, and notices all the buildings are smaller than her, and for real. She even saw some very scared people running for their lives. \"Uh.... what just happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, I grew to 129ft? Just some random number from my head. It's just like the tiny model city but for real this time.\" She said just as she brings her foot out of the building and ends up smashing a car with her foot, and it felt real. \"Wow... it felt real!!!! I am a giant. I guess I can try to befriend people.... Maybe this isn't so bad after all!\" she said just as she got out of the building and started walking towards the heart of the city Boom,Boom,Boom her echoing footsteps caused mild tremors to radiate through the ground and a few pieces of the road even cracked a little but her foot pressure was soft Charly smiled down at all the terrified,screaming and running people below in the streets \"Hello cute little people no need to be afraid I won't hurt you I just find it so fascinating to be this big!\" She also was mindful about stepping on people as she certainly didn't want to hurt or especially to kill anyone, but at the same time she was also being a bit careless and playful by stepping on as many cars as she could. \"If anything I can play with these cute empty cars a bit.\" She said just as she grabs a car and then messes with it for a second, like rolling its wheels,rolling it down the street and stuff like that. She then sets it back down and then flashes a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon she is in the heart of downtown, and then she goes to a building close to her size and peeked inside at all the screaming people noticing her. \"RUN... it's a giant girl monster!!!!\" Screamed by one guy, but Charly said. \"I am not a monster, I just got really.... big.\" She said nervously, but then she smiled. \"But I always wanted to do....this.\" She said, she then begins to look like she is taking her shirt off on the building, but then she places it to where her big stomach hits the building carefully, and she takes the end of the shirt and uses it to cover the building. She then ducks to get off the shirt and she smiles, \"Peek-a-boo, I see you!\" She giggles as she watches as the people scream a lot and run from the windows which slightly crack due to the pressure her stomach is putting on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut soon she was going to have to deal with a....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n/<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanna continue this story?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It happened. Charlotte didn't know how particularly, but it happened. Here she was, a 12 year old girl clad in a t-shirt covered by four horizontally alternating ebony and ivory hues going to an audition for some modeling gig, and she was somehow transformed into a 129 foot tall giantess who was currently stumbling through the streets of\u2026 whatever town/city that this story takes place in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every step Charlie took, her feet left ten-foot craters that engulfed the heated concrete roads. The sounds of ordinary urban living were tuned out by panicked civilians screaming, running, and honking their horns in fear of the young titaness. She bent over forward to try and calm them down, but this only served to scare the populace even further. Her innocent ears received screams of \u2018Monster!\u2019, \u2018Freak!\u2019, \u2018We\u2019re all gonna die!\u2019, amongst other more profanity-laden slurs directed toward her. Her face reddened in sadness as hot, wet tears cascaded down her facial cheeks and splashed onto the ground below, crushing automobiles and drowning citizens before evaporating in the blazing July heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a matter of fact, not even someone with the advantage of having access to higher and colder altitudes like Charlie was immune to it. Somewhat regretful for wearing the heat-absorbing black on half of her attire, Charlotte wiped gallon-sized beads of sweat from her forehead, inadvertently raining it down on more terrified city-dwellers. The scorching summer temperature of 100 \u00b0F was so overwhelming that Charly\u2019s thirst was magnified beyond even what a person of her present stature was capable of possessing. Her tongue was void of saliva, regardless of her attempts to moisten her mouth, and the sweat that was descending her body was beginning to seep through her glorified t-shirt. The smell brought upon by the heavily-stained article of clothing was enough to cause many of the puny humans below to faint. Even Charly had to plug her nose to shield herself from the aroma, but she was soon reminded of her other predicament regarding the need to purge her parched state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConveniently, she spotted a 71 foot long semi-truck with the shamelessly advertised brand name of Pepsi slapped on the side. Charlotte\u2019s baby blue irises sparkled with wonder as she easily broke the lock on the back door and gazed at the multitude of beverages being housed inside. She took a moment to check her surroundings, pondering where the people who were supposed to be around this cargo were at this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. I must\u2019ve scared them off.\u201d She stated with a dejected expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grumble from her stomach that Charly believed others would mistake for her roaring like a feral beast snapped her out of her depressed trance. She cupped her flat-as-a-board abdominal area with her hands and groaned in pain, rationalizing that the importance of quenching her thirst superseded that of the legal issues that would likely befall her afterwards. Pushing back the agony as much as she could, Charly dislodged the 48 foot long trailer from the 23 foot long truck, so as to have an easier time lifting her drink up to her mouth. Then with a grunt of effort, she heaved the trailer into the air using both of her hands and tipped it down toward her gaping maw. Hundreds upon hundreds of cold, sugary soft drink dropped into the gullet of the adolescent colossus. Once the entirety of the metal husk was vacated of its delectable fizzy nectar, Charlie still took the time to gently set it back on the ground, but was unable to reattach it to the truck. The overgrown girl then proceeded to chew through the plastic that concealed the Pepsi and was rewarded with gallons of caffeinated liquid that flooded her taste buds with a refreshing chilled flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cheeks bulged as she slowly swished it around in her mouth, wishing to savor every moment of this experience. After two \u00bd minutes, she\u2019d decided to finally gulp down her quarry, sending it on a one way trip to her boiling stomach acids. Charly breathed a sigh of relief as her desire for fluid revitalization was at last fulfilled, but then she felt something\u2026 off. Deep within the confines of the giantess\u2019s belly, the onyx ocean of carbonated calories was waging a wild war with the domestic green gastric juices, and it just resulted in internal turmoil for the host. Charly once again clutched her tummy in distress, though now that distress manifested from an overfilled gut rather than an empty one. Charlotte could hear popping sounds emanating from her gastrointestinal area, signifying that her battle inside was becoming even more chaotic. She could even see a small paunch forming from her previously thin stomach, yet was unable to identify the cause of it. The only thing that indicated the truth to her was a strange emptiness in the top half of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to the aspiring model, that bloating was due to the new atmosphere of sickly gas being born from the mixture of soda and stomach acid. Gargantuan bubbles were blown, expanded, and popped in the blink of an eye, adding even more gas to the swirling maelstrom that was being built up. The grumbling of a upset tummy grew in volume, giving Charlotte an ominous sense of dread, before suddenly going silent. Charly tilted her head to the left slightly and raised her thin, blonde right eyebrow in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder why it sto-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sharp pain interrupted her statement, forcing her to clench her belly a third time. This was the last warning that she was given by her body before it happened. The storm of putrid gas had swelled to a size that exceeded the dimensions of capacity that her stomach could provide and forced its way out. Before Charly knew what was happening, the mass of gas shot up her throat and erupted with a thunderous boom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b>~*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP P!*~</b></i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery window within a 15 mile radius was instantly shattered and the glass that fell from the monumental skyscrapers unfortunately fell onto many of the now deafened denizens. Most of the car alarms in the city rang, though all were drowned out by Charly\u2019s apocalyptic eructation. Said eructation could be heard from any neighboring city and carried with it the stench of quasi-digested soft drink. The odor took on a repulsive brown tint that flew at the speed one would a hurricane to be. People, animals, belongings, and other miscellaneous objects were blown away by winds originating from the prepubescent female, crashing and dying when meeting any stationary structures. The sheer power of the belch ripped through the ground, collapsing a vast array of buildings and creating crevices that consumed any poor soul unable to escape. The belligerent burp bellowed for 20 seconds before bidding the world adieu, and it was unlikely to be missed. Standing at the epicenter of this unnatural disaster was the nigh-130 foot tall giantess, blushing a dark crimson and clasping both hands over her mouth as a new slew of hot tears dripped down her cheeks. Against her best intentions, all of Charly\u2019s actions wrought more havoc and hysteria and after all that had happened, she only had the heart to whisper two words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Charly accepted and let the girls go first. Each one chugged a soda and burped at the exact same time. The force was actually powerful enough to move Charly back a few feet. \"Beat that, big girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharly grinned. \"Not bad girls, I'm very impressed. But let's see you beat this one!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Charly was appalled by what she had done. The 12 year old imagined her mother as one of the numerous thousands of casualties for whom she was to blame. Such a thought sent her to her knees in horror. She couldn\u2019t believe that she was the cause of such devastation dealt to the city without a name. As tears continued to fall down her face, Charlotte decided that it would be best for her to leave, so as to spare any potential survivors from her actions. The giantess tiptoed her way out of the ruined city, making sure not to accidently crush something else important. While doing so, Charly fanned away the air around her, it having been polluted by her cataclysmic belch. Given her new size, the girl made it to the city limits in a few minutes, and took one last look at the place that she destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trek from that nameless town was a painful one. Not physically, as her titanic body gifted her with enhanced endurance and stamina, but emotionally. Charlotte still couldn\u2019t get the images of death out of her mind. She continued mentally kicking herself for what she\u2019d done, still wondering how this happened to her to begin with. Charly wandered aimlessly, not particularly caring about where she was going, just wanting to get away from that nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Two hours later\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe preteen\u2019s solo exodus brought her to quaint little town (which also has no name for the sake of fairness). Even from a distance, she could tell that it was much smaller than the last one. It was only about ten blocks wide and the population couldn\u2019t have exceeded 2,000 people. When Charlotte crossed the border into the settlement, she noticed something strange (relatively speaking, of course): there was nothing there. The deeper she got into the town, the greater her nervousness became. Though the buildings were intact, the streets were deprived of any citizens, cars, or any other signs that it had once been inhabited. The buildings themselves weren\u2019t even that impressive, the highest of which barely reaching up to Charly\u2019s now empty stomach. With an inhuman view of the entire city, Charlotte was still unable to spot anyone who looked like they might live here, save for one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying down on the ground a couple blocks away was a small person, supposedly unconscious. Fearing the worse, the titaness sprinted toward it, leaving more foot-shaped craters in the roads and stirring up winds strong enough to knock over the abandoned automobiles. The ground shook so violently that the person was jolted out of their sleep. Dazed, the person turned toward the source of the tremors and was shocked by what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Who are you??\u201d The person asked in astonishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharly blushed at the question, and also at the one who asked it. A young boy who looked the same age as her, and was sporting blue jean shorts, a white t-shirt, red tennis shoes with orange toe caps and laces, and gray socks. His neck-length hair and thin eyebrows were dark brown; his irises had a yellow hue. Freckles peppered his tanned skin on his cheeks and forehead. He appeared rather cute to her, even though he looked terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Charlotte. What\u2019s your name?\u201d She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDavid.\u201d He answered. \u201cHow are you so tall?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I was at a modeling audition and somehow I just turned into a giant.\u201d Charlotte responded, shrugging her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, do you know what that thunder was?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Thunder?\u201d She repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, there was a loud booming sound that came from the north.\u201d David explained. \u201cIt happened around two hours ago. Everyone here was so startled by it that they left. I got left behind in the commotion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharly\u2019s face softened at this, wondering where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes your family know that you\u2019re still here?\u201d She inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, I\u2019m an orphan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess clasped her hands to her mouth. If anything, she could relate to losing a family member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s ok-\u201d The boy tried to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand! I\u2019m the one who caused that thunder.\u201d Charlotte interrupted. \u201cWhen I got this big, I got really thirsty and drank a truck full of soda. After that, I burped so loudly that I destroyed the city that I was in!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m the reason that this town is deserted and you\u2019re all alone!\u201d She cried. \u201cI\u2019m a monster!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave had to take a minute to register what he just heard. A 129-foot tall girl walked up to him and told him that she made his entire town leave him. Needless to say, it was a lot to take in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, Charlotte. You\u2019re not a monster.\u201d He finally chimed in. \u201cI bet you were just scared of what happened to you. Anyone would if they were in your shoes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte sniffed and stared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 I feel awful for what I did. All those people are gone because of me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou only made an accident. Don\u2019t hold it against yourself.\u201d David assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharly was surprised by his kindness and blushed even more because of it. This caused David to blush in return, looking away from the female colossus. Then, he was surprised when she laid a big wet smooch on his face. The prepubescent male looked up at her, and she giggled at his flustered expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHee hee hee. Thank you, David.\u201d She said with a slight smile. \u201c But you can call me Charly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid smiled in turn, happy that she wasn\u2019t focusing on the past anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do you want to do now?\u201d Dave asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharly brought her left index finger to her chin as she pondered her next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. Well, I\u2019m still feeling pretty hot, and since you\u2019re the only one here, I suppose I can remove my shirt.\u201d She suggested with a playful grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then proceeded to pull of her black and white shirt, revealing her once more flat stomach and leaving her in only her white panties and bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want, there\u2019s a large lake outside out the town that you might be able to fit in.\u201d The boy suggested back, his blush intensifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an excited giggle, Charly picked up her new friend with her left index finger and thumb and waltzed out of the town. In a few minutes, they\u2019d arrived at the lake and Dave hadn\u2019t exaggerated its size: The lake had a perfectly circular shape and a diameter of 250 feet. Charly sat David on the soft green grass and dunked her right foot in the lake. The contrasting cool temperature of the water made her reel back her foot before dipping it back in. Goosebumps started dotting her legs as she sank her left one in the liquid. Charly laid her back on the ground and sighed in relief, having found a way to beat the heat that hopefully wouldn\u2019t destroy another city. As she took the rare opportunity to relax, David decided to walk up to the docile giantess and feel her skin. He placed a hand on her side and was taken aback by how smooth it felt. Clearly, Charly moisturized quite often. The titanic girl faintly felt the boy\u2019s rubbing and giggled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, David, could you maybe give me a belly rub?\u201d She requested. \u201cYour hands feel great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette\u2019s eyes widened at her requested, but nodded in agreement and was again picked up by Charly. This time though, he was placed on top of her abdomen. Marveling at the sight before him, David got to work on his impromptu massage as he caressed, kneaded, and scratched his new friend\u2019s tummy. Charlotte laughed even louder at the feeling, enjoying this as much as he was. But then she began moving, and this lead to an odd situation (again relatively speaking). As Charly tossed and turned, David was rolled and tumbled all over her belly, eventually plummeting into the big hole at the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s fall into Charly\u2019s navel was thankfully not a hard one. He landed on a soft layer of skin, but was wedged inside. He tried to move, but this only made things harder. With every motion he made in there, Charly felt an even greater sensation than before. This lead to her giggling louder and wriggling about even wilder, ironically making his wriggling to escape even more difficult. This left him with only one option left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charly, I'm in your belly button! Please stop moving!\" He screamed at the top of his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut does she hear him?</span></div></div>",

That was awful!\u201d Dave replied hastily, a searing blush covering his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, if you say so.\u201d She scoffed, not buying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess placed the flustered boy back on the wet grass before sliding her body into the lake, surprised at it being deep enough to contain her body, and let her frame float in the water as she took her time bathing the smell of sweat off. All the while, David couldn\u2019t help but stare at the titaness scrubbing her armpits and legs, trying to remove the grime that had naturally accumulated on her. Charlotte caught on to this and decided to have a little fun with her audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, she reared her pretty head out of the water\u2019s surface and shook it from left to right, whipping drops of water from her hair that soaked Dave. Then, Charly brought the upper half of her body above the waves and placed her hands on her hips, her legs slowly kicking to keep herself afloat. Following that, she rotated her body 45\u00b0 to the left, making her right side look more prominent, and gave the boy a playful wink. Next, Charlotte raised her hands up to the back of her neck, making her elbows bend up over her head, and shifted her body another 45\u00b0. Now her entire left side was hidden from view. Finally, Charlotte swam to the shore and planted her elbows into the dirt, resting her soft head on her closed hands. During this, she flashed a cheeky grin at David, making him sweat profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how did you like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-It wuuhh.. was, uh.. fine, I guess\u2026\u201d He scrambled for a reply, scratching the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharly cranked her head to the left a little bit as she exited the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. That was only \u2018fine\u2019.\u201d She mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that he made a mistake, Dave tried to correct himself, but only succeeded in stumbling over his own words. Once again, Charlotte snickered at his dorky antics, but then felt emptiness inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 I think I\u2019m getting hungry again.\u201d She stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we could go back to my town and see if there\u2019s any food.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good.\u201d The white clad girl agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering her friend and putting her shirt back on, the colossal child walked back towards the boy\u2019s hometown. Once there, Charly let David down near his orphanage while she approached a dollar store. Before she could eat though, she heard a faint sound out in the distance. Charlotte moved her head in the direction of the commotion, and was shocked at what she saw: A military unit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, David himself was riding his purple bicycle that was conveniently able to seat two people. He\u2019d also heard about the eminent arrival of the army on the radio and was prepared to flee the town with three grocery bags full of supplies. He was about to warn Charly of what happened, but was surprised to see her running toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDavid! The military is- Ugh!\u201d Charly tried to warn, but was cut off by a sharp pain in her abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCharly! What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Dave asked, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess once again clutched her tummy in pain as she felt a sensation similar to when she first became a giantess\u2026 but also like the opposite. From her perspective, everything around her was steadily get larger, a direct contrast to what happened at the start of this whole incident. Dave\u2019s jaw dropped as he watched Charlotte shrink before his eyes. After 30 seconds, Charly had returned to her original size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCharly, what happened? Why\u2019d you shrink?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know.\u201d She responded, feeling exhausted from what she went through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, whatever happened, we need to leave now!\u201d Dave stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte nodded in agreement and the two fled the now empty town, caring not about where they went, but about getting away from the lurking military presence. By the time the army had arrived, the duo were already in the next city. Charly and David slowed down a bit, thinking that they could afford to take it easy for a bit. However, Charly\u2019s eye caught a newsstand with the headline, \u201cCity Destroyed! Natural Disaster of Unknown Origin Leaves Thousands Dead!\u201d dominating the top half of the newspapers\u2019 front page. Charly felt sick to her stomach just by reading that title. At her behest, David purchased one of them and was appalled when they got to the obituary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.. no. No! NO!\u201d Charly yelled after reading that her mother was counted amongst the deceased, causing. Dave to clasp his right hand over her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCharly, please be quiet. We have to try and lay low for a while, just until we can get somewhere safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s a wide open stretch of land further south. We could try going there.\u201d Charlotte suggested, failing to fight back tears of anguish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, we\u2019ll take the city buses as far south as they\u2019ll go.\u201d David planned. \u201cThen, we ride on the tandem bicycle for the rest of the trip.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll need a disguise or something until then.\u201d Charly stated, donning a pair of sunglasses and a pink bandana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe children hopped on a bus, their bicycle being held on a rack at the front. The bus travelled down to the edge of the city before letting our protagonists off. The pair rode across the next city, having some close encounters with some militia who were investigating anything related to the disaster. By the skin of their teeth, they\u2019d made it to another bus and sat quietly while it took them to edge of the next city. They kept to themselves, not talking or responding to anyone who might recognize Charlotte. Their hairs stood on end when a toddler began tugging on Charly\u2019s bandana, but his mother put a stop to it and apologized. Situations similar to these occurred many times on their journey, but by the slimmest of margins, they\u2019d avoided detection. By the time the kids finally left the urban scene, David had used up all of his money as Charly was broke. Then, they were faced with the long bike ride away from their troubles and their old lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Three hours later\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biking exodus was physically taxing on the adolescents. Their food was exhausted and their feet were killing them. However, now that they were alone, they told each other about their own lives. Like how Charly\u2019s father died in a car crash when she was six, so now she was an orphan too, and how David lost his folks to a serial killer with knife. Eventually, they came across a small wooden cabin in the flat wilderness. The bike was parked at the doorstep and the two made their way inside, though they were surprised that it was unlocked. David sat the remains of their supplies, but was caught off guard when he received a gripping hug from his acquaintance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was for everything you\u2019ve done to help me.\u201d Charlotte giggled before planting a long kiss on his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was even more surprised by this, and he couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He had to let her know!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCharly, I want to say that\u2026 that  I love you.\u201d David\u2019s whole face lit up in a scarlet blush. \u201cYou\u2019re the kindest, cutest girl that I\u2019ve ever met, and I\u2019m lucky that I\u2019ve met you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharly\u2019s facial colors soon matched his own, and then exceeded them when he motioned to kiss her back, but now on the lips. Charly was surprised by this, but soon returned the gesture. They spent the next few holding each other in a loving embrace eventually Charly was placed in the same orphanage as David and they continued their relationship \u2013 the one good thing to come out of all of this.</span></div></div>",

So much so that he starred in main roles for the past couple of years, and so it comes to no surprise that he\u2019s about to have a another movie to be recording today, but it\u2019s gonna be rather than he thought it was gonna be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob\u2019s main role is that he\u2019s gonna be a giant in a movie, and he expects to have some special effects, green screens and all.  That\u2019s all he knows at the moment, but what he doesn\u2019t know is that the director named Tommy, decides to make a surprise, by making Jacob a giant for real!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Tommy has is he\u2019s brought a growth ray gun, that can be used to make Jacob grow huge and letting everyone believe everything\u2019s so real.  Because of how people react to the effects they already knew, Tommy is hoping this could blow everyone\u2019s mind, both watching on screen, and those witness it in person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow all he needs is the biggest star, and so it happens on filming day, when he see\u2019s Jacob coming over to see in, looking excited to be part of another major film again.  So the director tries to remain professional, still letting a kid unaware of this surprise, and greeted him with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello there, Jacob!  You ready for your next movie role as a giant kid?\u201d  Tommy asked in greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes!  I\u2019ve been looking to this all day.  I can\u2019t wait to be part of it.\u201d  Jacob nodded with a wide smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re glad to have you onboard kid, and especially when you get to play this particular role of the movie...</span></div></div>",

I thought my Dad took it away after that.\u201d  Adam was much confused, but surprised with a smiling expression, since it\u2019s been a good number of years, despite he was only a toddler from that incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when he could only wonder if this stuff really works?  He would surely wanted to test it out and see if it grows or the other?  But the question is, does he wanna ask his Dad, Wayne to give it a test, or would he be able to do it all by himself?

The machine hummed to life. A whirring sound began and the pitch shifted higher and higher until Adam had to cover his ears. With a loud boom a burst of energy left the barrel passing through the basement window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine burst into flames. Adam in a panic began batting the machine with a towel until the flames went out. It was clear that the machine was out of commission for an extended period of time. It was not clear if it would ever run again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning his head to the wall, Adam covered his mouth. \u201cOh crap.\u201d A huge circular feature was present extending through the wall. Studying the edges of the wall, Adam noticed the damaged building materials looked weird. On the floor was a pile of tiny bricks and at the edge of the hole the bricks had a trapezoidal shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking out the window towards the street, Andy notice the fence beyond was also distorted. Crawling through the wall, Adam walked towards the street. On the ground, Andy found a tiny Tesla car. Kneeling down and looking through the window, it was clear that this was not a toy, but a vehicle which was reduced in size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the car, he tucked it behind the fence. He then returned walking the path of the blast. Along the path Adam found reduced bushes and tree. At one point he even thought he saw a tiny cat, but it fled before Adam could catch it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning his eyes to the path, his heart dropped. He saw that the blast struck the community pool. Running over, he hopped the fence. The pool structure itself was fine, so he sighed feeling relieved no one was struck by the blast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he turned to leave, out of the corner of his eye he saw some motion. Cornering the creature, he knelt down. To his dismay he saw two woman shaking and holding one another. The two women looked like mother and daughter. The daughter was college aged and her mother was in her mid-40s. Both women looked amazing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome here ladies, I am so sorry for what has happened to you. My father\u2019s shrinking machine exploded.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet away you horrible giant, leave us be,\u201d screamed the younger woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, you have to come with me.\u201d Adam reached in and wrapped his hand around the waist of the older woman. She was wearing a two-piece so he could feel her skin very well. She was warm and soft, but just beneath that softness clearly muscle. She was very fit. The middle age woman began screaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe daughter clutched onto the mother, \u201cLeave her alone you monster!\u201d She was crying buckets and punching Adam\u2019s hand. He repressed the desire to laugh at the scene. She was clearly doing nothing to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his free hand, he extended a middle finger and petted the young woman\u2019s head. She shrieked and turned around. \u201cWhy are you torturing us?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty woman, please let me help you.\u201d He gently touched her head again. Pulling his finger forward, he wiped a tear from her cheek. \u201cLet me take you home so I can try and figure out how to make you big again.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to back away. \u201cLittle woman, I am not going to leave you out here to get eaten or taken by someone else. However, I am going to give you a moment. Here is your mother back. She is safe, I just want to help you both.\u201d Adam released the mom, who ran over and cradled her adult daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam turned around and found the women\u2019s bag. He noticed on the next chair over was another woman asleep. While the women below the chair were about a foot tall, this sleeping woman was about six inches tall. She clearly was closer to the center of the blast, but hadn\u2019t noticed yet. He quickly snatched up that woman and tucked her into his pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the mother and daughter, he placed the bag down in front of them. \u201cPlease climb in. I won\u2019t touch you, but you need to come with me to be safe.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mother escorted the daughter up the flap of the bag. They slide down and slump down into a towel. The mother gives Adam a thumbs up. He reached in and petted her hair. She gave him a weak smile as he zipped up the bag.</span></div></div>",

Of course not! Go back and help your dad invent the toaster! Loser!!\" Troy laughed as he and the other kids trailed off leaving the ten year old behind slightly steamed and hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not fair! So what if my dad's a total nut case who likes inventing things? He's made a lot of cool things over the years!\" Adam tried telling himself struggling not to cry as he walked on home \"Those other kids are just jealous cause none of their dads are that smart! If I had my way I'd show them all!\" As he walked into his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>End flashback </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Adam was standing in front of the exact machine that a bunch of years back transformed him into a nearly 100 Foot giant toddler since his dad made a few minor adjustments,it would probably be easier to manage. As he started randomly pressing buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww come on dad,couldn't you at least have left a simple instruction booklet informing me how to work this thing-of-bob? Ah-ha bingo! There it is!\" He spotted the huge red button at the center and pressed it in for a while nothing happened and disappointed Adam was set to head back upstairs when there was a low rumbling sound that got louder and louder(luckily Adam was home alone with both of his parents at work so there was very little chance of him getting into trouble or someone hearing the commotion) as he realized...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it's working cool! Now wait what did I do before all those years ago? Oh yeah stand in front of it!\" As he ran over to where the big gun thingy was and....KA-BOOOOOOOOOMMM!! The sound and fascinating light show sent various types of energy into his body,Adam immediately felt faint,his knees all wobbly and his head dizzy yet he stood firm and managed to grunt his teeth through the pain this lasted for a few minutes or close to a hour until it finally ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's over! Huh? It's over? A-am I bigger yet?\" He wondered as the smoke cleared and he slowly got to his feet looking at the now totaled machine in ruins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwww Nooo... Dad's totally going to kill me when he sees this! But...but I'm bigger! <b>I Am Bigger,Really BIG!</b>\" He grinned as he looked down at himself,his clothes were definitely tighter and his sneakers were close to tearing but he couldn't care less all that mattered was that he was finally HUGE like before but just how big was he? </span></div></div>",

However as Adam walked down the freeway of the Mojave desert he has a strange case of deja vu. He doesn't remember growing to giant size when he was two years old but walking down the same road gives him a gut feeling. Before Adam realized where he was walking too, following that familiar feeling he had found himself in downtown Las Vegas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>WOW. I REMEMBER THIS PLACE.</b>\" The giant ginger says as he walks towards the brightly lit city as the sun sets in the distance. This felt great to Adam, after being blown up by his dad, he has had recurring dreams just like this. Being big in Las Vegas with millions of people cheering him on and praising him. The people on the ground feel the earth shake as something large approaches from the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giant Boy!\" One person shouts out. \"Look out.\" Others either stared in awe, run in panic, or quickly pulled out their cameras to take pictures. The titanic ten year old looked down at all of the tiny people running around him like little ants. The feeling of power over them and the attention he was getting was intoxicating. Adam didn't even care about the destruction he left behind, his red sneakers leaving cracks in the pavement with his heavy foot steps. He was too busy looking at the bright lights from the casinos like New York New York, MGM Grand, Excalibur and others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>MAN, I'M PARCHED.</b>\" The freckled kid says as he wipes away the sweat off of his brow, huge droplets of the salty liquid rains down and splatters on the sidewalk. Adam looks and sees a concert going on. He walks over to it, crushing cars under his feet without even feeling the slightest discomfort. Off to the entrance was a big Pepsi truck. The enormous preteen reaches down and picks up the blue, red and white trailer, peeling the back open like a can and chugs the content. It was like watching a Pepsi commercial. The citizens of Las Vegas watch as his throat expands as gallons of soda goes down his gullet, sounding like loud thunder with each gulp. He finishes draining the entire truck's trailer, crushing it in his hand like a can and letting it drop to the ground in the empty parking lot. A loud rumble was heard coming from his stomach.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbrown\"><br>\r\n<b>BBBBBBBLLLLLLLLLRRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUUPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!</b><br>\r\n</span><br>\r\nAn enormous belch is let out by the 100 foot tall Adam. Hot winds erupt from his mouth, blowing back trash, the hair on people's heads, and the leaves off of the nearby palm trees. The people nearby cowered as they screamed fearfully and held tightly onto each other as the tornado like winds threaten to blow them away and several windows literally exploded as shattered pieces of glass fell to the ground and the ground itself slightly shook!<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbrown\"><br>\r\n<b>BBBBBBBLLLLLLLLLRRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUUPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!</b><br>\r\n</span><br>\r\nAfter a minute, the giant finishes his monstrous burp looking a bit embarrassed as he at first,slapped a huge hand over his mouth staring around nervously. As all the people left standing, soon felt noxious from the horrible smelling fumes. \"<b>OOPS.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a beautiful day outside. The birds were chirping, kids were laughing and playing. There wasn't even a single cloud in the nice blue sky. Everything was peaceful and quiet. However, nothing can truly stay that way. Some people started to hear complaining. Most just shrugged and continued on with their day. However, the complaints started to get louder, and the ground started to shake. Everyone looked towards where the noise was coming from. They waited patiently as the noise grew very loud. Suddenly, Veruca Salt appeared from behind some buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost people remembered her from Willy Wonka's contest. The giantess was wearing the same red dress as she wore to the factory.  Veruca was barefoot and was only wearing panties and bra under her dress (no other pants). The angry girl stomped through the city and kicked a car so hard, it shot up to space. The next driver wasn't lucky either. Veruca stomped her foot down as hard as she could on a blue sedan, making the driver flat as a pancake.<br>\r\n\"I want to have fun! I want it NOW!\" She yelled. She picked up two males and lifted up her dress, dropping them in her panties. \"Squirm pests! Squirm squirm SQUIRM! As for all of you!\" She said looking at the other citizens. \"Bring me food! NOW! If I don't get what I want, I'll eat you instead!\" She said with a serious look. Her stomach growled, as if to show just how hungry she was. Veruca lied down in the middle of the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne woman brought her juicy vegetables. She hoped Veruca would be pleased. However, her hopes quickly faded. Veruca gave a sour frown.<br>\r\n\"I don't want vegetables, I want tasty food! I want candy and chocolate! Don't try to trick me!\" Veruca yelled. Veruca grabbed the woman and threw the poor girl right in her mouth, swallowing her whole. Unfortunatly  the girl tasted very good. If she couldn't get more food, she may have to snack on other humans. She slammed her fist down. \"Get moving! As for the three of you!\" She said, pointing to three women. \"I'm tired of walking around. Rub my feet NOW! Unless you want to be squished under them!\" The girls quickly ran over to her feet and started to rub. Veruca gave an evil smile. She was glad that she took that formula from Wonka. The citizens returned with lots of chocolate. They climbed up her body and threw it in. She loved the taste of everything she was eating. One boy tripped and fell on Veruca's tongue. However, even though Veruca could feel this teenager, she made no effort to help him. She simply closed her mouth and gulped him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeruca's three foot slaves were trying their best to please their new queen. However, Veruca couldn't feel any of them because of the size of their hands.<br>\r\n\"Why don't you listen! I told you to rub my feet! What are you doing, playing go fish? Let me get them closer to you, PATHETIC BUGS!\" She pushed her feet down on top of them. Their bones were slowly crushed and broken. The women shrieked as they were dying by Veruca's smelly foot. The giantess rubbed her foot on them until their bodies popped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeruca kept eating chocolate until she felt ready for her deadly attack as she felt her stomach grumbling louder than ever.<br>\r\n\"CITIZENS, BEHOLD MY POWER!\" She yelled. She sat up and burped as loud as she could. \"BUUUUUUURRRRRRRPPPPP!\" Many humans were blown back by it, some even passed out. Veruca could hear windows shattering. She even heard some sirens going off. She laughed, \"Oops excuse me!\" She smirked pretending to gasp out-loud  and cover her mouth pleased with her destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo celebrate her victory, she reached in her panties and started to rub herself. She could feel the men in there and decided to 'help'. She made sure to be rough. She moaned as more food was brought. She ate her food and press harder. In doing so, she crushed one of them. She rubbed faster and faster, until cum landed on the other male. She pulled him out and smiled. He was terrified of her and Veruca wanting even more fun-time from her 'toys' began stroking his stomach he squirmed and laughed begging her to stop \"I WANT TO HEAR YOU LAUGH,I WANT IT NOW!!\" She ordered as she stroked his stomach faster Veruca ignored his pleas and begging as she kept tickling him until she got bored and surprisingly gently put him down however she still had no mercy or guilt and looked around and saw a bag of chocolate that someone brought. She grabbed it and threw both the wet man and the chocolate in her mouth. She mashed them both up and swallowed. Though she wanted to eat more food, she came up with a evil plan.  </span></div></div>",

Her fart was so big, almost every building went down and a lot of people fainted. Veruca gave a cruel laugh as she got back up. She turned around only to be disappointed. One of the buildings had survived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a sky scraper that was taller than her. Both the fact that it was still standing and that it was taller than her beautiful body made her upset. She went over to it and looked inside. She saw something that upset her more. Everyone looked completely unaware of what was going on. It wasn't until someone saw her outside that people started to freak out. She punched through the thin glass and grabbed a random person. Her prisoner was a blond female wearing a black suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is unfair! I should be taller than that building! I want to be the tallest thing in this city! Take this tower down NOW,\" she yelled. Her victim was really scared. She looked down to see that she had no way of escaping. It didn't help that she was afraid of heights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O . . Okay. You just need to give us a couple of days. I'm sure that-\" she started, however Veruca got really upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A couple of days!? I won't wait that long! I'll just knock it down myself!\" Veruca chucked the woman behind her and cracked her knuckles. She backed up so she had room. The giantess started to run and slammed into the building. It shook like there was a natural earthquake. The tower fell to its side. Veruca laughed, but didn't feel like a victor yet. She thought of the many ways she could finish the job. Veruca could step on the skyscraper. She could sit on it. She could even hit it with her hands. However, she thought of the best way to deal with this. She grabbed the end and broke it off so it was short enough to pull it up. Veruca grabbed the main part and lifted it up over her head. Her hands started to bend it. Glass shattered and bodies started to fall. She opened her mouth, welcoming the people to her stomach. Once she felt she got enough people, she tossed the building far away. It landed with a large thud, hitting people before it stopped. Veruca wanted to have more fun though, so she . . .</span></div></div>",
