            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It seems a cruel trend that's risen up to consume what was once championed by ethical human morality has finally spread beyond anyone's control. When prisons became too crowded by the excess of impoverished people and rampant criminals, a solution was sought out to alleviate the monumental drain on the tax payers money. A solution was found in the rising reliability of shrinking technology, produced by private corporations as a means to reduce and safely detain large numbers of inmates in smaller capacity facilities. A controversial action, to be sure, though few really complained when the act passed and prisoners everywhere were reduced either for the duration of their sentence, or permanently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFew thought it would escalate, but with the new practice making full blown prisons almost entirely obsolete, an economic vacuum was in need of filling. The prison system was now in possession of copious shrinking devices, millions of shrunken inmates, and little income. No one knows who's idea it was behind the scenes to turn these reduced persons, or 'tinies', into a product. Prisoners sentenced to life were packaged and auctioned off to the highest bidders. When the small stunt proved profitable, and demand for tinies increased, it took less than a year to put through legislation that made prison time synonymous with shrinking and redistribution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commoditization boosted the economy, but supply would always be limited. As ridiculous as the laws had become, the country was devastated to find new laws passed that found those under a specific economic line suitable for reduction. Today, any minor violation are drop into the poverty line has become grounds for arrest, shrinking, and being packaged as a commodity sold anywhere in the nation, though particularly favored in wealthier regions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho are you in all this?</span></div></div>",

Someone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP!!\" a chorus of stressed voices joined together for a rare moment of unity to silence the one person who'd yet to get with the program. All of them had been dumped into this transparent plastic bag for days now, having been shipped from manufacturing and delivered to this truck stop in what looked like the middle of no where. The brief glimpse they could get when the chip shelf was empty showed a vast stretch of desert beyond the grimy glass door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan was one of few who'd remained silent through the last two days. Her limbs were weary from pushing herself against the others. At night, they'd all resolve to lump together in a pile at the bottom of the plastic. This wasn't a comfortable situation for anyone involved, particularly the tomboyish blond he repelled any unwarranted touching of her person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer disgust was only countered by her hopelessness in her position. She knew what they were doing her. They all knew, the one or two remained in denial. They'd heard of some folks that bought their packages to free the people inside, some even looking after them under the laws nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else either ignored them or took them for what they were. Food. A commodity to be purchased and consumed by the lucky customer that nabbed them. Didn't matter where they were from, their life stories are whether they deserved to wind up where they did. They were all calculated portions of a serving with their nutritional value written on the back of the package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, or not, this particular stop seemed entirely out of the way from the civilized world. They and the other bags of people had barely been touched as the days dragged on, only one being purchased by a local on the first day.<br>\r\nBeyond the layer of dread she had come to terms with, the absolute boredom was the closest thing to driving her mad. Helpless to do anything but wait to be bought and killed, or 'expire' and be thrown away with everyone else.</span></div></div>",

Her dog, a little brown and white terrier, watched her from his seat as she climbed out of the cab. He was a good boy and stayed in his seat even with the windows rolled down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTera was an average looking woman. She had soft brown eyes, a button nose, and curves that softened the bored attitude she always carried. Her brunette hair was tied up in a ponytail, sticking out the back of her trucker\u2019s cap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished pumping the fuel before going inside in search of her evening meal. And maybe some snacks. She purchased an extra long chili dog with extra chili and cheese, a giant cup of soda, and some chips. The bit of a gut that hung over the waistband of her pants attested to her sedentary lifestyle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was selecting her chips, her eyes fell on a bag of people snacks. \u201cHmm. Haven\u2019t had these in a while,\u201d she mused. \u201cMight as well.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed the pack off the shelf and made her way to the front counter. She was careful in setting down the drink and chili dog but took no care with the people snacks and chips. She let those drop first so she had better stability in setting down the main part of her meal.<br>\r\n__________________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan had kept a dull eye on the chubby brunette woman who\u2019d entered the shop. She\u2019d gone right past their bags, so Reagan didn\u2019t much believe this would be their time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow wrong she was when the woman walked back, casually glanced at their packaging, and gave their death sentence. The bag hadn\u2019t been in motion since arriving on the shelf, only shifting with their small struggles and activity inside. The hand grasped around the sealed top of the plastic, letting the screaming people flail around with each swing of their prison. Reagan was smart and braced herself in the corner, using the leverage against her neighbors to keep herself secure. For her, it was like one of those old swing rides at her towns annual carnival, except with far less safety precautions and no joy to be had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing carelessly tossed onto the counter jostled the dozen people further, knocking them all to the ground as the package settled on its side. Reagan was thrown onto another young man, a frightened red head who clutched her arms when he felt her presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJesus christ! This is it, were fucking dead! Help me tear this shit, help me get out, we can still-\u201c Reagan\u2019s hand clamped over his mouth, hushing him bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I hear one more whinge outta you, you\u2019re not making it out of this bag, capich\u00e9?\u201d She pushed herself off of him, uninterested in his mewling protests. Everyone else was doing no better or worse then him, all bargaining and infighting to stave off what was by this point inevitable, as soon as the declaration for above them was made:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForty-one, fifty-seven total, Miss.\u201d The tired shop keeper said, tallying up her charge after taxes.<br>\r\n__________________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTera slid her card as the clerk dumped her snacks in a plastic bag. She slid it over her arm, gathered her food and headed out the door. There was certainly a developed practice in her movements as she climbed into her truck. She put her chili dog on the dash, her drink in a cup holder, and dropped her chips and snacks in the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright mutsy,\u201d she said to her dog. \u201cLet\u2019s get going. Don\u2019t have time to spare.\u201d<br>\r\n__________________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing could stop them from being victim to the woman\u2019s natural sway as she returned to her truck, everyone tossed about like peanuts and Reagan unfortunately caught in the middle of it. Where fear had dominated the general mood among them, Reagan only felt anger for the little things. How incompetent her \u201ccell mates\u201d were at keeping still, how stuffy it was inside the even bigger plastic shopping bag that now contained their own, and how long would it take before she was finally freed from these assholes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind stuttered. Even she couldn\u2019t ignore the oncoming horror of what followed even that small victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bag was tossed aside and the people went tumbling with it, abandoned on the floor of the passenger seat while the occupants painstakingly recovered from the rough trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on, everyone, Hold on!!\u201d One of the men shouted over the rest. Their small voices didn\u2019t carry far with the acoustic padding the bag provided, but the people within heard well enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe air holes! We can reach them now and squeeze through, c\u2019mon!\u201d At his lead, the majority of people ceased toward the head of the bag where the miniature holes allowed air into their crevasse. Quickly they began reaching their arms through and attempting to push their whole bodies out. The plastic wouldn\u2019t give though, not nearly elastic enough for them to succeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan didn\u2019t participate, waiting with two other stragglers at the newly opened up space near the base. She was taking this rare moment to relax while the idiots made their escape attempt. Who knows; if they made it, maybe she\u2019d follow. Only after the first wave inevitably got caught so she could leave while their owner was occupied. That was a slim chance, if any though.</span></div></div>",

Then she folded the open top of the bag over and stuffed it between her legs for safekeeping.

Daylight reached them again, and the majority fell back to the bottom. The poor scrawny chick was stuck halfway through one of the air holes, her only modest ass and chest hindering her escape. She was at least lucky to not be noticed when pudgy fingers opened the seal with a ringing crack! Those same digits dropped in and snatched up two guys and an older woman. Reagan was tucked in the corner again, pushing people aside to not be smothered prematurely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three initial samples were plopped onto a mucky brown surface, quickly covered in the hot spicy mess. They had little chance to recognize where they were before terrified eyes locked onto the woman\u2019s looming face. The lady screamed, and the other two started to run directly away from her through the sludge, comically just running further down the Hot Dog.<br>\r\n__________________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTera raised the messy food to her mouth and shoved a large bite in. Her teeth cut cleanly through. As she pulled away, a string of cheese stretched between her lips and the chili dog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe broke the string with a finger and promptly licked the cheese off it. She noticed an additional burst of flavor as she chewed and nodded in approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTha\u2019s good,\u201d she said around a mouth full of food. \u201cNeed to do that more often.\u201d<br>\r\n__________________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan saw from below the first one to go. Not directly, of course; but her assumption was validated by the driver\u2019s comment. \u2018Poor bastards,\u2019 she thought, the most sympathy any of the condemned would get from her. She was resting against the corner again where she was out of the way. The others were once again trying to leave through the top, crawling up the sides and trying to smooth it out against the woman\u2019s thigh. \u201cHey dumbasses! You\u2019re just making it easier to grab ya!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFack off, cunt!\u201d Australian? Interesting. He\u2019d die all the same, maybe save some time if she heard his funny little accent. Reagan continues waiting, refusing to associate herself with the mindless pissants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove, the first of the two men saw the woman obliterate the unfortunate woman in her sloppy mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne continued running down the chili dog, and the last saw the wasted potential, instead chose to make an attempt at jumping over the side. A quick death was better than being food. Unfortunately, his mobility and range were far overestimated. All he accomplished was falling into the ditch between the dog and the bun, drowning in the creek of chilly.<br>\r\n__________________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTera opened the bag and dropped a couple more people onto the chili dog. She finished it off and used the chips to scrape the leftover chili off the sides of the cardboard container. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe washed it all down with several gulps of her drink then sighed in contentment. \u201cSo good. Alright. Time to go.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started up the truck again and headed out. She pulled out of the parking lot and onto the road. It was a little while before she decided to snack again. She unrolled the back, grabbed one and popped them into her mouth. This time, she didn\u2019t chew. She just sucked on the little person until they lost their flavor. Then she swallowed them whole and alive.<br>\r\n__________________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there were four. Reagan was one of the handful of survivors yet overlooked by the truck drivers munchies. The motley crew had survived the chili dog massacre. This might\u2019ve meant they were safe for the time being if Reagan didn\u2019t know better. They hadn\u2019t been moved from her lap. That just made them a la carte. She was proved again when the giant hand returned to grab the Australian from the bag. He didn\u2019t get a chance to speak. Too bad, she might\u2019ve liked him.</span></div></div>",

The suns glare was peeking through the passenger window directly onto the bag in a short time, building to a loathsome heat that Reagan had to suffer through. Still, if there was one thing she hated more than the heat and the whimpering  madness from her compatriots, it had to be the waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d consigned herself to days of anticipating her last moments alive. No one told her it\u2019d be another stretch of patience before the chubby Bitch had the decency to finish her off. Sweat trickled done her face and chest, soaking into her factory issued bra and underwear. The road shook through the machinery they were all carried in, each jolt and shake a mind quaking tremor to her, breaking her sanity down with every standout bump in the road. All the while, she felt the heat emanating from the giant woman\u2019s leg at her back through the plastic barrier. With it came a distant thump thump from her normal human heart, helping her do normal human things at such a ridiculous scale to the small girl.<br>\r\nThe jumps, the shakes, and the beating on her back. Bump... bump... bump....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck it! I\u2019m done,\u201d Reagan sat up from her crouch, crawling up the crinkling ground to the entrance her fellow captivess had failed to crawl through. That\u2019s because they tried pulling themselves up or the crinkly plastic down to them. Reagan knew that her strength wouldn\u2019t cut it; however, her weight would influence the bags droop. Hopping higher up, she felt the bag give under her little weight and fall down to the driver\u2019s other thigh. The entrance had fallen to be level with the top of her leg, creating a simple tunnel out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe hell are you doing?!? Just stay down, she wont see us, please!\u201d A man tried to whisper shout at her from below. She simply threw him the bird and continued on her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout the suffocating shell surrounding her, the air felt crisper, cool. It was still stale from having been lived in by its occupants, but Reagan preferred it to the cramped prison she\u2019d lived in the last two days. No food or water, they were destined to expire if not purchased. So Reagan took advantage of the forbidden liberty to stretch her legs and reacquaint herself with her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a growling came from her right. While stretching her arm across her chest, she glanced over to see a small sized dog baring it\u2019s teeth at her. She simply glared at the dog, not bowing to its pitiful intimidation tactics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBark! Arp! Ar ar ar!\u201d The little thing started yelping in alert, clearly perturbed by the small bug that was crawling on its momma\u2019s lap without actually taking action.</span></div></div>",

She pulled out another person and popped them into her mouth. \u201cYou\u2019ve got until I hit the next traffic light.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh. That worked. She was pleasantly perplexed to be set on the dash board where she actually had some room to herself. Didn\u2019t have the same shock absorption as the human thigh, but the open space was a modest upgrade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay... uh, ya got a name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTera,\u201d the woman answered briefly. \u201cTera Labowski. And you?\u201d Her brown eyes glanced down at the tiny person on her dash as she strongly sucked on the one in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan caught brief glimpses of the damned mouthful. Maybe that was the guy who warned her not to leave the bag. Irony in action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d She found herself locked onto the screaming man muffled between the plush, snarky lips, but decided best to make eye contact, at the least for her manners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReagan Shrom, or I was. Depends where you stand on that philosophical spectrum.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTera shrugged and took a drink of her coke. She was an expert at stuffing the tiny between her cheek and gum to avoid him going down prematurely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t really,\u201d Tera said. \u201cI just enjoy what\u2019s in front of me.\u201d She belched as she drove, not bothering to be any sort of polite about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t suppress a chuckle, that burp must\u2019ve been hell to the guy stuffed in Tera\u2019s cheek. Still, Reagan got a brief whiff being in the blast zone, and her nose didn\u2019t like what it had to look forward to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeeyoo! \u2018Scuse you, Lady,\u201d she chuckled about, a small, hollow laugh faked for the benefit of keeping conversation. \u201cHonestly, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d actually agree. Didn't have much to blabber about.\u201d Somehow, she was revitalizing her old sociability, a stark contrast to the cold and dismissive the way she\u2019d treated everybody since her conviction. Maybe it\u2019d be worth pretending, at least to see how far she'd get. Who knew how far off the next light was anyway in the middle of Buckass, New Mexico, or wherever the fuck she was stocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, you been truckin\u2019 for a while? Where\u2019s this shipment heading?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have and it\u2019s heading down to Arizona,\u201d Tera said. \u201cPicked it up in Canada a few days ago. Started in Arkansas, tho, delivering local. Worked my way up from there and bought my own truck last year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArkansas?\u201d She perked up a bit, \u201cAnywhere near Bentonville?\u201d Already she was regretting her enthusiasm, but she\u2019d be wrong to disregard the first spark of interest she felt in weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe one and the same,\u201d Tera confirmed. \u201cStarted shipping for Walmart first. Hopped around some since then but Walmart always gives good references.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, what a coinkadink. Grew up there, and damn near expected I was the only one to get out.\u201d Reagan reclined against the plastic wall barricading the dash meters, stretching her leg out with the other bent and supporting her arms, \u201cIt\u2019s a small world after all, ain\u2019t it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess so.\u201d Tera slurped around the human in her mouth once more before swallowing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a long drink of her coke and put it back in the cup holder. \u201cI\u2019m the first in my family to get out. The men usually work in warehouses and factories and the women in diners and restaurants. So I\u2019m doing real good as far as my family is concerned. Living high on the hog and all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood on ya for that,\u201d she ignored the swallow that sent the condemned man to her gut, yet out of morbid curiosity watched her drink immediately after, picturing what must be happening to the people still alive in her, flooded by fizzy soda and forced to swim or drown in the dark.</span></div></div>",

What\u2019s the appeal on your end?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNew food,\u201d was Tera\u2019s chillingly casual answer. \u201cYou\u2019re a decent snack on your own but y\u2019all do make excellent toppings. First time for a chili dog today but y\u2019all do go good on ice cream or pizza or fresh popcorn. My boyfriend loves it when I wear whip cream and shrinkies during sex\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw what! Ewwww~\u201d she teased, sticking her tongue out, letting out a cute laugh, \u201cI know some folks got up to foolin around with \u2018em, but it just sounds weird. Like, unsanitary, or somethin.\u201d Her reaction to the later detail helped her brush off being bluntly called food herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back of her head, she could feel a small chance of surviving. A small chance to win some sympathy maybe, just maybe. Try to distance herself from her identity as food. Appeal to her better nature. If she wasn't a totally heartless bitch, she might just make it past that prophesied stoplight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou tellin me ya let some dinky little rejects flit around in your hoohah? Hehe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Tera snorted. \u201cThat would be highly unsanitary. No. It\u2019s just whipped cream and shrinkies on my nipples. Oh and whipped cream and shrinkies on his dick. He likes that, too. But he really just likes any excuse for my mouth to be on his junk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything to spice things up, right?\u201d She snorted a bit, caught up in the unexpected girl talk between the two strangers. \u201cMy old boyfriend asked me to try that once. Couldn\u2019t do it, just felt silly n\u2019all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh. It\u2019s just food.\u201d Tera shrugged. She helped herself to another shrinky, popping it into her mouth. It was a second nature thing. She didn\u2019t even really think about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo different than the multi color sprinkles or gum drops or something,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess so,\u201d the short haired girl leaned back, \u201cnever heard it put so mundanely before.\u201d Her brow furrowed, biting her thin lip in contemplation, \u201cSeems kinder than how I did it. Just saw it as a power thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer blue eyes looked over to the window, drifting back on distant memories that had not long passed, \u201cDidn\u2019t have a lot of power growing up. Daddy was a shit entrepreneur and wanted me at home cleaning shit since Ma couldn\u2019t be asked. Went to college thinkin\u2019 that\u2019d make up the difference.  Turns out uni just makes ya feel shittier.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan pulled her knees in, wrapping her arms around them, \u201cWhen they started sellin\u2019 shrinkees, was weirded out at first. Obviously there\u2019s the whole civil rights debacle around it, but when I first tried \u2018em... I dunno! Was like a rush. Felt cool to turn shitty people into.. heh, shit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was smirking now, reliving what had turned out to be her prime before winding up how she was now, \u201cGuess that\u2019s Just hubris then. Life\u2019s funny like that, ya know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess so,\u201d Tera said around her shrinky. \u201cBut I don\u2019t break laws. I stay right at the speed limit. I don\u2019t get any tickets or citations. I renew all my licenses early and everything. I don\u2019t fuck around with that shit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that\u2019s my point! You follow the law, be a good, upstanding citizen all you like. In the end, that guy in your mouth had a family, friends, thoughts and shit,\u201d she pointed half heartedly to the bulge in Tera\u2019s cheek, not actually caring about the man inside beyond making a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe he killed a man? Maybe he embezzled money from his company? Maybe he didn't do jack shit and had a minor citation, bombing his plea hearing while pissing himself over a shitty defense council. You never know who\u2019s gonna wind up like this, someday might be someone you know. Might be you! Sure as hell didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be me...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan listed away, a moment of melancholy before shaking her self out, \u201cPoint is, that\u2019s the fun. Everything these cats were is now calories. Makes ya feel like a boss ass bitch when you get over the ambiguity of it all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTera slurped hard on her treat, even lightly nibbling him. Then she stuck him back under her tongue to get the best flavors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh. Don\u2019t care,\u201d she said. \u201cThey just taste good is all I know. Probably eat too many of them, but they tend to go straight to my ass and my boyfriend likes it, so I don\u2019t try too hard to stop.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Tera chuckled and pulled out the now-flavorless shrinky from her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want this? Does my little Mutsy-wutsy want a treat?\u201d She laughed at his eager expression before tossing the shrunken person at her dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ragged, spit soaked man coughed after his thorough wash. He probably found it a miracle he was still alive. Poor son of a bitch couldn\u2019t even get out a yelp before the little terrier snapped him in its jaws. It shook him about, readjusting it\u2019s bite over his now mangled body before hopping out of its owners lap to enjoy the treat on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan stifled a yelp watching the display, \u201cJesus! A bit much, ain\u2019t it?\u201d she held back a gag watching the cute puppy turn away, obviously gnawing away at the new toy. \u201cNot to mention the waste... ah well. To each their own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering she\u2019d gone through two tinies since they started talking, there was one left in the bag. Considering the time frame Tera gave her, she wondered if she\u2019d even make it that long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor someone that wanted to talk, I sure feel like I\u2019m carrying the conversation here. What? Don\u2019t feel like getting real?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crossed her legs, scooting forward into an upright position, \u201cIf you ever had a secret you\u2019d want someone to take to their grave, Now\u2019s a good time, honey.\u201d<br>\r\nTera laughed at that. \u201cI really don\u2019t have secrets. My man knows it all. But I can say my mom never found out how much my best friend and girlfriend ate me out during college. Or how I kept her tied to our bed for days at a time and used her as furniture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou talked about empowering? Controlling a tiny thing like you isn\u2019t power,\u201d she said. \u201cBut controlling a full-sized human like myself, now that is a power rush.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow...\u201d she was surprised. Not just by the extra promiscuity she hadn\u2019t anticipated from a truck driver, but that this sloppy, blue collar woman had also gone to college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-uh, didn\u2019t peg you the type to do the college thing. No offense! Just, well, why trucking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever said I graduated. Spent two years there and decided that shit wasn\u2019t for me,\u201d Tera said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out the final shrinky and popped it into her mouth. She tossed the empty wrapper into the passenger floorboard. \u201cTrucking made more money faster with less effort. I get to sit on my ass all day but still get to see the country and get paid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn. Now she was the last one. \u201cNever thought of it like that. Travel's always made to sound so expensive. But making money while doing it? Worth the occasional sore ass, I bet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTera wasn\u2019t soft spoken, but she wasn\u2019t giving Reagan much to go off of. At least from her perspective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was studying to be an opera singer. Earned my bachelors, tried my hand at teaching for a while,\u201d now she felt she was talking too much. Last thing she\u2019d want to do is annoy the driver, \u201cSorry, losing track. How much does the job pay?\u201d</span></div></div>",

She slurped hard on her treat, rolling the tiny around in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis year has the potential for me to earn six since I own my own truck now.\u201d Her nose wrinkled and her face scrunched. She inhaled deeply and barely managed to keep her mouth closed as she blasted out a series of sneezes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn. Must\u2019ve been some dirt that got in here,\u201d she mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHwoooah! Watch where you\u2019re hockin\u2019!\u201d Reagan yelped just after a glob of phlegm shot out of Tera\u2019s nose and hit the dash during her sneezing fit. \u201cI\u2019d be impressed if I wasn\u2019t almost mortared, haha.\u201d Even with the slimy droplet sliding down the plastic board nearby, she was laughing through the shock. \u201cShit, feel like I just missed a pie to the face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her laugh died down, she then heard a sickly sound coming from the pile. Sliding closer to the dash, the limbs and head of a girl stuck out from the green gunk, hyperventilating in a full blown panic. Her horrified brown eyes flicked around her new surroundings, eventually landing on Reagan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2014 hack \u2014 help... please!...\u201d The girl saw the blond tomboy as her last hope, several of her limps already broken and unable to free herself from the mess. For Reagan, it was an uncomfortable request, and she inched away, unwilling to provide any help. She felt for the girl, but there was nothing she could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTera wrinkled her nose and dug a tissue out of the console. \u201cGross. Can\u2019t let that stay there.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe promptly wiped the hunk of snot off the dash, balled it up and tossed it out the window. She quickly put the window back up so it wouldn\u2019t blow around everything in the cab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blast of winds blowing through the car billowed wildly as the loogie was wadded up and tossed out like nothing. Reagan watched the tissue, the snot, and the pretty brown eyed girl fly off to crash into the dirt somewhere. Maybe the tissue would cushion her fall? If she found any small plants, she might be able to eat a bit. But who\u2019d be fool enough to think a broken one inch person could survive in the desert? If the days of hunger didn\u2019t get her, the wildlife would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t they have harsh penalties for littering out here?\u201d Reagan looked up with a smugness on her face, pointing out the funny little hypocrisy she caught Tera red handed with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tissue and is biodegradable,\u201d Tera said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really count. Besides, we\u2019re totally alone out here. No one else. No cameras. No nothing out here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re careful, not law abiding. Whatever floats your boat.\u201d She was grinning. Aside from the gruesome imagery and crimes against humanity, she was having a nice chat with her last bit of interaction on Earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEver thought about what\u2019d happen if you got caught? Wind up like lil ol\u2019 me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah,\u201d Tera said. \u201cI don\u2019t do it on roads I don\u2019t know and busy places. Like I said, this place is pretty deserted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hummed to herself as a song softly played through the radio. It was a long-time favorite of hers. Her fingers tapped along to the rhythm of the music. There really was no other stop for a long time. There was nothing out there.</span></div></div>",

A life of freedom on the road, a man at home waiting for ya. I like the tune of that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup,\u201d Tera agreed. \u201cBest life ever. I love it.

Reagan didn't get the chance before she was craned in towards Tera's large, pudgy lips and unceremoniously popped her into her mouth. It was a casual routine for Tera, who smacked her lips for a moment then proceeded to suck on the small girl like any other piece of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t get out a peep before she was chucked into a slippery hot plain of gooey suds and spongey bits of food.

This was the only light for at least a hundred miles and it was only because the intersecting road was also a major highway. But still, way out here, no one was really on the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed as she sucked on the treat, wishing for the light to turn. Slipping her over and under her tongue. For once, having spent time with the girl, she paid more attention to her feeble squirming. It was cute, but also carried some disturbing undertones Tera didn't care too much to dwell on. After all, why ruin her mood?<br>\r\n__________________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer limbs and head had been beaten and bent from banging into the giant teeth, passed from cheek to cheek and savaged atop and under the tongue in random sequences. Reagan\u2019s breath was wasted when she could only breathe in spit. At one point, she accidentally ingested a gooey crumb of a long eaten chip while being scooped between the cheek and molars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan wondered if this was the same experience for her own food. Carelessly tossed and savored with no remorse. What hope she had that her friendly chat might\u2019ve given her an easier death was dashed. Then she wondered if this was an easier death?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave her morsels time to think. To plea. Stopping her onslaught to give them hope that it\u2019d stop, even opening her mouth to tease them with release. She\u2019d draw this out the most, letting them get as far as her bottom lip before snapping them closed. A quick slurp and gulp, and they were done. The fear was delicious, one of her favorite things to illicit from her tinies. Reagan never considered how they truly must've felt, and none of what she theorized quite lived up to the true dread of being molested by a slathering field of muscle and drool, flung and ferried into every dark, damp, squishy corner of a strangers mouth, trembling and crying to such an insignificant extent that her infinitesimal horror meant absolutely nothing to the world beyond her slobbery torment.<br>\r\n__________________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the time she humored the girl, it didn't make her taste much different from the others. Instead, Tera tapped along to the beat, bobbing her head a little as well and swishing the jelly bean of a person into her cheeks then back. Finally, the light turned. With a relieved sigh, she swallowed. Without even waiting a second, she raised her cup and took a long swig to wet her mouth, then hit the gas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo hundred miles to go, Muts\u201d she sighed.<br>\r\n__________________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTera didn\u2019t have the taste for drawing things out like the small girl had. Reagan was bucked to the sealed gullet and shoved down with little fanfare. A fat <i><b>GULP</b></i> ferried her down the pulsating tunnel. There was now time and room to rest and whimper, the walls simply conveying her down feet first instead of aggressively pushing into her. Any second now, she\u2019d plop into her grave...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore that could happen, another gulp echoed above, then another, and a flood of brown, fizzing liquid cascaded onto her head, quickly filling the small space she occupied in the esophagus. Luckily, the fluid also sped along her fall, and she spurted out into a lake of thick bile and bubbling carbonation. Without her ears being squeezed mercilessly, the heartbeat and grumbles were finally noticeable. The bodily noises resounded mightily with each gushing churn of the chamber. Reagan was forced to swim, knocking into the kneading rubbery walls for any possible handhold. The rush of massive airflow heard through the walls reminded her she had to breath, and there wasn\u2019t much air here, either from being stuck inside an organ where oxygen didn\u2019t belong or the carbon dioxide from the cola. Her arms were atrophied from her time in the packaging, leaving her no strength to stay above the surface. Getting light headed, she wanted to hold onto anything to feel like she had control. To have some bearing to say she could die with dignity. By the time her eyes glazed over, and her body was rocked across the surface of the pool, her arms gave out. She meekly kicked to prolong herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen something more solid then the mush she felt around her legs floated into her. Frightened by the invasion of her space, probably the least of her concerns, she realized the floating mass might be a way to avoid the constant swimming. She desperately paddled toward the mass, floundering her arms over the top of it for salvation. Instead, the bulk sunk just as easily, forcing her back under. As long as she was fully submerged, she felt the light tingling begin to encompass her entire being. Quickly, she pulled up the aimless mass, kicking to the surface with all her will. Finally, she broke through, but then came to realize what she was holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the Australian. Drowned and dead. Her little heart sank. She'd forgotten how many others were in here with her, so focused on her own predicament. How many made it down whole like him? How many body parts and viscera had she floated by already?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrified, she pushed the corpse away, left once again to madly tread water in the frothing, pulsing pond of soda and chyme. The walls were closing in further, pushing the water line higher up and threatening to pull Reagan under. She refused, kicking more and more as the tingling she felt earlier soon became burning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! NO PLEASE! ERIN!! DADDY!!! <span class=\"cmaroon\"><i><b>SOMEONE</b></i></span>!!!?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, the stomach clenched around her, condensing until all but a small pocket of space lie between her and the top. At this compression, the noxious air gathered at the sphincter overhead and rushed up and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the last thing Reagan Shrom saw before being unable to find her next breath, and slipping under the hot, bubbling surface...<br>\r\n__________________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTera took another drink of her soda, draining the last of the large cup. She belched loudly and licked her lips. She was bored again. As per usual. Still, it was her lot in life, she knew what she signed on for and loved what the life provided for her. Glancing over at her dog, she found a funny sight and snorted loudly to herself, her diaphragm bouncing with her laughter likely shaking up her guts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMutsy! Your face!\u201d She laughed. He had blood and some gore all over his smiling muzzle while happily accepting his momma's attention. She pulled him into her lap and wiped his face with a napkin, petting his stinky fur. When he was as clean as he'd get without a bath, she gave him a kiss and put him back in the passenger seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext time I\u2019ll get you your own bag,\u201d she promised.</span></div></div>",
