        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"><b>General Overview</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuna: Legend of an Unemployed Ninja is a roguelike (dungeon crawler) RPG series that centers around the antics of Izuna and her group which include; Shino, Matsumoto and \"Grand Boss\". The series takes place in, what appears to be, feudal Japan where Gods and Demons are still prevalent across the landscape, the former especially. The plot of both games differ exponentially from one another but, the key mechanics of them revolves around traveling through \"Dungeons\" and surviving long enough to get to the very end of them, at which point something useful or plot related can be found. Dungeons are noted for being incredibly dangerous as a wide assortment of demons and beasts are known to wander through their recesses, not only that but traps are said to litter some areas making travel difficult. A few dungeons are known to be the abodes of the Gods themselves and entering is either seen as an offense or way to communicate with them. While the series is normally focused on Izuna and her friends, the games feature a wide cast of colorful characters to interact and talk with all having their own personalities and opinions about what's going down around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenran Kagura (\u9583\u4e71\u30ab\u30b0\u30e9?) is a side scrolling action video game series produced by Marvellous Entertainment for Nintendo 3DS. Senran Kagura is a side scrolling action game for the 3DS. The player will assume the control of 5 different female ninja characters. The more they are damaged by enemies, the more their clothes are torn off (as like in most fanservice-y anime/manga). The main focus of Senran Kagura are the aspects of ninja and the integration of such into a high-school/modern day setting as the female cast secretly train the ninja arts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+Fetishes that can appear during this story...+<br>\r\n- Stuffing/Weight Gain<br>\r\n- Pregnancy/Unbirth<br>\r\n- Vore<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStandard rules apply...<br>\r\n- Only female characters are to expand. Although this doesn't exclude male characters from appearing at all in the interactive.<br>\r\n- Please put forth effort in your chapters.<br>\r\n- Nothing completely outlandish in regards of expansion.<br>\r\n- Let's try to avoid the overly gross situations such as toilet stuff and the like. Burps are fine (farts too, if you play it for comedy), but nothing past that please.<br>\r\n- This is an 18+ interactive so sexual situations are allowed, just...try not to go overboard with them. Use in moderation, basically and try not to have the story revolve too much around it.</td>",
