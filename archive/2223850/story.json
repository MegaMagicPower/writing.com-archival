It probably wasn't the best place to do this, but it's probably just fine. She loved to do this. Lay down, and look at the stars. Her house was a little bit away from all the lights and sounds of the inner city, so she could see the stars decently well. She reached up. She felt like, if she really wanted, she could just pluck one of the stars out of the sky, and hold it in her hand. But still, she probably would never be able to do that. Just like her Hikoboshi... Her mind floated to Okabe. It might have just been her imagination, but it seemed like Okarin had been getting more and more distant. He seemed more interested in Kurisu than Mayushii, ever since that summer. If only she could get Okabe to see her, not just as an old friend, but-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayuri: \"Mm...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was snapped out of her thoughts as she saw a shooting star.

She was currently helping Luka with her summer work, while Kurisu was helping both of them. Well, Mayuri wasn't helping as much, but she was still giving plenty of moral support. Either way, they were just starting to get a bit worn out, when the door clicked open, and a familiar, cat-eared girl walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayuri: Feris-chan! Tutturu!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaris: Heya, Nya!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka: Ah, Faris-san... Hello.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaris: Huh? Hold on a second...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pretended to sniff the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaris: I smell work! A lot of it, too, nya! It's the summyer. You shouldn't be working in the summyer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka: But school starts in a week... We have to do it by then, and there's a lot of it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaris: Well, we can all at least take some time off, because...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dramatically pulled a box out of hammerspace. Nobody saw her holding it before, but it just suddenly appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaris: I found this at a shop on the way here, nya! The myan at the counter seemed really happy to be rid of it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurisu: Doesn't that seem a bit odd to you? It's probably not too high of quality... How much did it cost?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaris: It was free! He said he could predict that there would be people to cheer up in my future, so I should have it, nya!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurisu: Hm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite her scowl, it seemed her worries were satiated for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaris: Anyway, we should play!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smacked the box down on the one table in the room. Finally, the group could see the front of the box a little better. Most parts were worn off. Pretty much the only legible part was where it said \"transform your boredom!\". Huh, a bit of a strange tagline, but whatever. She plopped open the box, and pulled out the instructions... which were just as mangled and worn as the box. It had to be handed over to Kurisu for interpretation, and even she couldn't understand most of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurisu: Ok... It seems like we'll all pick a piece to represent us. We start at the start square of the board, and roll dice to progress. Whatever color space we land decides what color card we draw. Um... And then we... Do whatever it says...? Are you sure this is an ok game to play, Faris-chan?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaris: It'll be fine! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurisu: Ok. It seems like the red ones will be something the person who draws it will have to do, while the blue ones will be something other people have to do. Green, meanwhile, is something that everyone has to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka: U-Um... What kind of stuff is it...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurisu: I don't know. The instructions are completely destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaris: Then, in that case, we should just learn by doing! I'll go first. Hm... I'll be... This one, nya!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out a pink piece, that once again didn't seem to exist before she needed it to. Then, everyone else also picked out a piece. Kurisu chose a red piece, Mayuri got the blue one, and Luka got the purple one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaris: All right, now time to roll!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dice somehow just appeared in her hands as she tossed them onto the board.

Everyone pick a nyumber between 1 and 100, nya!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurisu: Pick a number...? What kind of game even is this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaris: Who knows, just do it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayuri: Mayushii picks... 71.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka: U-Um... I'll go with... 17.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurisu: I'll take 42. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaris: And I'll do 33! Ok, so it says to flip it over once we're... nya...!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others seemed to also voice their shock, as 4 thick, black tubes dropped down from the ceiling, and immediately plugged themselves into the four girls' mouths. Then, it began to pump a strange, tasteless fluid into their mouths. As Faris processed what in the world was happening, she noticed that all of them began to get slightly plumper all over. Right as se bgan to realize what was happening, Luka was released. She had only gained a little bit, still keeping most of her elegant, stick-like figure, just with a bit of pudge, mostly centered around her waist and thighs. Next, Faris was released. She had gotten much bigger than Luka, now gaining a rounder tummy along with a slightly larger chest. Nearly instantly after Faris, Kurisu was released. Her weight had been spread the most evenly around her body out of the three so far. Her newly-widened torso pushed her lab coat to the side, as she had a much rounder waist. Then, there was Mayuri, who kept getting pumped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka: M-Mayuri-san...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayuri: Mmph! Mmmngh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurisu: Here, help me try to pull it out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaris: Yeah!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Faris and Kurisu pulled and pulled, it finally came out almost a minute later, as Mayuri leaned back, groaning. Her fat had mostly grown out around her belly and bust, jumping her up almost a full cup, and leaving her with a huge stomach. Her dress seemed a little small...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurisu: What...in the world... was that...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka: I-I... Wha... U-Um...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayuri: Mm... Mayushii's softer now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaris: Nya... That was byizzare...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurisu: Um... call it a theory... but I think those numbers had something to do with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayuri: Huh...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurisu: Think about it. Luka picked the smallest number, and she gained the least. Mayuri gained the most, and she picked the biggest number by far. Meanwhile, Faris and I picked numbers in the middle, and gained a medium amount. I-I mena, I'm still nowhere near fine with this! But I think that may be what happened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaris: Hm... that makes sense, nya. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurisu: Geez... we need to stop playing this, before we get even more messed up. This entire game is probably about changing our bodies in some way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka: R-Really...?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaris: \"Transform your boredom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurisu: Exactly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayuri: Um... Mayushii doesn't think we should stop. Look...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayuri was holding the instructions. She was pointing to a part of it that had just become legible. It said \"any changes made during the game are temporary, unless a player willingly stops playing\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurisu: So we're trapped...!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaris: Enyough panic, nya! We just need to keep playing, right? Let's make it through! If it's temporary, relax! We'll be fine afterwards, nya!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurisu: I guess you're right...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Kurisu rolled a 5, picked up her red piece, and ended up on a...</span></div></div>",

She stood just outside the doorway, feeling the heat of late summer wash over her. She didn't have to help out in the temple today, so she would probably head over to the Lab for now. But first, she had to wait for Mayuri. So, Luka walked out the front gates, and moved to the side, so she wouldn't be in the way of everyone. There, she waited. Her mind drifted, and she thought back to the last few months. The PhoneWave (name subject to change) had been crazy, but since they'd only managed to send numbers back in time (which didn't even win the lottery, with Luka messing up a number), they hadn't really done much. But then again, Okabe had been acting pretty weird. He had claimed things were different, like that Luka used to be a guy. Well, not like she even looked like a girl, with being flat as a board up top, but she definitely didn't look like a guy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Clonk!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka: Ow...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka grabbed her head as she felt something fall to the ground next to her. She checked it out. It looked like a small, dark scarlet, almost maroon, rock. It must've fallen and hit her on the head on it's way down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka: What in the world...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a note fluttered down in front of her face. She fumbled for a second before catching it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>To who ever receives it, this is a Wishing Stone. If you think about something hard enough while holding this stone, it will become real. You can alter yourself and the world around you, and only you will know. Think carefully about your decisions.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka looked up and all around her, trying to figure out where the stone came from. Eventually, she shrugged and fiddled with the rock in her hands, her mind moving to other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka: Hm... I wish Mayuri wouldn't take so long... It's so hot out-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n??????: Luka-chan! Tutturu!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka: Gah...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka almost fell over, before she recognized the voice as Mayuri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka: M-Mayuri...! Please don't scare me like that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayuri: Sorry...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka: It's fine. Let's go ahead and go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayuri: Ok!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayuri bounced ahead, as Luka followed along behind her. As they walked, she thought about what had just happened. She had thought about Mayuri arriving, and she had arrived. It's almost like the stone was real... Well, this is where she would earn her Lab mem title. It's time to experiment.</span></div></div>",

Of course, Mayuri was skipping a little in front of them. This caused her rather large chest to bounce around in front of her, almost taunting Luka. She had always wanted to be a bit bigger up front... She was a bit sick of having people almost mistake her as a dude from far away. Even up close, nobody really seemed to be able to tell. But, if she was a little bigger, that wouldn't be a problem anymore... So, with that slight thought floating across her head, she made up her mind. Steeling herself, she made her wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka: <i>I wish my chest was as large as Mayuri's.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she felt the world spin around her. She got dizzy, and stumbled for a second. Mayuri paused ahead of her, and looked back, confused. When the dizziness finally faded, Luka slowly lifted her head, her eyes still shut, prepping for another wave, that never came. But still, something felt off... She felt... heavier. Realization dawned on her as she slowly opened her eyes. Sitting there on her otherwise perfectly thin frame, were two large orbs. Boobs. She had boobs. They were fairly large, matching Mayuri, but looking ridiculous on Luka's smaller frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayuri: \"Luka-chan? What's wrong...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka: \"Wha...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the words on the note stuck out in her mind:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You can altar the world and yourself, and only you will know.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis must be what it meant. She had changed her bust massively, but Mayuri was clueless. Not that that said much, but Luka knew that even the oblivious Mayuri notices more than people realize. Surely she would notice a change this massive... if she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka: \"I-I'm... fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayuri: \"Hm... Mayushii thinks that's a lie... Oh, you're probably dehydrated! We need to get you to the lab, quickly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Mayuri dashed off, and Luka followed her hesitantly. pulling out her phone as she did so. Looking back at past pictures, it looked like she had grown to be this size over the last year, mostly exploding in the last month or two. It had gone so smoothly, making herself bigger. And she felt more powerful like this, too... but what else should she do? She should probably be careful with it...</span></div></div>",

Somehow, in August, you accidentally set the world on a path where Mayuri doesn't die, Kurisu doesn't die... and also nothing is canon. Prepare for inflation escapades!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n- Preferably no male inflation (Luka will be female, since Okabe didn't need to change him back)<br>\r\n- You can cross other characters into one where it's maybe not supposed to be, but it has to be centered around that character<br>\r\n- Try to stick with the three b's of inflation (bust, belly, butt)<br>\r\n- If you end off a path and I think it's too early or not very satisfying, I will delete the ending chapter<br>\r\n- Have fun and mess around! Nothing here is supposed to be serious</td>",
