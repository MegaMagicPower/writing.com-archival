The only lighting comes from sparsely mounted globes that glow with a soft white luminescence and from the occasional bluish-white shower of sparks or lightning-like flash overhead.

The fetid smell of sweat, decay, and something unnamable hangs heavily in your nostrils.

Your deadly axe and ogre\u2019s strength have lead to a distinguished and profitable career as a mercenary, at least until your last job...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were escorting a dwarven cartography team deep into a system of natural caverns when you got ambushed by a group of mindflayers.  You decapitated one of the hideous squid-headed men with your first swing, but your mind and body reeled and then shut down from the assault of their mind blasts.  You vaguely remember a period of time after that as one of their thrall, like a nightmare of being a puppet to some insane overlord.  When you woke, you found yourself chained to a mill wheel.  You are now fed based on how much you turn the wheel.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first thought was escape, but that was thwarted both by your weakness from near starvation and by the unbreakable adamantine chains that keep you fastened to the 6\u2019 thick stone pillar of the mill wheel.  If you push the handle of the wheel with all your might and walk it around the circle, you can cause the mill to rotate, earning you a few scraps of food for several hours of constant turning.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour second thought was the horrific realization that they had sawed your horns down to flat stubs, in effect, sawing off your pride and honor.  Your burning rage against the mindflayers for this insult will remain until death, either yours or theirs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the past week, you have regained your strength from the meager food and constant exercise by turning the wheel for about 16 hours a day.  Now, as you turn the mill wheel, you remain coldly alert to every detail around you, waiting for an opportunity to escape your laborious prison and punish your captors.</span></div></div>",

Pain and sacrifice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab the right shackle with your left hand and pull with all your considerable might.  Slowly, and yes, quite painfully, your right hand begins to squeeze into the adamantine shackle.  Your dark brown fur-covered hand turns crimson red as the skin rips and cotes it with blood.  The bones in your hand and thumb begin to crunch and snap as you grit your teeth and continue to pull.  Finally, your bloody mangled hand pulls free of the shackle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou use the intense pain and adrenaline to keep going.  Bracing your hoof on the rim of the left shackle, you do the same damage to your other hand until at last; you are free of the bonds.  Your hands are now useless and your horns are gone, but you can still kick, bite, and charge at anything unfortunate to get in your way.  You are pissed, and that's exactly what you need to get out of this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou howl with rage and charge at the door on the far wall, battering with your massive shoulder and splitting it with a loud crack.  You find yourself at the base of a spiral staircase, so you quickly ascend, taking the steps 3 at a time, until you reach a passage at the top.

The foul scent of mindflayers is stronger to the left, so you go left.  Your darkvision allows you to see clearly in what would otherwise be a barely lit long straight corridor topped by an iron grate a few feet above your eight foot stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about fifty feet, the passage turns sharply to the right.  As soon as you round the corner, you see your first obstacle.  Two goblins are dragging a third goblin, which is either dead or unconscious, from the other end of the passage.  They were about to turn the corner down a side passage when they spot you spotting them.  They drop the body of the third goblin and draw their swords.  You notice a certain drooling slack-jawed stiff gate to them as they turn to face you.  Good, they are thralls.  They may not be the mindflayers you crave to pound on, but at least the mindflayers controlling them will get the idea.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they finish freeing the blades from their scabbards, you have already closed the twenty foot distance between you and hit them both like a runaway horse, trampling them as you slide and stomp your great hooves into the rock floor and bloody crunching goblins, trying to slow yourself down and turn around.  One goblin now looks worse then the motionless goblin they were carrying.  The other is badly injured, but staggers upward and thrusts his little shortsword into your lower abdomen.  You grab the blade with your already cut and broken hand and yank it from your gut and his hand, tossing it aside.  The new wound adds to the pain which adds to the force of your headbutt as you drop it down on the goblin like a falling bolder.  You\u2019re not sure if the crunching sound is his skull, neck, or both, but there is no question that he is dead as you straighten back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back at the bodies and the trail of blood and realize that the trail is yours; marking the entire path you have taken from the mill wheel to your current spot.  The slit in your stomach is pouring blood freely and will leave a much thicker trail.  You start to feel dizzy from the blood loss, but then you shake it off and decide you don't have time for that.</span></div></div>",

You heave yourself up to your hooves and stagger after the woman, who is already leaving the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou catch up to her as she gingerly pulls a shortsword out from under the goblin that you trampled to death.

But you don\u2019t have a bow or arrows or even a safe place to rest.  You are trapped atop the rafters and cables suspended high above the dark Illithid city, near the ceiling of a mountain-sized cavern, always one false step away from plunging to your death.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou work for scraps of food, cleaning and repairing the structure and cables.  Your orders, food, and water are carried to you by a drider (a drow elf abomination with the upper body of a dark elf and the lower body of a huge spider).  The cables that hang downward into the dark city would be a means of escape if they weren\u2019t almost constantly glowing and crackling with lighting.  One of your earliest memories after your capture is watching another slave accidently touch a glowing cable and get instantly fried to a crisp.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOccasionally, an Illithid ascends to your elevation riding some sort of floating disk, and stares at you with its cold, solid white eyes.  Every time this happens, the drider gives you several new tasks and becomes extra violent if you show any hesitation in carrying them out.  Now, with the other slave dead, your only companions are the occasional hideous illithid, bad-tempered drider, and the constant hissing, whirring, grinding, clanking noise rising from the dark depths below you, like some giant nightmarish machine.

There is movement there.  A round shadow growing directly above you, blacker than the surrounding blackness.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run.</span></div></div>",

You go by the nickname Whitebeard, obviously due to your appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.  You are a slave in an underground city of Illithid, or mind flayers, as they are commonly called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.  You have a knack for engineering.  You are tasked with maintenance and simple projects regarding electrified cables, capacitors, and the springs and gears of some giant powered clockwork mechanism.  These tasks are simple, though, and your old mind churns with ideas of much greater complexity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.  You have a knack for magic.  Arcane words to half remembered spells drift though your mind.  Occasionally, a complete spell comes clearly into focus, but after you caused one of the Illithid to burn to death, they stunned you with their psionic abilities and cut out your tongue.  So now you cannot utter a single word, much less cast a spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5.  The Illithid can read your mind.  Every time you start to make progress on something they didn\u2019t instruct you to do, they appear and scramble your poor brain.  It\u2019s not a complete scramble, as bits of your memory linger after each incident, but it is more than enough to cause you to guard your thoughts very carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6.  You have found a way to think about possibilities of escape by re-associating your thoughts with random silliness, which appears to confound your captors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7.  Using your new method of deceptive thinking, you have devised some possible secret projects that might aid in your escape\u2026<br>\r\n  a.  You remember something about explosives, and you might have the materials to craft some.<br>\r\n  b.  You might be able to construct some sort of helmet that could give you protection from the illithid phychic powers.<br>\r\n  c.  You have a vague memory of a healer.  If you can get to her, maybe she can surgically graft you a new tongue so that you could cast spells again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, you work on a blown capacitor while trying to decide which project to pursue first and abstractly applying your thoughts to a rather amusing limerick.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It is big and clumsy compared to a gnome, but you're getting too old for a game of tag, and if this thing manages to 'tag' you, the 'it' you'll be is something of a light snack.  As you dash out from under the table, only an inch from the troll's grasp, you reach up and grab a beaker that was sitting on the table's edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, the beaker is not full of acid as you intended, but of oil.

I'm not dead yet!</i>  You think to yourself, elated at the mishap of the slippery oil, but you quickly becoming more concerned at the illithid.

Two tiny sparks of flame hit their marks and the troll howls, shutting its momentarily blinded eyes.  You dive between the enraged illithid's legs and leap to the side as the blind troll barrels accidentally into the illithid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you wait for them to recover, you'll be dead for sure, so you must decide immediately at a direction to run in the passage outside the workshop...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You, your brother, three other dwarves, and one very large hired minotaur wielding a steel great axe that was your finest work, stumbled onto a group of five mind flayers.  The minotaur beheaded one of the squid-men and you put another down, crushing its ribs with a mighty blow from your obsidian warhammer.

The minotaur became a puppet for the mind flayers, helping them to herd the rest of you deeper, into this underground city.

Now, with only one eye left, you craft only what they tell you to, getting your orders from the slobbering mindless goblin thrall that brings your food and water.

A cage door pops open, causing the head of the comatose dwarf that was lying up against it to fall and hit the rock floor with a \"thunk\".  The dwarf winces and blinks his eyes groggily, trying to look around and make sense of his surroundings.  The mindflayer wastes no time walking briskly into the room and up to the dwarf's cell, grabbing the confused dwarf by the collar and dragging and lifting him to pin his head to the top of the blood-stained stone pedestal at the center of the room.  The mindflayers tentacles wriggle and then attach to the dwarf's scalp, instantly slicing through skin and hair, causing the recovering dwarf to scream with pain and panic...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fling the razor sharp bone through the air, between the bars of your cage...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swwhk\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crude knife imbeds itself straight into the mindflayer's big milky-white eye.  It shrieks, tentacles flailing wildly in front of its head as it lets go of the dwarf to grab at the blade.  The dwarf begins punching, kicking, biting, and finally swatting at the blade.  A lucky swing drives the bone the rest of the way in, all 6 inches disappearing into the mindflayers bloody eye, impaling its brain!  The dwarf, still screaming in horror and bleeding profusely from the cuts in his head, shoves the illithid hard.  It stumbles and falls, directly into the trapdoor by the pedestal, falling down the chute and making a satisfying crunching and grinding noise on its way down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick!\"  You shout urgently at the still panicking and bewildered dwarf, \"Start pulling those levers in the hallway!\"  They'll be here soon!  Let the rest of us out before they get here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dwarf looks at you through the blood pouring down his face and into his beard.  He wobbles and looks like he's about to pass out, but then he turns and staggers to the passage, grasping at and pulling down each lever as he reaches it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, the cage doors start popping open and then, at last, your own door swings open and you dash out toward the dwarf.  He slumps down, muttering something under his blood-soaked beard and then collapses before you can reach him.  You realize that he lost too much blood, so you thank him and shut his dead, staring eyes.  Now you hear shuffling from down the dark passage.  They're here already!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You dash back into the room and carefully push through the spring-loaded metal trapdoor in the floor.  You can see a blood-soaked metal chute leading downward at about a 70 degree angle, with a flickering light coming from below.  You crawl down inside, using your hands and feet to press against the side and keep from sliding down its slippery length.  As the trap door springs shut behind you, you toss the hem of your cloak up to the vanishing opening and it gets caught by the trapdoor just in time.  You are now half hanging by your cloak and half pressed up against the slippery walls, trying desperately not to slide down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a commotion overhead as the mindflayers enter the room and start subduing the screaming captives.  Cold panic grips you as wonder if they will sense you hear, or decide to take a meal and drop a body on top of you.  Then, as your eyes adjust, you see that the flickering light at the bottom of the shaft is coming from a large set of whirling blades and it dawns on you that the bone you crafted into a knife and the 'meals' you have been eating were all from the brainless bodies that have been dropped down this chute.  You vomit down the shaft, trying to keep your gagging and retching as quite as possible...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe there is the sounds of a struggle directly above you followed by a blood-curdling death scream.  You realize with terror that one of the mindflayers is \"eating\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab at the edge of the trap door and manage to pull it down with one hand and grab the lip of the chute with the other.  Quickly pulling yourself up and onto the floor, you see that there are two mindflayers in the room.  One is pushing a comatose captive back into a cage and the other is sucking the brains out of a poor young human man.  You make a mad, but silent dash for the passage and only after you have put a hundred feet between you and the \"dining room\" do you take your first breath.  Gasping and double checking that you are not being pursued.  Presently, you find yourself at an intersecting passage.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Illithid city consists of a huge cavern deep underground with a network of 9\u2019 - 12\u2019 deep grooves carved into the base to form tunnels and chambers.  Each tunnel and chamber is topped with an iron grate.  The iron grates provide ventilation and security, as well as an eerie effect of hearing muffled sounds from all over.  There are several access hatches in the grate that can only be opened from above, giving the illithid quick access to different parts of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe exact layout of the city is not as important as where you want to lead the characters in the story.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are the areas of interest:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.  Mills \u2013 There are manually turned mills below the workshop, generator, lab, and kitchen.  The mills are hand-turned in 4 separate sub-level rooms by slaves (one is turned by Torune, the others are tuned by ogres).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.  Workshop \u2013 Contains a lathe (powered by Torune\u2019s mill), an electric forge, an anvil, workbenches, raw materials, a scrap heap, and various smithing and crafting tools.  Argos is currently the only slave working in it.  The healer\u2019s staff, broken in 2 pieces and missing the opal headpiece, lies in the scrap heap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.  Generator \u2013 Provides dim lighting (for the slaves that don\u2019t have dark vision) and power to the workshop, lab, and portal chamber via large suspended cables.  The generator is primarily powered by a small permanent portal to the elemental plane of air which blows a wind mill.  The wind is not 100% steady or reliable, so a manually turned mill provides some back and stability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.  Lab \u2013 Contains workbenches, precision tools, power tools, and a lathe.  Whitebeard is currently the only slave working in it.  Among the raw materials for the illithid projects is the opal from the healer\u2019s staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5.  Kitchen \u2013 A chute leads from the ceiling grate of this room into a large meat grinder, where corpses from the \u201cDining Room\u201d are chopped into pieces on their way down.  An orc slave separates flesh from bone and cooks the flesh for consumption by the slaves and thralls.  The orc \u201cchef\u201d also adds chopped mushrooms, bats, beetles, rats, and lizards to complete the \u201cmeals\u201d.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n6.  Dining Room \u2013 large round upper-story room made up of iron gratings for the floor, wall, and ceiling, lined with cages.  In the center of the room are a bloody pedestal and a trapdoor (over a chute leading to the kitchen grinder.  The passage leading to this room is lined with levers that open the cages.  There are 15 cages (and 15 corresponding levers).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7.  Infirmary \u2013 Contains beds and medical supplies.  \u201cHealer\u201d is the only physician.  Currently, there are no patients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8.  Servant Quarters \u2013 Four large rooms down a large hall form a barracks for slaves and thralls.  Only slaves that have proven their loyalty over a long period of time are allowed to stay in the quarters (instead of simply being locked into their current work area).  The slaves and thralls act as laborers, servants, and guards.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n9.  Master Quarters \u2013 Several rooms down 2 long parallel hallways comfortably house each illithid.  The halls lead from the Servant Quarters to the Brain Pool and are always well guarded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10.  Storage \u2013 Contains a large junk heap.  Semi-useful items and crude weapons can be found in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n11.  Hatchery \u2013 This chamber is where the illithid produce their larvae.  It is also a sort of bioengineering laboratory where the illithid experiment with symbiotic organisms.  If the solitary illithid in this room is dealt with and the room is searched, a searcher will be attacked by one of the experimental symbiants.  The symbiant will attach itself to the back of the victim\u2019s head and burrow tendrils into the brain.  Fortunately, the symbiant\u2019s will is not that strong and can be resisted.  Every hour or two that the host is awake and in the illithid city, there is a chance that the host will be temporarily under the control of the Elder Brain.  Torune and Arial are the most suseptable to this, while the Healer and Whitebeard are the least.  The host gains psionic abilities (telekinesis, mind blast, and resist psionics).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n12.  Vault \u2013 Contains treasure consisting of coins, precious stones, and valuable possessions taken from captives (like the players\u2019 gear and weapons).  The door is locked psionically and can only be opened by a player with the symbiant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n13.  Watcher\u2019s Chamber \u2013 A few illithid stay here in shifts to oversee slave work throughout the city.  There is an elaborate system of mirrors that allows them to visually monitor every area in the city.  The dim, somewhat sporadic lighting and the lack of their full attention provides a chance that any short activity will go unnoticed.  There is a psionically imbued floating disk that allows one of them to float to different parts of the city or up to the rafters.  The disk is controlled psionically, so if captured, it will only hover or drift unless the rider can find a way to push/pull it in the direction they want to go (unless they have the illithid symbiant).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n14.  Brain Pool \u2013 Huge iron-domed central chamber contains the massive pool of goo where the Elder Brain and the new larvae live.  This area is heavily guarded, though Elder Brain is capable of defending itself with powerful psionic abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n15.  Entrance Shaft \u2013 The main tunnel leading out of the illithid city consists of huge closed iron doors and two heavily guarded gatehouses.  Outside of the iron doors is a drawbridge over an underground chasm.  One gatehouse controls the doors and the other controls the bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n16.  Mushroom Farm \u2013 Slaves harvest mushrooms from the walls of a natural cavern at the edge of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n17.  Drider Cave \u2013 This cave at the outer edge of the city is full of webs and dried carcasses.  There is a chance of meeting the drider here.  The drider\u2019s spellbook can also be found.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n18.  Mine Entrance \u2013 A system of tunnels leads out from the edge of the city.  Slaves dig for stone and metal.  It is lightly guarded, but leads only to dead ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n19.  Mineral Spring \u2013 This warm bubbling pool is the water supply for the city.  It leads to a network of underwater tunnels and can eventually lead out for someone capable of breathing underwater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n20.  Rafters \u2013 gear boxes and suspended power cables are connected via a network of iron rails.  With the gears and cables being prone to wear and tear (like slipping, jamming, or corrosion), this area needs regular maintenance.  The gear boxes are tapered and lined with razor sharp ridges down the upper potions of each shaft, making them impossible to climb down.  The cables and connectors are powered with a fatal electrical current 90% of the time, occasionally going \u201cdark\u201d for 1 to 10 seconds, when no power is coming from the generator.  Sometimes there is a broken connection or a short power outage, but the drider guards this area vigilantly whenever that occurs.  Arial is the current slave tasked with maintenance in the rafters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n21.  Sewer \u2013 All rooms contain small disposal chutes (about a foot in diameter) that lead to the sewer.  The sewer itself is a large sub-chamber, populated by one hungry otyugh.  The chute from the kitchen is 4 foot in diameter.  If anyone unfortunate enough to enter the sewer through the kitchen chute manages to get past the otyugh, they can climb up to an exposed natural system of caves that will eventually lead to an exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally...</span></div></div>",

The portal itself is a 6\u2019 diameter round crystal lens with various powered mechanisms pointing at it.  There is also an elaborate control panel to \u201caim\u201d and activate the portal.  It can be activated by randomly manipulating controls.  If activated, the random destination is visible through the lens and can be seen before entering (the details of the destination, known only after entering it, are in parinthesis).

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">The Illithid (a.k.a. Mindflayers) capture those who stray too close to their underground lair.  Some captives are slaves, the rest are feeders, their brains devoured by the terrible squid-like humanoids.  The city is alive with cables and moving gears, like some giant machine.  But what does it do?  And can you escape?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a 2nd person narrative in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons setting.  No die rolls or game mechanics, only story telling.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you wish to contribute, use the \"Dungeon Masters Only\" link.  I will edit additions if they conflict with the info provided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you are just reading and want more chapters for a particular character, tell me which character and I will focus on furthering that line of the adventure.</td>",
