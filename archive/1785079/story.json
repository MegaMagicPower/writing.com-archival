Listen, Wolfchild, and you shall hear of the midnight ride of Paul Revere...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul invented Locomotivation in 1776. That's not true but I needed to say something or it would appear I had no clue. And I do have a Clue. Colonel Mustard did it with the lead pipe. I'm thinking - lead pipes? - no wonder those guys were so loco drinking that lead-heavy water. Lead is a funny word because it's a verb and it's also in pencils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're probably expecting me to say something about pencils now - I know that's what I was expecting - but patterns are made to be broken. Not really. That would be stupid. Spend all that time making a pattern and then breaking it. It would be better to put the pattern in a shoe box and save it in your closet. Then one day when you are old and about to die you could open the box and the pattern would come roaring out yelling, \"Why did you keep me trapped in a shoe box all those years!\" and it would scare you so much you would have a heart attack and die and then you wouldn't have to be old anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, this train is not gettting very far down the Locomotivation track. I will now give five people (or one person five chances) to define Locomotivation.</span></div></div>",

Locomotivation is what gets you going on the right track, or off the wrong track, or maybe just on a different track from your present course. Like someone ugly enough to make a freight train take a dirt road, or asking Ken Nordine the difference between next and noxt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome on, it's not all that difficult to comprehend, we all end up in the same place in the end. We just need to take different paths, roads, or elevators to get there. It's not like you have to become a Columbian vegetarian, or sell your grandmother to the recycling center to pay blood money to Indians. (Although that might not be such a bad idea...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what's YOUR locomotivation?</span></div></div>",

I went straight to the top and thought I would go down one floor at a time when I stopped in my tracks and saw this amazing bird. Wooh boy, keep you cool. <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/burstv.png\" alt=\"*Burstv*\" title=\"Burstv\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">She was covered in a grey dress that had a dash of burgundy just where her neck ended. I was transfixed. I stepped back to get a better look and fell off Macys top floor feathers flying every where. I bounced hard on the way down and landed back on the sidewalk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNumb and waiting for my heavenly wings all I could think of was this burgundy bird and making my dreams to accommodate her. When, a passing tramp picked me up and bundled me into a carrier bag.

He handed me to his Lady tramp and she put me on a barbeque where I really got a hot sun tan. I wouldn't try this at home guys. She put some pastry on top and they had me for their supper. All I could hear was Yum! Yum!<br>\r\nand a few burbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moral of this story as I write from a heavenly place with my new wings.

How in the world do you ever get a new start in life? Once you are alive, isn't it perpetual living until you are dead? Aye! There's the rub. I died, and so did Miss Burgandy. We both have a new start now so it seems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Burgandy is of course, now; Mrs. Burgandy Pigeon Toes, and she is now having our first little birdie baby. The misses is still quite stunning considering she has been through death, post mortem carving, and being eaten. Despite all of her flaws, I mean my flaws, I mean our flaws, we are sooo in love. I love Burgandy to pieces, at least all the pieces are still together considering we are nothing but bones now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Stutter Step Pigeon Toes was born nothing more than a skeleton of a baby bird himself. Before you ask, yes; he had his daddy's problem, good ole pigeon toes. That has caused more problems in my family line than anything else you can imagine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter little  problem it was Stutter Step finally got the nerve to get out of his part of the nest, the fun began. Can you see that little bird with his pigeon toes trying to walk, and him with that aggravating stutter step on top of it all? He had the darndest time trying to do anything but it was time to teach him to fly. Now walking on clouds is tricky just so you know, and with Stutter Step's problem it was even trickier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStutter Step got to to the middle of the cloud and fell over. He sunk down to the middle of the cloud and got himself upright, made it to the edge of the cloud, and because he couldn't see anything; he fell right out of that cloud. Talk about de`ja vue. The good thing is, little Stutter Step Pigeon Toes died of fright before he hit the ground. So much for new starts.</span></div></div>",

Whoo, what am I dreaming or alive or somewhere I know not.  Maybe the fifty first state isn't the problem but the slimy rocket fuel isn't cold enough to boost me into bed.  Well, I'll wait till the cops give me a ride then gat me onto the magic carpet and dive further out of this world.  Then agin, kin might figure I'm nuts and snack one till I'm no more good.  Bad, well if rotten then I might survive this timely death which isn't nobody idea  cuz they don't want to be here anyways.  So off I go to de store to slurp some rocket fuel and blast off the fire works.  Mars will have to wait.  Stars are nowhere to see nothin' and it's to dark anyways.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">My day was a hectic lazy night when I was slowly propelled to my bed to walk through the zoo and listen to the animals not sing to the wacky wicky blob.  It wasn't a good sentence however they tried vehemently to show their misery performing this musical.  What happened next before gave me a shout of noise I couldn't hear, so I lept to my feet falling onto the street and saw elephants with crayfish fly on the avalanche which swept the clouds away.  As if this wasn't wonderful enough my water broke and escaped from the flask which was pointed at me in self-defense for me thirst was waning and I didn't know where the water closet was not located.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coroner eventually hasn't arrived scooped me out of the plastic bag that had a bunch of rotten fruit and vegetables leaking through a tiny hole creeping into the sky and threw me into the side of his pickup truck ROLLS RICE on a stretcher under the bed.  As slow as possible I was driven through the forest quickly to the circus called the Reformatory, and gently resurrected under debris in the buzzards nest...  \"wait!  I don't have a parachute!\" I thought as I again awoke in a frog and snored in deep sleep.   Actually, I should be sleeping like a clog but there was a log in my way.  But, it was still day so I didn't get my Pj's off and dressed into my coffin with a tie and waste coat that I received out from under my clothes drawer because it was taken from me by my best friend a gift given to my on my death-day.  The pockets were slim. short. and shapeless but this mattered because I didn't care.  They were so important I decided to add them to all of my wardrobe as slowly as possible because I'm always in a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, I didn't sleep last yesterday and stayed awake snoring until daylight waned and dreams ran away with the pumpkin in cold pursuit following the bones wrapped in hot dogs chilled to boiling over.  The trail of broken glass cascaded with a horrible thud toward the sky and everyone know everything about nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if this wasn't fun enough, now you have the un-opportunity to subtract to this story.  Have fun, and by all means tickle someones funny bone with your word art so that we all can have a belly-shaking cry.  I look forward to repelling your stories about your day night and what you didn't do a far time recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSafe travels and many blessings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid I mention Your stories are unimportant?  I really don't want to know, so write all you don't want and I'll not read them minus no gift points won't be given to none of your stories that you don't write even if you don't write them elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease don't have a fun time writing these stories and by all means, don't be full of sanity either.  And, while you're not at it please or rather unplease don't do any writing so that nobody reads it and doesn't laugh while rolling off the floor giggling in tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour turn if you dare, thanks.</td>",
