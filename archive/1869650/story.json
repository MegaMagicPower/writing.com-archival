Shined upon by neon lights, Ciel hums with the melody and gracefully lands on the street, collapsing her wings. With someone exclaiming, \"An Angel!\", the crowd gathers around Ciel. Dressed in a Santa outfit and with her silver hair hanging down around her waist, Ciel smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is glorious!\" With someone taking the lead and speaks, the crowd echoes. A touch of blush climbs onto Ciel's face. Being complemented by a crowd of humans like this is certainly a new experience to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can... Can I touch your wings?\" a boy requests, but with awe in his voice. Ciel bends down and smiles at the child gently. \"Absolutely!\" She extends her right wing and strokes the boy's face with its tip. \"So soft~\" the boys exclaims with satisfaction. Ciel carefully folds her wing and straightens up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merry Christmas!\" her silvery voice sounds, with her smile still on her face. Her voice is not very loud, yet it is clear and magically soothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merry Christmas!\" The crowd follows. People hug and give blessings to each others. When they realize, Ciel has already disappeared. The crowd stays for a while trying to find where the angel went but fails, then disperses. Later, Ciel reappears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew\" With the blush still on her face, she heaves a sigh of relief. Her work is not done yet, as she still needs to fulfill the wishes of at least one family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpreads her wings and rockets up into the sky, Ciel glances around the town. Her eyes stop at a house with a small yard and only a little decoration. Landing in front of the house, Ciel knocks on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a squeaking sounds, the door opens slowly. It is little boy. \"Mom! Dad! An Angel!\" the boy screams excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No angel would come to dump, Eddie!\" A man's angry voice sounds. He is clearly drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Dad, here she is!\" The boy insists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I don't know who you are but I'm going to shoot you if.... Oh Lord that is an angel!!\" With the dull sound of heavy footstep hitting the carpeted floor, the man comes to the door. Yet the moment he sees Ciel, his eyes are caught by her perfect look. The wings on her back reminds him that Ciel is an angel and sobers the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P--P--P--Please, come in!\" The man stammers. Despite hearing the rumors that angels come to earth during Christmas, the man has never expected to see one in his life. The sudden thrill even makes him question whether he is dreaming. Pinching his own face and feeling the acute pain, he could only confirm that this is true. Quickly clearing out a spot on the couch, the man politely asks Ciel to take a seat. The boy tilts his head, could not believe that his father could be so polite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at the man, Ciel sits down, with the boy by her side. \"Merry Christmas to you all!\" Ciel excitedly speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me...Merry Christmas\" The man speaks with an complex emotion. He is clearly excited with Ciel showing up, but something is also bothering him, preventing him from enjoying Christmas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look worried, is there anything I can help?\" Noticing that the man is worried, Ciel asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My wife, she, she is seriously sick. Can... Can you cure her?\" The man sighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Where is she?\" Ciel asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is in the bedroom, this way.\" The man leads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the door, Ciel sees a woman lying in bed. She is in her middle-age, but her face is awfully pale. Ciel places her hand above the woman's chest, within seconds, her pale face gains color; her breath becomes stronger and soon her eyes open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She should be well in a few days!\" Ciel speaks, with her big smile still on her face. However, when she turns around, her face expression changes for the first time. On the carpet is a series of wet marks left from the snow on her boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I am so sorry!!\" Ciel apologizes anxiously. In a haste, she dries the wet spots with her power, yet the embarrassment is still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it! But... it, it would be nice if you would be willing to put your boots in the mud room...\" The man tries to be as polite as he could, for the respect and appreciation for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Su..Sure\" Ciel is at a loss of her sloppiness. She quickly slips her shorts boots off, exposing her gorgeous bare feet. The man could not help but staring at these perfect stunners. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can.. Can you shows me where the mud room is?\" Blush climbs up Ciel's face. For the first time does a male see her bare feet\u3002 Ciel could even feel the man's sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Please, allow me to put them away for you!\" The man picks up Ciel's boots, while he could still feel the heat from inside of them. He hastily walks to the mud room. At where Ciel could not see, he secretly takes a sniff at the boots. There is nothing but a fragrant body scent. An intoxicated look appears on the man's face. Rather than putting them in the mud room, he hides them. Meanwhile, Ciel is walking back towards the living room, barely holding back her giggles. As an angel, sleeping and showering would be redundant. Thus her feet rarely leave her boots, nor touching the ground. As a result, walking on carpet is almost torment for Ciel. Each time her sole makes contact with the carpet, she could feel a strong sensation going up her spine. She sighs with relief as she finally comes back to the couch. Sitting down, she clenches her toes to minimize contact with the carpet. The boy is by her side the entire time, but she hid her feelings so well that the boy did not realize her eccentricity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any wishes, little guy?\" Ciel asks the boy with her soft voice. The boy shakes his head. With the situation of his family, he is fairly mature for his age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can tell me, I am an angel.\" Ciel softens her voice even further, afraid that she would scare the child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get a RC helicopter?\" The boy speaks, sheepishly, afraid that he is asking too much and the angel would take her mother's health back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, kiddo.\" With her heavenly ability, it is not difficult to manipulate energy and make something like this. Within moments, a fancy RC helicopter appears from thin air, sitting in the boy's lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hooray!! You are a true angel!!\" The boy cannot hold his excitement any longer; he screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am. My name is Ciel, by the way.\" Ciel pets boy on his head gently and speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are too generous!\" The man has just come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christmas is all about the joy, and God bless you all. Do you have any more wish I could fulfill?\" Ciel speaks to the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I know it is a lot to ask, but could you stay with us for the Christmas?\" The man asks, but afraid that Ciel may refuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can stay for a while.\" Ciel speaks, but partially because she is afraid that she will not be able to hold her laughter if she walks on the carpet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later, midnight is approaching. Ciel stands up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you have enjoyed your Christmas! I have to leave now. The gate to Heaven will close soon.\" Ciel speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of.. Of course.\" The man sighs with disappointment but still leads Ciel to the mud room. However, Ciel's short boots are nowhere to be found. Pretending that he did hide her boots, the man fakes a worried look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember putting them right here!\" The man points at the tile. For Ciel has never been exposed to intrigue in Heaven, the man's act fools her. With her mind focused solely on getting back to Heaven, she does not even think of her matter manipulation ability. For the next several minutes, the man pretends that he is looking for Ciel's boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to go! The gate is closing\" Ciel suddenly speaks, striding towards the door while holding her laughter. Tightly behind her follows the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Just give me another minutes!\" The man yells, but Ciel ignores him. As soon as Ciel runs into the yard, she spreads her wings and rockets towards the sky. However, this time, she could not even get 6 feet off the ground, for the man has grasped her on her ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad what are you doing!?\" The boy yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go!!\" Ciel looks back at the man. For the first time, she has an angry look on her face. To her surprise, not only does the man fail to let go of her ankle, a thumb with rough skin starts stroking her arch. An unbearable tickling sensation strikes up her spine and Ciel bursts into laughter. Her wings loses strength and she falls back onto the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clock strikes twelve but Ciel never left earth. The man has released her ankle but her power is fading. With the gate to Heaven closed, she does not withhold infinite power. Lying in the snow, she starts having all the strange feelings that she has never had before. Disgust, despair, hatred, sadness. She could not understand why this man would do such awful things to her, as all she did was helping him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this is the dark side of humanity.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At this moment, the man is no different from any demon. Resisting her urge to purify him, Ciel stands back up. Her bare feet are covered by snow but she takes no action. Staring at the man, her face turns cold, so does her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, stealing heavenly property, that is greed!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Second, taking advantage of kindness, that is sloth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Third\", Ciel pauses. Her blush climbs up her face, due to either anger or shame, \"attempting to intrude angel, that is pride!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the dignity and oppression emitted from Ciel, the man freezes out of fear. He could have been fulfilled with keeping Ciel's boots but he could not resist the desire to touch the angel's feet for once in his life. He was blinded by greed and his ill will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy glorious angel, please forgive my sins! I was so blinded by my greed! Please let me live, my son is still young, and my wife just start to recover. I can't give up my current life, please don't hurt me!\" The man quickly kneels, despite snow on the ground has wet his pants. He begs. Afraid that Ciel will purify him, tears flood out of his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humph!\" Ciel is furious, but the virtue of kindness she posses pacifies her. \"Your name will always be on the naughty book! Now, return my belongings before I take further actions.\" Ciel demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes yes!!\" The man nods with all his strength and rushes into the house, finding Ciel's boots that he hid earlier. Meanwhile, the boy walks to Ciel and hands the toy helicopter he just received from this angel back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss angel, please forgive my dad, he is not a bad person\" The boy pleas with tears circling in his eyes. His hands are holding on the toy tightly but he is ready to let it go if the angel wants to back. Seeing the child, Ciel's heart softens. The warmth of family melts the sins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can keep it, little guy. You are a good kid, God bless you\" Ciel tries her best to soften her voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man comes back, with Ciel's short boots in his hand. Ciel quickly grabs her boots and flags her wings with great strength without even slipping on her boots first. She does not want to spend another moment in front the man, as he disgusts her as much as demons do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh in the air, Ciel takes a brief moment to put on her shoes. At this moment, she has much to worry about. With the gate to Heaven closed, her connection with Heaven is disrupted. Her earlier infinite power is now limited. To further save and gain energy, she might have to sleep and consume food like humans do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is she going to do? She does not know where the gates will be opened next Christmas, and even if she does, how could she survive the one year with humans? Will she still be admitted by Heaven after one year of earthly life?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Ciel does know another way back into Heaven, it is no less risky than staying with humans. The route requires her to access a series of seals guarded by Hellish creatures and walk up a path heavily trapped. No angel has attempted to use this route for ages, but this could be Ciel's only way home.</span></div></div>",
