There is a special company named \u00dcberMass, that specialises in the development, and sales of special products that enable rapid, and in some cases, extreme growth.  With a solid reputation for high reliability and strong sales, this company dominates its market.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin this world, there are many different kinds of anthropomorphic beings that live happily enough side by side, even if the odd exception here and there do exist.  And to support this, various industries have been created to support the many groups.  From the small Foxes and Cats that don't get much taller than 170cm, to the much larger Dinosaurs and Dragons that can reach over 420cm in height.  But for all of them, any day can be quite a spectacular one for them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the only reals questions that are asked are:  For who, will the day be such a spectacular one for?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, it will be......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVincent Schmidt - The Founder, Owner, and President of \u00dcberMass Incorporated.  A 205cm Windragon of a light, yet strong build.  With silver-grey fur, black feathered wings, very long brown hair that reached halfway down his back, and almost always seen wearing his trademark red overcoat with black, fingerless gloves.  If he isn't working at his company, you'll usually find him alongside...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra Crescent - A 190cm Gila Monster with emerald green scales for most of her body except for gold-yellow scales over her front.  Slender, except for an impressive bust, while loving to wear tight clothing.  She is the girlfriend of Vincent and often likes to \"help\" him with testing out some of his products when not at the gym she owns.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDmitri Healey  - A 351cm - when standing, but over 750cm from snout to tail - Asian-Type Dragon who's very slim for his height.  Deep crimson scales for the most part, with dark chestnut-colour for the scutes.  Very strong in spite of his apparent weak build - think Drako from the TMNT 2K3 Series - and willing to use it when required to.  Works as head of security at \u00dcberMass, but has been known to work for testing when needed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there are plenty of others to choose from, all part of the fabric of this story.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>A/N - To clarify an important point here, this world is quite unlike ours in terms of Geology and Orbital Nature. Specifically the world inhabited here is not what would be considered a Planet, but rather a Blue Moon. That is, it's an Earth-like world that orbits a Parent Gas Giant Planet which in turn orbits its parent stars. The plural there is because this is a Triple-Star System with the inhabited world maintaining a Stable Orbit around the Binary Pair (one at 0.74 Solar Mass and the other is 0.37) within the Habitable Zone, while the third Sun (0.43 Solar Mass) orbits the lot at an immense distance where it's influence is weak at best. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis results in the inhabitants being able to see an orange and red star in the day sky and a very bright star during their nights. And their day involves completing one full day/night cycle which is directly tied to their orbit around the Parent Gas Giant, taking about 14 days here on Earth to complete.</b></div></span></div></div>",

With silver-grey fur, black feathered wings, long feathered ears very long brown hair that reached halfway down his back, and almost always seen wearing his trademark red overcoat with black, finger-less gloves. Though right now, since he'd woken up not that long ago, this was not the case at the moment since he was getting dressed after a long shower.  Soon enough though, he was attired in his usual gear of black boots, dark blue jeans, light grey shirt with the top few buttons undone.  And of course, his red overcoat and gloves.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, he was just finishing his coffee as he checked the time.  10:30am.  Late, but since his factory and development labs were closed today, that was a luxury that he could afford.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what he asked himself was.  '<i>What should I do today</i>?'  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew Terra would be at the gym, that still being open today, he could always visit her there and have some fun.  However, there were a few things that he felt he could catch up with at his main Office, which was located in the main development lab, a ways out of town.  Then again, there were also a few places for entertainment that he'd either always wanted to see, or had not seen in a long while.  He could even take a quiet stroll around the Park or Nature Paths that were nearby.  And, of course, with a small stock of his own growth products here, there was always that for some personal enjoyment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecisions, decisions......</div></span></div></div>",

Standing at an impressive 190cm in height, she often found herself standing taller than many males.  Furthermore, she was also hampered by her hairlessness, not bald or shaven (which was a style that could be found in certain cultures) but completely hairless.  Granted, she <i>was</i> a lizard so it was quite normal to be lacking it.  Yet that didn\u2019t stop her from learning the hard way that many men found this to be a turn-off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Terra did have in her favour though, was her build.  For her height, she was slim, almost to the point of being athletic with hardly any fat on her body.  To add to this, in front of her chest, she carried an impressively large pair of firm, yet squishy D-Cups which appeared larger thanks to her build.  Something she would take advantage of by wearing tight-fitting clothing that could reveal a teasing amount of her cleavage while still retaining modesty.  V-Necks being a particular favourite of hers, which could send men into lampposts or have them receive a jealous scolding from wives and girlfriends on a good day.  Incidentally, this was a similar reason as to why she almost never wore a bra, though she would claim that this was because they couldn\u2019t fit her right.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer scales came in two colours.  The majority, a rich green-teal, while the belly, undertail, inner thighs, neck, lower snout, and her ample breasts came in a soft yellow-amber.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Terra, her main employment (and thus income) came from the Holiday Home that she had inherited from her Great Aunt when she had died, which she would travel to shortly before the start of each holiday season in order to make certain that everything was still in order and ready for the next round of guests.  Located several hours drive away, in an idyllic mountainous terrain, it was a great place for those who wished to be away from the hustle and bustle of City Life.  Though she had been known to make use of it herself, usually when she and Vincent were able to have time off together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she wasn't at work she would live with Vincent, and be a regular visitor to his main offices, and, at times, she would be willing to help him test out some of his test products to assess their worth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality-wise.  Terra Crescent is and adventurous, curious type, with a willingness to try out new things.  With a friendly nature and a tendency to look on the lighter side of things.  However, she is known to act on impulses without taking the time to think things through, and has been seen to be a bit of a ditz and being quite gullible.  On top of that, she does become bored rather easily.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what is she going to do right now?  </div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><div align=\"justify\">One-and-a-quarter hours, along barren roads, all by herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed dully, having done this several times before, it was something that she\u2019d become used to.  Not that the experience offered her any help with the boredom that plagued her.  Turning off the radio, not willing to listen to the latest generic 15-minute teen idol, leaving her with just the throaty rumbling of the car engine.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Terra did see driving as little more than a means to an end, she did know enough to know that she needed one that could handle the job.  That\u2019s why her current car was an oil-burning Skoda Yeti, painted an ashen-black metallic.  The four-wheel drive and torquey engine made sure that it could handle the last portion of her trip, which was a good 15-20 minutes of dirt road, and the black paint hid the dirt it would build up there easily enough.  While being able to remove the back seats and leaving them behind made certain that she could carry a lot with her, although all she had with her for this trip was a satchel bag resting on the passenger seat to her left.  It was all she needed to carry her essentials, most of the rest kept at the Holiday Home.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only real entertainment she had with her were the rains.  The larger Sun was only just beginning it\u2019s slow climb up the horizon, the smaller, redder one starting to cede to it\u2019s stronger light - even if both were being hidden somewhat by the thick, dark clouds.  This effect made this one of the two times in the day when the rains were most likely to come, and it came hard.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis meant she had been forced to slow down, from 100 to just 75 to be certain that she\u2018d be able to keep control in these conditions.  And that meant that she\u2019d be in this car, driving for longer than normal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is torture.\u201d  She whined to herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the weather was doing more than simply slowing her down, it also served to discourage people from taking to the roads.  She had yet to pass even a single other vehicle on her journey.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo quell a slight itch on her side, she reached a hand under her belted jacket and jumper to get her claws to it.  For this trip, she was wearing a wide-oval neck jumper that was the same amber-yellow as her belly scales, with plain black trousers of the same material that she had on for comfort, complemented by her belted jacket whose colour matched her trousers.  She liked this type since not only were they comfortable to wear, but also offered a good amount of stretch to them, meaning she could buy them a size too small and have them fit her snugly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut having reached under them like that, the jacket and jumper had been pulled up and now the bottom of her right breast peeked out.  This brought a giggle from Terra, who finally had something that broke the monotony of the otherwise painfully dull drive.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful now.\u201d  She teasingly scolded herself.  \u201cCan\u2019t have you flashing herself in public now, can we?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich actually brought a mischievous thought to her.  Thanks to the heavy rain, there was nobody else on the roads, effectively giving her the freedom to do whatever she wanted here!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that brought another wicked thought into her mind, reaching over into her satchel bag, she fished around for a moment, before her hand caught its target.  A pair of small bottled drinks that when she risked a moment to look at their labels, read:  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00dcberMass Fast-Gro<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00dcberMass Long-Gro<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecial drinks made by her beloved Vince\u2019s company, \u00dcberMass Incorporated, and would provide a special stimulation to the body, upping the height of whoever drank it by nearly two and a half, and ramping up their muscle mass even more so.  She had them with her in case, while alone in the mountains, she needed to do some heavy lifting, or just have some fun with it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile both would begin the process within minutes, the first one would take her to peak growth in a minute tops, and last maybe an hour-and-a half.  The second one, the Long-Gro variety needed over an hour to hit the peak but would hold that peak for over four times longer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, it would definitely make the journey far more exiting for her, if she were a giantess for it.  And no-one being around to see it would make it safer, operating a motor vehicle while a giantess may not be illegal, but it was certainly something that was severely frowned upon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, if she was going to take it, she\u2019d wind up losing her clothes, and have to do the drive naked.  Why could she not do just that?  Take off her clothes and drive in nothing but her scales?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the bottles sitting on her lap, Terra pondered over her options, before making up her mind. </div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><div align=\"justify\">In the end, she had already decided what she was going to do.  Slipping the first drink back into the satchel, she popped the other one open and took a swig of the liquid, the sweet juice tickling her mouth ever so slightly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh Terra Crescent.  You are such a <i>naughty</i> girl.\u201d  She mock-scolded herself for what she was doing as she re-sealed the drink and sat it next to her satchel bag.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she was forced to wait for it to take effect, and with nothing good on the radio either.  Not because there were no shortage of stations, but because there was only the one station that could be kept from the City all the way to the Holiday Home, and all it usually played were generic Teen Pop Idols or the like.  Certainly not what Terra wanted to endure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome elation ran through her when she saw the sign noting the turnoff from her current Route L10 to the Route K09 that she wanted to go on was just 5 Km away.  Once she reached it, time-wise that would mean that she had made it to the halfway point, with half the time left on tarmac roads then the last part would be primarily dirt road.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow though, the first tingling sensations ran through her, signalling the start of the growth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmmmmmm\u2026\u2026\u201d  She moaned out with the euphoric pleasure that washed over her as the drink began its work.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the waves of ecstatic pleasure, her body began to swell out.  Limbs becoming thick with heavy muscle that were beginning to press out against their tightening fabric confines.  She was dimly aware of the sound of popping and tearing, her jacket, not having the same stretch as her jumper and trousers had had its buttons torn off by her enlarging breasts and torso while the right sleeve was being pulled away at the shoulder seam, her biceps pushing out against them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely able to keep her eyes open with the pleasurable feelings that she experienced, Terra could feeling her legs bending notably as they lengthened along with the rest of her, as the car\u2019s interior seemed to become smaller to her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she managed to pull her senses together as the euphoria wore off, and not a moment too soon either.  She was almost at the turnoff now!  And now she had a brand new problem of her own making, with her greater size and thicker, more muscular build, she found that she was having trouble getting her foot off the accelerator and onto the brake, somehow managing to do so.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh.  Forgot about that.\u201d  Terra spoke to herself as she had to do a sort of fast-shuffle with the steering wheel to make the turn thanks to her larger breasts being somewhat obstructing now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, her clothes were becoming restrictive now, she normally liked to wear them a size smaller than she should since that allowed for a snug fit given their stretchy nature.  The penalty for this was that they had little give in them for her growing body.  She found herself grateful that - as usual - she had neglected to put on a bra or panties, that would just be too painful for her to bear had she done so.  Terra was also grateful for the fact that her heels were in the passenger side where she\u2019d left them just before setting off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, things were very uncomfortable for her now, and she was soon forced to find a lay-by where she could pull over and bring the car to a halt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow at a stop, she could slowly, carefully work her arm between her legs to get to the lever beneath her seat, sliding it back to its farthest point.  That was better with her legs no longer needing to be bent painfully to work the pedals, and more space between her and the steering wheel meant they weren\u2019t brushing against it now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lack of motion also meant that Terra could now get a proper look at herself.  She could see her swollen biceps as she flexed them, and it was not just her biceps had swollen.  Muscles were forming into definitive shapes on her forearms as well, which had slid out from her sleeves.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis, this is just <i>too</i> cool!\u201d  She squealed with a slight giggle, that giggle causing her boobs to bounce slightly, even with the jumper and jacket - which was held tight only by the belt that remained on - pressing them in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving the left one a squeeze with her hand, pleased that they were still soft and squishy even with their increased size.  And she could imagine that her legs were in the same state as her arms as her free left hand ran over the side of her left leg, confirmed when she managed to crane her neck over to see them past her swollen boobs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes caught the drink, the Fast-Gro that had put her into this glorious situation.  This made Terra think about finishing the drink, and really getting some size and muscle packed on!  However, doing so would make it next to impossible, if not <i>impossible</i>, to drive, so she could be better off just leaving herself at this size and driving on, even if that would be duller - though not as dull as driving at her normal size at least.  Then she looked at her clothes, stretched almost painfully, and the jacket was torn now, perhaps she would be better off getting them off first.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon Terra, make up your mind already.\u201d  She impatiently demanded of herself.  </div></span></div></div>",

Soon these roads would be packed with holiday-goers bit for now, it felt like the Grand Voyager was the only thing on the tarmac.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra had selected this car for two reasons.  One, its sheer size made carrying the luggage she sometimes needed to stock up the place with on occasion a lot easier.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo.  Despite her misadventure with accidentally growing herself in the last car, ruining it, she found that the act was very pleasant, she did enjoy it while it had lasted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd three, this car was a lot larger than the last one so with the greater dimensions and much greater load limits, it could handle her doing such a thing again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs usual, the unneeded back seats had been left behind, with the stowage spaces used to hold what they were bringing with them.  Mostly Karol\u2019s stuff since Terra kept a number of changes of clothes and other things at the Holiday Home, meaning less to cart back and forth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this time, she would have some help running the Holiday Home she managed during the Season having convinced Karol Schroeder to come with her as an assistant.  Not that it made the journey any less dull than it normally was with 43:34 being the only consistently held station for the entire run and she had already grown sick of the latest teen trash, for now, the radio was silent.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you did agree to come with me, so you\u2019d better be able to deal with this.\u201d  Terra countered Karol\u2019s complaint.  \u201cAnd besides, things\u2019ll be better once we\u2019re off the road.\u201d  If there was one thing helping Terra deal with the tedious journey, it was having someone else around to complain about it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that, but jeez!  How do you cope with this?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have ways.\u201d  Terra replied simply recalling her previous accidental adventure when she hadn\u2018t read the can label and made herself a muscled-up giantess, and the one before when she\u2018d done more than half the drive naked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d  Karol answered with a slight smirk.  \u201cBut why the getup?\u201d  She referred to Terra already being in her business clothes of deep v-neck sweater that gave just the right amount of cleavage, belted jacket and trousers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re comfortable to drive in.  And besides, sun\u2019s not been up long.\u201d  She was half-right.  While the smaller red one had been up for a while, the larger orange one had only recently starting its slow climb up the horizon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFur.  Works wonders.\u201d  Karol teased, leaning back with just her knee-length dress wrapped around her own body, a styled belt holding it in slightly above the waist.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScales.  Low-maintenance.\u201d  Terra returned the friendly fire before licking the rim of her mouth.  \u201cThirsty.  Mind getting a drink?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d  Karol replied happily, having something to do that meant moving around, if only to the satchel by her feet where she rummaged around in it for a time before taking a can out and handing it over.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d  Terra said as she popped it open, draining the can of its bubbly liquid before handing it back over to Karol who was halfway through her own drink.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued to banter for a while, talking about the Holiday Home, what to expect, what needed to be done before it was opened for the Season, about Vincent who Terra kept speaking of with deep affection.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the turnoff from Route L10 to Route K09 came into view, the point where the journey would be half done.  It was at this point that Terra\u2026</div></span></div></div>",
