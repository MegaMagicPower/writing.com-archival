Jason calls out his Pokemon but they are simply outnumbered. Besides, the attacking Pokemon tend to ignore the other Pokemon and attack Jason himself. Then a Poke ball gets thrown at Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation of being turned into energy is weird.

Whether it be physical or mental, tame or explicit, feral or anthro, straight or gay, or anything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it is going to be open, I'd like to suggest leaving heavy violence and death out of it! It's only a suggestion though!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, let's try to keep things as open and variable as possible by leaving at least one option for other story suggestions!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further ado, here we go!</td>",
