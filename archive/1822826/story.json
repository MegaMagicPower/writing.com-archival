Frankly, it hadn't been long since he just arrived here. Who would have thought that there was a such a place in the middle of nowhere? And by nowhere, I mean Nevada. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore this, Greg was just an average guy, 15 years old and living with his parents and sister. He had short strawberry-blonde hair and blue eyes, with an average height and size. Frankly, he wasn't used to the supernatural, but he apparently had the \"gift\" for it. Well, that's what the creepy guy who visited his house said anyway. Greg still wasn't sure about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, here he was, clad in a blue shirt and tan shorts and normal shoes for a guy. You could see the DWMA from practically anywhere, so he pretty much assumed that was where he was supposed to go. Maybe someone would then tell him where he's supposed to stay. The guy had never been on his own before. He still didn't know how his parents got convinced enough to let him come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, standing around wasn't going to help, so Greg began walking up at his own pace. Supposedly, assuming this academy had semesters at all, things were starting up soon. Greg kind of wondered if he'd get to meet anyone. He didn't have many friends before, though he had a respectable bunch back at home. Supposedly, he heard something about getting a \"partner\" or something weird like that. Perhaps he should have actually read the manual to this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You there!\" A 16-year old girl with short white hair and wearing a white hoodie open in front with a black tank top underneath and beige pants. She had a fairly slim yet built frame. Her accent seemed a bit normal but had a British sound to it. The girl carried a blue duffle bag over her shoulder as she approached the boy. \"You know where the academy is?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg was taken back a bit and just motioned to the giant structure. \"That's it? Oh, I'm a bloody idiot. Sorry.\" She claimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg replied, \"It's no problem. I'm trying to get there too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl grinned in surprise. \"Really? Well we should go together then,\" she extended a hand. \"My name's Naomi Lanister. Nice meetin' ya.\" She smiled greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grew up on the streets of her town. No family or friends. So when someone offered her a place to stay she immediately accepted it. She was ready to carve a new path for her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

So quite a ways from here.\" Greg explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nice.\" she replied. Greg raised an eyebrow at how positive she seemed to be, but he shrugged it off. This was perhaps the closest he had been to a girl in a while. Not too often that ran up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, not to be rude, but your name doesn't sound....well natural. No offense.\" spoke Greg, much to Naomi laughing a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, a lot of people say I have a weird name. I'm used to it.\" Naomi just shrugged off. Greg decided to end that topic right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you doing here?\" asked Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was to come here to this academy. Don't really know why. Didn't read the book.\" said Naomi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither did I.\" said Greg. Boy, they were just a couple of teens without a clue. What were they to do? Well, they still saw quite a few people their own age heading towards the academy. Guess they had to now. Perhaps someone would explain this whole mess of a situation.</span></div></div>",

At that moment, Naomi felt a form of energy surround her  and focus on her body before she was caught it a white flash for a few seconds. She heard Greg let out a noise of surprise as she opened her eyes. She felt...naked, for lack of a better word. \"What happened?\" She said. In the reflection of the window she caught a glimpse of herself. Well, she wasn't there. Just Greg and his weapon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon saw the main blade of the spear and ace like weapon have a curved eye shape to it with a moving pupil in the center. Hers. \"The bloody hell is this? Greg?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you're a weapon,\" Greg said, finally piecing it together. \"I'm the wielder,  or 'Meister'. You're meant to be my partner. The weapon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi didn't fully understand, but decided if this was her role, she'd try it out. \"Alrighty...I'll try to be as Pike-like as possible.\" They underwent standard motions, all of which seemed natural to them before they returned to normal. Naomi was just glad she reappeared in her clothes. That was all they were taught then.

I never knew that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's more surprising is that the weapons are people if that class was anything. I expect a full explanation soon.\" Greg groaned, making Naomi giggle a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No argument there,\" Naomi said.

I'm sure I would have noticed if there were.\" Naomi said quickly, shooting down Greg's idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess the heavy duty stuff isn't until tomorrow. Figured as much, as it's already late. I had a small lunch just to make it here.\" Greg sighed. Why did all of this just have to pop up out of nowhere?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny, my trip was similar. How about we go out for some supper once we see where we live?\" suggested Naomi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough.\" Still, finding their residence was easier said than done. Unfortunately, Naomi had NO sense of direction, often making Greg wonder how she even found Death City. Seriously, she went into the same dead end THREE TIMES!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it. Give me the map!\" Greg grabbed it away from her, making Naomi pout as she put her hands on her hips. Greg's luck wasn't much better, but at least he was able to get some directions, leading them to an apartment complex where they saw a lot of students walking around. Not bothering to talk, they just walked right in, going up a few floors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you I could find it.\" Greg smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill smirking, Greg eventually found their room on the fourth floor, not bad since he actually liked being higher up. The place was like a condo, with a kitchen and some rooms and such. They immediately say down their luggage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not bad at all,\" smiled Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get to call first room!\" volunteered Naomi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why is that?\" asked Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because a lady needs her space.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your point?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi huffed and just walked into a room, making Greg smirk. This girl was way too easy to unsettle.</span></div></div>",

Thankfully, there were actually two bathrooms, so they wouldn't have to fight over a shower. Greg still found it kind of odd that he was now sharing this apartment with this girl, but apparently he had no choice now. Thankfully, the place was well stocked, especially in the kitchen where it had all the appliances necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is great. I've have you know that I'm a pretty good cook,\" smiled Naomi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice, though perhaps we should go out tonight. You know, explore the place a bit more,\" suggested Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's good too,\" said Naomi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg had a good amount of cash on him, and his bank account wasn't too bad either. Hopefully they even accepted credit cards out in the desert. Anyway, with that in mind, the two of them left, walking around for a bit in hopes of getting to know the place better. Still, Greg had to do the directing, because Naomi kept running into dead ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you find this place again?\" Greg smirked, earning him a light slap on his elbow. \"By the way, where exactly did you come from? I can tell by the accent that you're not naturally from America.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi gently smiled. \"Well, I'm actually half-American and half-British, but you're right that I didn't come from here. I was born in London, and I lived there most of my life. I came here directly from there actually. I'm trying to fit in though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry too much. I'd say you sound fine the way you are,\" spoke Greg. \"So, um, do you even have money?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know how you use it here, and I got a lot of money exchanged when I entered the country,\" thought Naomi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah good, guess that saves me from having to explain it,\" smiled Greg, with earned one from Naomi too. After a time, they actually found a place called Death Cafe. If this was any other city, that would probably freak people out. Not this one apparently. Inside, it appeared as a typical kind of late-night restaurant, appealing to both families and individuals. Greg ordered a table for two, and the many featured many typical foods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Naomi...\" started Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you..um...changed into that spear, what was it like?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....hmmm, kind of hard to say. I felt like I was myself, yet not myself. I felt strong though, more than I ever had before,\" said Naomi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same for me. I wonder what it's all really about,\" pondered Greg. Then, Naomi smiled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's for another day. I've been dying to try these American burgers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg could do nothing but chuckle.</span></div></div>",

She slipped on her regular clothes and walked out of her room to see Greg ready to go and awake?\" He asked with a bit of a smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned and put her hand to her head. \"As a awake as I can be in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two soon went off to the academy. They realized that they were both in the same class. When it came to finding the classmi just about circled through the halls twice before Greg stepped in to find the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were soon in seats next to one another in the class. The class was a bit...weird. It started off with the teacher talking about a man long ago who devoured human souls. He was driven insane and became something called the Kishin. Luckily however, Lord Death was able contain the Kishin and locked him away within the academy. To stop this from ever happening, they looked for people who could become weapons and meisters to use them to help stop those who may try to become a Kishin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, a goal for the weapons would be to consume the souls of those who try to become Kishins. Specifically, 99 Kishin souls and the soul of one witch. Completing so would allow you to be used by Lord Death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the two were given time to try and do what they did yesterday in the courtyard but without the accessories that caused it. They were taught about 'Soul Resonance' lining up their Souls' wavelengths in order to function greater. After a few shaky tries, the two managed to achieve their previous form with Naomi again as a Pike. \"Yeah, finally got it!\" Naomi couldn't help but laugh. However weird her new role was, she was finally discovering how to use it. Today seemed to just be learning about Soul Resonance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

All we really did was work on you getting into weapon form easier. Besides, that teacher said something about wavelengths and the fact that we were really off,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's not too surprising. I didn't even know you before yesterday,\" said Naomi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true. I get the feeling that this is really going to take a while....great, I honestly don't have the patience for this,\" sighed Greg. Who knew how much training it was going to take for them to get in sync. To their credit, many other students didn't do well either, but a lot of them seemed to at least knew their partner well. The only thing Greg and Naomi knew about each other was where they were from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, enough depressing thoughts, I'm hungry!\" Naomi clapped her hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, do you know how to cook?\" Greg said plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fairly good. I had to teach myself a bit before coming to his country. Nothing too special though. What about you?\" Naomi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, you don't want to taste my cooking. Trust me, I tried once,\" said Greg. \"I'm pretty bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I don't think it would be too hard if you knew the recipe,\" pondered Naomi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's always one thing or another. Sometimes, I turn the stove on too high, or not cook the meat enough, or whatever. The list goes on and on.\" Greg said. Naomi tilted her head slightly to the side, but didn't object. The decision was made then for her to cook dinner. Greg figured that they would need the energy. Starting tomorrow, there would be more classes. After all, in addition to meister and weapon duties, they apparently still needed to learn typical school topics, like math and science. Greg paled at the thought of it. Guess there was no avoiding that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Greg, if you aren't going to do anything else, then at least pass me the condiments!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mother,\" Greg groaned.</span></div></div>",

Me literally becoming a weapon, meeting you, a meister. I'm wondering how all this will turn out.\" She sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg spoke up a moment later. \"I've been thinking the same thing for awhile. But I think we'll be fine.

It wasn't long before they were sent after those who are trying to become Kishins. It was a bit unnerving for both of them the first time Naomi had to 'eat' a soul.  They began learning about witches and the Kishin himself.

The academy wants us to keep an eye out for anything.\" Naomi nodded to Greg's reply. \"Alright, but I don't think it can be too serious, and if it is, we can fight it off right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked through the street and they were about two blocks from their home when night came.  \"That's odd. It's only 6 P.M.\" Naomi said. Greg answered back, \"This might be what the academy is talking about. Maybe we should-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could finish, Naomi and Greg heard a bloodcurdling cackle. The duo turned and looked up toward the figure on the roof. She wore a dark robe with odd designs and a hood and some kind of talisman around her neck. \"It's lovely, isn't it?\" She said looking up to the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we help you?\" Greg said a bit surprised. The woman turned back with a beaming, unnerving smile. She then jumped down by them. \"Yes, you can die and be a clear message to your academy.\" She said and threw out her hand, from the shadows casted came black tendrils that lunged toward them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were fast enough to dodge the tendrils. \"Naomi!\" Greg yelled. \"On it!\" She jumped back to Greg and began resonance turning into a Pike. The woman laughed, \"Oh, that's cute.\" She pointed at them with her palm up and bent her finger. Shadows cast by a building behind them launched tendrils as well. Greg jumped out of the way and began to take a few jabs at the woman with Naomi. She focused on her but seemed unable to hit her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman yawned. \"I'm getting bored.\" She waved her hand and caused a wall to form behind them and to their immediate sides. Leaving them open to the front for attack. The woman launched again another volley of tendrils, but now they had no where to run. \"Greg!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi dropped out of her form and took the blow, the tendrils pierced her through the chest, arms, thighs while one sliced at her face across her eye. Greg took no damage from it from Naomi shielding him. Naomi looked back with her injured eye. \"Greg...you...?\" She soon fell onto her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman groaned. \"That sucks. I wanted to kill both of you at once. Oh well, maybe next time,\" she grinned and then simply disappeared, leaving Greg with Naomi.</span></div></div>",

However, while Greg could see that her vitals had likely not been hit, the biggest concern was Naomi's face. The attack went vertical across Naomi's left eye, practically slicing through it. He gently turned her over to get a better look, hoping that she hadn't bled out already. To his surprise, she was still awake, a small smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you smiling about?!\" Greg nearly yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...I'm not....too sure....Did I...screw up?\" She was clearly attempting to humor him, but her voice had no effort behind it. Greg certainly wasn't in the mood for that nonsense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You moron....\" Greg spoke quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everyone alright?!\" Greg immediately turned to see a small group headed their way. It was one of their teachers, leading a small group of meisters. It was Mr. Tristin Homs, one of many teachers at the academy. The man had short brown hair, wearing a suit that would almost make you think he was a part of the military. Thankfully, he didn't act like one. Fittingly, he was a Gunner Meister. However, one look at the scene gave the man all he needed to know. \"Call the medical team immediately! Tell them we have a student down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\" Two of the crew members complied and called back to the academy. Meanwhile, Tristin walked over to the fallen Naomi, who was still conscious but pretty much numb by this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think, sir?\" asked Greg with worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what I can tell, her vitals are still intact. We just have to make sure she doesn't bleed out,\" replied the teacher. He glanced over the wounds, observing how they were formed. \"Did whoever do this use shadow tendrils on any kind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, that's right!\" confirmed Greg. \"Wait, how did you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had been getting reports of a \"Shadow Witch\" around the area. Nothing too special, just your usual witch with a grudge. Still, she's obviously more than a match for a rookie meister,\" spoke Mr. Homs. The last remark didn't sit well with Greg, though it was true. The last month did well for him and Naomi, but they were still far from polished. Of their missions, they had collected 8 Kishin eggs, but they were all small-time villains. Half the time, they couldn't even get Naomi's weapon form to work right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This sucks...couldn't do a damn thing....\" Greg mumbled in anger, both for that witch and his weakness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't beat yourself up for it. You're simply not ready. That's what the academy is for,\" said the teacher as he continued to stabilize Naomi. Eventually, a medical corps arrived, taking Naomi in. Greg knew that there would be no sleep for him tonight, so he insisted that he come along.</span></div></div>",

Greg was about to apologize to her before Naomi let out a faint noise, \"I'm an idiot...\" She felt her eye water up. \"I must've worried you so much I...just wanted to protect you. Now look at me,\" she choked the last part out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moron.\" She looked to Greg who had just spoken up. \"I should be apologizing.

Her left eye was still bandaged, which she just left that way. However, while her chest injuries had healed a bit, she was told to not transform or do anything strenuous for a while. She accepted that grudgingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, Greg at least helped her home, as if Naomi would make it there otherwise. They got some sympathetic looks on the way back, to which Greg was thankful for. Still, it brought his mind back to the event. They were nowhere near that witch's power. Who knows how long it would take for them to reach it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg, are you alright?\" Naomi asked with a curious look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, I'm fine. Just thinking.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? If you need to talk, I can...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't bring it up,\" Greg snapped back, not wanting to talk about it anymore. Rather than look offended, Naomi just let the topic slide for now. They eventually got back to the apartment, though it was getting late. It was about time for dinner. One of Naomi's arms was still too injured for her to use, which left them with either going out or Greg cooking. Truth be told, Greg didn't want to cook. They got a good pay for the times they had to go out in search of evil humans, but he didn't want to spend it all. Well, perhaps it was just time to bite the bullet and give it a try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try and whip up something,\" Greg said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You're going to cook?\" Naomi asked with a surprised look. Greg had refused to cook over the last month, so she never really got to see why he beat himself up over it so much. Well anyway, Greg sat her down on the sofa so she could watch TV while he gave it a go. To be honest, this was the girl who saved his life. He really wanted to nail this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Greg ended up making some spaghetti, though he ended up putting in too much tomato sauce and paste. He probably got them mixed up again. In all honesty though, it was passable, according to Naomi anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Compared to how gloomy you were on it, I think you can improve,\" she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's more positive than my parents put it,\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, if you can improve on cooking, then that means I can learn to read directions,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck on that,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them shared a nice laugh after that, nice to think about the positive things after all, though guilt still continued to linger in Greg's mind.</span></div></div>",
