One day, its only employee of any merit, Captain Olimar, was hit by an asteroid and crashed on an uncharted planet while on a vacation. However, he was aided by mysterious creatures which he called Pikmin. With all the ship parts is gathered and fix up, Captain Olimar escaped the uncharted planet. But in Olimar's absence, his employer, Hocotate Freight, ran into a rather...fiancial problem...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Olimar flew into the Hocotate's atmosphere and safely landed at the Hocotate Freight site where he is greeted by the President of the Hocotate Freight and the local yet dimwit employee Louie. Olimar jumps out the ship with a bottle cap-like object in his hands, expecting a good greeting from the President, though it was more than a delivery of bad news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, Olimar! I'm so glad you are safe! Yes, very glad. Quite glad...\" said the President. \"But...sadly, I have an announcement that is...not so glad: Our company is going under. Yes, we're finished...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What? What happened, sir?\" Olimar asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...on his first mission, Louie here met a vicious and ravenous space bunny...and an entire load of golden Pikpik brand carrots was eaten!\" The President said while imitating a space bunny eating the carrots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's terrible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that wasn't the terrible part. I took out an enormous loan to repay the debt from this loss! I decided to sell off corporate assets to repay the loan, but...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlimar then heard a siren, spotting a flying machine with a large claw underneath heading this way. The machine grabbed the ship by the claw and flew away with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...That was the only asset we have to sale, mainly your ship, the S.S. Dolphin. But sadly, that wasn't enough...right now the rest of loan is now total...10,100 Pokos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-That much!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...and we have no means to repay it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlimar was stunned at the huge loan, so stunned that he dropped the object, rolling up to Louie's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! What is that, Olimar?\" the President asked,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, it's a souvenir I found on the planet for my kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, an old ship, known as Hocotate ship, begins to speak. \"Treasure! Treasure! Treasure! Money! Money! Money! Money!\" it then opens the hatch and beams up the object. \"Initiating valuation of the recovered treasure. This artifact is worth...100 Pokos!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-Wh-What!?\" The President sputters then becomes amazed at this object's value. The loan he must pay off is now 10,000 Pokos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This thing is worth 100 Pokos!? That's more than a year's salary!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush up, you! Olimar! You did say that it was from the planet you were stranded on!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir and there are more of them, some even bigger than that artifact.\" said Olimar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!?! That's wonderful to hear! Now I can repay the debt!\" The President shouted with joy before turning his attention to Louie. \"Louie, you dolt! Look alive! You must depart immediately with Captain Olimar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two captains look at each for a moment until they both nodded in agreement and got onboard the Hocotate ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck, you two and bring me those-ooooh!\" The President was blown away as the ship takes off into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfy of how to pay off the debt, the President trouts away to go check on his wife until a paper materializes in thin air, hitting the President's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof! What the..?\" The President grabs the paper, reading of what it said. \"Hmm...NanoCorps...the best mercenaries in the universe...? Will work for free...? Hmmm...well, Olimar can handle himself, but Louie...hmm...perhaps I could hire one...\" The President nodded before resuming his victory trout. Oblivious to the President, an unknown figure, standing on top of a sign, watching the event unfold, letting out a familiar laugh before he disappears...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Meanwhile, in the NanoCorps' dimension, inside FlameHeart Keep...</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe NanoCorps, greatest mercenaries in the world, have been busy lately. Thanks to Zeke's idea of spreading their info around not just their world, but different worlds. Looking through different requests from the computer, Beta received an anonymous requester that is not from this world or rather their dimension.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Andross. I require your assistance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up, Beta?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems we received a request from an unknown sender that is not from our world or other known worlds. The coordinates seem to be...off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...pull it up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeta activates a hologram from his chest, revealing the sender's words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let see...'company in debt'...'need help to assist the two captains'...'find artifacts to pay off debt'...sounds like this Hocotate Freight company is in trouble and this person wants our help to find treasures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a solution: Why don't we pay off their debt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could, but don't wanna hear Dave's ranting and crap, and he will shoot you for leaning others some money...which I need to talk about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another solution: Sending X, our fastest member, will get the job done quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's a good idea. I'll contact X after he's done with his mission and-\" Quentin heard a feminine voice from behind followed by a rather soft sensation on top of his head. Figuring out who it is, Quentin sighs in annoyance. \"...Amber, what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Booosssss~! Let me take the mission!\" Amber, the ditzy Majin, said while wrapping her long arms around the Drangua. \"I haven't done a solo mission like forever! Please let me take it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleeeeeeaaassssseee~? Pretty please with candy on top?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's 'cherry' on top and I'm not sure you are ready-\" Quentin felt Amber's grip is getting tighter and her bosom pushing down even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not letting you go until you say yes!\" Amber grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...Vixen will be upset if she sees this...alright alright, you got the job. Beta, send her to her destination\" Quentin sighs, feeling the pressure off of him with Amber jumps for joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me, Master Amber.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, boss! I'll try my best not to mess it up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Let's hope not</font>...ahem, yes, good luck, Amber! Contact us if you need anything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber nods and follows Beta to the wrapping device located in his laboratory. Quentin sighs once more knowing that Amber would probably screw this one up due to her...clumsy nature. But he should give her a chance...it's just a simple treasure hunting mission...right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'll check on her on every 30 minutes...just in case.\"</span></div></div>",

As the portal disappears, Amber begins to survey the area as part of the rule of NanoCorps if venturing into an unknown territory though there appears to be nothing but snow, tree stumps, and a little pound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hellooooo? Is anyone out here!?\" Amber shouted. Her voice echoes across the area but no response. \"Captain!? Are you here!? I'm the one you hired!\" Again, no response. \"Huh...he's not here...guess I'll wait for his arrival.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber sighs, brushing her hair aside from her face, looks up at the falling snow which increases the amount of snow and wind, while waiting for the captains...until she spots something in the corner of her eye, something flashing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? What is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Inside the Hocotate ship...</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Olimar and Louie have entered the snowy region and forced to fly through a blizzard, dodging branches. It was doing well until the ship came to close to one of the branches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah!? Brace yourself!\" Olimar said, bracing for impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?  Brace for wha-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship hits the branch, knocking off Louie into the snowy area. The ship with Olimar inside manages to drop with a thud, ejecting the leader to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof...that was a rough landing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brrrzzzt! You're telling me!\" The ship communicates with the captain. \"Good thing I have adverted a crash landing. Running diagnostics...Alert!  Alert! Louie is missing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He must have fallen off his cockpit from the impact...and he is not responding via his communicator. He is either flouting protocol or in danger! Captain Olimar! You must find Louie before he freezes to death in the cold of this planet-wait a minute...Captain! Look over there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Olimar looks up, spotting five familiar leaf-headed red figures battling a  small creature known as Dwarf Red Bulborb. \"Is that...the Pikmin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are the Pikmin? They need your help as we speak! Call out to them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlimar quickly gets up and got close to the fight before whistling the Pikmin. Hearing the familiar sound, the Pikmin comes running to Olimar, remembering him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to see you guys again! Now let's take care of that monster!\" Olimar grabs one of the Pikmin and throws it at the Bulborb's back with others follow pursuit. With few beatings, the Bulborb was defeated and the Pikmin return to Olimar's side.<br>\r\nOlimar is glad to see the Red Pikmin is alright and wondering where are the other Pikmin, but right now, he must find Louie before he's a goner. The only path he can search is straight ahead but it is blocked by an unknown brownish object. Olimar throws five Pikmin on top of it, but it will not budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear...seems I need to find more Pikmin, but there's no Onion in sight...I wonder...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain Olimar!\" the ship communicate. \"I have good news and really bad news!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh...what's the good news?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have just re-established my communications link with Louie, seems to be doing okay! Though I'm really worried about his conditions...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...the really bad news is he's on a life form...a MASSIVE life form. I cannot get any details of this creature but perhaps Louie can explain...unless he's in up inside the creature's belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh my...\" As Olimar worries about Louie's safety, he heard a loud booming sound that wasn't far. Could this be the massive creature's voice? Whatever this is, the captain is very worried about Louie...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><div align=\"center\">Meanwhile, in Louie's current location...</div></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Amber's POV</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber watches a small object entering the snow and crash into one of the tree branches, and a tiny figure was flown out and heading straight towards her. The Majin didn't react in time as the figure ends up diving into her shirt, between her large breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Amber gasped, causing her breasts to wobble a bit. \"What was that...? Is it a bug? It better not stealing my candies!\" Amber huffs before pressing her breasts in order to prevent the 'bug' descending. Using one of her hand to hold her breast, Amber begins fishing out of whatever it is that plop into her bosom. Feeling movements between her boobs, she was able to locate the intruder and grabs it, pulling out of her cleavage and as she opens her hand, she is rather surprised of what she saw: A very tiny creature with glowing blue antenna and dressed as a spaceman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, a tiny person! Hello there!\" Amber grins, waving at him. \"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Louie's POV</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouie is rather having a difficult time. He was flown off the ship by the impact, crashed landed on a soft and squishy surface, bouncing like crazy from the shaking, being picked up, and now facing what is possibly the biggest monster he ever saw. Standing on the landscape of pink surface which is the creature's hand, Louie is literally petrified by the sight of the monster: It has long black 'fur' on its head, red eyes that look very menacing, two long tentacles from its neck, black nails on its fingers, and a huge mouth that could devour the entire civilization! Even when it opens its mouth, he could see a row of sharp teeth, a massive blue tongue that is waiting for its prey and, the worst of all, the endless abyss that is waiting behind that hanging 'guardian', welcoming its prey to their doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature starts talking to him, couldn't understand its words due to its loud booming voice, but able to make out of the last words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><b>\"ARE YOU ALRIGHT?\"</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature seems to be rather concerned about him...or it could be a trap...but he must response or this monster might eat him. He quickly nodded, acknowledging it that he is okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><b>\"GOOD TO HEAR! NOW WHY WERE YOU IN MY CLEAVAGE? ARE YOU TRYING TO STEAL MY CANDY?\"</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill can't understand its booming voice and still terrified, he simply shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"chotpink\">\"AWW, ARE YOU SCARED OF ME? DON'T WORRY, I'M A FRIENDLY GIANT! MY NAME IS AMBER, PLEASE TO MEET YA!\"</span></b> The creature grins and winks at him. <b><span class=\"chotpink\">\"OH...THIS SOUNDS SILLY, BUT ARE YOU RELATED TO THE COMPANY CALLED HOCOTATE FREIGHT? I WAS HIRED BY THE COMPANY TO ASSIST SOME CAPTAINS IN SEARCH OF TREASURE. PERHAPS...YOU ARE ONE OF THE CAPTAINS?\"</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouie able to understand what Amber was saying and knowing this monster won't harm him and was surprised that it knows the company and that it was hired to help Olimar and himself in search for treasures. Louie quickly nodded to her, feeling quite relieved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"chotpink\">\"YOU ARE!? THAT'S GREAT! THOUGH IT'S KINDA WEIRD THEY DIDN'T MENTION THAT YOU'RE VERY SMALL...SMALLER THAN RICHIE...BUT A JOB'S A JOB!

The shadow man was stopped by the police earlier, but he made quick work on them before he runs off once more. As he enters the alley to where the headquarter is just a few blocks away, G.O.D heard a sound of a string being pulled and immediately halted at his track, just before an arrow zip past his head, puncture the wall.

The hunters don't know it could be from a big fan or something, but they decided to open the package. Inside the box is a strange device and a letter beside it...Quentin Andross, the Drangua leader, opens the letter while Danny, the joking woman lover recon, messes with the device but was swiped from his hands by Zeke, co-leader and a wise old gunman. Quentin reads out loud to the mercenaries to see what the mysterious letter have to say...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><span class=\"clred\"><i><b> Greetings! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am Dr. Van Micro, the greatest scientist in the world! I heard you are the best hunters around here...If so, then allow me to offer you a mission that could be very challenging and hard to refuse. I sent you my latest creation that allows you, mercenaries, to travel through time and space, into different dimensions. From there, I will send you a list of wanted names and I need to see the body of that targets...It's not like I don't trust you hunters or anything, just wanted to see how mighty and powerful you hunters are...Oh yes, two things I must tell you: Since you are called NanoCorps...I added the device to change your size, making you smaller. A bit smaller than an ant...and the second thing is...the targets are all females! Let's just say I have a thing for big gals~ MWHAHAHAHAHA! Good luck out there hunters! I will reward you handsomely and look forward to your success...that is if you lot survive!.MWHAHAHAHA!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSigned,<br>\r\nDr. Van Micro: Manly Genius</b></i></span></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finish reading the letter, Quentin and the others look at each other with confusion and skeptical. Viz Archer, the tough and cold hunter with two robotic arms, shake his head in disbelief and protest on taking the mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have got to be kidding me,\" Viz said in his angry tone. \"I'm not gonna run around  killing women just for fun, especially while we're being a size of an ant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Siding with Viz here for once, that guy is a quack! Sounded like he treating us like test subjects!\" Petrie, one of the Three Recon Stooges said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" Ella, a member who has incredible ESP powers, groans at the cursed word she once endures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeep! S-Sorry, Ella...Anyway, it's closing time for us! We'll do it in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, let's just ignore his request, for now, my favorite program is about to come on...\" Ralph, second of the Recon Stooges, said in sarcastic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And  I'm getting hungry.\" Sharper, the last of the Recon Stooges said while rubbing his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always hungry, ya eejit!\" Petrie smacks the hungry merc on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep...sounds like a plan to me...\"  Slick, a powerful but lazy telekinesis said as he yawns while laying on the couch, scratching his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now hold on, guys. Remember one of the rules? 'No matter how ridiculous it is, we must grin and bear it.' Right? \" Quentin said, looking at every mercenary in the room, which all the hunters gave a simple nod. \"If Beta confirms that the device is working and able to use it, we're taking it. If not, we will kindly reply back to the doc it does not work and be done with it for tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph...I don't mind, it does sound challenging.\" The Namekian hunter, Orn, said...which is quite rare for him to say it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm with the big jolly green guy!\" The womanizer Danny said, patting against Orn's back. \"Especially the shrinking and women part...All the things we can do while shrunken and on a female's body...!\" Danny's perverted thoughts begin overtaken his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do know I have the ability to change sizes, right?\" said Aradia, the strongest mage in the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you lovely ladies are just too stingy of not letting us climb your bodies.\" Danny grins at the mage before an enraged princess, Alanna, wacks him on the head with the sword's hilt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid idiot.\" Alanna, the hotheaded elf princess member of NanoCorps, huffs in annoyance before turning her attention to Quentin. \"Are we serious accepting it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Part of the rules, Alanna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit...I really hate that rule and I'm starting to hate Micro now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, my sweet elf.\" Danny swoons over to Alanna with a big bump on his head. \"No need to get your hands dirty. Let us fellas beat Micro up...and maybe you can give me a smooch.\"  The womanizer pucker his lips, making sounds before the now angered Alanna kicks him in the gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the mercs continue their conversation, Beta begins scanning the device. The device has a knob on the right side and a button on the left, an antenna sticking out on the top and a screen at the center. It doesn't take for Beta to figure the device out and begins to press a button. A sudden burst of blue light appears in front of the hunters, creating a strange portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it the device works?\" Quentin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Affirmative.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well looks like we're taking the job,\" Quentin smirks at Viz, curses to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...great I guess?\" Sumiye, the superhuman officer, sighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know. I don't like it either, but rules are rules...and he did say he'll reward us, if not, then I'll allow you, girls, to beat him up till he does.\" Quentin grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like that plan.\" Sapphire, A female Roegadyn member, smirks while cracking her knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we go now? I wanna take a nap after we done with the mission...\" Rive, the blue-skinned Saiyan, yawns loudly before getting a flick on the head by her teacher Zyla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, kids. We can't just rush in there without knowing where we end up. It'll be safer if we do a 10-man squad. Quentin and I will go on ahead and we will contact you on who will come with us. Sounds good to you all?\" Zeke asks the members which they all agree...except for Slick who is already asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me. Pack up your equipment in case we select one of you guys...and keep an eye on Slick. He's already knocked out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every damn time...wake up, idiot!\".Shigeyoshi, a fearsome demon samurai, slaps Slick on the head, waking himself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful in there, Quentin,\" Vixen said while giving him a quick nuzzle against his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, we'll be alright. Remeber, guys! Be ready when called on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that settle, Quentin and Zeke enter the portal while the others, not without a few grumbles, ready themselves for this interesting mission. Little did they know that this strange mission...isn't what it seems to be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\">...At Dr. Micro's laboratory... <br>\r\n</div></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Van Micro watches the bounty hunters enter the portal from the computer screen, rubbing his hands with glee before turning around to face a certain guest that help him with the 'mission'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything according to plan, partner...now you did promise me for that big cash reward, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person he was talking to is a shadowy tall slim being who is made of darkness, has glowing red eyes and mouth and shadow like fog appears beneath his feet. He wears a black three-piece gentleman's suit, black shoes, top hat, and long cape and carries a black sword hidden cane. He is well known for being the most wanted man in the world and a great enemy to the NanoCorps who are unable to catch him thanks to his cloning ability and almost covering the world in darkness before being thwarted by the hunters, the mysterious creature doesn't have a real name, but many people call him Gentleman of Darkness or 'G.O.D' for short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dohohoho! Of course, I did promise you a lovely sack of money once the NanoCorps are dead...no objections?\" The shadow man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't have any ill will against them...\" Micro said before grabbing a wad of cash, throwing them into the air, making all the cash rain down while giggling maniacally. \"Then again, with all the money I have here, I think I do have a little grudge against them! Death to the NanoCorps?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Death to the NanoCorps, dohohoho!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two laugh evilly before watching the leaders of NanoCorps enter the portal to a new destination and to their 'doom'. Will the NanoCorps be able to succeed this 'mission' or will G.O.D have his revenge...?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It appears the mercs are in someone's bedroom with the sunlight shining through the windows, brighten the room and the furniture seems to be quite fancy...almost a bit royalty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Check out the bed, it's huge! Way bigger than Atomic's!\" Petrie said, pointed at the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like Micro's device really works...I need to ask him if he got a spare...\" Danny chuckled at the thought of shrinking down to size and spy on his fellow female members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be glad any girls are here with us or they'll beat the shit out of you...\" Quentin sighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah.

The door suddenly open slowly, revealing a woman with long blue hair in a dress and blue wedges. Some mercs were in awe of her massive size and her stunning appearance, especially  Danny who couldn't keep his eyes off of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blue hair...beautiful...yep, this is Vivi,\" said Quentin. \"...And now we should move away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Cause she's royalty and all and we should bow down to her?\" said Jackle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah. You suppose to show respect to royalties and also...\" Before he continues, a familiar feeling of the ground trembling and the ear splitting booming noises interrupt him and the hunters notice a massive shadow falls before them. They all look up to see a sky of blue sole headed straight for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's heading our way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap!!\" Sharper yells and begins to panic. \"We're done for!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I totally want to die under her feet...\" Danny still mesmerized by her beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slick! Get us out of here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine...\" Slick said yawning before surrounding himself and the others in a purple aura and with a snap, the mercs vanish into thin air right before Vivi's foot made contact to the ground where they used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the NanoCorps escaping their demise, the sloth ended up taking them....</span></div></div>",

Even some painting and pictures that are one the wall have the same person along with towels with the person's face that said 'Gray-sama Love' with a heart at the end.

Before the mercs locate the sound, a large shadow covers them and they quickly look up to see a brown colored object heading coming down.. Froze was the first one to act as he dashes quickly to the safe spot with Orn following pursuit, Zark disappears into thin air and made it to the safe area before Froze and Orn has arrived, Quentin summons his dragon wings and glides towards the others, finally  Alpha  grabs the remaining mercs and activates his boosters to reach the other in just in the nick a time as the brown object slams down on their previous spot. All ten of the mercs made it safely and no one was hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Whew...thanks, Alpha,\" Skylar said as he breathing heavily and checking on Jet and Dash to see they are unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, For a moment there, I thought I was a goner,\" said Dr.Zeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too close in fact! Why didn't you warn us earlier!?\" Dave shouted at the behemoth robot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apologies, Master Dave. I was gathering data about her and this world. I failed to notice we were in danger.\" Alpha said. \"But the target, Juvia Lockser, is here. She is above us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mercs have noticed another object right beside them which is similar to the object that almost crushes them and upon closer inspection, those two objects are actually dark brown boots. The mercs look up to see a blue dress coat and since they are nearly underneath it, they can see a pair of blue panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Panty shot!\" Danny said drooling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep...very similar.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh-Shut up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mercs keep trailing the body, they can't get a good view of her face due to her 'mountains',  but they did see a lock of blue hair resting on the cloth covered breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we climb this mountain of beauty!?\" Danny asked Quentin, much to his annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just want to get a good view of her panties...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sadly, we don't have any teleporters with us, but we do have Alpha.\" said Zeke. \"He can turn into a hovercraft and can get us up there in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or we can climb...\" The womanizer drops to his knees, begging for the leader to pick climbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's his decision, laddie. What it'll be, Quentin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right then...I'll pick..\"</span></div></div>",

The young and cute looking Kaioshin who happens to be 75 million years old, wearing a robe that most of the Kaioshin wears and a pair of Potara earrings, and high heeled boots for her short stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiiiiii!\" The yellow and white bird named Tokitoki calls out to the Kai while sitting on one of his perching spots which is in the middle of the pond. The bird is strangely resembled of a wise old man and is a best friend and pet of the Kai and a very important one for the Time Nest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know! But it has been 3 hours since he left and I haven't heard from him since!\" The Kai huffs and being impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tooooh! Kiiiii!\" The bird caws again, this time it made the Kai stops in her tracks and gets angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! I am being patient, but I'm worried about Trunks and the patrols...\" The Kai sighs before resume her pacing. Just as the Kai about to contact Trunks once more, she suddenly sense a small yet faint presence near the stairways of the Time Storage Vault. She hurries over to where the presence is, noticing a tiny light floating near the stone walkway that is barely the size of a tiny incest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh..? What is that?\" The Kai got on her knees to get a better look at the tiny light. At first, she thought it was a time crack from the rift, but this is way too small to be a rift. As the Kai moves in for a closer look, the light begins to bright up and popping from the light are a group of tiny people, which are the NanoCorps, landed on the stones. Her eyes widen in shock, letting a gasp, watching the tiny group move around a bit before noticing the Kai and they too were quite stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is that!?\" Jackle shouted as he notices Chronoa's large face looming over them and prepares to charge up his electrical attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand down, Jackle!\" Quentin orders the renegade to halt the attack. \"I don't think she's hostile...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I guess that crazy doctor's invention really...now I see how different it is from Richie's point of view.\" said Vixen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mercs and the Kai stare at each other for a few minutes before Chronoa calmly speaks to the group without scaring them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>\"Hello there, do not be frighten...I'm a friendly giant, I guess...?\"</b></font> She smiles a bit, showing she means no harm to them...though she actually quite glad there are beings that are shorter than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>\"Kiiiii! Kiiiii!\"</b></font> Tokitoki squawks once more, ringing the mercs' ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">\"Not now, Tokitoki....\" </font></b>The Kai clutches her fist in anger before returning her attention to the NanoCorps.<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b> \"Sorry about my friend Tokitoki, he's always like this. So, are you guys the new Time Patrol recruits that Trunks mention?\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time Patrols? What the hell is-\" Jackle was about to say something but was covered by Zeke's giant mechanical hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we are the new Time Patrol recruits you just heard about. Trunks told us to go ahead and meet you here without him, he had other things to do.\" Zeke lied to the Kai which is very rare for Zeke to lie and it seems working for them as she believes his words. \"We decided to wrap over here but it looks like...it miscalculated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>\"In a very small way, hehe\"</b></font> The Kai giggles at her joke, although the mercs didn't laugh at her joke except for Jackle who gets the joke. Clearing her throat, the Kai stands up to full height with her hands on her hips, towering over the tiny 'Time Patrols', craning their necks to see her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, I just realized she looks young. How old is she?\" Rive whisperers to the group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's 75,000,000 years old.\" said Delta, shocking the mercs except for Zeke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beg your pardon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, she's much older than the old gran-\" Jackle's mouth was silence as Zark quickly covers his mouth while he and the others nervously look at Flare if she heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What?\" Flare looks at them, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Nothing, Flare!\" Vixen sighs before slapping Jackle across the head. \"Idiot! You know saying anything that relates her age is taboo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son of the- that hurt...I didn't know about that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you know...Delta, you sure about her age?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Supreme Kai of Time is 75,000,000 years old and before you asked, my calculation hasn't proved wrong.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this is true, A.I. rarely miscalculated.\" said Ryx. \"Anyway, you don't think she's our target?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure. Micro hasn't called us yet, but right now, play along,\" said Quentin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>\"What are you guys talking about?\"</b></font> The Kai's booming voice startle some mercs who was quite curious about their conversation, hoping they are talking about how huge she is right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Nothing, ma'am! Just talking about how awesome this Time Portal job gonna be and you look mighty fabulous I may add.\" Quentin said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>\"Aww, how sweet! Now hop on to my hand and I'll show you around the Time Nest!\"</b></font> The Kai smiles before she lowers hand towards them. One by one, the mercs hop aboard her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChronoa couldn't help but giggle to herself while watching them get onto her hand. Miscalculated or not, she never encounters such small people before and for the first time, she enjoys having someone shorter than her. Once the mercs are secured, the Kai takes them to the Time Storage Vault for a little tour and might come up with a mission just for them....for her pleasure that is...</span></div></div>",

Only Atomic was unaffected, which meant little for him since he didn't need weapons or armor anyway. Looking around, he also noticed a green bar at the edge of his vision, right underneath his name. Zeke noted it looked the view through his high tech goggles, except his head was bare. Quentin could also see green bars next to his comrades, along with a green icon floating above their head. Except for Atomic, who had a black icon floating above his monstrous visage. Well, it will make keeping track of his fellow mercs a bit easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was getting used to this new perspective of the world, a flashing envelope icon floating into view. Quentin tapped it, and Van Micro's shadowy visage emerged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>\u201cMwahahaha! Welcome to Sword Art Online, my good friends!\u201d</i></b> the mad scientist said through the video channel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe aren't your friends and what the hell is going on here!?\u201d Petrie yelled at the video window. \u201cWhere's our stuff? How are we supposed to fight anything with these kitchen knives?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\u201cDon't worry, your equipment is being sent back to your other members. You can reclaim it...that is, if you all alive.\"</b></i> the doctor cackled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough...where did you send us? What's this Sword Art Online?\u201d Cross interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\u201cIt's a popular online game, except you connect using your own cranium instead of a computer. But pay close attention to the name: guns aren't allowed in SWORD Art Online, obviously. You'll have to make due with those bladed weapons that I paid a lot of in-game currency for. Do you have any idea how long it took me to grind to get you that sword in your hands? So many skeletons-\u201d</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't care. What's the target?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\u201cUgh... of course. Well, if you die in this game, you die in real life. Scary, right? I put a regen skill on your equipment so you guys won't have to worry about it. But the daughter of a very important person is also trapped in this game, and some very powerful people want her taken out. So, all you have to do is defeat her here, and she'll never wake up over there! Of course, I'm getting paid handsomely-\u201d</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain. don't care. Where do we find her?\u201d Cross demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\u201cAlright alright...impatient, aren't we? \u201d</b></i> the doctor said, rubbing his chin. The mercs heard him hit a few keystrokes and a player's profile popped into each merc's view. A young girl's smiling face, framed by long brown hair. She was decked out in white and red armor, and a rapier hung sheathed at her hip. She was at a high level, with a lot of deadly skills. Quentin noticed her character name: Asuna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! What a cutie!\u201d Sharper said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad the womanizer mortal isn't with us.., he'll jump all over her.\u201d  Veil moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of size\u2026aren't we a bit small, or are those blades of grass just huge?\u201d Zeke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\u201cOh yeah! In order to transfer you guys into the game, I had to compress you really small! I wrote the algorithm myself, it's quite-\u201d</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't care...though it could be a problem with some of us here.\u201d Cross said while looking at the three recons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What's that suppose to mean?\" Petrie grumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Just use your skills and everything will be fine, trust me! At any rate, I should disconnect before the game notices this outside connection. Good luck, NanoCorps!\u201d</b></i> the scientist laughs as the window closed out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuentin turned to his gynoid companion Delta who has hacking capabilities that could come in handy in an online game like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDelta, can you find this target?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSearching now, Master Quentin\u2026 target acquired. She's currently on this level, staying at an inn in a town close by,\u201d the gynoid reported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShame we don't have any teleporters. \u201d Ralph sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke examined his spear. \u201cTaking down even the weakest monster will be a challenge at this size. Delta, can you perhaps hack the game to remove the target from the player list, so it will look as if she was killed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is possible, but only if the target was rendered unconscious first. The game's security layer is simply too secure otherwise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuentin slammed his fist down into his open palm. \u201cThat's the plan, then. We ambush the target and render her unconscious, then we remove her character from the game's roster. Then we'll get the hell out of here,\u201d the young leader said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good to me. What's the plan?\u201d Petrie inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...\u201d</span></div></div>",

We have more than enough space to play with out here in this field,\u201d Quentin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026if we don't get eaten by a monster first,\u201d Sharper whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDelta, send a message to Asuna. Make it say that you're being attacked by a huge monster and you need help. Also, make it look like it was sent by some weakling player,\u201d Quentin told his robotic comrade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSending now,\u201d Delta said, her hands quickly tapping out a message in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Seriously!? We're gonna fight a monster that is twice the size of us!?\u201d Sharper gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh..we do have a monster, kid. He's right beside us,\u201d Zeke said, slapping Atomic on the leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, this 'monster' got feelings, ya know!\u201d Atomic laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlrighty, let's get started. Here what we gonna do...\u201d the young Drangua ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b><i>...Later in the day\u2026</i></b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom their perch atop the highest tree branch, the three recon stooges and Veil were the first ones to see the target approaching. The young girl certainly didn't waste any time getting here. The target's long brown hair streamed behind her as she ran to the coordinates sent in the message. Sunlight glinted off her armor as she ran through the field at full steam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh...she must be quite the do-gooder to come running out here so quickly,\u201d observed Ralph. \u201cHow revolting...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe's even cuter in person! What a goddess!\u201d Sharper drooled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetrie knocked both of their heads together. \u201cStay quiet, ya dimwits and wait for the signal!\u201d the older recon said while the angel simply sighs at their usual goof-ups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like Ralph said, Asuna wasted no time coming to the rescue. She remembered how scared she was when she was a weak player, always afraid of death lurking right around the corner. She didn't think twice, quickly donning her armor and running to where the player said he was cornered by a monster. However, as she got closer, she couldn't believe her eyes. It looked like an action figure was fighting against a monster the size of a small dog. Still, the monster had a black icon hovering over its bulk, telling her this was a seriously strong monster. Even at her high level, there was still dangerous beasts roaming about. The player, who is Revenant, fighting the monster was fending off its attacks but looked like he was giving a bit of ground with each parry. But why was he so tiny? Was this a glitch in the system, or a new status effect? Also, he looked strange. Maybe a custom avatar? Whatever, she could ask him once she defeated the beast. The monster was terrifyingly muscular and demonic. Asuna would have to be on her toes to defeat this creature. She equipped her rapier and prepared to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo easy, Atomic...\u201d the undead knight said, just barely avoiding another one of his invincible comrade's swipes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour blessed armor can take a punch, plus we gotta make it look realistic, so better keep up!\u201d Atomic roared with a laugh. They both turned as they heard thundering footsteps approach. Their target came into view, sword in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>\u201cHey there! Don't worry, I'll defeat this monster in a jiffy!\u201d</b></font> Asuna said, getting into an attack stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh! She has the voice of an angel!\u201d Sharper drooled. \u201cDo we really have to do this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust follow orders, dammit!\u201d Petrie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"...I seriously don't know how these mortals still remain in the group...\" </i>Veil thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you say something, Veil?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\u201cLinear!\u201d</b></font> Asuna shouted, as her body began to glow. Before anyone could blink, she lunged forward at an incredible speed, rapier pointed directly at Atomic. For anyone else, they would be impaled before they could even draw another breath. But Atomic's reflexes were unparalleled. From his view, the sword looked like the pointy end of a skyscraper was headed directly at him. His world exploded in pain as the sword entered his body, but just as quickly, his arms wrapped around the blade of the rapier. He planted his feet and kept the rapier stuck inside his body. He watched his own HP display dip briefly before his invincibility kicked in and his HP filled back up. Using his incredible strength, he wrenched the sword away from the giantess's grip. Shocked, the Lightning Flash began to stumble. She had never seen a monster parry an attack so with such speed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGah...first time I felt pain before. Alright fellas, get to it because this hurts like hell!\u201d Atomic roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo go go!\u201d Quentin ordered. Asuna was so confused over being disarmed that she didn't even notice the three tiny recon stooges and Veil drop from the tree above her. Brandishing their weapons, the four jumped into Asuna's thick curtain of hair and plunge their swords, lance, and knives right between the target's shoulder blades. Their weight caused them to drag their weapons right down the giantess's back, and they landed on the ground right between her armored feet. Sharper began to look up Asuna's skirt before Petrie dragged him away before they could be stepped on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna doubled over in pain. The attack didn't do much damage, but she was now fighting multiple unknown enemies without a weapon. Quentin noticed the icons over the mercs' heads now turned orange. Asuna noticed this change as well and wondered why there are tiny player-killers running around. Is this a new trick by Laughing Coffin? Whatever the case, she had to defeat these PKers and warn other players. Tiny infiltrators would be a menace, for any guild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she opened her inventory menu to equip a backup sword, she failed to notice four more tiny mercs rush from the grass towards her feet. Before she could finish the equipment change, Zeke, Quentin, Cross, and Delta sliced into the giantess's ankle, causing another glowing red wound on her avatar. Asuna saw a dreaded icon appear under her HP display: a boot with a red line through it. Limited mobility means certain death, especially since she's alone. Her knees buckled under her as she toppled forward, but she caught her fall with her hands. She looked up to see the tiny Quentin, along with the others, drawn his blade out, ready to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Asuna. I hate to do this...but orders are orders...\"</span></div></div>",

With his quarry down on her hands and knees, it didn\u2019t feel much like a hunt. He remembered the heat from the Quantum Dragon\u2019s belly as he sliced the creature in two during his first mission on the eighth moon around Regolith IV, along with Amber, Cross, and Viz.  His skin crawled as he recalled the slimy flesh of the Plutonium Squid deep in the Endless Ocean on Europa that had taken out a whole platoon of the galaxy\u2019s best bounty hunters and mercenaries before Quentin shoved a nuke through its maw. But this target, as huge as she was, was still a cute young girl. Under a dangling fringe of brown hair, her brown eyes still blazed with fire, calling to mind the old saying that a cornered animal is always the most dangerous. Oh well, he just wanted this job to be over with. His fellow mercs had done all the dirty work of disabling the target, and all that was left was for their fearless leader to knock her out. He flipped his blade over to its flat side, in order to deliver a powerful thwack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Drangua\u2019s calf muscles bulged as he prepared to launch himself at Asuna. The ground cracked under his feet as he leaped skyward, toward\u2019s Asuna\u2019s heavenly face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDragon Maw Strike!\u201d he yelled, as Asuna\u2019s face loomed in the sky above him, coming ever closer like a falling planetary body. \u201cAsuna the Lightning Flash was it? I'll admit, I was kinda hoping to see you move that fast, like one of my comrades who aren't here, but you get the gest.\u201d the Drangua said. \u201cBut I believe its checkmate for you...no hard feelings!\u201d he shouted up at his quarry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, the brown-haired swordswoman was about to live up to her nickname. Shifting her weight to her left side, she reached out with her right hand, intending to intercept the tiny PKer in midair. Of course, with his extremely high reflexes, Quentin saw the hand coming from a mile away, fingers outstretched like talons. Quentin always had his handy dragon wings ready to pop out at a moment\u2019s notice and needs them now than ever.  He squeezed his back muscles, and before his wings could sprout out, a video message appeared before his eyes. Dr. Van Micro\u2019s shadowy visage appeared in the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...we're kinda in a middle of a battle here, doc.\u201d Quentin sighs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\u201cOh, you are? Well just to let you know, flying has not been implemented in this game! If you want to soar through the skies, you\u2019ll have to play this game\u2019s successor. In fact-\u201d</b></i> the crazy scientist blathered before Quentin tapped the window closed with a groan. With no way to alter his trajectory, the Drangua was helpless to evade as Asuna\u2019s hand grabbed him. He slammed into the skin of her palm hard enough to knock the wind out of him. Her slender fingers closed around him in a vice-like grip, crushing his lungs. His head and shoulders still poked out, however, and he quickly swung his sword around to sever the offending appendage. He still had the flat side of the sword facing her, however, and he silently cursed himself as the broadsword bounced off her wrist with a resounding thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna winced in pain, but quickly pivoted her weight onto her left hand and kicked out with her uninjured leg in a sweep, sending the mercs gathered around her feet flying into the weeds. Sharper just happened to be ducking to retie his shoe, and he got a heavenly glimpse of Asuna\u2019s panties in full view underneath her red skirt. Momentarily out of danger, the swordswoman collapsed down onto her butt, crushing Sharper underneath. The soft material of the giantess\u2019s panties did nothing to cushion the blow, and Sharper\u2019s HP quickly fell to 0 as her massive weight crushed him into the dirt. Because of the doc\u2019s machinations, he still remained in the game, but his HP couldn\u2019t recover while the giant girl\u2019s rear remained on top of him. But in all his travels, there was nowhere he would rather be more, then under the rear of the girl who he just fell in love with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch...Sharper just got crushed under Asuna's ass...\" Ralph said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serves him right for being like Danny!\" Petrie shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Quentin could strike another blow, Asuna\u2019s left hand hovered over his head and two slender fingers roughly pinched his wrists together, then plucked his sword from his grip and threw it away. Now disarmed as well, the Drangua looked in dismay at the icon of a sword with a slash through it right under his HP bar. Luckily. he wasn\u2019t the only member of the group. Quentin looked around from his elevated view, but could only see Atomic still impaled by Asuna\u2019s sword. That was a bit of a stalemate, as removing the sword from his body would allow Atomic full movement, but would give the swordswoman back her weapon, which might spell doom for them, now that she\u2019s more familiar with their tactics. Certainly, Zeke was planning their next move, hidden in the tall grass with the rest of his fellow hunters. Except for Sharper, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith little else to do, Quentin took stock of his captor. His heightened sense of smell was filled with the tangy bite of Asuna\u2019s sweat, but he could also detect faint traces of vanilla. He met her piercing brown eyes with his own gaze. Long caramel-colored hair cascaded down around her flawless face. Her clothes were impeccably tailored and flattered her form. She almost reminds of Vixen, she has a fierce fighting spirit and never backing down, he was actually impressed of her spirit even backed into a corner by highly-skilled adversaries, she was still giving it everything she\u2019s got. As someone who has had his share of scrapes with death, the Drangua knew that look in her eyes: the look of someone who would never give up...yes, she is definitely like Vixen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>\u201cListen up!\u201d</b></font> Asuna yelled, projecting her voice towards the hidden mercs. \u201c<b><font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">Throw down your weapons and surrender, or...\u201d</font></b> she said, two fingers of her other hand reaching down and squeezing Quentin\u2019s head. <b><font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">\u201c Or I\u2019ll kill your leader!\u201d</font><br>\r\n</b><br>\r\nDespite the crushing cranial pressure, Quentin\u2019s ears still worked well enough to hear peals of mocking laughter coming from the grass. \u201cGo ahead, do it!\u201d Petrie said. \u201cHe still hasn\u2019t given us our pay from the last two mission!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, what? I did give you a pay-wait a minute...\" Quentin realized Petrie was actually joking, trying to give some tension so Zeke can figure out what to do next. \"I see...uh,  I\u2019ve been meaning to! I just haven\u2019t gotten around to balancing the checkbook yet!\u201d Quentin shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe deserves it\u201d mocked Ralph. \u201cHe always cooks the worst food too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd he never wants to do the laundry!\u201d said Atomic<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd he snores!\u201d followed by Veil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay..that kinda hurts...\" Quentin sighs. \u201cUhh...when this is all over, you\u2019re all fired with no pay!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crushing pressure finally lets up as Asuna stopped pinching Quentin\u2019s skull. <b><font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">\u201c Being a leader is tough, huh?\u201d</font></b> she said to him, knowingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh, kinda. They never want to wake up early, or do any recon on the target, or take out the trash...I mean, the trash cans are always full and never been taken out!\u201d the leader, falsely,  complained. He could tell immediately that Asuna was one of those born leaders, that people would follow to the very pits of hell. Just like himself. But this is no time to be making friends with his target! Quentin might\u2019ve been new to this game, but he quickly figured out Asuna\u2019s strategy: by stalling for time until her HP recovered and her ailments went away, she would be able to escape. If she hid somewhere or summoned help, this job would quickly become impossible. Quentin had never lost a target yet, but he\u2019ll need his fellow mercs\u2019 help more than usual on this job\u2026</span></div></div>",

It's Asuna he's concern now she's fully recovered and stands. Sharper, who was pinned underneath Asuna, was finally able to move and rolled onto his back, only to be greeted with the sight of her white panties once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh...what a beautiful sight...\" Sharper smiles with his nose gushing out blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Idiot.\" Petrie facepalms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtomic, meanwhile, was barely hanging on to Asuna's sword, cursing up a storm from having so much pain.\"Son of a bitch!

Emerging from their hiding spot, the NanoCorps were about to attack her in order to rescue Quentin, Asuna made a quick announcement while pointing her rapier towards them, stopping them in their tracks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">\"Do not come any closer or I'll cut down your leader!\"</font></b> Asuna threatens them and to back this, she holds her rapier near Quentin's head, though she really doesn't want to harm the tiny player.<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b> \"Cooperate and he'll be unharmed.

I might be back...depends on the situation.\" Quentin said with a nod, signaling the co-leader to stand down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...very well. All players stan down. Let her go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? After she cut me not once, but twice!?\" Atomic roared in anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold, you abomination. I do believe they have a plan...\" said Veil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtomic growls at first, but decided to stand down along with the others. Asuna, sighs in relief and moves her sword away from the Drangua, safely sheathe her weapon for next battle, brought out a small, large to Quentin, glowing blue crystal out of her inventory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\"Teleport Granzam!\"</b></font> Asuna shouted and the crystal begins to glow brightly before disappearing into thin air, leaving the NanoCorps behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooo, what are we gonna tell Vixen about this? She'll kill us!\" Petrie whines as he rubbing his bald head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, kid. She just told us where they are headed: Granzam.\" said Zeke while checking on Atomic as he slowly recovering his wounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is located on the 55th Floor.\" Delta said while tapping on the window screen. \"We need a Teleport Crystal to reach 55th Floor. However, it seems the human know as Micro had forgotten to supply us with crystals and we must achieve them from shops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curious, but what Floor are we on right now?\" Revenant asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...1st Floor where a settlement called Town of Beginnings resides.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D'OH!!\" Petrie, along with the other two, groans while facepalming. \"It always had to be the first floor. It happens like every damn mission!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's head over to the town for now, kids. We may have to find an ally to help us out.\" said Zeke as he about head towards the entrance of the town with the other folllowed behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...should've brought Slick or Ella with us...\" Sharper whines before Veil slaps him across the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit your crying and get moving, mortal. I don't like it as well since there is no flying in this game, but we gotta deal with it and find a way to save Quentin.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah...maybe they got something to snack on...\" Sharper rubbing his stomach as it growls for food. He also worries about his boss's safety, who knows what she gonna do to him not after what just happen...he can only hope the Drangua can find a way to escape and reunite with the others...but right now, he got other things to worried about...like food as the tiny NanoCorps entering the town known as Town of Beginnings...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The gynoid was calculating and typing with her personal computer, trying to think of a plan to save Quentin. However, Zeke had something in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDelta, can you hack into Asuna\u2019s inventory?\u201d the co-leader asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHacking now, Master Zeke.\u201d Delta said, windows popping in and out of existence as she tried to hack into Asuna\u2019s profile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you thinking?\u201d Petrie asked, coming up to the group. The rest of the mercs except Atomic followed closely behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if we can add a poisonous item to the target\u2019s inventory, we might be able to make her sick or a bomb would damage her...\u201d Zeke contemplated, rubbing his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDisplaying target\u2019s inventory now,\u201d Delta announced. Asuna\u2019s armor and clothing were displayed in a window, along with her items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm...what does this button do?\u201d Ralph said, tapping at a random button at the bottom of the window. The button glowed, and all of Asuna\u2019s equipment was now added to her inventory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh dear...the button Master Ralph just push have de-equip everything on the target,\u201d Delta explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh\u2026whoops,\u201d Ralph laughs sheepishly as mercs glared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b><i>...Meanwhile, back to Quentin and Asuna...</i></b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>\u201cBut still\u2026 it\u2019s nice to have friends, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</b></font> Asuna said, starting to bond with the tiny Drangua in her hand. He wasn\u2019t the usual PKer scum. She felt a bit of a bond with him, as a fellow warrior. However, she noticed that her HP had recovered enough to remove her movement disability. Finally, she could make tracks. Before she could move, however, her armor and clothes began to glow with a blue light\u2026 before disappearing entirely. The giantess was now as naked as the day she was born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh sweet dragon's shit...\" Quentin groans at the sight of Asuna's naked body, knowing someone screw up her inventory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping in embarrassment and rage, she balled her hands into fists. Unfortunately for one Drangua, however, he currently occupied one fist, and his eyeballs nearly popped out of his skull, both from the pressure and the incredible view in front of him. Asuna\u2019s porcelain skin glistened in the sunlight, her hair covering her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">\u201cYou bastards! What did you do?! You\u2019re gonna pay for this!\u201d</font></b> Asuna roared, standing up. The pressure on him now released, Sharper rolled onto his back, only to be greeted with the greatest sight of his life: the backside of the girl he fell in love with, now completely bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Shit, should have brought my camera...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna was overcome with rage. First, they attack her like cowards, now they figured out a way to remove all her clothes. People or not, she wouldn\u2019t stop until they were all dead. First one up, however, is their leader, still helpless in her hand. Brushing aside any thoughts of camaraderie she once had with the young Drangua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Asuna...let's not be hasty...that was an acci-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words cannot reach her ears as she opened her lips and raised Quentin to her mouth. The target\u2019s once-angelic face was now creased with anger, as she brought him closer to her lips. How convenient, his head was the perfect size to fit between her teeth like a piece of candy. Quentin saw a strand of saliva break into droplets between the giantess\u2019s pink lips as her hot breath washed over him. He could see her muscular tongue ready to strike like the Beast Anaconda from The Jungle Planet, the wettest, slimiest creature Quentin had ever faced. Until now, that is. The back of Asuna\u2019s throat led to a deep abyss, but there would be no climbing out of that crevasse. Quentin\u2019s head was placed on a glistening white tooth, as the giantess placed him into her mouth like a large lollipop. Except this lollipop had an extra-juicy center. The cavernous maw quickly darkened as Asuna\u2019s lips closed. Her top row of teeth slammed down on Quentin\u2019s neck, severing it. He watched his HP bar plunge to 0, but his vision never went completely dark. Looks like the crazy doc\u2019s modifications made him unable to die even if decapitated. Still, it looks like he\u2019ll be out of this fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stream of digital blood dribbled down Asuna\u2019s chin as she pulled Quentin\u2019s headless torso out of her mouth with a grin. She tossed the body into the grass before wiping her chin with the back of her hand. <font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>\u201cLooks like your boss lost his head...\u201d</b></font> she cackled. <b><font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">\u201cBut don\u2019t worry. Soon you\u2019ll join him!\u201d</font></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHOLY STINKING DOG SHIT!!! She just tore off Quentin's head!\u201d Petrie screams and watches the giant naked girl stomped toward them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...that was brutal...\" said Ralph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo kidding, dumbass! It's your fault for pressing that button!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh right...my bad.\u201d Ralph offered before Veil punched him hard enough to pound him into the dirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always knew one of you three mortals would make a mistake and now we're paying the price...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna\u2019s fist crashed into the group, sending Ralph even further into the ground and sending the rest of the mercs flying through the air like shrapnel. They could barely stand up before the giantess sundered them again with her bare hands and feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\u201cWhy\u2026 won\u2019t\u2026. you\u2026 DIE!?!\u201d</b></font> she said through her teeth, unaware of the tiny hunter\u2019s invulnerability. Still, she continued to stomp and punch them mercilessly. Despite their HP reaching 0 multiple times, each merc continued to stand up, only to be thrown into the air again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay...maybe being unable to die isn\u2019t so great,\u201d Cross grumbled, as Asuna squashed him flat under her sole for the umpteenth time. By now, bits of digital blood trickled down from between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the commotion, Atomic, still holding onto Asuna's weapon,  looks over to see what's going on and was a bit of surprise seeing a giant naked girl stomping his comrades into oblivion. It was only when Ralph flew through the air and landed next to him that he decided to act. Seeing a large rock nearby, Atomic sprouts a tentacle from his back, grabbing the large rock and tossed it into Asuna\u2019s head. The swordswoman\u2019s eyes rolled backward and she fell onto her back, out cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke was just recovering from being crushed in Asuna\u2019s fist before her shadow fell over him. Expecting to see the dirty sole of her foot, he was inside surprised to see her toppling over like a fallen tree. He just managed to roll away as she collapsed onto the ground, throwing up clouds of dust. Brushing off his hat, he was delighted to see that Asuna\u2019s eyes were tightly closed. They can feel safe, for a little while. Sharper had already climbed onto the giantess\u2019s body and was currently spread eagle on her flat stomach, rising and falling with every breath. His eyes had hearts in them as he rubbed his cheek against Asuna\u2019s milky-white skin. Atomic, who came up to the others,  finally pulled the sword out of his body and threw it aside with a clang. \u201cDamn...I\u2019ll be feeling that one tomorrow,\u201d he roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad that\u2019s over with,\u201d Cross said, still upset about being crushed by Asuna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed. But we\u2019ve got one more problem to take care of,\u201d Zeke said, gesturing towards Quentin\u2019s headless body. \u201cSomeone has to retrieve Quentin's head from that girl before we can get out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd who will get that thankless job?\u201d Petrie asked, already knowing the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat'll be you and the other two, kid.. Get a move on.\u201d ordered the co-leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, always the best jobs,\u201d Ralph mumbled before being grabbed by Ralph and walking towards the fallen giantess\u2019s head. They grabbed fistfuls of her soft brown hair, and began climbing up her scalp. When they arrived at her forehead, they paused to admire the view. Asuna\u2019s nose rose gently upward before them, and her closed eyes were ringed by long eyelashes. The small hills of her breasts sloped downward into the plain of her stomach, and her long legs seemed to stretch to the horizon. They could see Sharper having the time of his life, rolling around like a child on Asuna\u2019s tummy. As they approached the target\u2019s lips, they were buffeted by a warm wind blowing from the giantess\u2019s nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, this is messing up my hair,\u201d complained Ralph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot my problem, now get moving!\u201d</span></div></div>",

The walls and floor were covered in shiny saliva, and the sharp teeth formed a sharp ring all around the tinier hunters. Asuna\u2019s tongue squished under their feet as they looked around for Quentin\u2019s noggin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe she ate \u2018im,\u201d Ralph said, his voice echoing off the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe not. Keep looking,\u201d answered Petrie, climbing over Asuna\u2019s molars and descending into the space between her gums and cheek. The humidity was overwhelming, and a drop of saliva splashed onto Petrie's head. He was just about to try lifting up the giantess\u2019s tongue and checking underneath when he kicked something in the darkness. Something round. Petrie dislodged it from between Asuna\u2019s back molars and her cheek, and the scaly texture told him it was Quentin\u2019s separated head. The Drangua rolled his eyes at being stuck in his dark cavern for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI found the boss\u2019s melon. Hey, what are you playing with?\u201d Petrie inquired, noticing Ralph walking towards the back of Asuna\u2019s throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at this thing! It\u2019s like a punching bag!\u201d Ralph said, giving the dangling uvula a playful nudge. The fleshy ball bounced around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha! Hey, bet I can hit it with the boss\u2019s head!\u201d Petrie said, launching the head at the pink ball of flesh. The uvula slapped Quentin\u2019s noggin right back at the bald hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph jumped onto the swinging uvula. \u201cI feel just like Tarzan!\u201d he laughed, swinging back and forth. \u201cHey, toss me the boss\u2019s head! I wanna make a lay-up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a rumbling vibration came from deep within Asuna\u2026.</span></div></div>",

A nice way to have a little picnic for the people in Hyrule...that is until an evil army name the Dark Forces, appears and causing havoc across the Hyrule, led by a dragon knight, an evil wizard, and a dark sorceress. Soldiers on both sides clash against each other, spewing blood across the field, but it seems the Dark Forces are gaining the upper hand...it looks bleak for the Hyrulean Forces, but little did they know, a group of hunters is about to enter the battle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of the rocky cliff, a bright portal appears in thin air and coming out from it are the NanoCorps...although only the female members; Sumiye, Apollonia, and Aradia, came out with no sign of the guys and to make it very strange of their arrival...they appear to be normal sized. The girls check their bodies for any changes, but it seems they are okay, though it doesn't explain how they are still regular size, but more importantly...where are the boys?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...Apollonia does not like any technology. She rather travels by land and, maybe, air.\" Apollonia, the foreign member who is not really a big fan of techs, lets out a huff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, you'll get used to it eventually.\" Sumiye pats the warrior's head. \"It looks like the doc's invention works, sort of. We're still at our normal height....could this be your doing, Aradia?\" The girls turn to the sorceress who is well known for her size-changing spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would lie if I said I did but, of course, I didn't. Seems the invention did work half-way and the boys are missing,\" said Aradia before hearing loud shouting and sound of clashing swords over the cliff. \"Hmm? What's all the ruckus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls walk over to the edge, witnessing soldiers and monsters battling each other with casualties on both sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh! A battle! Let us join them!\" The warrior said while bringing her bow out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa whoa whoa! You can't just go down there and pick a fight with them!\" Sumiye grabs Apollonia's arm, preventing her to enter the battle. \"We gotta find and regroup Quentin and the other before we can do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An excellent idea. The guys shouldn't be too far from here...let's find a way to sneak past them and-hmm?\" The sorceress felt something near her foot and looks down, spotting 7 tiny figures near her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...Just bugs but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell magic lady scared of bugs? Apollonia takes care of them.\" Apollonia walks over to where the bugs are, lifting her foot up, ready to crush the insects and get on with the mission. Aradia carefully watches the bugs jumping around as if they are trying to contact her...her eye catches a small red line of light heading up, then forms what appears to be...a dragon's head...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...dragon's head...?\" The sorceress' eyes widen as she remembers there is one person who can create a red colored dragon's head. \"Apollonia! Stop!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? You don't want Apollonia crush bugs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not bugs! It's the guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls crouch down to get a better view on these 'insects' and let out a gasp as they spotted their fellow members waving their arms, shrunken down to a mere ant size. Aradia lowers her hand for them to climb on which they quickly did and lifts them up to the face level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys!? You're small!\" Sumiye said, covering her mouth in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No shit, Captain Obvious.\" Viz huffs in annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiny metal arm man sound angry...She is sorry for almost crushing you.\" Apollonia lowers her head in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, kid. We didn't expect this to happen...then again, it could someone's dirty magic work...\" Zeke said, assuming it was Adaria's magic that causes the guys to be shrunken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, it wasn't me... besides, if I wanted to shrink you guys, I would've done it looooong ago~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And she's right, she would shrink us down in a snap.\" Quentin sighs. \"We'll talk about this later, right now we gotta move. With this war going on and if spread over here, we will end up entering the fray.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She doesn't mind at all.\" The warrior brought her bow out once more before being bonk on the head by Sumiye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While, yes, we have an almighty powerful mage, a policewoman with Atomic's powers, and an expert huntress on our side, we still don't know who's the enemy and who's an ally,\" said Zeke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps our best choice is to go to that castle over there.\" Froze, who is on top of  Aradia's digit, pointing at a large castle over by the lake. \"If there's a castle, there will be a king or queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If there's a queen or princess reside there...a good chance that she might be Micro's target, which is not good cause of the 'No Royalty Killing' rule,\" said Cross while hearing the voices from the battlefield are getting louder and more intense \"Also...it seems the fighting is getting closer to us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We must act swiftly...\" said Ryx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! We need to hide you guys before we move...too bad my skirt doesn't have pockets,\" said Sumiye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to worry. I have the perfect hiding spot just for you guys...\" Aradia smiles before moving her head above her exposed cleavage, much to the members, especially the males, shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey hey! What the hell are you doing!?\" Viz shouted with his cheeks all red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare put us in there!\" Orn protest as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAradia, ignoring the protests, tilts her hand and all of the 7 members free falling towards her cleavage. With them smushed between her large breasts, the sorceress gently pats her breasts before turning to her fellow members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All set! Let's go!\" Araida walks in the opposite direction, leaving both Sumiye and Apollonia in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well uhh...th-that was...interesting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least pervy man is not with us,\" Apollonia said before following Aradia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumiye sighs with a nod, knowing that Danny will have the time of his life if he was with them. The three mercs begin their journey to the castle without getting themselves into the fray...</span></div></div>",

That's her breasts!? Hot Damn! That doc's device really works and very, VERY close to a woman's lovely, soft, bouncing mammaries-\" Danny felt a punch to his stomach, causing him to get on his knees in pain.

Now standing on the fleshy landscape which is her palm, they got a good view of the giant sorceress.

Flames crackles and brighten the area, dripping water from the ceiling and a soft low hum of the wind blowing across the cave. The hunters knew they are in a cave as they have come across caves quite often and it's no trouble for the NanoCorps, but now is a scale of a tiny ant is a challenge for them to some mercs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the group looks around of the new surroundings and waiting for Dr. Micro to contact them for their target to kill, they heard a muffled sound behind a humongous boulder behind them, catching few hunters off guard and on attack stance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What  was that..?\" Reza said, meekly hid behind Sasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, Reza. I recognize that sound and not too common about it,\" said Sasha. \"Seems someone is tied up and gagged...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, very common indeed.\" Dave, the greedy mercenary, said. \"Back when I'm still doing the dirty works, I always tied up hostages and threaten to give the dough before gagging them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh, dude...\" said Danny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I always get hired for that, especially those who hold a lot of money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But now you are here working with us and you still get big sum of 'moolah' eh, laddie?\" said Dr. Zeal, one of the healer, and a sinister one, in NanoCorps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. Better hope that weird doctor hold some money or he'll get a nice bullet in the head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...anyway, where's that sound coming from?\" said Quentin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over here!\" Lunar shouted over by a large boulder, waving at them. \"There's a girl all tied up! We must assist her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard her, guys! Follow our sexy ninja!\" Danny shouted before being bonk on the head by Alanna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuentin rolls his eyes before he and the others follow Lunar around the boulder, spotting a giant young looking woman lying on the ground, tied up in ropes and wrapped cloth around her mouth and to Danny's eyes...she's quite a stunning one. Detailing from top to bottom, she appears to be a ninja which they haven't seen in quite awhile. Long brown hair with a large bang covering her right brown eye, curvy body with noticeable large breasts that Danny had been eyeing on. Wearing a revealing tannish pink short kimono style outfit with a yellow scarf, shin, and hip guards, large brown buckle with palish orange ropes tied, arm guards with blades at the end and sandals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the NanoCorps' surprise, the woman was able to spot the tiny hunters with no showing of shock or flabbergast, gently moving her head up while making muffle words to them, telling them to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive. The kid spotted us and asking for our help. Ninjas really do have good keen sight.\" said Zeke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That we do.\" Lunar smiles proudly. \"And, not to brag about it, I was once called the 'Ninja of the Mist' due to my superior speed and accuracy...that is until I met Zark, who...surpass me with such speed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, talk about a dreadful downfall...\" Slick said, laying down while scratching his butt, unaware that Lunar was glaring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, we'll talk about how cool ninjas are right after we help her. Let's cut the ropes from bottom or top,\" said Quentin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds splendid, laddie...though Danny got a good head start.\" The doctor pointed at Danny who's already climbing the ninja's body, very close to his destination...her ample bosom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hell...better get a move on before he gets killed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late for that!\" The enraged elf takes out her giant sword and goes after the womanizer while the others just shrug and follow pursuit...except for Slick who fell asleep moment before the order was given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFew minutes have been passed of thinning the ropes, beating Danny to a pulp(mostly Alanna), and healing her injuries thanks to Dr. Zeal, the NanoCorps successfully cuts the ropes, freeing the female ninja and able to remove the cloth herself. The mercs move away from her, dragging the bloody Danny from being on her and watching the now freed ninja stands up to full height, towering the tiny hunters and wasn't able to get to see her face due to her mountainous breasts blocking the way until she looks down past them, still able to see the tiny hunters. She then lowers her hand down near them, offering them a lift which they hop on without second thoughts(and carrying Slick) before being lifted up to level with her large bosom which Danny, still in pain, kept staring at all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>\"Thank you for your assistance, little ones. My name is Kagero; One of Lord Ryoma's retainers.\"</b></font> The ninja said, bowing down to them with gratitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anytime, darling. Now where's our big cash reward?\" said Dave<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dave, do you want to end up like Danny?\" Alanna, cracking her knuckles, threated him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sorry, force of habit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...it was no problem at all, just doing our job of saving lives from disasters,\" said Quentin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>\"Why are you all here in Mokushu? Did Lord Ryoma send you all here and how did you get to be so small...?\"</b></font> Kagero asked the mercs with curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Quentin worries about telling her about them and their mission would losses her trust and will attempt to kill them...and it is also possible that she might be Micro's target, but still, have not received his call..\"I...would love to answer your questions, but I don't think it's a good place to talk, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>\"Hmm...? Oh yes. I need to return to Lord Ryoma before Kotaro returns...would you all  like to come with me?\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, kid, we got nowhere else to go..sure, we'll tag along,\" said Zeke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagero nodded in agreement, now she must place the NanoCorps somewhere...she didn't bring pouch and her outfit doesn't have any pockets. She thought of various places for them to hide: Putting them on top of her head is one of them, but she may lose them in her hair and accidentally hurt them when searching for the mercs, or could place them safely on her scarf. the next one is rather...embarrassing, but she could place them in between her large breasts, giving them a cushion and secure hold, though she doesn't wear her bra today, making her breasts bouncing freely, giving the hunters very rough ride (pleasurable for Danny). The last safe place is...her mouth. She can hold them steady in her mouth without swallowing them, but they may not like that one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her mind set, Kagero decided to place her tiny saviors in her... </span></div></div>",

Once landed on a solid ground that is a bit wet, they are surrounded in some kind of fog and it's a bit warm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh...Is it me or I'm getting a bit steamy?\" Petrie pulls his suit collar away while trying to cool down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ain't the only here...\" Ralph wipes the sweat off his forehead. \"I believe we are in some kind of sauna...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is also possible that we end up in the bathhouse.

The recon peek above the edge, noticing water that was releasing steam, realizing Zeke is right; this is a bathhouse...Before he could return to the team, Sharper heard a soft feminine humming right across the water. the recon narrows his eyes to get a good view who is it...and immediately drops his jaws while his nose spraying out blood in a comical way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuentin, meanwhile, sighs as he watches the argument until Petrie said something lewd about seeing women naked which result in anger of Valeria and Veil, pummel him down to the ground while the others look on. Quentin turns to find Sharper still near the edge and comes up to him to see what he found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sharper? Is something wrong?\" Quentin asked him, only to hear a gurgling noise. \"...Sharper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuentin waves his hand in front of his face, but no reaction, so he looks over to where Sharper is looking at...and he starts to blush madly. \"Oh geez!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other mercs heard their leader shouting and quickly comes to them, Zeke asked what's wrong and the leader responded by pointing in front of them..In front of them was a really beautiful woman with long purple hair, covering one of the eyes and appears to be a buxon type due to her large breasts...and she's naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet glory of almighty...\" said the beaten and bloody Petrie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...I feel sorry for Danny for not being here with us,\" said Ralph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Does every male mortal always act like when seeing a naked female body? Veil asked Valeria while looking at the men staring at the naked woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides Danny, I have no idea...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem! Alright, enough staring!\" Quentin shouted to get everyone's attention. \"Since the device took us here, then that woman is possibly the target. Now the question is...should we wait for Dr.Micro to contact us or go ahead and get his over with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shame we didn't bring any teleporters with us. We could of teleport on her shoulder and start attacking her,\" said Zeke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...we can just walk around the edge and strike her, though I don't know how long we'll reach her. Then there's the water which we could swim up to her and climb her body until we reach her head,\" said Quentin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I vote for swimming!\" Petrie blurted out, resulting from a smack on the head by Veil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...It's your choice, kid.

Overcast weather can be seen from past the closed window, and there appears to be a slightly dark ambience to this whole castle. Additionally, everything looks much bigger than it should be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr...are the Nanocorps much smaller than they should be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, elegant yet booming footsteps approach the bedroom. With no time to wonder about their situation, the hunters retreat under the neatly-made bed as a young-looking giantess enters the room -- peeking out from under the bed, the Nanocorps are able to notice her light hair with purple streaks, her purple eyes, her black heeled boots, and her black-and-white outfit. Exhausted from a day of healing injured allies, she sets her staff down near a wall and sits upon the bed with a tired sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this..?\" Quentin muses, thankfully unheard by the giantess atop her bed. \"Beta, I need you to analyze -- \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already done,\" Beta says, \"this giantess is Elise, the younger princess of the kingdom of Nohr. Cheerful and energetic, she uses her staff to cure her friends' injuries.

The thought of seeing her siblings together make the princess smile\u2026though the peaceful thought was interrupt when something flying near her face. Corrin spotted not one, but two tiny flying figures in front of her and they move quite strangely\u2026Corrin simply shrugs and gently blows the \u2018bugs\u2019 away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuentin and Cross felt a hurricane like wind hitting them as the giant girl tries to blow them away, luckily their dragon wings can withstand such powerful gust like this one and they remain close to Corrin\u2019s face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph..her breath is not bad...still need a mint though.\" said Cross<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSheesh, you are lucky she can't hear you yet, but anyway-whoa!\u201c  Quentin notices the girl raising both of her hands, holding really close to the Dranguas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">\u201cPesky little things aren't you? I\u2019m sorry but you leave me no choice.\u201d</font></b> Corrin said before she clasped her hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the danger, the tiny Dranguas quickly flies forward as the two gigantic hands closing in on them fast. The wall of flesh nearly touches Quentin's wing before escaping their certain death..or maybe inflicting pain since they are both pretty tough to handle this.  Quentin sighs in relief of his escape but not before the two looking at the sky filled eye of an annoyed girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\u201cWow, you little things are pretty fast, aren't you?

Not with any choice, the two remains still as the fingers gently closed down on the Dranguas, moving them even closer to her red eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Huh. She got the same eye color as mine...gotta admit, it sure looks nice.</i> Quentin thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin carefully examines the tiny beings and realize they aren't insects, they are human beings! Corrin lets out a gasp and quickly gets up from the bed, surprise and shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">\u201cOh my god! I\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m so sorry!

Don't mind him, he's...a bit moody today.\u201d Quentin chuckles a bit. \"Anyway, we are not injured, no need to apologize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin sighs in relief, seeing the two is alright\u2026yet, surprisingly, they speak in her language. Perhaps talking to the two will get to know them better, especially since they carrying the dragon\u2019s blood. The girl sets the Dranguas in the palm of her hand while sitting in the bed again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\u201cMy name is Corrin, I\u2019m a princess of Hoshido as well as Nohr.

They look about each other for a second before Cross simply shrug and looks at the princess who is confused about their actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...I'm Quentin Andross, leader of NanoCorps: the greatest mercenaries in the world and this gloomy one is Cross, a member of NanoCrops. We did come with the others, but it seems we got separated for unknown reason. Anyway, I notice you are a dragon, right? We can sense it within you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\u201cI do, with the help of Dragonstones, I can take the form of a dragon.\u201d</b></font> Corrin was actually kinda surprised that Quentin was able to tell she carries dragon\u2019s blood. <b><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">\u201cHow did you know?</font></b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stone? A mere stone that helps you turn into a dragon? Pfft...\" Cross said, crossing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCross!\" Quentin glares at him.\" Ugh...We are Drangua: A race of human/dragon. We may have the appearance of humans but have a soul and power of the dragon.  Though as a now, the Dranguas are extinct\u2026there are few survivors, thank goodness. It\u2019s rather kinda hard for me to explain it.\u201d Quentin looks down with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\u201cOh\u2026I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know\u2026\u201d </b></font>Corrin lowers her finger, gently rubbing the little Drangua\u2019s head. She tried to rub Cross's little head, but the Blood Drangua simply prick her massive digit with one of his summon blood swords, telling her he is not a confront type of guy. <font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\u201cS-Sorry...maybe I should keep you two here with me until you\u2019re friends come back. Sounds good?\u201d</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a good idea, but uhh...before we do that, mind if you put on some clothes?\u201d Quentin said while looking away. Corrin doesn\u2019t know what he talking about until it has hit her. She realizes she has no clothes on except her bra and panties. The princess shrieks in embarrassment, unaware her piercing shriek hurts the Dranguas' ears, and trying to cover her garments with one hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood thing, we didn't bring Danny with us, he\u2019ll jump on you like a happy little pet who won\u2019t leave you alone and stalking you.\u201d Quentin laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\u201cGood to know...I-I must apologize once more, with your unexpected appearance, I didn\u2019t notice I was in my bra and panties.

We will wait for your return.\u201d Quentin said with a bow while Cross simply looks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess smiles as she sets Quentin and Cross down on her bed and head towards the other room, not before Quentin and Cross get a nice view of her shapely rear, almost as if she\u2019s\u2026flirting with them. Quentin quickly shakes his head of dirty thoughts, worrying he may become like Danny and it is a pretty bad sign\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"...A rather nice caboose she got there...\"</font></i> Cross said as Quentin jumps in shock with a blush on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"Dammit, Cross! You had to say something slick!\"</font></i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Quentin decided to contact his team before Corrin comes back and make a decision of telling the princess the reason why they come here or not\u2026</span></div></div>",

Quentin quickly comes back to reality, discarding the pervy thoughts again, he really doesn\u2019t wanna end up like Danny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit staring at her or do I have to tell Vixen about this...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGah!\" Quentin shook his head \"I am, I am!...umm...I did tell you I\u2019m the leader of the mercs, right? Well, we usually get hired to take down dangerous criminals and we get rewarded. Today, however, we did get hired by a weird doctor name Micro who sent a hit list for us. We don't know who is the target, though the device has sent us here and, this is just a guess, you might be our target...\" Quentin braces himself for Corrin\u2019s outburst of anger and tries to kill him\u2026Instead, Corrin simply looks at the tiny hunter with a concerned look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\"Oh, I see\u2026you don\u2019t look like a cold-hearted assassin and you are very friendly...unlike your friend here\u201d<br>\r\n</b></font><br>\r\nCross lets out a huff again assuming she's talking about him before he and Quentin were scooped up gently, holding them in front of her face. <font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\u201cSorry if this sound inappropriate, but why haven\u2019t you kill me yet?\u201d</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, there's a  simple yet very strict rule of killing people and that is: We do not kill royalties. Princes, princesses, kings, queens, anyone who is in the royalty line will not be killed by us, hell, even I can\u2019t kill a princess since I\u2019m a gentleman towards them. But not all mercs in my group are bloodthirsty...well, maybe one...\" Quentin looks at Cross with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Stop piling on me...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\u201cHehe...so why did you take the job?\u201d</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s our last one for the night and some mercs want to try out the device that let us travel through dimension and shrunk us down, which works as you can see. I\u2019m really sorry about keeping it a secret,  I should have said it earlier, I don\u2019t know how you reacted if I said it, I hope you can forgive-\u201c Quentin then felt Corrin\u2019s finger pressing gently against his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\u201cI\u2019ll forgive you, on one condition.\u201d </b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cName it.\u201d Quentin said with her finger pulling away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\u201cDo not take any more request from Micro.\u201d</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t worry\u2026we won\u2019t. In fact, we are gonna pay him a visit after we get this situation under control, right Cross?\u201d Quentin chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. He might have some good blood...\" said Cross. Corrin looks confuse at his words before Quentin explains it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...Forgot to mention that Cross is a Blood Drangua. He is like me, but uhh...learns a taboo ability and now has the power to absorb his victim's blood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\u201cEww- uhh I mean, great!\u201d</b></font> Corrin smiles before looking at the window, the sun is about to set and Quentin\u2019s friends haven\u2019t arrived yet.

Vixen, Quentin's beloved girlfriend came out first, followed by Sapphire, a female Roegadyn, then Sollenne, former Garlean princess, and lastly Sumiye, the 'super' officer. They immediately notice that they haven't shrunk at all...perhaps the device didn't work at all,  The four girls look back at the portal for the boys to come out, but they didn't show up and the portal suddenly closes in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh! The portal!\" Sumiye shouted, looking for the portal frantically.\"Oh no, oh no! What are we going to do!? Quentin and the others could be trapped in another dimension or worst...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Sui.\" Vixen places her hand on the officer's shoulder. \"I got a feeling they are somewhere around here and possibly, I think, shrunken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh..that's actually...even worst!\" Sumiye got down in all four, surveying the grass for any signs of the guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I made it worst.\" Vixen sighs before noticing the two looking around of the location. \"Any idea where we are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Eorzea...\" The former Garlean sighs in disappointment. \"...We are back in our dimension. How in the world does Dr.Micro know about my homeland?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky guess?\" The Roegadyn shurgs with a smile before it disappears as Sollenne turns to her, though unable to see her through her helmet but she can she is not in a mood for jokes.\"Sorry...seriously, I have no idea how he knows about Eorzea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't think those Garleans are working with Micro?\" Sumiye said, still on the ground looking for the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Highly doubt it...\" Vixen rubs her chin. \"Anyway, we should go find the guys before we can do anything else...Sapphire and Sollenne? Since the two of you know more about Eorzea, where are we now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Middle La Noscea. I remember a farm called Summerford Farms is nearby.

Lead the way, Sapphire!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVixen and the girls follow Sapphire to Summerford Farms for any information about the guys but little did they know...the guys did arrive not too long ago, but they instead arrived in a small cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b><i>....Inside the cave known as Seasong Grotto.....</i></b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other half of NanoCorps emerges from the portal to their new location, noticing that they have shrunken as they saw a towering stone tablet, carved in words,  in front of them, but also notice the girls haven't shown up before the portal closes behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh...that's not good.\" said Zeke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They could possibly be arriving at a different location. Beta, can you detect them?\" Quentin asks the robot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already did, Master Andross. They are indeed here and they are heading north to a settlement called Summerford Farms. However, I did notice something different about them. It seems that the females are actually in normal size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They haven't shrunk? Seems the doc's invention half-worked.\" said Revenant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it seems...\" Hadaron said, folding his arms. \"We will have words with our 'friend' later. But as now, we gotta figure where are located.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...I wonder what it said?\" Zeke looks up at the monolith. \"Might be some kind of prayer or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am still gathering data about the location, might take some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Guess we will wait for the doc to contact us.\" Quentin sighs<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the mercs waited for Micro to call them, they heard a loud echo of a voice appears out of nowhere, startling the mercs and got their weapons out for a sudden ambush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">I am the waves that bear.<br>\r\nI am the winds that guide.<br>\r\nI am the evening stars.<br>\r\nI am the morning sky.<br>\r\nI am born of the sea.<br>\r\nAnd there shall I die.<br>\r\n</font></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mercs turn around, ready to attack an unknown enemy. Quentin saw what appears to be a female feline with a light brown skin tone and brown markings on her face, light teal eyes, and white hair with two frontal pigtails tied with rings and dresses in a white dalmatica with silver patterns, blue trousers and black ankle boots, and, of course, she's gigantic compared to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuentin immediately orders the mercs to stand down, viewing the woman as not a threat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>\"Thus reads the sailors' requiem carved into yonder stone.\"</b></font> The mysterious woman spoke once more before walking towards the NanoCorps, each step creates loud booming noise and the ground beneath their feet shakes rapidly with every step she takes before coming to a stop right in front of the mercs. Some mercs marvel at the sheer size of the giant feline, the boots itself making them feel like mere insects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>\"Such words well describe the manner in which the citizens of Limsa Lominsa live their lives. It is both a litany against misfortune for those out on the waves...and a prayer that the souls of those who perish on land might find their way back to the sea.\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. So it's a prayer/funeral?\" said Zeke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much.\" said Quentin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>\"Hmm...Coming out from the light, I do believe you are not from here.\"</b></font> The feline said while slowly get on her knees without harming the NanoCorps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. We have just arrived here in this cave-hold on, how did you know?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>\" I thought myself on the trail of the kidnappers, instead, I stumble upon a mysterious group of small individuals...who does not match the kidnappers. Alas, it would seem I have missed my mark.\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, yeah. We're not the right size of being kidnappers...\" Quentin chuckles a bit before he and the others heard a noise coming from the entrance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Revenant said, getting out his sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Threat detected. A very large creature is approaching us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a large Goobbue appear outside the entrance, letting out a threatening growl before stomping its way towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>\"..Or perhaps not.\" </b></font> The woman lowers her hand near the NanoCorps, offering a lift. Not much left with a choice, they got onto her hand, one by one, except for Hadaron who simply summons his wings and took flight. The woman lifts the NanoCorps near her chest level before facing the Goobbue as it got close to them and letting out a roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\" As I suspected, the aetheric disturbance here is no natural occurrence. Nor is it a coincidence that the mysterious small individuals and I should come here in search of those responsible for the disappearances only to be attacked. But who stands to benefit from the keeping of this secret?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Technically, kid, we weren't. However, we do have ill will against kidnappers.\" said Zeke while getting his sniper rifle out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's our job to save innocent people from harm, no matter how dangerous it is.\" said Beta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Many believe we are heroes...unfortunately, we are not. But it is our duty and code to protect lives from threats. \" The knight said along with Ton who simply grunts in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>\"Right. Such thoughts must wait. I must attend to the task at hand, unpleasant though it be...unless you all can assist me? Despite your size?\"</b></font>the woman asked them, knowing that they may have powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. You have no idea who're talking to.\" Hadaron floats near the rest of the group. \"Give us the orders, boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right then. NanoCorps! Take down that monster!\" Quentin shouted an order with the group shouted 'Yes, sir!'. The feline woman, amaze of their actions, simply smiles before getting out her wand which resembles a tree branch, ready to fight against the raging Goobbue...</span></div></div>",

While the two arguing, the mercs scan their new location and It is a sight to behold. It appears to be they are inside a  temple or something, the floor they are now standing on is quite smooth and shiny, and In front of them is a very large chair like structure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Royalty.\" Viz sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely royalty.\" Orn said, folding his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess we are killing a princess or a queen.

As the bright light begins to dim away, the hunters got their sights and now staring a brown colored wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? I don't remember seeing a brown wall...\" Danny said while scratching his head. He then notices the others are looking up in awe. \"Uhh, guys? What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kid. You might wanna look up.\" Zeke said in a calm voice. \"You might be surprised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny, scratching his head, shrugged before looking up...and immediately shocked at the sight he just witnesses. The goddess was beautiful indeed, with very long green hair reaching down to her lower legs. She appears to be wearing a simple white dress with numerous gold ornaments, gold laurel crown, red fibula that is on her hips, vine-like patterns on the hems of her dress and brown sandal-like footwear which the hunters are quite near it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot Damn...\" Danny nearly collapses in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good gravy almighty...\" Petrie said with his mouth wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's smoking hot!\" said Sharper<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehh, Rine's hotter.\" Viz shrugs as he is not quite impressed by her appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Andross.

We are not really attacking her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy...Miss Palutena, we mean you no harm, we come in peace.\" Quentin said in is honest words. \"We were kinda forced to kill you by a...weird man by the name of Dr. Micro. Perhaps we can work together to fool the doctor...if that's alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalutena forms a gentle smile on her face, although the mercs feel an uneasy feeling about her smile...</span></div></div>",

While the device did succeed in its transportation part, the shirking part, however, doesn't seem to work as the two remain the same size. The deity, who didn't care about the size problem, took notice of a large portrait of a young beautiful woman posing for the image, though something is a bit off with this portrait, but couldn't possibly tell what it is...the deity's thoughts were interrupted when her and Morrigan's communication chimes through their ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morrigan here.

While the group waits for either Quentin or Zeke's commands or Micro's information, they were greeted by a massive earthquake that shook the entire group, followed by a what seems to be several miles high wall of a black object. The group craning their necks back to see five fleshy like objects, fidgeting against on the object and upon furthering up, while they couldn't see the face, they saw those massive 'mounatins', covering  in a bikini, are blocking the view, but Danny immediately recognize this massive creature, in a rather comical way, that it is Morrigan, and also pointed out that Coventina is behind her, how he knows is he recognize the..'sea' scent coming from her,,,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDodging from their incoming feet and stopping right near Coventina's sandal, unware Danny climb up the sandal wall and got a little 'personal touch' with her big purple toe,  Quentin quickly taps into his communication to connect one of the girls before they are crushed. He was able to contact Morrigan and responded, though her voice rings out across their ears and informs her that they are near the Seasnaga's foot. Coventina's god-like voice echoes through their ears and her massive foot begins tapping, nearly send them flying as dust and little particles are blown away until Morrigan tells her that they are near her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoventina courches down to get a better look at the shrunken boys and lets out a gasp as she sees them waving at her.

Anyway, who's our target?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"I wouldn't call her a target, just yet...she's a Wingly who can fly around in the air and such, and she posses a very powerful weapon called the Moon Dagger, not much I know of and that's pretty much it.

What do you mean by 'once she contacts you'?\" The B.Drangua asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"L-Like I said, just play along. She thinks I'm some sort of trader, it is the only way to get close to that female Wingly.\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuentin frowned at Dr.Micro's words, along with the others, not sure to trust him or not...The leader looks at the co-leader for any advice to this situation, the only response from the wise gunman is a simple nod, meaning to go along with the plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright doc, we'll do it.

Where is the Wingly at?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is now flying towards the opening of the window ledge behind the couch. I suggest we make haste.\" said Beta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\"Why? Can't she just use the door behind us?\"</b></font> Morrigan pointed at the door behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negative. I detected a large group of soldiers marching throughout the castle and they are getting close to this room. Again, I suggest we make haste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And haste we shall. You heard the robot, ladies, Take us to the windows!\" Quentin orders the giant mercs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\"What about Danny?\"</b></font> Morrigan asked Coventina of his safety. The Seasnaga checks her little prisoner to see if he's still moving, she felt a little squirm and possible felt a kiss from him...causing her eyebrow to twitch and press her big toe against him with more pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\"...He's fine. Let's go.\"</b></font> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith just a brief run, the mercs made it to the edge of the opening ledge and not a moment too soon: The castle's soldiers burst through the door, spotting the girls and quickly think they are with the Wingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\"Halt! You two shall come with us!\"</b></font> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, I didn't except those soldiers to move so fast.\" Zeke said while the mercs look for the Wingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\"Where the hell is that woman!?

The girls look over at the edge and see's a silver-haired woman dressed rather revealing clothing and a bandanna on her head, and a pair of light blueish wings on her back, and seems to be cover in cuts and bruises. The woman waves at them before flying away and with the soldiers getting closer to them, Coventina sighs and snaps her unoccupied fingers, creating a large circular like water beneath the girls' feet and flies off into the skies, leaving the soldiers in awe and covered in water from the blast, disappears from their sight...</span></div></div>",

Coventina. We'll leave the Wingly to you two until further notice.\" Quentin orders the girls. Coventina moves the boys on her right shoulder and they are safely tucked in the cloth fold...and to see Danny is still living, she moves her toes a bit to feel him..and felt another wet kiss on her toe, meaning he's still alive. Once again, she presses her toes down on him in anger before checking on the Wingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, winged woman! It is about time to stop flying and rest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman, was shocked by the two riding on a water-like object,  looks at the two mercs with a frown at first, but then her mouth slowly forms a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. I forgot you are with me. Alright then, ladies, we'll make a pit stop right around here and deal with this...strange situation.\" The Wingly notice they are flying over a forest, a good resting spot as long there are no wild vicious monsters or soldiers interrupt her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed...though not is weird in MY situation...\" Coventina grumbles about Danny and his pervy actions. \"Anyway, hurry up and land or you'll rather be dead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...well aren't you a feisty one?\" The woman teases at the Seasnaga, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe NanoCorps and the Wingly descend into the brush green forest,  spotted a small river streaming down and a nice shaded spot nearby, perfect for her to rest. As the Wingly landed safely with the mercs landed as well,  she collapsed against the tree, out of breath and soring from her latest fight. This is where the NanoCorps should either heal the mysterious Wingly and get information about her or leave her be and tried contacting Micro so he can explain the situation...but before they can do that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoventina flicks Danny off from her toes with a disgusted look as she places the other mercs on the ground near him.

It\u2019s quite dark and gloomy with little light from the large window from above and candles flicker on the stand, giving a more ominous feeling in the atmosphere. The team turns to notice three giant stone like pillars with one statue of a figure holding a sword right near the neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh..no one's here...and why do I have a weird feeling that something gonna attack us...?\u201d said Rive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, Rive? Are you trying to scare us?\u201d Rine chuckles a bit. \"Seriously though, where is our target? Did that jackass doc screw up the device?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That note did say it will take us to the target's location. Maybe we should wait for him to contact us.\u201d The lamia Zella said while slithers around from one side to another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess...in the meantime, what's our location?\u201d Quentin asked Hundred who tapped into her high tech visor<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's kinda fuzzy, but I pick the name called High Wall of Lothric. I'm still gathering more information.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then, since there's no one around here, we'll settle here til Micro call us and gives us the information on our target.\" Quentin said before getting a strange chill blowing against his shoulder, causing the Drangua on high alert. \"...Rive might be right, something's not right here...keep your guard just in case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mercs nodded in agreement until Amber calling out her teammates, startling them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys! Guys! Look! The door!\u201d Amber shouted and pointed at the opened doors as it beings to closing itself slowly with a gust of wind flowing in, blowing the candles out in progress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm..haunted perhaps?\u201d said Zeke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way. If it was haunted, I could've sensed a supernatural activity in a second.\u201d Rine scatches her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever it is, keep your guard up. We don't want to get ambushed while were small, it'll be pretty bad if that-\" Quentin then heard Hundred shouted warnings that something is appearing above them! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the mercs look up right after hearing dripping sound near the now closed doors and see more of the black like water substance dropping down from above. The team spotted a massive figure emerges from a black foggy portal, dropping towards the ground in a rather elegant landing. The figure lets out a breathing noise and slowly rising up, turning towards the statues where the NanoCorps are located with a sword cloaked in flames in its hand. This creature appears to be a female-looking humanoid with impossibly long, slender limbs clad in silver plated armor running up and down her body, with a veil trailing from the head. She has a twisted crown that holds the veil up and a metal grille that covers her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d said Flare<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt looks like a...some kind of human-like monster...and it feels quite in pain...\" Ella said, reading the mind of the giant monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait. I just got something...and it's about this monster we're facing,\" said Hundred \"She was one of the daughters in a royal family but was ordered by a man to become a dancer first, and then legionnaire, which is equal to exile. He also gifted her dual blades, infused with darkness and fire, similar to his own weapons\u2026From my understanding,  she became this monster by an unknown force, or maybe fate,  and is now known as the Dancer of the Boreal Valley.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDancer, huh? Really sad about her fate... I wonder-\u201c Quentin notice the Dancer is slowly making her way towards their location, each step she took made a loud clicking sound like woman\u2019s heeled shoe. \u201cAnd she is coming this way. Get ready, everyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeh, I doubt she notice us...\" Rive huffs, but her eyes widen a bit when the Dancer lunges her sword towards them without warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mercs didn\u2019t have enough time to get out of the way nor was preparing to teleport away, but one certain merc knew this will going to happen. Zyla quickly gets in front of the rest and simply blocks the towering flaming sword\u2019s tip with her specter,  creating a powerful shockwave. The shockwave pushes few mercs against the stone statue and. not surprisingly,  pushes the Dancer back and falls down on her back, despite being gigantic compared to the strongest member of the selected group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my. It seems that was a bit too much...my apologies, miss Dancer.\u201d Zyla said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow...never underestimate a student's teacher.\" Quentin chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got that right...\" Rive sighs before noticing the Dancer getting back up, breathing heavily as it seems to be anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cElla, I think this is a good time to move us!\u201d Quentin orders the ESP as he sees the Dancer is about to grab them. Ella nodded and surrounded her teammates in green aura before disappearing right before the Dancer slams her hand down, only that her preys got away safely. The NanoCorps reappear behind the Dancer with no one being harm though they are now facing the Dancer\u2019s rather large rear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...for a monster, she does have a rather big caboose.\" said Zeke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZeke! Not in front of the girls,\u201d Quentin sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dancer slowly turns around to find the mercs behind her and moves slowly and vaguely towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat now, Quentin? Can we fight the monster now? Amber asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we can\u2019t hide from her as if she knows our presence very quickly...yep, we're gonna have to fight her. She may have some weakness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA good idea, Lord Quentin. I shall stay here and observe the fight.\" said Zyla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Really? For a teacher, you sure are lazy...\" Rive huffs before being slapped on the head by her teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch your tone. I will assist you if you are in trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I will attack her from afar.\u201d Zeke pulls out his favorite sniper rifle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen the rest of us will go full assault on the monster. Alright, let's move out, everyone!\u201d With the order from their leader, Quentin and the NanoCorp begins their battle against the giant Dancer...</span></div></div>",

In front of the group is what sort of looks like a beach with strange, almost organic rock formations and a glowing light that shines across the dark murky water that acts as a moon. While this place is certainly new to them, Quentin, and possibly the others,  has an ominous feeling that something bad is gonna happen if they don't hurry and complete this mission, but it seems his ominous feeling is about to happen when Delta alerts the group that an unknown creature is heading this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Andross. An unrecognized creature is approaching us and it's likely to attack us. I suggest we arm ourselves and combat this creature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-What are you talking about, Delta? There's nothing here but-what the fuck?!\" Danny screams in terror when a giant dark-skinned creature emerges from the ground in front of them and attempts to swipe at the group. They quickly get out of its path, though Revenant stood his ground and clash its giant claws with his giant sword. The two seemingly matched of the struggles until the knight, uses his dark power to strengthen himself, pushes the giant creature's claw away, sending it straggling before it was killed by the knight's Dark Terra Slash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to go, big guy!\" Danny runs up and pats the knight's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't celebrate just yet...I can sense more of these creatures are heading this way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you might be right.\" Quentin said as he and the others spotted two more giant creatures emerges from the shadow and tries to attack them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best we spread out before we get crushed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke and Sasha fire two bullets at the creatures, hitting them in the eyes which is enough to stun them. Cross summons his blood scythe and flies over at the first creature's leg, slicing it. The creature, though doesn't seem to be making any noises, stumbles to the ground before it felt a sharp shocking pain from its left side as Jackle unleashed his electric power at it. The creature tries to swipe at the renegade but was block by Sumiye, who uses the DNA, and grabs its arm, ripping it off. The creature fell backward, losing its strength and energy before it was finally killed by Cross's Blood Dragon Fist, disappearing into nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the first one gone, they turn their attention to the second creature...though it doesn't seem they need any assistance. The second one is down on the ground with Revenant piercing his sword against its chest, Zark strikes one of its eyes while Quentin takes out the other, Delta slashes its lower half multiple times with her beam sword, and Zeke and Sasha fires every round from their weapons until it disappears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew...everyone alright?\" Quentin asked them as the mercs regroup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch, it was nothing, but what the hell was that?\" said Jackle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delta?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am still gathering data, but the place we are in now is called the Realm of Darkness. \" Delta inform. \"The area we are located now is called Dark Margin.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Realm of Darkness? Dark Margin? Talk about cheesy names\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the one to talk. Don't tell me this is where our target is located.\" said Sumiye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so. If not, we're gonna have a talk to our friend.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful everyone. More creatures are coming...and it is in large force.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Cause I don't see any-\" Danny spotted three more giant dark creatures emerging from the shadows. \"Never mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mercs ready themselves for another battle until they notice multiple dark creatures appear around them, surrounding them with no way to escape and closing in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn...looks like this is it.\" said Zeke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's the bright idea to accept this request...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now, Cross...\" Quentin sighs. \"But I'm not going down without a fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got that right, boss! Bring them on!\" Jackle shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..Jackle should deserve an honorable death...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell that supposes to mean, blood jackass!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuentin rolls his eyes before seeing the giant creatures get closer and closer and the mercs brace themselves for another big fight until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\"Firaga!\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large ball of fire appears from behind, hitting few creatures, causing them to disappear. The remaining ones skid to a stop and turns around, only to be hit by another fireball. The last remaining creature looks around, noticing its fellow comrades has vanished, it starts running away in a panic but it too got hit by the last fireball, disappearing from the hunters' sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...what happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe the woman who uses magic could be responsible.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke points towards a feminine figure that is walking towards them. The woman appears to be tall, gigantic to the tiny hunters, and slender with medium-length blue hair and blue eyes. She wears a black and navy blue, high-collared halter top, a black corset with two pairs of white laces and black shorts, white bell-sleeves with small, segmented piece of armor on each of her upper arms and tan, fingerless gloves, black stockings reaching about halfway up her thighs, two strips of blue cloth draped over each of her hips and armored silver boots with sharp hook in the outer side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot Damn! What a woman~!\" Danny drools at the sight of his savior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh brother...anyway, she did save us, though did she saw us? Sumiye asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only one way to find out...\" Quentin said while watching the giant woman getting closer and closer with each booming steps she takes...</span></div></div>",

They quickly dive out of the way before the shoe crashes down at the spot they were, blowing them a few feet away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn...that was close.\" Froze sighs while he and Dave, along with the Direagles, recovers. the golem Boulder got up while holding X, Cross, and Slick (who is sleeping), protecting them from any debris. Zeke and Ryx were unharmed as well, regrouping with the others, though the two was able to get a description of the target who almost step on them: Reimu, the target's name, has brown-black hair with a red ribbon. a traditional Miko uniform that Sasha remembers the outfit with a red hakama over a white kimono, white tabi socks, and red shoes. She seems to be heading to her bed for a little relaxation for today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone alright?\" Zeke asked the others<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.

The young Drangua groans, notice something soft around his body and reach out to grab whatever it is, much to everyone shock and Ethelinda lets a soft coo that causes Quentin to quickly pull his head out, facing Ethelinda's smiling face...Realizing he actually landed on her by accident and grabbing her large breast, Quentin quickly gets off of her and moves away in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I-I-I am so sorry, Ethelinda! I-I didn't mean to grab your...I am sorry!\" Quentin bowing down repeatedly, even gets on the ground with his head down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, it's quite alright.\" The Drangua got up and walks over to him before petting him on the head. \"Besides, I wouldn't mind cuddling with you and Cross.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing Danny isn't with us.

L-Let's drop this subject for now and focus on Reimu! A-Any other information we should know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As Micro said before: Reimu is a Shrine Maiden, they are generally virgins and take various rites of purity and chastity, and undergo various forms of physical and mental training. They also practice sealing and purification rituals, which are highly form-based and symbolic, and are used to bless, purify, or exorcise vengeful spirits\" Ryx explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...perhaps we could call a Shrine Maiden to do a purify on a certain man.\" Dave said while looking at Reimu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I highly doubt Danny would agree to this idea...but it'll be funny to watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I second that.\" X smirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuentin sighs before waking and ordering Slick to teleport them on Reimu's body, the sloth groans in annoyance and begins surrounding the hunters in glowing purple light before disappearing into thin air, but where would they in up?</span></div></div>",

In front of the mercs is a humongous size female face, staring down at them with her cold eyes and evil wide grin, and a hideous scar covering half her face, slowly opening her mouth and lets out a loud single word that frightens some mercs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><i><b>COME!!!!</b></i></font></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAHHHHH!!!

Perhaps I can locate and makeshift the token, we may have a chance to defeat her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get to it and quickly, don't know how long Sharper will last in the dark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey..\" Sharper sighs while cutting the lights off, but still can't get over the scared face of Eun-ah...as the group waits for Beta, who begins scanning the entire school grounds, some mercs still feel uneasy with the ghost is waiting and watching the mercs to slip up and attack them, but the one they should be watching is Sharper who could be Euh-ah's first target...</span></div></div>",

Together, the mercenaries save lives from dangerous criminals and natural disasters, capturing most wanted criminals alive or dead under minutes, thwarting any malicious plans that'll harm citizens,  and infiltrate and eliminate evil organizations. It really is a no-brainer why everyone across the world comes to the mercenaries, but not everyone is liking the NanoCorps...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day at their headquarters called the Flameheart Keep,  Quentin, and co., receive a package that contains a letter and a strange device by a mysterious person name Dr.Van Micro. The leader accepts the strange request despite some protest among the group and what happened next will be the most difficult and strangest challenge they ever did. However, unaware of them, they were being monitored by an old arch-nemesis and world's dangerous wanted criminal, Gentleman of Darkness or G.O.D for short, waiting for the right opportunity to strike them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><div align=\"center\"><u><b>NanoCorps Members</b></u></div></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><u><b>Male NanoCorps Members</b></u></font></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>The Drangua Leader</b></u> <br>\r\nName: Quentin Andross <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 21<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 5'12\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRace: Drangua (Dragon/Human race)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanoCorps' Rank: Founder/Leader/Frontline/Swordsman <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGender: Male<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearance: At first, Quentin appears to be scrawny underneath his NanoCorps' uniform, but he has a surprisingly well-built physique and as Drangua, he has sharp teeth, his peach skin that is hard as dragon scales, dragon wings that can magically put away and dragon irises.

If activated the DNA, his green-skinned body turns shiny silver like Atomic's, increasing his strength and durance, but the green warrior rarely uses it as he rather uses his own strength, but will use the DNA if it's an emergency.

He has a habit of shielding the female mercenaries from any danger, making the womanizer Danny a bit jealous of him. Like Froze, the knight vows to protect innocent people from any harm.
