Not wanting to eat alone, Shuichi searched the house for his blonde lover but found that he was no where to be found. He then went back into the kitchen and then noticed on a calendar that Yuki had put on the fridge had marked that Yuki had a book signing that day. Shuichi smile, \"Yuki must have left the pancakes for me as a good morning present!\" he twittered happily. He quickly ate the pancakes before skipping off to go take a shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was done showering and dressed for the day, Shuichi noticed that he had a missed message on his phone from Yuki. </span></div></div>",

He wasn't imagining things, he reached up to fold the palms of his hands either side the curve of his stomach, noting with some horror and some oddly misplaced excitement that it was growing slowly underneath his palms. He kept his hands in place, feeling the firm fat billow against them, before long his fingers ended up sinking into the flesh as it tried to grow past his hands. Shuichi gazed down at himself in disbelief, what had once been a softer, squishy stomach was pushing out into a full pot belly that strained against the front of his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe button flew off with a ping, and the heavy fat forced Shuichi's zipper down before he could even think of reaching for it. The full extent of his belly was revealed now that it was free from the confines of the material, a round ball of fat that seemed to be steadily growing. While it continued to protrude quite impressively, it started to sag a little the more weight that was pushed into it, it felt unusually heavy against Shuichi's slender frame. He staggered backwards, falling into a chair as he watched his gut continue to rise like dough, rounder and fatter until it resembled a half inflated beach ball with no signs of stopping... </span></div></div>",

He ran his hands over it, sinking his fingers into the soft flesh, reminding himself that he wasn't imagining what had happened to him. His stomach had bloated out to stretch several inches in front of him, he couldn't even see his open pants underneath the rise of flab, and he was only relieved that he could still see the tips of his feet. Still shaken by the entire experience, and wondering desperately what he should do there and then, Shuichi reached for his bottle of water to calm his nerves, it was only after he had taken a generous swig that he realised it had been that water that had started the entire thing off to start with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Shuichi groaned as his stomach began to swell again, slower this time, but bigger, starting to reach the size of a fully inflated beach ball. It looked ridiculous, seeing this vast ball of fat sticking out from a relatively slim frame, and it was pressing down against his thighs with the more weight it gained. Shuichi forced himself to remain still until it had finished, and on standing up he let out another whimper on seeing that he couldn't see his feet past his suddenly huge gut. His sides had softened to help carry the weight, he could easily grasp love handles from the excess flab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to... what can I do?\" Shuichi raked his fingers into his hair, \"How.. did this even happen?!\" </span></div></div>",

Feeling glad that the concert was already over, Shuichi headed out of his dressing room to find K standing there, gun resting on his shoulder, watching as the catering crew packed up all of the left over food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K, I'm ready. Are you taking me home?\" Shuichi asked, trying to ignore how it suddenly seemed like his head was getting lighter and lighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" K asked, turning to look at him then grinned. \"Yeah, I'm taking you home. You want some of this stuff? Can't let it go to waste, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShu looked over at the food and realized that Yuki might be feeling a bit hungry since he had probably been working all day and if that was the case, then he probably hadn't eaten all day either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had been something that he had been trying to put an end to, Yuki's erratic meals. He was always so engrossed with his work that he forgot to eat, and since cigarettes helped to suppress food cravings and with beer constantly filling his belly, he didn't always know when he was hungry. If he brought home some of the food with him then he might be able to force Yuki into eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! I'll take some!\" Shuichi chimed. K nodded and turned around back to the cleaning crew, barking for them to pack up as much as the food as they could for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about half an hour had passed, K was dropping Shuichi off at the door to his and Yuki's apartment with four large boxes of food. With a little difficulty, he managed to open the door and get the food to the kitchen. He then went bouncing off to find Yuki. </span></div></div>",

Not that Shuichi didn't support his lover, because he really did, but he really didn't know how to cook for himself and he was just so lonely without Yuki there, which was why he'd been eating out as often as he had.  In the mornings, he went and got big platters of eggs and meat at the diner a few blocks from Yuki's flat.  In between meals, he'd picked up snacking, mostly on his strawberry pocky (though maybe he'd been eating a bit more than usual), but also on chips, and chocolates, and anything he could find.  He liked to think that his lunches were small, but his sandwiches had been getting larger since Yuki had gone on his book tour, and he'd been eating more other things with his lunches -- soups, more chips, more sushi than he wanted to think about -- and then his dinners...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he hadn't put on <i>that</i> much weight since Yuki had left, of course he hadn't.  It'd been a few pounds, five, <i>maybe</i> six <i>at the most</i>.  He'd probably just been seeing things in the mirror, thinking that his tummy had gotten pudgy, and his shorts were probably just tight because he'd shrunk them in the wash.  That kind of thing happened, it wasn't unheard of.  And it was totally fine for him to go out to dinner.  It was fine for him to order a cheeseburger, chicken fingers, soup, fries, a chocolate milkshake, and then an ice cream sundae for dessert, too.  It wasn't bad either that he got more ice cream from the store after dinner, then ate two pints of it, a bag of cookies, and two boxes of strawberry pocky before he went to bed.  He was <i>hungry</i>, and he couldn't just <i>starve</i> because Yuki was out of town for eight more weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't like he was going to get <i>fat</i> or anything.

None of his clothes fit -- <i>NONE</i> of them.  Since he'd first noticed that he'd put on a bit of weight, he'd sort of noticed all his clothes getting tighter, but now he had absolutely nothing to wear, nothing at all.  Just this morning, he'd ripped four pairs of his tight little hot-pants along their seems, just trying to get them on.  The pair he'd been most successful with, he'd barely gotten up his flabby thighs -- and then, when he had, he couldn't even get the button and buttonhole together.  He'd sucked in his tummy, laid on his back and sucked it in, and wriggled around as best he could, finally getting the button done up only to have it burst right off as soon as he'd started digging into a pint of ice cream (which, naturally, he'd finished; he couldn't just leave perfectly good ice cream <i>sitting there</i>).  Where he'd once had shirts that made him look sexy, or shirts that were even a bit loose on him, now all of his shirts were strained to hide his expanding form.  His t-shirts all rode up over his bulging belly, he'd split the seems on one of his tighter-fitting tops while finishing his ice cream, and he'd completely burst the buttons off one of his nicer shirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, looking in the bathroom mirror, Shuichi couldn't deny it: he was letting himself get fat.  Just six weeks ago, he'd been slim and trim.  Sure, he hadn't been the 112 pounds that every magazine said he was; Yuki had said once that, at 5'5\", Shuichi was too thin, so Shuichi had let himself get up to 120. Some of it had been fat, but a lot of it had been lean muscle too, so Shuichi hadn't worried at all -- now, though, any tone that Shuichi had ever had was buried under a layer of fat.  It was like slim Shuichi Shindou was melting away into a wider, squishy waistline, soft, broader hips, and an increasingly jiggly form.  His nice, toned arms and thighs had gotten wobbly, his pectorals had started turning into small breasts, and even his face was getting chubby, his cheeks filling out and the beginnings of a double chin starting to show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrunching up his face in fear, Shuichi stepped on the bathroom scale and, to his horror, the numbers didn't stop until they hit 165.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Oh, no.  165.  He'd gained 45 pounds.  He was a fat loser and Yuki was going to ditch him when he got home.  Leaving the bathroom in shame, he wriggled into a pair of too-tight underpants, a pair of Yuki's jeans (which fit better than Shuichi's clothes, but were still tight on his chubby body), and one of Yuki's sweaters.  He had six weeks until Yuki got home and he needed to do something about this.</span></div></div>",

He couldn't have been that fat at all, Shuichi reasoned as he gingerly picked himself up from where he had led down on the floor, ignoring how tightly the waistband was cutting into his fleshier waist. He turned to look at himself in the mirror, his face falling at the reflection presented to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anything, the hot pants made his stomach look <i>worse</i>. The excess fat was pushed out over the tight waistband, a jiggly roll of flesh that seemed more prominent than ever. Shuichi squeezed at the sides of his belly with a whimper, his fingers sinking into the soft flesh. This wasn't something he could ignore so easily, his big fat belly seemed to stick out a mile over the top of his tight hot pants, generous love handles forming against his previously slender sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen... </span></div></div>",

He lifted up the mound of jiggling flesh and dropped it back down, watching as it sadistically jiggled before settling back into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd really let himself go. Shuichi looked at the top that he'd intended to wear, holding it in front of him by the short sleeves. It was a short, cut-off that would have once flaunted his taut and toned stomach. He pulled on the top over his body and pulled it down as far as it would go before turning slowly to look in the mirror. Fat. The crop-top was tight against his large mid-rift, flashing at least 2 inches above his belly button. His small moobs that had formed were squashed against his skin so tight that his nipples could be seen. His fleshier arms had made the short sleeves tight against his flabby arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pinched his belly again and watched as it softly jiggled to his touch. What would Yuki think?! Shuichi frantically began searching the room for a spare, bigger top to hide his fat body, trying hard to ignore the tight straining noise his shorts were making as his thighs chaffed together and the slight jiggle to his belly with each step he took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he found one of Yuki's smaller shirts, which thankfully was a baggy, average T-shirt of Shuichi, only the small roll of fat that overhung his waistband could be sometimes seen when pulled tight against his stomach. He pulled it on over his own, tight, fitted one.  Otherwise, the clothes were good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will stop eating as much, Shuichi promised himself before he left the room to find Yuki, quietly sucking in his gut so it was invisible under the bigger T-shirt. However the tell-tale strain against Shuichi's shorts were a constant reminder to him of the weight he had gained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuichi found Yuki in the lobby'<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Pride still surging through him, he reached down to tug up the zipper, wincing as he felt the metal teeth pinch against his skin. Whining softly at the bite of pain, Shuichi leant over to see what the problem was, face falling at seeing the small rise of flab protruding out between the two lines of metal teeth, stubbornly stopping the zipper from being tugged up.

Although Shuichi hadn't known how exactly much he weighed before that first dinner, he weighed 270 pounds the following morning, which didn't seem to be that far off from the 260 he'd weighed two months beforehand, when he'd stopped appearing in public.  It was only ten pounds, and he'd been eating a lot on his own before Yuki had decided to step in.  Yuki didn't seem impressed either -- he'd mumbled under his breath about how he'd hoped for it to be more -- but, after that, there had been the best, biggest breakfast that Shuichi had ever had in his life: pancakes a la mode, eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, and a lot more; there was so much of everything and it had all tasted <i>so, so good</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat first afternoon, lunch had been a similar smorgasbord: sandwiches of all kinds, spaghetti and other pastas, more meats than Shuichi had ever dreamed of, and so much more -- with ice cream for dessert!  Between lunch and dinner, Shuichi had been allowed -- even <i>encouraged</i> -- to snack and, even though he'd spent most of his time after lunch and dinner sleeping, he'd still found time for cookies and for sweets, noticing that there seemed to be more of all of his favorites than he remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second dinner was much a repeat of the first, although it did seem slightly easier this second time.  It wasn't completely easy, and Shuichi had still needed Yuki's help to finish, but it had still been <i>somewhat</i> easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next two weeks brought more of the same, with Shuichi slowly finding it easier and easier to finish all of his enormous meals, even as Yuki slowly started to add more and more food to them.  He noticed that he was gaining weight now, too: after every meal, his belly was always painfully distended, but, outside of meals, it was getting bigger as well.  All of his shirts had been tight before, but, as the two weeks went on, they got even more so -- and Shuichi's pants were a similar story.  He'd entirely given up on his tight hot pants after, several months before now, when he'd just barely weighed 175 pounds, he'd ripped a pair of the largest size that he could find -- but now he was finding it harder and harder to get into normal pants as well.  The pairs he'd owned had all been tight before he'd let Yuki start this -- it was rather hard for them not to be -- but, after the first three days, he'd noticed that he needed to suck in his gut more, just in order to get them buttoned and zipped.  After the first week, getting them on had been impossible without at least five minutes of struggling first.  Halfway through the second week, Shuichi had taken to laying in bed or on the couch and sucking in his gut -- and, even then, buttoning them had still been hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, though, after two weeks, his pants refused to take any more of this mistreatment: dinner for the night was winding down, and Shuichi was, with only minor assistance, from Yuki, stuffing his belly full of his hard-earned dessert: an entire Black Forest Chocolate cake and two gallons of ice cream.  Shuichi had finished one gallon of ice cream and was halfway through the cake when the button on his pants burst off, ricocheting across the room at breakneck speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBemusedly, Yuki tilted his head and watched as Shuichi's fat, massive belly poured into the pink-haired teen's lap.  \"I think you're too fat for those pants, brat,\" he commented dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that Yuki was right, but not wanting to admit it, Shuichi looked down at his gut and protested with a huff: \"Those ones were always small on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki said nothing, but merely rolled his eyes and walked away; in a minute, he returned with a pair of the exact same pants.  \"Try these on, brat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuichi did as told and noticed, as he did, that he had even more trouble getting them buttoned -- even after laying down and trying to suck his gut in, they were being difficult.  Finally, he got the button and the zipper done, but the only thing it accomplished was getting him a five-inch rip in the seat of his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you that you were too fat for them, brat,\" Yuki said smugly.  \"Let's go see just how fat you've gotten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some help from Yuki, Shuichi took the pants off and then followed his lover to the bathroom, where he promptly got on the scale.  Although he couldn't see the numbers spinning because of his belly, he heard them going and he heard it when Yuki bluntly read: \"290 pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n290?!  He'd really gained <i>twenty pounds</i> in <i>two weeks</i>?!</span></div></div>",

Yuki though to himself, unable to keep himself from hardening discretely at the rounded singer blowing himself up further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sadistic author bemusedly felt up the pink-haired pop star's chunky belly as the tight, yellow tank top nearly tore in its attempt to keep the hefty middle contained. Absent-minded as ever, Suichi set down the finished second shake on the counter behind him, the motion causing his pudgy middle to further indent already plump lovehandles as he twisted about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelly surged outward and Yuki caught the faint sound of a rip, transforming that constant scowl into a malicious grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suichi, haven't you noticed this?\" One of his long, slender fingers poked into the fattiest part of the boy's lower belly, the digit vanishing two inches deep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noticed what, Yuki?\" Innocent blue eyes sparkled up, a quiver to his voice betraying him. Of course he'd noticed. He was fat. Very fat. Now, he was scared he would be thrown out for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirk moved to Suichi's ear, taunting him further as his hand hefted up the bulk of the shorter lyricist's greedy indulgence. \"I think you dropped ten pounds this past week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing was further from the truth. In fact, it looked as if the pudgy pink star had added padding everywhere at an alarming rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Of course Yuki! I have been really good and working out!\" The big ball of energy maneuvered himself away from the writer's inspecting grapple, his gut jiggling as it fell back into place, bouncing as he walked over to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProducing a cigarette from his case and lighting it, he let the smoke filter out from the corner of amused lips as he heard his lover's pants creak under the pressure of a globular bubble butt. Cheeks tried to take turns, rolling up and down as Suichi put forth the effort to make his walk less of a waddle when clearly thighs were rubbing and preventing the motions from flowing smoothly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up a cushion from the couch, even the small bend had to be aided with a hand to his distended middle. 'Phew.' Suichi thought himself saved from a popped button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'At least if I keep sucking it in he won't realize how big I've gotten. No more sweets!' He chided himself as Yuki pipped up from behind, \"I know. That is why you should have more of these. They help your metabolism the more you drink them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sucker.' The blond soon finished his smoke, setting the bud onto an ashtray and joining his lover with a tray of doughnuts from the counter. \"So, even if you eat all of these it will burn more calories since there is more food to go through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh. I get it.\" Suichi didn't really, but he'd say anything to cover up what a glutton he'd been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, all efforts to exercise seemed doomed as Yuki pushed him gently toward the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was just the right amount of chewy pastry and gooey glaze, and he let out a small moan of joy as he continued to eat his way through the round pastry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I thought you'd like these.\" Yuki remarked, watching Shuichi lick his lips as he picked up another doughnut to feed to his young lover. He had picked them up from a bakery his editor was constantly gushing about, she would tell him anytime the subject of food would come up that they had the most delicious treats and that it was a shame how high in calories they were because it meant she couldn't indulge too often. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n But indulging was just what Yuki wanted to see Shuichi doing. He lifted another doughnut up and brought it to Shuichi's mouth. The younger man's mouth was open as soon as it was lifted from the tray, and Shuichi even leaned closer to take a bite sooner. He wasn't sure why Yuki was feeding him exactly, but he wasnt going to argue when the food was so good! All thoughts of the weight he had gained were completely out of his mind as doughnut after doughnut disappeared into his eager mouth, each delicious bite teasing his sense of taste as it passed over his tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki watched as Shuichi finished the whole tray of doughnuts, an entire baker's dozen and a half tucked away in his bulging stomach. The fullness from the doughnuts combined with the two shakes from earlier had pushed Shuichi's stomach outward, stretched to accommodate all the treats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thirsty?\" Yuki asked, standing up to take the tray away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Shuichi nodded, and moved to lift himself off the couch before Yuki stopped him with a gesture of his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You don't have to get up, I'll grab you something when I take care of this tray. Want another shake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sure. That sounds great!\" Shuichi felt like it must be his lucky day, not only was Yuki being so nice to him but his sweet tooth was having a field day. His stomach, on the other hand, was feeling a bit full. Though all those calories would just be burned or something, that's what Yuki had said anyway, so it didn't matter what he ate. Eating more might even help him to get back into his old leather pants! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The sound of a can hissing open broke through Shuichi's thoughts, and he looked up at the chocolate shake Yuki was extending to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thanks!\" Shuichi brought the can to his lips and drained it quickly, he must have been thirstier than he had realized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Yuki smiled as he eyed up his thicker lover, lingering on his large stomach pushing into his lap. Now that Shuichi seemed convinced he needed to eat more to lose weight, his plans for dinner would be a cinch to pull off.</span></div></div>",

The little brat seemed to always find him in the dead of the night and also seemed to just mould himself to him. And yet no matter how much he, Yuki, hated to cuddle, his arms always seemed to wrap around the little rock star and hold him until he needed a smoke, couldn't resist the urge to write or if it was time for him to get up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying there with the covers somehow kicked to the bottom of the bed (must have happened while they were playing \"doctor\" earlier) Yuki began to study his much younger lover as he hadn't done for a while. Shuichi had been gone for the past two months on tour and this was his first time home, part of the reason why he had been willing (eager really) to play \"doctor\" with Shuichi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started with Shuichi's hair, noticing that it was two inches longer than it had been before he had left. Still that atrocious bubblegum pink hair. His face seemed to have matured a little, and Yuki noticed with a small smile that Yuki had stubble on his chin.Tomorrow morning Shuichi would most likely be shaving and that was always amusing to watch, no matter how much he pretended that it wasn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki then continued his examination of Shuichi's body. Yuki noticed how he had a ring of hickeys around his throat (like a necklace, he thought absentmindedly). His eyes went over Shuichi's chest, smiling a little when he once again noticed the nipple piercing in Suichi's right nipple. He had gotten that right before he'd left. He'd been furious but now it amused him to know how lively Shuichi was, not even slowing down even now two years after Shuichi had forced this relationship upon him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki's eyes then trailed down to Shuchi's stomach and there they stayed, glued. Blonde eyebrows furrowed as he studied Shuchi's stomach. Before he had left they had been finely toned abes, but now it wasn't only soft smooth skin. In fact, it seemed to curve a little. His eyes flicked down to Shuichi's hips. They weren't as boney as they used to be. In fact, were those the beginnings of love handles?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki carefully drew away from Shuichi, crawling out of bed with a graceful ease that came from years of practice. He stumbled across the room, searching for his pants that he had discarded earlier that were currently with-holding his cigarettes from him. Once he found them and had one lit up and inbetween his lips, Yuki returned to the edge of the bed, carefully studying Shuichi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had noticed earlier that Shuichi had seemed a little softer, physically at least. He just hadn't taken note of it since they had been too busy (in the throes of passion) for him to do anything but pay attention (worship) Shuichi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe breathed out a cloud of smoke as he noticed how Shuichi's cheeks were also a little rounder, having lost some of it's childishness from the past couple years. And why hadn't he noticed that Shuichi's arms were a bit thicker as was other parts (his delectable rear-end and thighs) of his body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lost thought caught Yuki off guard, making him inhale a little too sharply with that cigarette still pressed firmly between his lips. He quickly ripped the cigarette away and coughed as quietly as he could, getting his breath back. One he had, he quickly thought back to that surprising thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad he thought that Shuichi's rear-end and thighs were delectable because they were meatier? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(You mean fatter?) Yuki shook his head, trying to clear his mind. He then quickly turned away from the bed and went towards his computer to work on his latest story and to forget about Shuichi's slight weight gain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't matter. Not really. It was barely even noticeable. He had only noticed because Shuichi was naked and he had become quite accustomed to how Shuichi's body felt over the past couple of years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(You didn't care in bed. In fact, you enjoyed it.) Yuki growled, clutching his hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" he growled angrily at his thoughts. Surprisingly, they fell silent. He turned on his computer, then getting up and going to the kitchen for something to drink while he worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked into the kitchen, he was surprised to find Shuichi standing (he's still naked!) in front of the open fridge, pulling out a candy bar that he had stashed in there before he had left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(He looks so edible right now! I could eat him up like he's going to eat that candy bar!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki quickly forced that thought away, but it persisted in echoing in his head. With a soft growl, he put his cigarette out in the sink and stalked over to Shuichi, ripping the candybar from his hand and slamming the fridge shut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuki! What-\" Shuichi began but Yuki had already ripped the wrapper off of the candybar and had Shuichi pressed up against the fridge. He then shoved the candybar into Shuichi's mouth, using his other hand to hold (grope) Shuichi to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy that candybar because we're going back to ged!\" Yuki growled, not sure what had just come over him. Shuichi on the other hand was just melting against the blonde writer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, yes sir.\" he purred around his candybar, wrapping his arms around Yuki's neck. Yuki growled, taking the other half of the candy bar into his mouth before forcefully kissing Shuichi, forcing the rest of the candybar against his reaching tongue and into his questing mouth. Shuichi groaned and quickly swallowed the candybar, pulling back far enough to grin at Yuki. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chocolate kisses. I think I like those.\" Shuichi informed him enticingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki growled, \"Shut up!\" and then slammed Shuichi onto the couch for another round of \"doctor\". </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shuichi woke up the next morning feeling thoroughly satisfied.  He'd missed his Yuki so badly for the two months he'd been on tour, and being back with him felt so good.  Especially if he was going to be as into having sex as he'd been last night.  God, Shuichi hadn't had sex that good in too long.  He had no idea why Yuki had been so into it, but he wasn't going to complain.  If whatever it was got him more sex with Yuki, then it had to be a good thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally, though, even though he'd missed having sex, Shuichi had also loved being out on tour.  He'd loved performing, he'd loved the screaming fans, and he'd especially loved the food.  He and the band had stayed in lavish hotels, and all the food had been so much better than everything else.  For breakfast, there'd been several different meats and pastries, and omelets the size of a small keyboard.  For lunch, there'd been hearty soups and sandwiches piled high with every kind of filling imaginable.  For dinner, there'd been absolutely everything: rich, creamy pastas; enormous lobsters; steaks, chicken dishes, fish; all manner of ethnic foods.  And, after almost every meal, there'd been the option to have all manner of sweet things -- ice cream, cakes, cookies, cupcakes, chocolates, and all -- and Shuichi had always taken it.  Without his Yuki around, the rich food and delicious deserts had made him feel good, as had the nearly endless supply of strawberry Pocky from the devoted Bad Luck fans.  He and the band had been met with buffet-style serving most everywhere they'd went, and Shuichi had taken to it with gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the first three weeks of the tour, Hiro had advised Shuichi to mind what he ate, especially when presented with as much as they were given at the buffets, but Shuichi didn't listen.  Hiro hadn't said anything completely out of line, but Shuichi didn't <i>need</i> to worry about gaining weight.  After all, he pranced around on stage every night, which was exercise enough, and he hadn't been eating <i>that</i> much.  So what, he was eating more than usual.  He'd been so stressed about the tour beforehand that he'd actually lost five pounds, and he needed to eat more so he wouldn't get malnourished.  Besides, nothing had happened and, even if it had, Yuki obviously didn't mind, given how enthusiastic he'd been about the sex last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, Shuichi woke up and wandered into the bathroom, still naked from the night before.  All through his morning routine, he didn't notice a thing until, looking at his profile in the full-length mirror, he saw it: a tummy.  Where he'd formerly had toned, flat abs was a round, curving tummy, sticking out from his (apparently) flat chest.  Curiously, he poked it, getting a bounce and a jiggle in his flesh.  The view from the front was even worse.  He had to feel around for his hipbones, as his sides were notably softer; poking them got the same jiggly reaction.  His thighs, formerly slim and toned, now rubbed against each other and, like every other part of his body, it seemed, jiggled when prodded.  Though he couldn't see his ass in the mirror, Shuichi grabbed both ass-cheeks and felt them; they were distinctly flabbier than he remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...No, no.  Just... <i>no</i>.  He had to be hallucinating this.  It was all just a bad dream, or insanity caused by exhaustion, in turn caused by a night of amazing sex.  He couldn't have really gained weight; he was a pop star.  Pop stars didn't gain weight.  Hiro couldn't have been right.  And, just to prove how not right Hiro was, Shuichi turned to the bathroom scale and stepped on, sure that it would just show his normal 112.  Or maybe 115.  At the very most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scale whirred for a minute before the red digital numbers read back, \"140.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<i>What</i>?!  ...When had all <i>this</i> happened?!  Since when did Shuichi Shindou weigh 140?  When had he gone and developed <i>pudge</i>?  When had he turned into such a little fat-ass?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying not to cry, Shuichi stepped off the scale and then back on; the numbers stayed the same.  He repeated this action five times to the same results.  ...But, but... he was Shuichi Shindou!  He couldn't weigh 140 pounds, he just couldn't!  They'd call him a fat loser, and he'd be in trouble with K-san for making trouble for the band, and then Hiro would be right, and Yuki would leave him, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait.  There was Yuki to think about.  He'd never been so into sex before last night.  ...It couldn't have been because of the extra weight, could it?  ...He'd been so handsy and touchy, but he was supposed to hate being both.  If he'd liked it, then maybe...</span></div></div>",

Grinning, Shuichi bounced on over, plopping himself right in the writer's lap despite the fact that the man was obviously busy at work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki released an irritated snarl, his mind snapping back to how much work he had managed to get down while Shuichi was away. In fact, he was two months ahead in his schedule (not that he was going to let his publisher know that!) but nonetheless he was on a roll and Shuichi had to come bother him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell do you want brat?\" Yuki snarled angrily, carefully removing the cigarette that he was smoking so he wouldn't burn the popular pop star. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanna go out and eat! Lets go out and eat Yuki!\" Shuichi chirped, seemingly completely oblivious to his lover's less than happy mood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the hell would I take you out to eat. As if I want a repeat of the last time!\" Yuki snarled, his mind flashing back to Shuichi upending an entire platter of food on the waiter when he had thought that he had seen Hiro outside the restaurant's window. He had then continued to try and clean up the poor waiter with Yuki's glass of beer, thinking it was water. And everything had just gone down hill from there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Yuki! That was an accident! Tohma even went out with me to dinner during the tour!\" Shu cried pleadingly, giving his boyfriend his rendition of sad puppy eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki couldn't help but smirk, despite his bad mood, when he remembered the peace and quiet that had been around the house during Shuichi's tour. Shu hadn't bothered him, Tohma hadn't bothered him, Mika had been too busy with the baby to bother him, none of Shu's stupid band members or crazy Americans had bothered him, not even his brother had bothered him! The only people who had bothered him had been his psychiatrist, his doctor, and his publisher, and all of those had been once a week maximum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been nice.... (Liar!) a voice yelled from the back of his head. (You missed all the noise and especially Shu!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where do you wanna go eat?\" Shuichi asked pleadingly. Yuki gave him an irritated growl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go call one of your friends and go eat with them! I'm busy!\" Yuki snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Yuki!\" Shuichi cried like a petulant child. Yuki grabbed the pink haired singer and carried him out of his office, through the living room and to the front door. He opened the door and chucked Suichi out into the hall with his wallet and Suichi's shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare come back until after you're eaten!\" Yuki snapped, slamming the door and locking it. He would unlock it after half an hour like he always did when he threw Suichi out. He never meant for the singer to be gone for too long whenever he threw him out, always unlocking the door after his bad mood had passed (or when the guilt struck). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YUKI!\" wailed Suichi. After a couple of minutes of pounding on the door, Shuichi finally gave up, pulling on his shoes. He would just have to go and eat before Yuki would let him back in. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yuki let out a relieved sigh as he leaned back in his chair, stretching the cramped muscles in his shoulders and back. In big black letters on the screen spelled out the words 'The End'. He had managed to finish his book three months ahead of schedule. With Shuichi home and on vacation for a month, along with all the sex that they had been having since Shuichi had gotten home, he had been overflowing with creativity and had finished his book while Shuichi was out and not distracting him with his delectable rear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughts of Shuichi made Yuki grin. Sex had been much more frantic since he had come home. They had, had sex on the couch and on the floor. They had, had sex in the kitchen on the counters, on the table, and even against the fridge. They had done it in the hallway, in the bathroom in the shower, on the counter, against the counter, on the tiled floor, against the door, and in the doorway of the bathroom. They had, had wild, passionate sex in the bedroom on the bed, against the dresser, against the closet, and once again, on the floor. They had, had sex everywhere and against everything in the house. Yuki's hands caressed the armrests on his chair. Well, almost everywhere. They hadn't had sex in his study (Yet).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was also the fact that whenever he came into his study to work, Shuichi had found different things to occupy his time. He didn't know what his smaller lover had been up to while he was writing, but it had effectively given him plenty of time to finish his latest book and gave him a nice long vacation that he planned on spending rewarding Shuichi for his good behavior and as a way to tell him just how much he had missed him during his tour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were interrupted when his cellphone started making an annoying racket. That meant that it was Tohma because he had one of Bad Luck's more tolerable songs as Shuichi's ringtone. His facial features contorted into an irritated scowl as he reached for his phone and flipped it open, placing the earpiece next to his ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Eiri. How's the book coming along?\" Tohma asked cheerfully. Yuki quickly lit up a cigarette, knowing full well that he would need the nicotine to help him control his irritation towards his brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you calling?\" he demanded, not particularly in the mood to entertain his stupid brother-in-law in his game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Eiri, that's not very nice. You should be thanking me for getting little Shuichi out of the house for two months.\" Yuki gritted his fist. Thank him for taking his lover away for two months? Eiri pulled the phone away from his ear and stared at the screen of his phone for a moment. A devilish grin erupted on his face as he calmly hit the 'End' button on his phone, hanging  up on his lover's boss. After a moment of consideration of whether or not to turn off his phone before Tohma called back, he recieved his answer when he heard the front door slam and Shuichi calling out that he was home. He turned off his phone before he turned to his computer and hit 'save'. He then got up and went looking for his lover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found Shuichi in the kitchen, emptying three bags that were overflowing with take-out from three different places. Yuki leaned against the doorway as he admired his little rockstar who was completely oblivious to the writer in the doorway. Yuki started with Shu's butt as he had been doing since Shuichi had come home. It was even larger since he had come home, stretching his shorts that had been tight before but were now absolutely obscene, leaving nothing to the imagination and even inhancing the sight. The boy might as well of been wearing absolutely nothing with how tightly those clothes clung. Shuichi was also wearing a tight tank top that was also so tight that he might as well have not been wearing it. The bottom of the tank top was riding up a bit, showing off the bottom of his bulging tummy and his lovehandles that his shorts were squeezing in such a way that both stomach and lovehandles were hanging over the sides of the shorts a little. Where his belly button was, was a large hallow, and his rather beefy pecs were beginning to look like boobs. And the straps of the tank top were digging in pretty deeply into his shoulders. In the smaller garments, Shuichi's arms looked much beefier than they were and his thighs were huge, rubbing together every time that he moved. His butt and belly were jiggling as he danced. Yuki's eyes finally found their way to Shuichi's face was a small double chin was forming that he found incredibly adorable for some reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuichi suddenly turned, getting into the fridge and bending over in order to get something out. Yuki's eyes narrowed in on Shuichi's butt where the pants suddenly having a much harder job at staying intact despite the fact that there was a very small tear right in the middle, Yuki saw. Suddenly his mouth went dry and his pants were feeling much tighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki walked briskly towards the bubble gum pink haired boy, grabbed his hips and pulled him back against him. Shuichi shot up, his head smacking against Yuki's chest and his purple eyes looked up in surprise at the blonde man. Yuki bent down and kissed the boy hungrily, letting him know just how he was feeling at the moment. Shuichi moaned, pressing back against the blonde, who had noticed how his fingers were sinking into Shuichi's hips in a rather enticing manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Yuki pulled away, one hand sliding from Shuichi's hip to up his shirt (barely up his shirt) and began to caress the bulging tummy. Yuki felt it gurgle and gave Shuichi a cocky grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry?\" he purred, still caressing his lover's stomach. Shuichi nodded cheerfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got dinner for us! And I was just getting your beer for you!\" he chirped, holding up a six pack of beer. Yuki bent down and gave Shuichi a small nip on the cheek, loving how much meatier (fatter) it was than it used to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets get some food in you.\" Yuki said firmly, turning around and steering the younger boy towards the living room. He sat Shuichi on the couch and gave him a firm look to stay there. He then turned around and went back to the kitchen, packing all the food back into the three very large bags and two pairs of chop sticks into the living room. He set all the food on the coffee table then plopped down on the couch next to Shuichi. Shuichi instantly began digging in while Yuki popped open a beer and drank half of it before grabbing a box of rice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched Shuichi eat, his chubby cheeks full of food and his lips flecked with some food that hadn't quite made it all the way into his mouth. he was chewing rapidly, his purple eyes glowing with happiness. Suddenly Shuichi's eyes flicked towards him and their eyes locked. Yuki set down his box of rice next to him before he pulled Shuichi over to him and into his lap. He then picked his rice back up and continued to eat. Shu was still for a moment before cuddling back against Yuki, wiggling his more substantial butt a bit, before he began to eat again. Yuki's eyes rolled back into his head, loving how Shuichi's butt was big enough to fill his entire lap. He could also feel Shuichi eating, he could feel his chewing, him swallowing, him reaching for more food, and him absent mindedly pulling his shirt down since it was riding up with all the food that was making his belly swell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here Yuki! Your favorite!\" Shu chirped, handing Yuki an unopened box. Yuki blinked in surprise before he reached towards Shuichi, wiped his thumb across his bottom lip, wiping away the remaining food, and offered his food covered thumb for Shuichi to lick. Shu blushed and sucked his thumb into his mouth, laving at the digit with his tongue until it was all clean and Yuki pulled his thumb away. Yuki's hand found it's way to Shuichi's butt, squeezing it as he pulled Shuichi closer. The little rock star blushed, then grinned as he turned around in Yuki's lap until he was facing him, then opened the box and took out a piece of sushi and offered it to Yuki. Yuki obediantly opened his mouth and took the piece of sushi into his mouth, quickly discovering that it was indeed his favorite food, a yellowtail trout hoki roll. Yuki ate it all as Shuichi offered it to him, making quite the intimate scene in their living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the box of sushi was growing empty, there was a soft knock on the door. Shuichi's head jerk towards it and made to go get it but Yuki's hands shot to his hips and held him still in his lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're enjoying dinner. They can go to hell.\" he growled as his fingers sunk into the meaty flesh. Shuichi's purple eyes shot towards the door again as another soft knock came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it could be Hiro! Or K-san!\" cried Shuichi, biting his lower lip in uncertainty. Yuki growled and pulled the boy towards him, capturing his lips in a passionate kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If its them, they can go to hell as well.\" Yuki whispered against his lips before he recaptured them. Shuichi's arms found their way around Yuki's neck, bringing the two of them flush against one another. Neither of them noticed the soft click of a key being turned in the lock of the door nor did they hear the door open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eiri, are you home?\" a soft voice called. The man in question as well as the rockstar both pulled away. Yuki sighed in irritation. Why hadn't he realized that hanging up on Tohma would just make the man come over? (Because Shu is rather distracting.) Yuki growled at that thought, knowing full well that it was true. Shuichi tried to move out of his lap, but Yuki held onto him firm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignore him.\" he ordered Shuichi. He nodded, knowing that angry look in Yuki's eyes meant that he shouldn't do anything that might turn his wrath from Tohma towards him. He took up the chopsticks and placed another piece of sushi into Yuki's waiting mouth. Yuki chewed happily, ignoring the sound of his brother-in-law's footsteps coming closer. Tohma came into the living room right as Shuichi placed the last piece of sushi in Yuki's waiting mouth. Yuki took his time chewing before turning his angry gaze towards Tohma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you doing in my house?\" he demanded. Tohma stared at the two of them, surprised to have caught them in such an intimate and loving position. Shuichi made to move once again but Yuki grabbed him once again, holding his lover still. He heard Shuichi's stomach rumble again, knowing that his lover was still quite hungry. \"Now pick what you want to eat.\" he whispered softly so only Shuichi could hear him, his angry gaze never leaving Tohma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was worried when you didn't answer your phone.\" Tohma said softly, that fake smile finding it's way back onto his face. Yuki's look darkened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you invited yourself into my house?\" he demanded. \"Bullshit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Eiri, keep in mind your ulcer.\" chirped Tohma, daring to take a few more steps into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get the hell out of my house.\" Yuki growled before he turned back towards Shuichi who was holding a box filled with teriyaki chicken noodles. He took the proffered chopsticks, scooping up some and offered the bite to Shuichi who hesitantly took the small bite, his purple eyes glued on his boss who had once again lost his composure and was staring at them open mouthed. Shuichi slurped up on the noodles, chewing them happily and then taking the next bite that Yuki offered them. Tohma watched this sequence until the entire box was finished, still shocked to see Yuki acting like he was, like he cared about the annoying brat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tohma, either you get the hell out of my house or else I'll throw you the hell out.\" he snapped. Yuki's eyes widened in surprise as Shuichi popped a vegetable into his mouth as he said out. His golden eyes narrowed at Shuichi, who was giving him a wide eyed innocent look as he ate another vegetable. Yuki squeezed Shuichi, a little amused at his antic. Was the brat trying to calm him down? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't make Yuki get up. I'm comfortable.\" Shuichi whined, turning towards Tohma. He then turned back to Yuki and offered him another vegetable, which Yuki willingly ate that time. They heard Tohma turn and leave, obviously baffled but the whole situation. Yuki just smiled and ate whatever Shuichi offered him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were done eating (Shuichi eating more than half of the food that he had brought home) Yuki had pulled his pudgy boy against himself and informed him that they were going to go out and get dessert. He told Shuichi to go pull another pair of pants and a shirt since food had gotten on Shuichi's shirt and Yuki had taken the blame for ripping Shuichi's pants when they had finally given up on containing the substantial rear end. Shuichi had come hopping out of the bedroom wearing another tight pair of shorts that he could barely see underneath one of his shirts that Shuichi had stolen that was too big on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I give you permission to steal my shirt, brat?\" Yuki demanded, pulling the smaller boy against him. Shuichi looked nervous and he shook his head. \"Then you better put it back when we get back.\" he growled, for once not angry that Shuichi had gotten into his stuff. In fact, he found it rather adorable for some reason and he found Shuichi adorable in his baggy shirt, almost as if he was trying to hide how much weight he had gained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" Shuichi chirped, instantly back into his cheerful mood. He clung to Yuki as they put on their shoes and made their way down the hall to the elevator, bugging his taller lover the whole way about where they were going. Yuki put up with the incessant chatter by fondling his chubby lover as they walked along until they got to his car. Once they got in, he reached over and gave Shuichi such a mind blowing kiss that it left his speechless long enough for Yuki to take the two of them to the bakery that he had in mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I was here once! I came with my mom to pick up my aunt's wedding cake! It was so good!\" Shuichi gushed, having apparently snapped out of his lust induced stupor. Yuki reached over and squeezed a meaty thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pick what looks good.\" Yuki informed him. Shuichi couldn't get out of the car fast enough. Before Yuki even had his door open, Shuichi was already inside drooling over all the food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki ran his fingers through his hair and pulled out his pack of cigarettes that were in his shirt pocket. He pulled out his lighter and paused for a moment, staring at the picture of Shu and him from their first date that he had been forced to go on. He caressed the picture with his thumb before he finally lit his cigarette and put his lighter away. He watched Shuichi through the window, watching as he talked to a painfully thin woman behind the counter. Yuki contented himself with watching the rockstar from outside until he finished his cigarette and went inside where Shuichi was quick to reattach himself to his arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuki! Do I only have to pick one?\" Shuichi whined. Yuki sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you may pick three.\" he said in a gruff voice. Shuichi squealed happily and ran back to the counter to decide what he wanted. Yuki walked up to the counter as well but pulled the painfully thin woman aside. \"Two of everything he wants, three of those things that he's looking at, and double my usual.\" Yuki informed her. She nodded and set about filling the order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki watched Shuichi tell the woman all that he wanted, his mouth twitching in amusement occasionally. When Shuichi was finally finished ordering his sweets, he rushed back over to Yuki, hugging the man around the waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we also pick up some strawberry pocky on the way home?\" he asked, staring up at the blonde with his gorgeous sparkling purple eyes that were filled to the brim with happiness. Yuki didn't know what possessed him but he smiled down at the pink haired boy as he ran his fingers through pink hair before his hands rested comfortably on the rather large bump that was Shuichi's rear end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" he murmured. Shuichi smiled again and nuzzled Yuki's chest, his pudgy belly pressing against Yuki's much thinner stomach. Thats how they remained until the woman called out that their order was ready. Yuki went to pay as Shuichi picked up the plain brown boxes, fiddling with the brown string that tied them shut. Yuki waited as the woman swiped his credit card and placed it back into his wallet. He signed the receipt, took his own then nodded for Shuichi to bring the boxes to the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuichi was surprising silent as they went to the store, got his pocky, then drove home. Once they got into the apartment, he ran into the bedroom and replaced Yuki's shirt from where he had gotten it. He walked out shirtless, making Yuki's mouth go dry once more. Yuki gestured for Shuichi to join him on the couch, the boxes now open and displaying all the lovely treats that they had gotten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were 2 Chocolate Decadence Tarts, 2 Rice Tarts, 3 Lilikoi Tartlets, 6 Raspberry Granites, 6 Haupia Cream Puffs, 8 Mini New York Cheesecakes, 10 Rum Balls, 2 Chocolate Mousse Logs, and 20 Chocolate Dipped Strawberries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuichi stared in awe at all the sweets before him that filled up the two large brown boxes that had been tied together and shut with the brown string that Yuki had cut off while he had been replacing the shirt. Yuki reached over and plucked up a Haupia Cream Puff and popped it into Shuichi's open mouth. Shuichi began to instinctively chew and moaned with pleasure as a utopia of flavor exploded on his tongue. Shuichi crawled closer to Yuki as he chewed and swallowed. He pressed himself up against Yuki as he crawled into his lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was soooo goooood!\" Shuichi moaned happily, nuzzling Yuki's face. \"You need to try one.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki reached forwards and grabbed one, kissing Shuichi's meaty shoulder at the same time. He felt Shuichi's squishy stomach move against him as he leaned forwards, making him want to just ignore the desserts for a while and take the chubby boy into his room with him. He finally leaned back and handed another Haupia Cream Puff to Shuichi to then fed it to Yuki, who also got a sensery overload from the food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was enjoying the food, Shuichi leaned back and grabbed one box and put it on their right on the couch, then he grabbed the other box and put it on their left on the couch. When Yuki came back to reality on the couch, he found Shuichi undoing the button on his far too tight shorts. As soon as the button was released, his stomach surged forward from it's confines, looking much larger (and more beautiful) than it had just a moment before. Yuki's hands once again found their way to their new favorite place, Shuichi's squishy hips, and gave Shuichi a questioning look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They must have shrunk in the wash because they were hurting.\" he explained with a pout before he looked down at the shorts that were also squeezing his thighs in such a way that Yuki was sure that pretty soon they were going to burst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot of clothes shrunk in the last few washes.\" Yuki murmured obligingly before he realized what he was saying. Not wanting to think about what he had just said, he then picked up a Chocolate Dipped Strawberry and fed it to Shuichi who made sure to give his thumb and index finger a good few licks before he pulled away. Yuki was soon greated with a Chocolate Dipped Strawberry of his own which he took as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis system continued for a while before all the desserts ran out, and Shuichi was rubbing how now hard tummy, cuddling up to his equally full lover who was rubbing his own with one hand and helping Shuichi rub his tummy with his other. Yuki leaned forwards and began to nibble on Shuichi's neck, shoulders and ear, pressing into his chunkier lover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it's time for more fun activities.\" Yuki whispered huskily before he picked Shuichi up and carried him into the bedroom so they could play some more \"doctor\". </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u2018Ahh\u2019 Shuichi sighed after undoing the button on his tight shorts, allowing the mass of fat to surge forward and rest on his lap, jiggling slightly when he leant back to rest on the sofa. He soon fell asleep. The washing machine must really be shrinking these clothes small, as Shuichi had noticed a lot of his clothes were squeezing him tighter around the middle, the waistband cutting into his porky stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki looked at his lover sprawled over the sofa. Over the past week, Shuichi had been stuffing himself recklessly before sleeping every night. Yuki would sit him on his knee and watch as Shuichi ate everything on the plate. His skimpy little hot pants were becoming horrendously tight on the little singer, straining to contain his mammoth gut. Some of the smaller shorts refused to even button now, even after he lay flat on the bed and strained the two folds of material as close as they could get to each other over his flabby, soft stomach that spilled over the sides of his tight shorts. Yuki would always find himself thinking Shuichi was erotic when his tank tops would ride up his stomach and strain against the rolls of fat which was his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki continued telling Shuichi that it was the washing machines fault whilst watching his lover stuff his face and massage his enlarged stomach after the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki strolled over to Shuichi and began rubbing his hand across his belly, feeling the fat mould to his hand and ripple across the rest of his body. His hands crept up past his mobs and towards the double chin that had positively made it\u2019s appearance 3 days ago. As Shuichi was lying on his back, his chins seemed to be emphasised, his neck disappearing slightly beneath them. Shuichi mumbled in his sleep and moved his hand to the hem of his shirt, trying to tug it down over his revealed stomach in vain. Yuki laughed. Shuichi needed new clothes, but Yuki quite liked to see Shuichi in denial over his weight and continue to squeeze into the small, revealing clothes. Yuki\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yuki decides to revel in Shuichi\u2019s denial over his weight gain, whilst helping him along a little on the way. Yuki constantly kept the cupboards full with fatty foods with a high carbohydrate or sugar content which soon disappeared into his lover\u2019s engorged belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Yuki, where did you get this new brand of chocolate spread? It\u2019s so delicious I could just keep eating and eating it!\u2019 Shuichi moaned as he took the blunt knife out of the jar and placed it into his mouth, sucking and licking off the chocolate. Yuki felt his cheeks flush slightly so walked up behind Shuichi and placed his hands on his meaty hips, feeling the curve of his stomach as it rested on his lap over his waistband of his \u2018fat\u2019 pants for days before the weight gain, which were now straining to contain the new, fatter, him. He was wearing a once baggy t-shirt that clung to his gut and had ridden up as he sat down, revealing an inch of flesh from underneath. Shuichi twisted around to look at Yuki, causing the button on his \u2018fat\u2019 pants to creak under the strain, dangerously close to popping off completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018The store down the road. Do you want me to get some more of it when I go out for some more cigarettes later?\u2019 Yuki began playing with the fat, feeling it between his supple fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuichi hadn\u2019t left the house for a while under the pretence that reporters were lurking around. Another marvellous lie from Yuki to keep Shuichi in the house. It wouldn\u2019t do for it to get out about Shuichi\u2019s newly accustomed weight and his ill-fitting clothes. Although, Yuki was dying to take him out to an all-you-can-eat buffet sometime soon and watch his lover enjoy himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki walked to the fridge and pulled out a chocolate milkshake and placed it on the table next to Shuichi\u2019s jar of chocolate spread. \u2018Here. You should keep hydrated.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuichi grinned up at him, dimples forming between the fat in his cheeks, before opening his milkshake. \u2018Thanks, Yuki.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother week or so passed, Shuichi didn\u2019t know. He\u2019d been hanging around the house, when not annoying Yuki, he\u2019d been eating. Tohma had rung from NG Recording Studios a few weeks ago, saying that Bad Luck were on a break for a month or so, leaving Shuichi with not a lot to do. He made his way to Yuki\u2019s study, packet of ready-salted crisps in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki heard the door of his study creak open and felt a small smirk appear on his face. <i>He thinks he\u2019s so stealthy, but not with his figure</i>. Yuki carried on typing, pretending not to have heard his lover walk in the room. Shuichi padded across the room, and Yuki could almost imagine him walking with his legs farther apart, as Shuichi had started doing recently, to prevent the waddle in his walk and his thighs chaffing together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Yuki, you almost done for the night?\u2019 Shuichi began playing with Yuki\u2019s hair and distracting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki turned his face into a scowl. \u2018No. I\u2019ve still got another chapter to do for tomorrow. Please yourself tonight, you damn brat.\u2019 Yuki lied. He was already three chapters ahead of schedule, but didn\u2019t want Shuichi to know. Shuichi didn\u2019t reply, so Yuki turned to look up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuichi looked bigger than ever. He had resorted to wearing one of his old, over-sized, button-up shirts that he wore when decorating the house a few years ago. The button now looked strained when pushed against by his stomach, and the material was taut around his mid-section. The \u2018fat\u2019pants from a week or so ago that he had taken to wearing squeezed his fatty stomach, making the overhang and soft-love handles horrendous. Shuichi yawned and stretched his arms outward and then upward, groaning from the stiffness in his shoulders. When he placed them by his side again, his shirt had ridden up with sections of soft flesh poked out between the buttons. His gut overhung his jeans and jiggled slightly when he bounced up and down when saying:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh, oh, Yuki! Guess what!\u2019 Shuichi didn\u2019t even pause before carrying on, \u2018a new restaurant has opened in town and I\u2019m dying to see what\u2019s on the menu! Let\u2019s go out tonight!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki wasn\u2019t listening. He was just watching as Shuichi\u2019s stomach bounced up and down, jiggling to Shuichi\u2019s exuberant movements of excitement. The mound of flesh quivered and stopped when Shuichi stilled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018C\u2019mon Yuki, what d\u2019you say? Tonight?\u2019 Shuichi moved closely to Yuki and moved to place his fat behind on Yuki\u2019s legs. All that jumping had made Shuichi a little out of breath. As Shuichi sat down, the button on his \u2018fat\u2019 pants gave way and snapped across the room. The sudden relief on his stomach caused Shuichi to moan with pleasure. \u2018We really need to get a plumber in to fix that washing machine, as well. These are the biggest pants I can wear! I\u2019ll soon be fitting in your clothes!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki looked down at Shuichi\u2019s jiggling flesh as he squirmed on his lap. Maybe going out for a meal would be nice\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Man, we really need a new dryer! That thing is shrinking everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five minutes of intense battling with the button of his pants, sweat was causing the bubble-gum-haired pop star's blubbery, shirtless belly to glisten. With a grunt Shuichi slide the shorts down, once again fighting his massive rear, and decided just to go around Yuki's apartment in his now skin-tight boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki had been so affectionate lately. Buying Shuichi food, complimenting him, grabbing his booty, and oh dear God the sex. It was constant and hot as could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, lately Shuichi had noticed that he and Yuki's \"sessions\" were taking longer than usual. Yuki became out of breath a little easier, and was drenched in sweat by the time they were done. Shuichi wasn't sure why, but maybe it had to do with how much less Yuki had been smoking, and how much more he had been eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery time Shuichi managed to cram himself into his all-too-tight outfits, the two of them would go out and buy a feast. And usually Shuichi ate a good two-thirds of what they bought, but now it seemed Yuki was eating almost all of their personal buffets. Shuichi didn't mind. Yuki's tummy swelled up like a beach ball, which gave Shuichi the opportunity to rub and caress it, Yuki too bloated to fully grasp what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuichi had asked Yuki to quit smoking, and with Shuichi's new found \"sex-appeal\" (his enormous ass, and jiggly belly) Yuki had reluctantly agreed. The novelist found his shoving whatever he could into his mouth to replace the cigarettes. This was often his small lover's lips, but more often chocolate or sweets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuki!\" Shuichi called out, wadling his way to Yuki's study. \"I'm hungry! Let's get something to eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, the young pop star peeked Yuki's study door open. His jaw dropped at what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was his slim, or maybe not-so-slim, lover passed out in his chair by his computer. It had been so hot lately, Yuki's outift matched Shuichi's, just a pair of boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe writer's once toned, slim waist was rounded and soft. A decent pot belly sitting atop chunkier thighs.His chest had softened a tad, no where need Shuichi's little moobs, but softened nonetheless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandy bar wrappers littered the floor, and a small trickle of droll ran from the author's chocolate-stained mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaringly, Shuichi sauntered over. Putting his big, round butt in Yuki's lap, the lover's distended bellies meeting for the first time, Shuichi gently and sweetly prssed his ips against his lover's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>God Yuki looked hot all chubby and stuff</i> the young pink-haired boy though, oblivious to the twenty or so pounds he'd picked up in the past few months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki's tired eyes batted open and</span></div></div>",

Shuichi, watching television wearing a large white t-shirt with boxers and watching television, and Yuki, wearing a white button-up shirt and black pants, typing away on his laptop. Shuichi kept looking over at Yuki, wanting attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had been living together for a year now, but Yuki was still constantly working and they barely had much time for each other. Shuichi\u2019s career didn\u2019t help much either. He sighed, and went back to the television, changing the channel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a commercial for some diet pills. Shuichi found them annoying, but he waited to see what was next. Yuki stopped typing and Shu looked up, surprised. He was staring at the screen, so Shuichi followed his gaze. There was a man, a BIG guy. He was at least three-hundred pounds. Shuichi watched, looking from the television to Yuki, who was staring right at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYuki?\u201d he asked, sitting up. \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki looked a bit surprised and smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing.\u201d he said, and Shuichi poked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo really!\u201d he whined, prodding his ribs. \u201cWhat\u2019s so interesting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s cute.\u201d Yuki said simply, getting back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuichi paused and looked at the screen. They had two pictures next to each other now, one of the fat man who\u2019s stomach hung well below his crotch, and one \u2018after\u2019 picture of him with a six pack. He looked back at Yuki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore or after?\u201d he asked, suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Before.\u201d Yuki said simply without looking over, getting back to work. Once the keys where typing again, Shuichi knew the conversation was over<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuichi was dumbstruck. He looked back at the screen. The man \u2018before\u2019 was so fat it was gape-worthy. His stomach jiggled as he walked, he had wide-set hips and thick, jiggley thighs. Shuichi couldn\u2019t see his backside, but he knew there HAD to be love handles on that frame, and a huge rear end. He blinked, looking down at his own petite body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki wasn\u2019t very interested in him right now. It was obvious. They had sex, but not often. He put his hands on his stomach, tilting his head. Maybe if he were bigger\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided he needed to gain weight. Fast.
