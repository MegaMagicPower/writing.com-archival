She picks you up and places you on a throw pillow and then starts to kiss you again. Your face is pressed against her top lip. Her lips are soft and pleasant. You Try your best to kiss her back with your small form. You are in absolute heaven! This is so unbelievable, but its truly happening. Her kissing is making her moan as she gropes herself and is now sucking and licking at you. \"mmm, oh. kiss me dear. make me want you more!\" she says between kissing and letting you know she wants more. Again, you try your best to kiss back but you don't even know if its working. Maybe it is because she's still getting horny. She is increasingly covering you in saliva, you are soaked to the bone in her kissing and licking. she slowly pulls away opening her eyes. You are wide eyed and soaked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"tee hee! you were great! that deserves something very special.\" says Minerva pleased with you. \"*cough* what might you have in *gasp* mind?\" you ask exhausted from her giant lips pressing and kissing against most of your body. \"hmm... lets get to that breast thing I want to do to you.\" she says seductively. Minerva picks you up and places you between her large, shapely breasts. they are covered in soft, short, white fur. she squeezes you lightly while she moans and sighs with pleasure. \"ohhh, yes! this feels so good. how is if for you darling?\" she asks \"oh man... i'm so... so...\" you can't finish because she pushed her boobs together in a way that covered you up. \"hmmmm... yeah. ugh mmmm... I can't.. take it a-any mooorrre.\" says Minerva with a soft sexy voice. She holds her breasts together and slips out of her dress and walks to her bedroom. You are now jiggiling between her wondering where she is off to. Minerva shuts the door, closes the blinds and turns the lights to a dimly light room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe releases her breasts letting you drop onto a giant purple pillow. Its got fringes on it and is made of silk. The fabric so soft and inviting, but not as much as her breasts. You look over to the bottom of the bed and Minerva is now crawling toward you, swishing her tail back and forth slowly. She has a look of pure passion and lust in her eyes. She kisses you gently before dragging her breasts into you. You grab hold and come up with her boobs. Minerva picks you up and turns over and places you on top of her breast's nipple. \"And now for something really special. you're going to make love to my nipples.\" Minerva says looking at you with half shut and glowing eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart skips a beat and your stomach fills with butterflies. Theres now way you could say no to that and also theres now way you could resist because she would make you do it. At your current size, you would be easily over powered by her. You place your member into her nipple and she smiles at you. \"ok. lets get started.\" she says with a grin. Minerva picks you up with her index finger and thumb. Pulling you up and down, your penis being stroked by her nipples inner walls. You gasp and moan in pleasure. The sexy white mink starts to pick up the pace and pulls you in and out faster and faster until you shout in esctacy! She giggles at your small pleasure and makes you do the same to her other nipple. You just about couldn't do it but it worked. Minerva is pleased with you and gently picks you up and kisses you. \"what shall we do next my sweet?\" asks Minerva. Really?! she still wants more? well what do you want to do?</span></div></div>",

There was the closet where she had an impressive collection of shoes, there was the space under the bed which looked to be a good spot to hide out, and then there was a pair of fluffy slippers just at the foot of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Hmm?\u201d she asks in a sort of stern voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!? I didn\u2019t mean that! Well, I\u2019m sure you value privacy and I\u2019d see why you would be upset about my intrusion but I\u2019m not that kind of person. Well I\u2019d be lying if I never said that I never lusted over you before.\u201d You say to Minerva. \u2018Did I actually say that!?\u2019 you tell yourself, shocked at the sentence that left your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles to you and says \u201cwell at least you\u2019re honest.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to ask you something Jake.\u201d Says Minerva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it, beautiful?\u201d you say, half trying to sound cool and romantic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you\u2019re such a sweet guy! Well I was wondering, since you have nowhere else to go and were friends now; will you stay with me? Forever?\u201d asks Minerva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny thoughts of going home escaped the second she asked you the question and you answer \u2018yes\u2019 rather quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh thank you cutie!\u201d says Minerva as she presses you against her chest. You are so happy that you are finally with the girl you\u2019ve always had a crush on for years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva asks you \u201cSo Jake, what shall we do first\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

It sounded like a young man's voice, and she figured that someone was playing a trick on her, letting her get all excited from what was only a tape recorder hidden in somewhere nearby. She wasn't going to give them the benefit of watching her search for it, and only to be teased endlessly later. She decided to just ignore the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be hearing things.\"  She muttered not hearing the tiny voice anymore.

You continued to shout and wave as she scooped up another Forkload very close to you. You looked up in time to see the fork disappear into her mouth, then reappear empty. You watch her chin move up and down as she chewed, then the motion in her throat as she swallowed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the fork descended on the plate once again. It was tilted as it made its plunge into the the rice, and you find yourself lifted upward. Your  luck ran out. You have been scooped up along with a forkload of rice. Your heart raced as her Dress flew past your vision,  which led to Minerva's neck and jaw line. Locks of blond hair framed the enormous head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at Minerva's giant lips. Time seems to slow as the fork moved  forward and She slowly opened her mouth. You can't help but stare into it. The tongue rippled and glistened with saliva and bits of food.  The back of her tongue dropped revealing her uvula and slimy throat. A shadow fell over you as the fork entered the giant mouth.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Every single instinct he had was screaming at him, telling him to flee as fast as he could and a few of the \u201cintellectual\u201d parts of his mind were agreeing with them as he remembered how Minerva was portrayed in the cartoons. The mink while beautiful, a wonderful singer, and a temptress beyond compare never gave the impression that she\u2019d be pleased to find what most surely would appear to her as an invader of her home. So lost was he in his thoughts that Jake\u2019s attention was pulled from the mink until he felt the brush of her silken fur against his face. Summoning every ounce of willpower he had Jake kept from moving as the middle finger and thumb of Minerva\u2019s right hand passed over his face before wrapping around his chest as he was gently lifted from the ground and carefully placed on her left palm. Letting his weight go he tried to act like a doll, attempting the illusion that her actions had changed his weight enough to cause him to fall rather than the simple fact he needed to move even if it was under her gaze. Just out of the corner of his eye he could see her face getting closer as her palm was lifted up towards her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell aren\u2019t you just the cutest little thing\u201d Minerva cooed sweetly. \u201cI could just eat. You. Up\u201d Whether the emphasis on the later words was purposeful or not, the combination of the words and the fact that Minerva had a lot more canines in her large white smile than he was expecting caused Jake\u2019s instincts to win out over his intelligence. Unlike in the movies there was no yelp or any other verbal exclamation as he freaked out, he did however push himself back away from Minerva\u2019s grinning muzzle as quickly as possible although there wasn\u2019t far to go as he took up her entire palm. Quickly finding his back against Minerva\u2019s long slender fingers Jake couldn\u2019t do anything but wait as Minerva\u2019s fingers closed in on him and much to his surprise ever so gently stroked carefully down his head and back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t think I was going to hurt you did I?\u201d Minerva\u2019s voice was surprisingly quiet and sounded almost pained, like his reaction had hurt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026yes\u2026.no, you found someone uninvited in your house, I had no idea how you were going to act\u201d He replied truthfully, as he\u2019d expected Minerva to freak out like he currently was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what can I say cutie, it\u2019s every girl\u2019s dream to literally have a man in the palm of her hand\u201d Minerva punctuated the end of the sentence with a soft giggle, her voice thankfully becoming more normal as she spoke,<br>\r\nSlowly sitting up from the almost-fetal position he\u2019d taken in her palm Jake felt whole sections of muscle relax as he observed Minerva. Clad in her trademark red jumpsuit she looked even more beautiful standing before him than she had on any television or computer. Minerva\u2019s massive golden tail trailed down to and formed a small pile of smooth silken fur on the floor; he could feel her large soft eyes examining every inch of his body as \u201cphew\u201d she gently blew a few strands of golden hair out of her face. Every inch of Minerva\u2019s silky smooth fur and soft flowing locks seemed to sparkle and shine in her home\u2019s natural light, as he admittedly stared for several seconds. Once the fear of having her react negatively to him was passed Jake was feeing oddly excited, despite some other pressing problems like how he\u2019d gotten in his current situation being unresolved at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee something you like?\u201d Minerva\u2019s voice drew Jake from his reverie and he was sure he felt his cheeks flush as he was caught basically ogling Minerva while he was sitting in her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s just you\u2019re\u2026.well you\u2019re beautiful\u201d Jake replied truthfully. What he wasn\u2019t expecting was for Minerva, the seductress, the heartthrob to turn away and blush, no different than a girl who\u2019d been complimented by her crush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re just saying that\u201d Minerva replied demurely, eyes downcast as her tail wrapped protectively around her legs as a gentle crimson coloured her snow-white fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not; you\u2019re one of the most beautiful creatures I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d Jake replied earning another gentle blush from the rather uncharacteristic Minerva. Jake wanted to question why she was acting completely different from the cartoons, but honestly the less he said about it the better; he\u2019d already dodged one bullet by having her believe he meant no harm. Trying to convince her about everything else was something he\u2019d need to save for another day\u2026or not reveal at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should really be better at taking a compliment, I mean I am an actress after all\u201d Minerva replied, her head turning back to Jake as her vision focused upon him \u201cbut something about your words, they just feel so sincere.\u201d Eyes focused completely on Mineva\u2019s smiling face Jake was caught off-guard as one of her fingers began to gently stroke over his back, the smooth furred digit barely exerting any force yet he could feel the weight and warmth of the digit easily through his shirt. The two stood like that for nearly a half a minute, both seemingly content to not wreck the moment. Yet Jake knew that he had to take advantage of the opening that Minerva had provided by saying she was an actress. While he wouldn\u2019t reveal everything he now had a reason to know her name atleast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou said that you were an actress\u2026.I might be completely wrong about this, but are you THE Minerva Mink?\u201d Jake despite himself felt a small amount of reverence enter his voice as he talked about Minerva even though he was talking to her. He was surprised by Minerva\u2019s reaction however as her entire body seemed to tense a gentle sigh escaping her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I\u2019m Minerva Mink\u2026.I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen my work then?\u201d Minerva\u2019s entire body seemed to sag, her ears and tail drooping as it was like he\u2019d come to discover some sort of deep dark secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026.yeah, and I\u2019ll admit you\u2019re acting a bit different than you do in the roles, but they\u2019re just roles right? It\u2019s not like that\u2019s how you actually are\u201d Jake couldn\u2019t help hesitating for just a moment as he had admittedly expected that Minerva would act more or less like she did in the cartoons because well that was all he had to work off of. Cartoons are also different than any movie\u2026at least that\u2019s what he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTing\u201d Minerva\u2019s tail suddenly stood straight up like an exclamation mark as her expression became quite sultry. He tried to back up as Minerva slowly leaned towards him, her face looming ever closer until \u201cMmmmhmmm\u201d her soft lips pressed against him in a gentle kiss that lasted for several seconds before she pulled back. \u201cNot only are you cute, but you\u2019re smart\u2026.you\u2019re the first guy to ever figure out I\u2019m not how I act in my movies isn\u2019t that funny?\u201d Despite her best attempts pain was obvious in Minerva\u2019s voice and similarly written across her face. What she\u2019d gone through because someone thought she was simply some shallow bitch thanks to seeing her cartoons was something Jake wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d ever know. A pang of guilt shooting through his chest as he\u2019d thought the exact same way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s talk about what we\u2019re going to do with you\u201d Minerva practically purred as her palm was quickly brought to above her voluptuous chest. Without warning it suddenly tilted forward Jake tumbling down into the soft furry orbs, a gentle giggle escaping Minerva\u2019s lips as Jake landed between her voluminous cleavage face down his thrashing legs sticking out as he struggled to right himself. He was left in rather humid darkness for several seconds before Minerva\u2019s fingers gently wrapped around his chest and with one surprisingly deft motion flipped him, right-side up although he was still surrounded by her warm soft mounds, and he was facing Minerva rather than the rest of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMin-\u201c he barely had time to speak before one of her fingers lowered to right before him and she gently shushed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t have anywhere else to carry you, and you\u2019re not going to tell me that my breasts are uncomfortable are you?\u201d Jake wasn\u2019t sure what he was supposed to say in reply to that, Minerva\u2019s eyes fell upon him \u201cwell?\u201d she continued, an angry undercurrent characterizing her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026.they\u2019re very comfortable\u201d he replied softly, his voice barely above a whisper. Lowering his gaze he was caught off-guard by Minerva\u2019s finger gently stroking over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you like them, and hopefully you\u2019ll like my home just as much. Now let\u2019s show you around\u201d Minerva\u2019s voice was soft and controlled as she began to walk. Resigning himself to being stuck where he was, after several seconds of wiggling and a pause from Minerva, Jake was able to orient himself so he was looking out over her cleavage and towards the room as a whole. As Minerva began her \u201ctour\u201d her latest actions brought several questions to mind, but the most obviously pressing one was why she was being so kind. It was obvious she wasn\u2019t the same Minerva he knew from the cartoons, but even so\u2026</span></div></div>",

However, I slipped once again,(what with her coming from the shower and getting the bed wet) and was now in between her crack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, for one reason or another she decided to stand up and took me with her.

You're lifted up to her face and she gently pokes you with one finger \"please\" she says smiling. You can't help but answer after seeing her smiling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this will sound crazy but i'm from a different world, and well there you're nothing more then a cartoon character there, so to most people you're fiction\" you say quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do these feel like fiction?\" Minerva says dropping you into her chest surrounding you with it. She pushes her chest together twice squishing you into the warmth before she fishes you out and places you down on her shoulder. \"Do you still think i'm fiction?\" Minerva asks slightly angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never said you were fiction, that's just how you were portrayed in my world\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalming down she says \"well you did tell me how you heard of me. So what part of this gorgeous mink do you like best?\" she asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I like you're singing voice best, I mean you are absolutely beaufitul but you singing you're little song stuck with me since I first heard it\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you're the first one to ever say that, all the guys i've ever met want me for my body and well.....that\" Minerva says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i'd be lying if I said I never had those kind of thoughts about you, but there's obviously more to you then that\" you say. She picks you up between 2 fingers and places you down on the couch. Minerva lays down facing you and motions with 1 finger for you to move closer which you do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close you're eyes\" Minerva says. You do so and stand stock still, shocked, as she leans forward and kisses you. You quickly open you're eyes and you kiss back as best as you can, you smile as she looked so cute with her lips slightly parted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you do that?\" you ask still stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you'll be staying here anyways so you might as well stay here as my boyfriend\" Minerva says smiling. \"I mean it's not every day I get to meet a human who's such a little sweetie\" she says reaching over and lightly poking you, you just stand there trying to take everything in. \"Or do you not want to be my boyfriend?\" Minerva asks after you don't answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing to you're senses you say \"of course I will, I mean it's only what i've dreamt about for years\" you cover you're mouth at the end and she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well atleast you're honest\" Minerva says smiling, she lays out in front of you seeming to examine you and you're gaze slowly shifts onto her tail as it slowly shifts from side to side. Minerva seems to notice and smiles \"so you like my tail?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe\" you reply \"I mean what kind of gorgeous mink doesn't also have a gorgeous tail\" you say. \"So is it as fluffy as it looks?\" you ask nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva smiles and says \"why don't you find out for yourself.\" She sits up and turns so her tail is between you and her, you reach over and gently stroke, it feeling how soft and warm it is you bury yourself neck deep in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so comfortable\" you say happily. You look up and see minerva staring down at you, you look down and notice you're still wearing you're shoes. \"Oh i'm sorry\" you say quickly taking them off. You drop them to the floor and walk over and sit between Minerva and her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack do you mind telling me something?\" Minerva asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure what?\" you reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you've shown how much you like me, is there anything you dislike?\" Minerva asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, i'm not really one to talk since i'm the same but I thought how you went gaga over that wolf nerd when he transformed was kind of shallow\" you say looking in the other direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you looking away?\" Minerva asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this all seems so dream like to me, i'm kind of afraid that i'll wreck it or the instant I see you mad i'll wake up\" you say blushing. You feel her tail wrap around you and she you turn towards her but you just look down instead of up. She gently pushes you're head up with 1 finger and you are suprised to see tears rolling down her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...\"you are cut off as she leans over and kisses you enveloping you're head and most of you're upper body in her lips. You kiss her upper lip with as much strength as you had and you hold the kiss for a few seconds, you broke it off however because you needed air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\" she says quickly you guess taking you ending it as rejection \"it's just i've never met a guy that liked me for me and was well willing to criticize. You probably don't know how much it hurts to fall for some good looking guy and have them get in bed with you only to leave and spread the news on the internet about how a poor sex partner you are.\" You climb up her arm and sit on her shoulder \"so is that what happned with the werewolf?\" you ask. She nods and you sigh \"i'm sorry Minerva for what I said, I'd never do that, both becuase I couldn't and because you mean too much to me\" you say slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no need to apologize\" she says composing herself \"it was shallow of me to fall for him just because he looked good\" she says. \"Well you probably want to leave now that you've seen what a wreck I really am\" Minerva says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never\" you shout getting her attention, \"you're still the Minerva Mink I fell in love with, seeing you like this makes me want to be with you even more because it means you aren't shallow, so now you're perfect in my eyes\" you say. You're picked up off her shoulder and she hugs you into her chest, \"thank you\" she says. She holds you there for a few minutes until you're stomach gives off an audible rumble, Minerva lifts you up and asks \"was that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it was, I guess i'm a bit hungry\" you say sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let me take care of that for you love\" she says. Minerva places you down on her shoulder and walks into a kitchen area, she places you down on a tiled counter and grabs some stuff out of a fridge and a cupboard. In a few seconds she has a sandwhich bigger then you are sitting in front of you, \"well dig in\" she says smiling. You chow down and finish about a 4th of the sandwhich in 5 minutes, you push the plate towards her and she eats the rest of the sandwhich quickly showing off a few canines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My compliments to the chef\" you say smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you sure are easy to cook for\" Minerva says. She lowers a hand to you and you climb on, she walks over to her armoire and grabs a brush with her free hand before going back to the couch and laying down. She puts the brush on her back and asks \"Jack do you mind giving my tail and hair a brush?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" you reply. You grab the brush with 2 hands finding out suprisingly it was lighter then you thought and get to work, you start brushing and Minerva starts singing \"It's not pretty being me... Try it and you'll see... It's harder than you think being a gorgeous mink. La da da da, da da dee, it's not pretty being me\" the whole time you brush. It takes you 10 minutes to do all the brushing and she sits up and goes and looks at herself in her mirror, she strikes a pose and nods. She takes the brush and puts it back \"you did a really good job Jack, better then I do\" Minerva says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i'd hate to ruin any part of you're beauty Minerva, plus the song acted as a good motivator\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack you're now my boyfriend and personal caretaker, are you ok with that?\" Minerva asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're really good you get special priveliges\" Minerva says smiling. </span></div></div>",

Minerva walks toward the one other door in the house and opens it revealing a fully pink bathroom complete with toilet, bath tub and sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlaring red again you ask \"um....so what do you need my help with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to help me while i'm in the shower\" Minerva says smiling you were sure because of you're reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No that's ok, I just need to go\" you say looking around for some way to get down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww you're hurting my feelings Jack\" Minerva says sweetly \"don't you want to take a shower with me?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I refuse to answer that on the grounds i'll sound like an idiot, now if you'll just let me down i'll let you take you're shower\" you say thoroughly embarassed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but that's no fun\" Minerva replies, she puts you down on the counter and with 2 fingers rips you're clothes off, you grab a hand towel and wrap it around yourself. \"Why'd you do that?\" you yell at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't being very cooperative\" Minerva says, she starts sliding off her red dress and you turn around. \"Oh come now Jack we just met do you really think i'd show you everything?\" Minerva says. Believing her you turn around and just stand there with you're mouth literally hanging open at the sight in front of you. Minerva is standing there fully nude her chest seemed even bigger when freed from the dress, her fur accentuated her perfect figure and she spins around once. You had to admit her tail really contrasted her cute butt and made both look even better. You shut you're eyes after a second and turn around saying \"you said you weren't naked\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never said any such thing\" Minerva says poking you're back. She picks you up and puts you down you assume in the soap dish as you were now sitting on something hard. You hear the shower turn on and you shut you're eyes even tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I really not worth seeing?\" Minerva asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, i'm just afraid if I see you like that i'll become like those guys you hate and think of you only for sex and you're body\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come now you like me for more than that\" Minerva says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes but there's always been a part of me that lusted for you and whenever I let myself go even a bit that lust seems to take me over\" you say. You're poked in the stomach and you slowly open you're eyes. Minerva's face took up you're whole field of vision she was so close and you see a smile on her face. She quickly pulls the towel off you and keeps smiling, it takes a second for it to register that you're sitting there fully nude in front of her but once you do you try to cover up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There now we're even\" Minerva says she picks you up and says \"if you really aren't ready then you can wait outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think i'll be ok, but just hold me down if I try to go too far\" you say. She picks up the bar and splits it into half handing one half to you and puts the other down. You're able to hold it up with you're whole upper body and she holds you near her back. You start rubbing and quickly have a lather created, Minerva holds you up to each part of her body and in a minute you have ever part of her except her front covered in soap suds. Finally she holds you up to her front and you slowly start rubbing. You hear Minerva give off a small sigh but you keep rubbing, you feel her step into the water stream as the water hits you as well as her. She lifts the bar from you're hands and after a few seconds you open you're eyes to see her smiling down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow you were so gentle Jack\" Minerva says running a hand over her arm \"smooth and silky just how I like it\" she says smiling. \"Now it's you're turn\" she says grabbing the other half of the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what...\" you're cut off as she starts rubbing the bar over you and then holds you under the shower head for a second. She puts the bar back and turns the shower off, she steps out of the tub and puts you down on the counter before handing you a hand towel which you use to dry off and as a temporary set of clothes. Minerva starts drying herself off with a towel and she quickly has herself dried off. \"Ahh much better, I always disliked how my fur sticks when it's wet\" Minerva says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's good, hey do you have any dolls clothes or something as you kind of destroyed mine\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but you look so cute with that towel wrapped around you\" Minerva says. You glare at her and she sighs, \"I think I still have some\" she says before running out of the bathroom. She quickly shows back up carrying a small white t-shirt and a pair of blue jeans there was even a tiny pair of underwear. You thank her as she passes the clothes over and you quickly get dressed. She lowers a hand to you and you climb on \"see that wasn't so bad, you didn't try to do anything\" Minerva says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah although I have to admit it was kind of hard to hold it back\" you say. Minerva leans over and gives you a kiss \"well that's a reward for willing to do that\" she says.</span></div></div>",

You climb onto her back and starts rubbing, even though all you wanted to do was curl up in the warm fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? i'm here shouldn't it be a problem if I see you naked\" you say as you rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who says I don't want you to see?\" Minerva replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're stunned for a second but you start rubbing again \"why would you want me to see? we've barely known each other?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but you're already the nicest, sweetest guy i've known, and I don't want you to leave\" Minerva says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you think you need to show me something for me to stay?\" you ask. You finish rubbing her back and move up onto her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....maybe a little, you did say that you still had those kinds of thoughts\" Minerva says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but they're a minority, Minerva I fell for the gorgeous, somewhat shallow mink that seemed kind and had a great singing voice and no amount of skin is going to change that\" you say. Minerva's silent and you continue rubbing, it takes you a minute to finish and you jump down onto the couch and walk in front her. \"Minerva are you ok?\" you ask as she had her head down. You walk up and gently stroke Minerva's golden hair and you get no response. You sit down and continue stroking her hair with one hand while you reach over and stroke part of her fur with you're other hand. You keep this up for a few minutes before getting up and starting to walk away. You're path is blocked by Minerva's hand and you sit back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minerva what's wrong?\" you ask turning around and staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"........\" you heard her mutter something but you couldn't tell what she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you say?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said i'm scared, no one's ever been this nice to me before without wanting something in return\" Minerva says. \"Everyone just wants me for my body, even the first guy I fell for, he was an actual nerd but he just wanted to get me in bed and once he learned I was no good he left\" Minerva says starting to cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is that why you became shallow? because you were hurt by someone you truly cared about?\" you ask. Minerva just nods in reply. You walk up and sit next to her and hug her big furry cheek \"with these hands I will protect you, with these hands I will hold you, through the happiest day or the darkest night I will be by you're side\" you say not really sure where the words came from. Minerva just stares at you for a bit shocked at what you had just said then she hugs you tightly to her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Jack\" she whispers and she cuddles against you for a good 5 minutes before releasing her grip. You step back but you're pushed against the couch as Minerva kisses you. There's a difference between the other times, you can feel this is a truly passionate kiss, she holds it for a good few minutes before gently releasing it and lifting her head. She keeps staring at you and it starts kind of creeping you out. \"What?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing i'm just glad I met such a cute little sweetie such as you\" Minerva says. \"I'm also really glad I made you my boyfriend beacause now you're stuck with me, you don't mind staying with this gorgeous mink forever do you?\" Minerva asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No that's why I agreed in the first place\" you reply. Minerva leans over and gives you a big long lick, \"gross why'd you do that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I know you're taste and scent so there's no getting away\" Minerva says with a sly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I want to get away?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugs \"I don't know but now now you can't even if you wanted to\" Minerva replies. Minerva yawns and stretches before laying her head down \"why do I feel sleepy all of a sudden\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you need a lot of beauty rest\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm beautiful enough already\" she replies pushing you over with 1 finger. \"Well then I guess you're just tired\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i'm going to take a nap then\" Minerva says. You nod and start to leave going to look for something to do while she sleeps when she picks you up with 2 fingers. \"Where do you think you're going?\" Minerva asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To go find something to do while you sleep\" you reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sleeping with me\" Minerva says lowering you into her chest and laying down so you're stuck in there but not hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey this is imprisonment\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad cutie\" Minerva says patting you on the head with 1 finger \"now go to sleep\" she says laying her head down. You try to get out but you can't so you lay you're head down and quickly fall asleep. You have a dream where you're at a church obviously there for a wedding and Minerva is you're bride. You feel as happy as can be and the priest says \"you may now kiss the bride.\" Minerva leans over to kiss you but something doesn't feel right. It feels like she's getting further away and you realize you're getting even smaller, you shrink until her lips hit where you were and you perish. You wake up screaming and this wakes Minerva up, she looks down at you worry written all over her face \"Jack what's wrong?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, just had a bad dream, we were getting married and you were about to kiss me but then I stared shrinking and you didn't realize it and you well squished me\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, i'd never do that\" Minerva says kissing you just to prove it. \"You're my cute little guy and i'll take care of you\" Minerva says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't I supposed to be you're caretaker?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes but that's really just for grooming\" Minerva says. \"No offense but you probably couldn't really protect me in a fight\" Minerva continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah\" you say. Minerva gets up and walks through the house to the bedroom, she places you down on the bed and then stands in front of you. \"Alright Jack you have to beat me, you do that by getting me to surrender\" Minerva says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How am I supposed to do that, I mean i'm not going to bite you or anything\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how about if you reach my ears then\" Minerva says pointing at them. You nod and she steps straight in front of you, you jump onto her foot and quickly start climbing. You wrap around her leg as she tries to push you off but you quickly make it onto her behind. \"Hey no fair you can't touch a girl there\" Minerva says trying to push you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everythings fair in a fight\" you reply, you grab onto her tail which was swinging around and you're just able to use it to catapult yourself onto her shoulder. You quickly climb onto the top of her head and grab her ear \"ha Minerva I win\" you say. She doesn't answer \"hey Minerva you ok?\" you ask letting go of her ear and looking forward. Minerva falls backwards onto the bed and you're just able to jump off onto a pillow. You just stare at her and her eyes slowly open after a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you found my weakness\" Minerva says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My ears, they're really sensitive\" Minerva says leaning over, you reach out and stroke one and Minerva sighs and falls over. \"See what I mean\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you mind if I scratch you're ears for a while?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure but i'm not sure what will happen\" Minerva says. You climb onto her head and start scratching, Minerva instantly starts sighing and after a minute you hear her breathing get heavier. You rub her ears for a good 10 minutes and climb down. She turns and looks at you....</span></div></div>",

She wraps her hands behind you puts her whole self into the kiss. You can't help but smile \"thank you\" you think thanking whatever higher power let you have this joy. Minerva lets up after a minute but you stay in the little groove in the pillow, looking up. \"Where'd Jack go?\" she asks, \"oh well\" she shrugs and walks over to a closet, you see her back as she takes off her dress and puts on a purple and pink robe. She walks back up and hugs the pillow to her stomach, flopping down so you're head was just under her belly button. You're just able to reach an arm up and you tap her stomach, she lifts herself up and looks down at you, \"oh there you are\" she says smiling mischeviously. \"Well since you're down there how about you give me a belly rub\" Minerva says laying back down. You mumble under you're breath for a second before starting to rub, you heard Minerva give off a sigh and you were fearful for a second as it felt like her weight increased before it went back to the bearable level it was now. As you rubbed, you started sniffing and that's when you realized you were surrounded by her scent, she smelt like flower petals, the forest, and slighlty like soap. You lean forward to get more of her scent and you rub against Minerva's belly button and much to her suprise you hear her start giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minerva are you ticklish\" you yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, it's just fun to have you under there\" she replies. You lean forward and lick her belly button and you hear her start laughing and you smile. You rub her belly for a bit before Minerva pulls you out from under her and smiles at you. \"Thanks for the rub\" she says laying down on the pillow and smiling at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, it was my pleasure\" you reply sitting down and facing her. \"Minerva you smell nice, like flowers\" you say smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...thank you\" Minerva says blushing a bit. She pulls you forward and gently snuggles you into her chest, \"you can smell me all you want\" she whispers before she starts stroking you're back with one finger. \"Mmmmm\" you reply, you curl up and fall asleep right there, surrounded by her warmth. You wake up and Minerva's staring at you, she smiles as she realizes you're up and you stretch. \"Morning\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning\" she replies crawling forward so she's right in front of you, she leans forward and you kiss her pink nose. \"Good, you did know what I wanted\" she says smiling, \"you really are a good caretaker\" she says.,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for you\" you reply smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm well I think it's about time you were rewarded.....now how should I?\" she says. Sitting up and holding a finger to her chin she thinks for a moment, \"I know, you and me and a little church\" she says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you say. Minerva gets up, walks over to a desk and pulls out a small box. She puts it in front of you \"open it\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way this is happening, no way\" you think while opening the box. Inside was a ring, it was bigger then you were around, \"so where'd you get the ring?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I was the one who bought it, i've kept it as a reminder of how mean men can be\" Minerva says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're giving it to me to get rid of it?\" you ask not able to process the alternative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No silly\" she says, she picks up the box and smiles \"will you be mine, forever and ever?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A....are you proposing to me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes....now come on don't keep me waiting\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B...b...but i've barely known you a day, and I could still betray you and...\" you're shushed as Minerva's tail falls around you and she holds one finger to you're mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it a yes, or a no?\" she asks staring at you with her large eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course yes, but why?\" you ask honestly confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well as I said before you're the nicest guy i've ever met, even though i've known you for maybe a day you've treated me so well and not because I bullied you or seduced you but because you care for me, I even tested you earlier and you passed beautifully. So after you fell asleep I thought about it and thought about it, and I figured something out, you've made me happier in the last day then most guys have made me in a year. I don't want to lose that, I don't want to lose you, because I think i'm falling in love with you\" she says. You nearly have a heart attack over what you were hearing but you do faint, You wake up a small time later with Minerva looking over you, \"wakey wakey\" she says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Augh, I had a weird dream, you well proposed to me\" you say trying to convince yourself of you're own words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't a dream\" Minerva says holding up the ring box, she leans over and smiles at you \"so since you already said yes we should probably start preparing\" Minerva says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Preparing for what?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well first the ceremony, then the reception, then our life together and eventually the pitter-patter of little paws\" Minerva says looking away dreamily at the last bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that last one even possible?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll just have to try and find out\" Minerva says smiling at you mischeviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just...just give me a second to take this all in\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is this such a shock?\" Minerva asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've loved you for I don't know how many years, now you're in front of me and saying you love me too, it's just i'm so happy i'm not thinking correctly\" you say. She pushes you over with one finger and smiles \"well you'll have the rest of our lives to figure out it's real\" she says laying her head down next to you. You turn over and she smiles at you, you can't help but smile back and she sighs \"thank you Jack\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, thanks for what?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had given up, on ever finding someone, until you showed up in my house, i'll admit at first I was angry at you, but you started making me fall for you the moment you first spoke to me and were so kind\" Minerva says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, i'm glad you're so happy Minerva\" you say. She smiles even more and cuddles you against her cheek \"that's what I love about you\" she says. You lay on her cheek for a bit hugging her with one arm and gently stroking her with you're free one. You jump down and sit in front of her, you smile at her and she smiles back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, you're going to have to meet my parents\" Minerva says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, although I honestly thought most animals lost contact with their parents when they grew up\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well my parents came back into my life once they heard about what happened with wolf boy\" Minerva says. \"It's going to be hard to introduce you, but we'll figure it out somehow\" Minerva says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to be hard why?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they're very judgemental, and not only are you not a mink, you're kind of small\" Minerva says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't mind my size do you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it just makes you easier to cuddle with\" Minerva says hugging you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But don't you wish I could well wrap my arms around you and just hold you tight?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, a bit, but the other advantages of having you small are worth it\" Minerva says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What advantages?\" you ask, Minerva just smiles at you and doesn't reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What advantages?\" you ask again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's about time to get up and make some breakfast\" Minerva says changing the subject. She grabs you and gently drops you on top of her chest, before walking out of the bedroom and into the kitchen, bounce a bit as she takes each step and you can't help but smile.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Minerva enters the kitchen and puts you down on the table before grabbing some bacon which she starts to fry. You thought about continuing to ask her about the advantages but you decided to just drop it. Minerva finished the bacon in a minute and sat down cutting off a piece which she handed to you. You ate it happily getting a bit of grease on you which much to you're suprise Minerva licks off you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I have a drink?\" you ask. Minerva nods and grabs a saucer which she fills with a small amount of milk. You happily drink the milk although you did look a bit like a cat as you drank it. Without a word once you finished Minerva put the plate away, went back into her room and got changed into her trademark red dress, came back and picked you up and put you on her shoulder and walked out the door. She walked for a minute before the silence started to bug you. \"Minerva what's wrong?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong...n-n-nothing's wrong\" she stammers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, that's something i've never heard, seriously what's wrong?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm scared, my parents are both huge hunters and you're well, you're a human but you're very.....prey sized\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I trust you\" you say. Minerva smiles at you and pats you on the head, \"thanks\" she says. It was suprisingly only a 10 minute walk to her parents house, like hers it was a giant log with a window and a door cut into it. Minerva slowly opens the door and walks in, \"Mom, you home?\" she yells grabbing you and hiding you in her dress. You stick you're head out over the top edge of the dress and you see another mink walk in. You could easily tell where Minerva got her looks from as her mother looked great, not as god as Minerva but still very nice. From a side corridor came another mink carrying a newspaper, \"the daily root\" it read. Minerva notices you're head sticking out and quickly pushes you back into her dress, \"Mom, Dad we need to talk\" Minerva says.You felt her walk and sit down. \"Mom, Dad, i'm well i'm seeing someone\" Minerva says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunnie that's great, but you better not go too quickly\" Mrs. Mink says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok mom, this guy is really nice, and even though he's had a lot of chances to take advantage of me, but he hasn't\" Minerva replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's good\" Mr. Mink replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to meet him?\" Minerva asks hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, we'll expect him in the hour\" Mrs. Mink says.Minerva reaches into her dress and pulls you out, \"Mom, Dad this my boyfriend Jack\" she says holding you up. You look up to see 2 huge mink faces looking at you, although unhappily they had a look of hunger in their eyes. Minerva pulls you close to her chest and glares at her parents. \"Mom, Dad, leave him alone\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minerva, what is that thing, it looks like a hairless mouse\" Mr.Mink  says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a human, and he's been my admirer for a long time\" Minerva replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Mink leans over and the look of hunger leaves her eyes, \"wow, he's actually kind of cute\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks mom, I think\" Minerva says, Minerva sets you down in her lap and her father sits opposite in a chair while her mother sits down net to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's different about this little guy?\" Mr. Mink asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he's kind, funny, he actually cares about me\" Minerva says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh pssh look at him, he's so small even with you fully clothed he's probably just non-stop staring at you and having dirty fantasies\" Mr. Mink says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually dad, I already tested that, I offered to take a shower with him, I mean what better chance right?\" she says, \"anyways he said he didn't want to, he actually tried to run in the other direction before I stopped him\" Minerva continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, one example does not make a man\" Mr .Mink says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad he spent 20 minutes brushing my hair and my tail, and half an hour giving me a massage, I don't think he wants to take advantage of me\" Minerva argues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't trust him\" Mr. Mink says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what do I call you\" you pipe up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Thomas\" Mr. Mink replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, glad to make you're acquaintance\" you say standing up. \"So you're problem is you think i'm gonna betray you're daughter, why?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she's always had trust issues, the guys never trusted her as much as she trusted them\" Thomas says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe i'm doing this\" you think. \"What if I proved I trusted her\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be acceptable\" Thomas says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minerva can you lift me up?\" you ask. Minerva lifts you up to eye level. \"Do you trust me?\" you ask and she nods, \"well then open you're mouth\" you say and she stares at you horrified. \"Look this isn't easy on my end easier, so please just do it\" you say and Minerva opens her jaws. You walk in past her teeth which were like mini rock formations to you and you sit down on her tongue, \"a minute good?\" you ask. Minerva's father had frozen, \"uh yeah sure\" he says. \"Ok close it\" you say and you were plunged into darkness. You felt Minerva's breath all around you, it was wet yet actually kind of warm. You just sat there letting the seconds tick by, finally after what felt thankfully like a minute Minerva opens her mouth and pulls you out. Her father was staring at you stunned as well as her mother. Minerva lifts you up to eye level and she seems quite angry, \"don't you ever, ever do that again\" she yells causing you to cover you're ears. Her eyes soften and she hugs you into her chest, \"you scared me half to death, if I made one wrong move...I..I...i'd lose you\" she says sniffling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minerva it's ok, I had complete trust in you\" you say burying you're head in her chest. You heard a sound and you turn to see Thomas stand up and walk over, he bends down and stares at you before extending a paw. \"You have guts, trust, and most of all you truly seem to care for my daughter unlike those other sleazebags, I accept, welcome to the family\" he says. You turn around and shake his paw happy as can be. You felt a tap and looked up to see Minerva's mother looking down at you, \"i'm Felicity, i'll be you're new mother-in-law\" she says happily. \"Thanks\" you say not able to say much else. Minerva puts you down on the couch, \"me and mom are gonna make wedding preparations you and Dad can talk for a bit\" she says getting up and following her mother into the kitchen. You look up at Thomas and you had to admit you were a bit unnerved by the guy even backing up a step, Thomas notices this and smiles, \"don't worry, i'm not going to eat you, my daughter seems to really like you\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well i've liked her for a long time\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, how long?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I saw the show on my 5th birthday so a little over 13 years\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's a long time to hold a crush\" he replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly never thought i'd meet her, but it was a bit hard\" you reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i'm expecting you to take good care of her, even if you're a bit....small\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can do, so I can see where Minerva gets her body from\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Felicity's great, fell for her the moment I saw her, sadly that was before I moved away in elementary school, didn't see her again till college\" Thomas says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got something in common\" you say and you both laugh as you realized you did.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next few weeks were quite hectic, you were introduced to so many members of Minerva's family it wasn't even funny. She had 50 cousins alone along with their parents and any other acquaintances that might have been close enough to attend the wedding, this was going to be one very packed church. Nothing really major happened until the party which was supposed to be Minerva's all-female party but she wouldn't let you out of her sight so it was just a regular party. You were sitting on the refreshment table as Minerva had to go to the bathroom when a mink that looked like Minerva's twin except she had black hair instead of blond walked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Shelly, Minerva's cousin, wow so she really is marrying a really small human\" she says leaning forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's a dream come true\" you reply. She leans further and you notice that she keeps smiling, but it's a creepy kind of smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you like so much about my cousin?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, she's pretty, smart, kind\" you say. Shelly nods, \"well you know you could always dump my cousin and come with me\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at her stunned but politely reply \"no that's fine, Minerva's the only girl for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't asking\" Shelly says starting to reach for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shelly\" you heard a voice yell and in a second you were picked up and nestled in 2 large mounds held in a red dress. \"What do you think your doing with my Jack?\" Minerva says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh looks who's here, Ms. everyone loves me because I\u2019m hot, I\u2019m pretty much your twin except the hair and no guy has ever wanted to go out with me, so I decided to take the one guy who actually seems to matter to you\" Shelly says staring at you and Minerva holds you tighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys don't want to go out with you Shelly because frankly your a bitch\" Minerva says practically growling. You looked up at her and then at Shelly and you knew this was not the place you wanted to be at this moment. You saw a glint in Shelly's eye and throwing caution to the wind you jumped back towards the refreshment table, good thing too as right after you did you heard one girl connect with the other. You just landed on the side of the table and you had to scramble to get up but you made it. You turned around to see the 2 rolling around at on the floor tearing at each other's clothes, pulling on hair and tails, scratching at face, it was a regular cat fight. There was no one around so you did the stupidest thing you could do, you shimmied down the leg of the table and ran toward the dance floor. It wasn't hard to find Thomas as he was wearing one of those stupid disco outfits, you ran toward him dodging pans and other limbs until you reached his leg. You grabbed his leg and started climbing, thankfully however he noticed the sensation, looked down and spotted you. He picks you up between 2 fingers and lifts you up \"hey what are you doing over here, it's dangerous\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minerva, Shelly, cat-fight\" you say pointing towards where they were. Thomas nods and holding you in a palm he runs over to the refreshment table, puts you down and pulls the 2 girls off each other. \"Hey, hey break it up\" he says. The two girls look at each other still very angry and Thomas stands between them \"ok what's going on here\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was trying to steal Jack\" Minerva says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She doesn't deserve a nice guy, she's gotten enough chances\" Shelly replies. Minerva freezes and looks around \"hey where is he\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry he's ok, he came and got me, little nut ran out onto the dance floor to get me\" Thomas says. Shelly just turns and walks away, you wave and Minerva quickly walks up, scoops you up and hugs you. \"Thanks for getting my dad\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, but look at you, do you know how much brushing I\u2019m going to have to do to fix this\" you say indicating her fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva giggles \"thanks for always looking out for me\" she says and she gently kisses you. The party was pretty uneventful after that and true to your word it took you probably a good 2 hours to fix everything Shelly had messed up and that included cleaning and bandaging the cuts. You fell asleep nestled against Minerva's cheek with one hand gently placed on top of you. You woke up the next day to her beautiful smile and she gently kissed you \"well today's the big day\" she says. You nodded and she put a doll's tuxedo down on the bed \"no peeking\" she says standing up. You dive under the covers and start getting changed into the tuxedo. It only took you a minute and every few seconds you'd look out and see her tail swish around as she moved around. You felt her touch the bed and you crawled out and were stunned. Minerva was standing there in a traditional wedding dress veil and all, well except for the ear and tail holes. She gently lifted you up and smiled at you \"you look quite handsome\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minerva your easily the most beautiful thing i've ever seen\" you reply and you saw her blush slightly under the veil. \"Hey isn't it bad luck to see the bride before a wedding?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not when she's your transportation\" Minerva replies and before you can stop her she nestles you into her dress so just your head was sticking out and she starts walking. You sighed and just got comfy. It only took her a few minutes to walk to the church and she hummed the whole way, she met her father at the front who looked around. \"So where is he?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh he's close\" Minerva says. Thomas with a grin on his face opens the church doors and leads Minerva up to the altar while \"Here comes the bride\" plays. The priest looks her over and somehow he doesn't notice you either \"uh where is the man your supposed to be marrying?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here\" Minerva replies pulling you out. You heard a gasp from the front row and you heard someone yell from the back \"lucky bastard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehem yes well other then our couple's strange entrance if there is anyone who objects to this matrimony speak now or forever hold your peace\" the priest says. You saw a lot of the people who Minerva had gone gaga over yet they were all silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem well then do you take this woman to have and to hold till death do you part?\" the priest asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you take this man to have and to hold till death do you part\" the priest asks Minerva laughing a bit at the small irony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do\" she replies quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then you may exchange rings and kiss the bride\" he says. Thomas walks up and hands Minerva 2 rings, she slips one over you and is about to slip the other one on when you stop her. Struggling to hold the ring up as gold is actually quite heavy you slip it onto her finger, Minerva lifts you up and you share your first kiss as husband and wife. The church erupted into cheers and clapping \"Thank you Jack, you've made me so happy\" Minerva whispers tears streaming down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes two of us Minerva\" you reply reaching up and brushing as many of her tears aside as you can. She giggles and kisses you again and that was the start of your marriage. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You wake up slowly, and as soon as you realize the date you smile slightly. You look up at Minerva's still sleeping face and smile \"happy 1 year anniversary\" you whisper. The tranquility of the morning was broken by the sound of crying, and Minerva slowly sat up, \"uhh, what time is it?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"7:00am, but Cassy and Chris say it's feeding time\" you reply climbing up onto her shoulder. Minerva slowly stood up and walked over to your twin's room, Minerva although still obviously half-asleep smiled your 2, 3 month old twins as her eyes rested on them. \"Hello my little darlings\" she says lifting them up one in each arm. \"They're almost as cute as their mother\" you say laying against her neck as the familiar sound of the 2 suckling fills your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little flatterer\" she replies before yawning, \"oh sorry\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, happy anniversary Minerva\" you whisper. Minerva gives off a quite excited squeal \"you remembered\" she says, she probably would have hugged you right then if she wasn't holding the twins, and as soon as she put them back down in their crib and was free that's exactly what she did. She hugged you to her cheek for a few seconds before giving you a gentle kiss, \"I still can't believe we had kids, let alone twins\" she says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, one in a million, shows what doctors know\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or your just one in a million\" Minerva replies which you had to admit caused you to blush a little. Minerva smiles down at you in her palm and she walks back into the bedroom, you had gotten used to getting up this early as Minerva had to be at her modeling job by 8:00. She promised when she started that there'd be no underwear or nude shots, but you still secretly stole and went over all the samples she brought home. You were only about 4 inches tall but you still worried about her. Minerva sets you down and gently strokes your back with 1 finger \"hey shouldn't I be giving you a brush down\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pooh to that, it's our anniversary\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your just going to go to work like that?\" you ask. She didn't look bad but she had well \"bed fur\" and you had to do a lot to keep from laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright you can straighten it, I swear you take more pride in my appearance than I do\" Minerva says. You'd never admit it but you kind of did, making sure Minerva looked her best was one of the few things you could do, so you did actually take real pride in keeping Minerva looking her best. Minerva grabs a brush from the dresser, discards the robe she wore around the house and lays out on the bed putting the brush down beside her. You still couldn't believe she had been able to stay in shape, and you still stared \"like what you see?\" Minerva says shaking her butt a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes\" you reply a bit flustered, you grab the brush and get straight to work to try to keep yourself from only thinking about well her cute butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know how hard it is to lose baby fat\" Minerva says like she hadn't said it a hundred times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I wouldn't have minded if you were a few pounds heavier\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I can't lose my gorgeous figure, why else would you stay with me?\" Minerva says jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I don't know, your impulsive attitude, that beautiful singing voice, the caring you showed me when we first met\" you reply. Minerva quieted until you jumped off her and put the brush down then she quickly rolled over and hugs you to her chest \"that's why I love you Jack, you love me for more than my body\" she says. The two of you just lay like that for a bit savoring the moment before Minerva lets you go. \"Now no peeking\" she says as she walks over to the dresser, although you couldn't help yourself you watched her walk, that beautiful golden tail swinging seductivley behind her. She quickly gets dressed and turns back smiling as she sees you don't even try to hide the fact you were watching \"little peeping tom\" she says picking you up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say, it's the best view in the world\" you reply and she smiles. She put you down on top of her dresser and you grabbed some clothes, although they were only doll's clothes and you know you felt Minerva's gaze on you as you changed. You turned to see her smiling up at you, \"now who's the peeping tom?\" you say climbing down onto her palm. Minerva laughs slightly and the two of you head out into the kitchen. You had a quick meal of toast and some eggs before Minerva left her job. However this day she said something different as she left \"goodbye my little love.\" This shouldnt' have been a big deal but you latched onto it and over-analyzed it all day, only stopping when Minerva came home for lunch and once her shift was over around 5:00. Dinner was a very simple fare, just steak and vegetables, thankfully the twins had been quite most of the day so you had been able to stew, or well maybe not so thankfully. Once your finished you sigh and Minerva looks down at you \"what's wrong?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, I've known you for a year and there's something wrong, what?\" Minerva asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you once your finished\" you say. Minerva nods and quickly finishes her supper before moving the two of you over to the bedroom so she could lay out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright what's wrong?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minerva, am I inadequate?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, we haven't well, done it since our wedding\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva smiles \"that's normal, most couples are more worried about their children rather than their sex lives\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minerva, I know this is kind of personal, but how big were they?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon?\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How big, were the guys you slept with before me? I don't care about the act, but just tell me please\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMInerva looks stunned for a few seconds then stops to think, after a few seconds she quietly replies \"your entire body is the smallest thing I've taken\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, I mean you had guessed that as you were only 4 inches tall. Still it just kind of hit you like a hammer blow, you just stared at her for a few seconds. Minerva looks at you and then lifts you up \"Jack I don'd care about that\" she says. You look away suddenly feeling asahamed and Minerva lifts you up to face level \"Jack, sex with you is the best I've ever had, not because of phsical please but because you love me inside and out, both figurativley and literally. Yes I had sex with those other men, but you are the only guy I have or ever will make love to, because you are the only one I have ever truly loved\" she says. You hugged Minerva's cheek tears and she gently rubbed against you, you were so caught up in the moment you didn't even notice Minerva's nimble fingers gently removing your clothes till she tugged at your shirt. You looked at her and she smiled that mischevious smile only she could pull off, \"take your shirt off love\" she says. You slowly take it off and she moves and puts it with your other clothes before pushing the whole pile off to a corner of the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva smiles and before you can stop her she licked your leg and said \"this is mine\", then she did the same with your other leg. She licked every part of you one piece at a time till you were covered in her spit and then she gently pushed the tip of her muzzle against your crotch \"and this is also mine\" she states with a final affectionate lick. \"Minerva what are you doing?\" you ask as she lets you sit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just claiming what's mine\" she says before kissing you her lips pressing against your body for a few seconds. She giggles afterwards and says with mock concern \"Oh Jack your all wet, well you'll just have to sleep very close to me to keep warm,\" She puts you down between her mounds and pulls the sheet up, she then holds you in place and turns over her whole body becoming a ball as she curls up. \"I love you Jack, never forget that\" she whispers to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too Minerva, and our kids\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and I love Chris and Cassy\" she replies before planting one final kiss on the top of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy aniversary\" you whisper up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy anniversary\" she replies, those words being the last you hear before you fall asleep her warm breath washing over you and her heartbeat soothing you. </span></div></div>",

On this particular day however, things are going to be taking a dramatic turn. For better or worse? We shall see. For it is on this day in the wee hours of the morning that a man is seen making a trek through the forest. He looks to be in his early twenties. He is tall with short, shimmering blonde hair and sky blue eyes. He is a bit on the scrawny side but from the looks of it he has great muscle definition. He seems to be wearing some sort of martial arts uniform. It's a white top with what looks japanese writing on the back, white pants and a black belt around his waist. Some of the forest's residents seem to be taking notice, but a look of determination on the young man's face keeps anyone from approaching him. He asks one of the residence \"You there, have you seen this person\"? He shows them a picture of the person in question. \"Y-yeah\" the person stammers \"I know him. He lives just down that way\". He says pointing the man in the right direction. \"Thanks\" said the man in a monotone voice as he continued walking. 'After all this time, can it be that I've finally found you'? he thinks to himself as he looks at the picture. \"I HAVE to know\" said the man to himself as he jumped up into air and started jumping from tree to tree in an effort to speed up his progress.<br>\r\n============================================================================ ==================<br>\r\n*Back at your place*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's at this time that Minerva has just got done feeding the twins and is getting ready to go to work. You are assisting her, giving her her routine brushing while making idle conversation. \"Yeah, I think it's almost time we started weening them too\" you say talking about your two children. \"Are you sure we shouldn't wait just a little bit longer\"? asks Minerva. \"Yeah, you know it'll just make it harder for them if we wait too much longer\" you reply. At this point the man in the white Gi (martial arts uniform) jumped down from the trees into the clearing near your house with a loud *THUD* as he landed. Inside the house the *THUD* was heard and you and Minerva look at one another \"What in the world was that\"? you ask \"I don't know\" replied Minerva as she went to look through the window at what had made the noise. As she looked out the window she saw the man walking casually towards the door. She said \"Jack honey, there's some tall man in white coming to the door\". \"Tall man in white\"? you question \"What does he look like\"? He kind of looks like you but with blonde hair and blue eyes\". She responds 'Blonde hair and blue eyes' you think to yourself 'It can't be'!</span></div></div>",

She opens the door to see the man standing on the porch with a rather serious look on his face. \"Can I help you\"? she asks. \"Yes, I'm sorry to bother you ma'am but I'm looking for-UGH\"! He stops abruptly after he sees you in Minerva's hand. You immediately recognize him. \"B-brother\"! says the man as he looks at you. Minerva's eyes widen in surprise. \"What did he just call you\"?!?! she asks in shock as she looks down at you. \"T-this is my b-brother\" you say stammering in response. At this point the man crumbles to his knees now looking at you face to face. His eyes swelling up with tears, \"Oh my God, Jack\" he whimpers \"All this time I've been searching for you, everyone else that knew you had given up and assumed the worst but I just knew it, I knew you wer alive\". Says the man now identified as Jack's brother, tears streaming down his face. \"WAAAHHH\"! the twins could be heard from outside crying due to all the comotion. \"Oh dear\" says Minerva \"I'm afraid I don't fully understand what's going on but please come in and have a seat\". She says kindly as you all adjourn to the living room. He takes a seat while Minerva places you on the coffee table and goes to the twin's room to tend to them \"I'll be right back\" she says. \"Ryan (That's the brother's name) how in the world did you find me\"? you ask. Ryan, wiping away the bulk of his tears answered saying \"After you dissappeared I dedicated everything I had to finding you, but just a few days ago I found a small hole with your wallet beside itin the woods by our house, so I put two and two together and jumped in. The rest is history\". \"But enogh about that\" he says \"How in the hell did you get so tiny\"? He asks in concern. As he asked Minerva made her way back into the room. \"Sorry about that. So who is this guy Jack\"? \"This is my older brother Ryan\" you respond \"Apparently he's been looking for me ever since I dissappeared from our world over a year ago. Ryan, this is Minerva....my wife\". *COUGH COUGH* YOUR WHAT\"!  He exclaims. His reaction was to be expected so you let him pull himself together and repeat yourself. \"This is my wife\" you say as you point at Minerva. Your brother examines her, looking her up and down. \"Well\" he says \"I can certainly see why you haven't been in any hurry to get home\". \"Sorry for being so rude, I'm Ryan\" he says as he extends his hand to shake hers. \"It's alright\" she replies \"I'm sure all of this has come as quite a shock to you so your reaction is understandable, I'm glad to know that Jack has such a loving brother\". She says as she shakes his hand. \"This is all well and good, but you still haven't answered my question\". He says to you. \"Oh, about my size. I really have no idea myself, I was like this the moment I entered this world\" you say. \"I wonder why your not\" you say to your brother.\"No idea\" he responds. \"At any rate I'm just happy to finally be reunited with my little brother\" he says as he grabs you and embraces you in a hug.</span></div></div>",

This causes you to grit your teeth angrily. \"Who's the flea\"? he questions. \"The name is Jack douchebag, and I'm her husband\" you say matter of factly. \"You gotta be kidding me\" he says. \"It's true Chad, now why dont you GET LOST\"! Minerva says in a loud tone. \"Don't be like that baby, whaddya say you dump the smallfry and get back together with a real man\" he says while flexing his arm muscle. \"BEAT IT\"! She shouts. \"I wasn't asking\" he says as he reaches for her wrist. \"Besides whose gonna stop me, shrimpy here\"? he asks sarcastically motioning towards you. Then from out of nowhere and as quick as lightning, Ryan grabs the wolf's wrist instead \"No, that would be me\" says your brother throwing a solid punch right in Chad's face, sending him flying back atleast ten feet and landing on the ground with a hard *THUD* \"Uuuhhh\" says Chad as he gets up rubbing his sore jaw. \"I don't know who you think you are, but you're gonna wish you hadn't done that\". He says slightly growling bearing his fangs. \"I'm Chad! the most popular and sought after wolf around. All the ladies want me and all the guys wanna be me. I'll make you wish you were never born\" he says as he draws out his claws. All the while Minerva is watching nervously, \"Should we help him\"? she asks you \"Nah, just watch hun\". \"Are we going to fight\"? your brother asks as he takes fierce looking fighting stance \"Or are you going to continue to waste my time\"? he asks with a smirk on his face. </span></div></div>",

As a matter of fact, your brother turns his back to Chad and walks over to you and Minerva. \"Can you hold on to this\"? He asks Minerva while taking off his top and handing it to her. \"Uh, sure\" she replies as she grabs it from him. \"Thanks\" he says \"I just dont want Spudz McKenzee over there to wrinkle it up\". pointing at Chad. This makes you and Minerva chuckle. Chad however isn't laughing, he is extremely pissed and it shows as he charges at your brother snarling. \"I'll kill you\"! he yell as he swings at him. Minerva covers her eyes expecting the worst, but hears nothing but a loud \"YIP\"! She opens her eyes to see that your brother has Chad in a solid wrist lock, and from the looks of it, Chad doesn't look to comfortable. \"Now now, we shouldn't fight this close to the house\" says Ryan. \"We might accidentally break something\" as he pulls the wolf away from the house still holding the wrist lock. Chad continues to whine and whimper as he is pulled away from the house into the clearing in front of it. At this point your brother releases his hold on Chad and he pulls away a couple of feet to regain his composure. \"Told you honey\" you say \"We've got nothing to worry about\". \"Are you sure\"? She asks. \"Just watch\" you reply. \"Your not bad for a puny human\" says Chad. \"Your the first one to ever actually hurt me, even so, I'm still gonna tear you to ribbons\"! \"Tell me something before we continue. How does it feel to live in complete ignorance of everything that's going on around you\"? Ryan asks smugly. Chad snarls at him. \"It must be nice\" your brother retorts. \"RAAWWRR\"!!! Howls Chad as he charges your brother yet again. All the while Ryan is just smirking at Chad's attempts, dodging every swing of his claws with ease. \"You have great strength but you swing too wildly, you are wasting all you energy. Try to focus your attacks or your never going to hit me\". Your brother says nonchalantly. \"SHUT UP DAMNIT\"!!! Yells Chad as he continues to swing wildly at Ryan. \"Oh, and one more thing\" he says. *THOOM* \"GWAH\"! utters Chad. \"You are leaving yourself wide open for my attacks\" says your brother as he connected a punch straight to wolf's stomach. At this point Chad staggers a few feet and falls to his knees holding his gut while still occasionally coughing. \"I'll *COUGH* make you *COUGH* pay\"! He says as he gets to his feet and pulls out a knife from his pocket. \"Gasp\" says Minerva as she looks down you, however, you are still completely calm. \"Well, this should be interesting\" you say. She just looks back at your brother with great concern in her eyes. \"Please\" says your brother. \"Don't take this any further, just walk away while you have nothing but a bruised ego. If this continues I wont be able to guarantee your safety\". \"Oh, not the tough guy you were five seconds ago huh\"? asks Chad arrogantly. \"Well lets see what you do to get out of this one\"! he yells as he charges yet again. *Sigh* \"I'm sorry, but you are being far too wreckless for my tastes\" says Ryan. He simply deflects the knife, again with great ease, taking it from Chad and holding the blade end between his index and middle fingers. *SNAP* is what you hear as you and Minerva see the blade fall to the ground in pieces. Chad, at this time, staggers back away from your brother, fearful for his life. \"There's no way your human\"! he exclaims. \"You gotta be some kinda monster\"! He screams as he runs into the forest in fear. \"\"Well\" says your brother. \"I may be stronger than a normal human, but to just flat out call me a monster. That's just rude\". He says as he looks back at the both you and smiles. You tell Minerva \"See, I told you there was nothing to worry about\". \"WOW\"! She exclaims. \"I guess you were right Jack\".</span></div></div>",

She asks. \u201cWell you see,family <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhas always been a touchy subject for both me and Ryan\u201d you reply. \u201cIt's true, Jack and I were <br>\r\n<br>\r\nabandoned by our parents when we were young and put up for adoption\u201d says Ryan. Gasp \u201cThat's <br>\r\n<br>\r\nawful\u201d she says. \u201cYes, I was only six years old and Jack was barely a year old himself\u201d says Ryan. \u201cI <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncan't even remember what our parents look like\u201d you say. At this point Minerva has begun to swell up <br>\r\n<br>\r\nin tears. \u201cThat's the saddest thing I've ever heard\u201d she said. \u201cThat's not even the worst of it\u201d says Ryan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't you think that's enough Ryan\u201d? You say. \u201cIf you say so, but don't you think you owe it to your <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwife to tell her about your past to help the both of you better prepare for the future\u201d? Asks Ryan. \u201cYes, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nplease honey tell me the rest. I want to know everything about you\u201d states Minerva. \u201cFine, but it only <br>\r\n<br>\r\ngets worse\u201d you say as you wave for your brother to continue, not wanting to tell the story yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter about five years or so, Jack and I were separated when I was adopted by a man named Khan Lee <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwho became my best friend and master\u201d. \u201cThat doesn't sound so bad\u201d said Minerva \u201cI thought you said <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe story got worse-\u201d \u201cIt did\u201d Ryan interrupts, \u201cFor Jack...you see, he wasn't as fortunate when it came <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntime for his adoption....He was adopted by a single older woman. She didn't adopt him for any other <br>\r\n<br>\r\nreason but the welfare checks he provided\u201d says Ryan. \u201cOh honey....I'm SO sorry\u201d she says crying <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhugging you to her chest. \u201cShe never even once told me she loved me\u201d you say holding back tears <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyourself. \u201cHave you forgotten the happy ending to our story already brother\u201d? Ryan inquires. \u201cNo *Sniff*, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'll tell her\u201d you say drying your tears. \u201cAfter seven years of torture with that woman, Ryan had turned <br>\r\n<br>\r\neighteen and found out about what was going on and came for me. We took the matter to court and <br>\r\n<br>\r\nafter he showed them all of the proper paperwork they granted him custody\u201d. \u201cOh that's incredible <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack\u201d! Minerva exclaimed. \u201cYes, and for four wonderful years I lived with my brother in a house my <br>\r\n<br>\r\nmaster and I had previously built\u201d says Ryan.  \u201cUntil the day you disappeared that is....I was <br>\r\n<br>\r\nheartbroken Jack, I thought I had lost you forever\u201d he says tearing up, but then smiles as he says \u201cbut <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've found you again\u201d. \u201cI'm sorry Ryan....I'm sorry I made you worry so much, but you know how love <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhas a way of changing your perspective\u201d you say as you go to nuzzle Minerva's cheek. \u201cYes, I <br>\r\n<br>\r\nunderstand\u201d he replies. \u201cI'm so happy for you and the family that you have made\u201d. \u201cI hope to have one <br>\r\n<br>\r\nof my own someday\u201d he says. \u201cSo Ryan, do you have a place to stay\u201d? Asks Minerva. \u201cHuh, Oh , no I <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsuppose I don't. I've done nothing but looked for Jack since I got here. I'm not sure what I am going to <br>\r\n<br>\r\ndo\u201d. \u201cWell I do\u201d you say speaking up. \u201cYou're staying with us, as long as your okay with it dear\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva says \u201cOf course\u201d \u201cAre you sure, I don't want to impose\u201d says Ryan. \u201cDon't be silly\u201d says <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva. \u201cWe have a guest bedroom and everything\u201d.

Minerva takes out hand towels, wash cloths, and lastly her panties and bras. Jack was starting to blush a little from the sight of her underwear. Minerva notices and she giggles. \"what is it little Jack? you like what I wear underneath my clothes?\" she asks with a sly smile. he looks on at the pile of underwear and cloth. 'well... they do look rather nice. I bet she would look pretty sexy with just those on.' he thinks to himself. after he doesn't answer she speaks up. \"well don't you? or do you think they are ugly?\" she asks in a stuck up tone of voice. \"no! I mean.. well they are.. umm.... uhhh...\" he stumbles on how he should respond. 'she is making this harder for me than it needs to be. what do I say?!' he wonders franticly searching for the right thing to say. \"yes?\" she asks curiously. \"the look really pretty and you'd probably look really... sexy in them.\" he says knowing there wasn't much he could say to help his cause. she blushes slightly and says to him, \"you think so? well why don't I try some on for you when we're done.\" says Minerva with a mischievous grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthey fold the clothes in silence when Minerva breaks the silence. \"so if I'm a cartoon where you come from, then what does that make you?\" she asks curious as to what he is and where he comes from. \"well I'm from earth.\" he says as truthfully as he can. \"we're already on earth punkin'. so you're from here on this planet then?\" she asks. \"well I wouldn't say this one. I'm probably from another dimension entirely. I just don't know for sure because I don't even know how I got her and why. honest.\" he says trying his best to convince her. \"that just sounds to strange but you wouldn't lie to me would you?\". \"of course not! that's all I know. I'm sorry I can't give you any more information other than that. I just don't remember. sorry.\" Jack says as he looks down in shame. his head is gently lifted up by her finger and he meets her caring gaze. \"its alright sweetie. I'm not going to be mad and I trust what you said. I believe you.\" she says softly before giving him a kiss. \"well I'd say were done. why don't I try on those panties and bras you're so fond of.\" she says with a slight tease. he smiles at her and blushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hmm.. what ones do I try on first?\" she says half asking and wondering to herself. \"well you could try those ones on first.\" Jack tells her, pointing to a pair of red and white panties with hearts on them and a matching bra with lace on it. \"my, do you have good taste.\" says Minerva complementing his decision. she slips out of her dress and is now in front of him in the pair of underwear she was already in. Minerva places it beside him. he stares at her half naked body. he notices her curvaceous body, large blonde tail curling around her legs down to the floor, her long blonde hair sleek and soft and her breasts sitting high on her chest, being pushed up by her bra. she looks at him with half shut eyes and a seductive grin. \"you ready?\" she asks in a seductive tone. \"y-yeah. sure, lets see what they look like on you.\" he says a little nervous. she was about to undress right in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack wonders if he should turn around or close his eyes to allow her some privacy. he does both and Minerva is a little shocked. \"what's the matter hon? don't you want to see?\" she asks unsure of what he is doing that for. \"well, I just thought you wanted some privacy.\" he says to her. \"oh well that's awfully sweet of you  to think of that but I'm not going to be mad if you watch. were in a relationship dear. this is just something we can do to bond. please turn around.\" he does but his eyes are still closed. \"open em. come on, don't be shy.\" she says in a sweet caring tone of voice. Jack slowly opens his eyes and she smiles brightly at him. he blushes bright red at the sight before him. Minerva is fully nude and is holding her bra in her right hand and her panties in the other. Minerva walks closer to the bed and stares down at him. \"well what do you think of me? am I as gorgeous enough for you?\" she asks with a seductive look. he's still blushing but responds by saying, \"umm... you certainly are really pretty.\" there was a bit of disappointment in her face now. \"you don't think I'm gorgeous or sexy? well, then maybe I shouldn't try these on for you.\" she says half serious and teasing him. 'uh oh! why did I say that?! maybe I should just tell her what she wants to hear.' he think to him self trying to figure out what to do so she still will do that for him. \"I-I didn't mean that Minerva. what I meant to say was that you look very sexy! yes, you have a great body. so sexy and your curves are so good. I'm becoming more attracted to you by the moment!\" he says hoping he said the right thing this time. her expression changes to one of lust and approval. \"that's more like it. I'm glad you think so cutie! now I'll put them on for you. you've earned it!\" Minerva slips on her panties and turns around in a circle slowly so he can see all of them. then she puts on her bar concealing her large, bouncy breasts. the bra pushes them up nicely on her chest. \"so what do you think? great aren't they?\" she asks nonchalantly. \"you... you look amazing!  they really look nice on you Minerva.\" says Jack hardly able to contain himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva gives him a wink and says, \"all for you sweetie. I'm glad you think so. come here!\" she brings him up to her chest and hugs him gently. Minerva sighs softly and tells Jack, \"I'm so glad I finally have someone to spend some time with. that and you're just so darn cute.\" Minerva is stroking his back while she holds him to her chest while Jack is having the time of his life. he can't believe this is happening! the girl of his dreams is starting to like him more and more. who would have thought that this would happen to him. she lays down on her bed and releases him. he sits up and looks into her big back eyes. Minerva is starting to fall for him. he's attractive from his size and his cute looks but he is genuinely nice. that and he hasn't taken advantage of her at all yet. she wonders if she goes for a nap with him, will he try to take advantage of her? Minerva yawns and rubs her eyes. \"mmm, Jack I'm getting a little sleepy. why don't we go for a nap together.\" she says in a sleepy voice. \"sure. I'm feeling a little tired too.\" he responds. Jack lays down on her breast and Minerva brings her hand down on him, holding him gently like a blanket. Minerva closes her eyes and in a few moments she is asleep. Jack on the other hand was kind of fibbing. he was still wide awake but didn't want to leave Minerva and be all alone. then a few moments it hits him. 'if she is truly sleeping then this might be the best time for me to take some time and have my own fun with her while she is unaware.' he thinks to himself but then his good side kicks in and tells him to calm down and stay put. he knows he shouldn't take advantage of her but his urges are starting to get the best of him.

With a very angry and annoyed face. First you freeze in fear as you use the deer in headlights strategy. However you start moving when you see Minerva\u2019s foot raise up into the air, intending on stomping you. You run for your life as you feel the impact of her stomp on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet back here you little Stinker!\u201d Minerva screamed as you assume she's giving chase to you. You go to run under the couch, seeing that she won't be able to get you there. However her large white furry foot/paw stopped you. Crashing in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStopped You!!\u201d Minerva yelled in victory as you waste no time turning around. However you didn't make that much distance as her other foot stopped you in your path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRun all you want, Your too small to get away\u201d Minerva said, that however didn't stop you as you try to run another direction. However your stopped by Minerva once again by her foot, this time instead of just blocking your path, it came down directly on top of you, pinning you down to the ground. You struggle as her Toes were directly above you. Minerva smiling evilly lowered her big Toe onto your face as you start suffocating. Losing breath you start struggling even more, Thankfully Minerva lifted her toe from you as you take a breath of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour lucky I'm letting you live, if i wanted to i could stomp out you life right now\u201d Minerva threatened as stares down to you with a look of disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI Swear this is not what it loo-\u201d You were cut of mid sentence as she silenced you with her big toe once again . This time with it only covering your mouth, not your eyes or nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't want to hear your lies. You made the mistake of peeing on me, so i think I'm going to make you pay for that by keeping you as my new _________</span></div></div>",
