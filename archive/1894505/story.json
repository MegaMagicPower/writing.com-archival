The lady had turned up, with a bruise on her head and a crazed look in her sapphire eyes, demanding to see the head witch- whoever she was! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please have mercy! My only son will die! He didn\u2019t mean to insult the sea god- he thought he didn\u2019t exist. It was a mistake!\"<br>\r\n\"But I don't know any head witch- you have the wrong guy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! Please I know you're her secret keeper! PLEASE LET ME SEE HER!!!!!!!!!!\" the lady screamed, now in hysteria!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m no-one's secret keeper! Well except maybe Natasha's; but that's because I'm her best friend...\" Nicholas said; turning to face Natasha- who was fiddling with an oak leaf from the tree next to their classroom<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was smiling rather oddly. \"Natasha- you aren't the head witch are you!?\" He asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I am?!\" she simply asked. Nicholas stared at her, then back at the lady who didn't seem to notice his exchange with Natasha. \"She can't see me unless you let her to!\" said Natasha, noticing his puzzlement at her ignorance of the exchange<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that why she's screaming so much?!\" he asked Natasha who nodded and said, \"I guess you can let her see me. I'll set her right!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicholas turned to the lady. She looked at him with tear stained eyes. Pointing to Natasha he said, \u201cThere\u2019s your head witch! Plead with her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes widened in fright and recognition the lady got down on her knees. But Natasha shook her head. The lady looked down for a moment; then got up and left. Nicholas stared after her and then back at Natasha, who said \u201cMY no is no!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Since when were you the head witch? when did you become a witch in the First place? What do you mean invisible to everyone? and what secret keeper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathasha didn't reply or look up from her book.

Nathasha knew so many others- older and more able for the task... but no!! It was Nicholas who was destined to be her protector... a fate he did not choose...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"if only I had been more careful!! None of this would have had to happen!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathasha was named as the head witch at birth- which was something unusual for the community.. For all generations before her, the head witch would live for at least a 150 years and rule for 90 years after which, all the mystics would gather at a place for the naming ceremony.. in which the fates would reveal who the next head would be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbut that was not the case ... The last head witch had died in unusual circumstances at the age of 40 (what the circumstances of his death were- was never told to Nathasha!!) There was a span of two years of utter chaos among the mystics before Nathasha was born- and the fates deemed her the new head witch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathasha grew up with her parents (both tutors of magic and mystics) being trained to rule and judge the people... Her First protector was her music instructor, Mr. Andrews. As all protectors before him, Mr Andrews could not wield magic nor knew of the existence of the mystics- until his charge (Nathasha) was named as the head witch!! (this was to ensure that the secret keeper is never tempted to harm his/her charge and claim the title for himself/herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathasha's Parents, Mr and Mrs. James and Racheal Wordsmith, did their best to support Mr. Andrews with his task. teaching him the duties he was to perform.. Telling him the stories of various Secret keepers of the past and all.... Mr. Andrews had very little trouble with his charge- she grew up obedient, powerful, wise and yet extremely kind and beautiful. he was extremely fond of Nathasha whom he considered as his surrogate daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were fine till Nathasha turned 17....an Age just a year away from her being legally eligible to rule her subjects... Mr. Andrews grew more and more quieter with each day... began spending a lot of time at home with his violin than his usual time with Nathasha as she took her magic classes... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen one fine September morning, Mr. Andrews came home to take Nathasha out on a field trip.. \"just round your favourite hang-outs- exactly as how when you were a kid!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't a field trip... he took her to the gardens of Ged (a garden field accessible only to magical folks and secret keepers!!). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathasha had felt there was something off... but her faith in Mr. Andrews caused her to not question him..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nuntil he came...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathasha knew him from her childhood..  he haunted her dreams every night... he was nothing more than a shadow... until he catches hold of your fears.. then he grows.. to become a cloud of darkness... Neither hope nor light or bravery too can save you from him... he intensifies your fears and grows with them.... Dawn of the Darkness, Throne of Death, Shadows - he went by many names....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you would protect her\" Mr. Andrews had said to the darkness.... Which was when Nathasha realized that it was a trap!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Andrews, we have to get away from here!!\" Nathasha had pleaded... tugging at her mentor and friend !! But Mr. Andrews didn't budge, \"he said he would protect you Nathasha!! he promised me he would\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Andrews !! Philip !! please listen to me!! it's a trap- we have to leave!!\" Then, when Nathasha had taken his first name, Philip Andrews looked back at her and realized the grave mistake that he had made- revealing her to the Shadows!! Filled with guilt, he allowed himself to be filled with fear too... made himself a prey to the Shadows thirst.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all its strength, the shadows can consume just a single being at once... And with the fear and guilt in Philip growing ... the shadows took him... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nleaving Nathasha alone... !! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand she had been alone- leaving her parents home, travelling from place to place... until the fates brought her to the school.. to her new secret keeper... to Nicholas...!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely able to hold back her tears, Nathasha away from Nicholas, who said quietly, \"I'm ready to listen!! What is going on??\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was tricked by the evil Guild of Logic and Science.\"  Her eyes glowed red, but she brought herself back under control.  \"At the moment each of them were killed, their powers and skills were transferred to us.  You are the Secret Keeper, my protector.  You are descended of other secret-keepers.  Your parents should have told you when the amulet began to glow.  That is how they knew you'd been blessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're a nut.  I don't have any amulet.  I'm just a nerd in high school who thought a pretty girl actually wanted to be his friend.  Wow, was I stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nicolas turned and started walking, but Natasha grabbed his shoulder and spun him around.  He knocked her hands away and stared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I was drawn to you.  My family moved over three hundred miles because you are mine.  Didn't you feel the connection?  You walked right up to me on my first day of school and walked me to class.  Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I walked you to class because Mrs. Hermeties told me to.  It was my job to escort you.  I got credit for one hour of community service for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Natasha pushed her long, brown locks from her face.  \"It changes nothing.  The old woman did not recognize me until you allowed it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How could you be invisible?  People see you all the time at school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She saw me, but she didn't recognize me.  I was just another girl, sitting under an oak tree reading a book, until you told her who I was.  In fact, you shouted it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The bell rang.  Lunch was over and all of the students who'd come out to enjoy the last of the warm, autumn days headed back inside.
