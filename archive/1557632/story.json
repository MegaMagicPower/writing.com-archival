Ookami was in clear view now and keeping his pace, \"weird\" thought Kiba. Ookami jumps and tackles Kiba before he could think anything else. <br>\r\n\"Ahh, get off you..\" Kiba was cut off by the fact that Ookami had bit his shoulder. Naruto kicked Ookami and used his shadow clone jutsu, Hinata started checking the mark<br>\r\n\"Naruto we have to get him back to the village\" Hinata said \"This bite is bleeding bad\"<br>\r\n\"Fine\" Naruto agreed<br>\r\nBefore thay got to the leaf village Kiba chacked the wound again. the bleeding had stopped \"What\" he thought to himself \"It was pouring blood earlier? Uhh... maybe I should go see Tsunade\" But his stomach growled too and he felt very tired. He could always tell hinata or maybe just Ignor the bite and train. What should he do</span></div></div>",

The best he could do at the moment was to seek medical attention , if the wound had just stopped pleading on its own that could have ment that it had been infected. When he arrived he when straight for the hokages office where he knew he would find tsunate working on a mountain of paperwork. He walked in in a calm manner posited to his wild nature that he was always known for, he stood before the hokage and began to explain the situation.<br>\r\n\"I see.\" said lady Tsunate \"that bite on your shoulder is indeed very serious but the fact that it is stating to heal rapidly is strange like nothing I'veever seen before. The best i can do for now without any analysis is to patch it up and i'll see how you do tomorrow morning\" with that he walked out of the building with a bad feeling about the bite on his shoulder. The only thing left to do was go home and try to get some rest. looking up at the sky he saw the moon coming out from behind the clouds it seemed nearly seemed to be nearly full. he tried to ignore it by just going home and getting some sleep. By the time it hit midnight tossed and turned in his bed sweating cold clenching his teeth and fists as the wound began to seal up .</span></div></div>",

The ground blurred and sound became overwhelmingly high, causing him to gain a headache in the process. Naruto's voice, which is annoying at times, became a loud boom followed by Hinata's butterfly soft voice. Akamaru's whine was also soft but slightly higher than Hinata's voice, and Kiba could have sworn that the whine translated into a word. His name to be exactly, followed by utter blackness.<br>\r\n*                                                                           *                                                                      *                                                                                     *<br>\r\n   Kiba awoke the next day with slight stiffness in his shoulder and a blinding headache. He tried to pull back his eyelids to see where he was, for all he heard was a slight shuffle and, whine every now and then. When his eyes opened to a white blinding light he instantly shut them again.<br>\r\n   \"Kiba,\" a soft whining voice said with concern. A little amount of pressure was followed by the voice and another whine.<br>\r\n   \"Akamaru, is that you boy,\" Kiba said with his throat completely dry. The white light found a way past his eyelids to sear his eyes, and his throat became more dry with each breath he took. It remained that way for a few minutes but it felt like hours to Kiba, and then the hospital lights went out. With that, Kiba opened his eyes to see Akamaru laying on top of him with a worried expression in his eyes. <br>\r\n   \"Akamaru...\" Kiba looked around the room, seeing that it was just an ordinary hospital room with a balcony. <br>\r\n   'The lights must be on a timer,\" Kiba thought as he got up and throw the blankets off to walk to the balcony. Akamaru moved out of the way before blankets where thrown on top of him and followed Kiba out to the balcony after. The moon in Kiba's vision swelled and expanded to it's utter fullest with the sun's set. Kiba couldn't stand to be in the staying still any more, and jumped down to the bottom floor. He was running before his feet even touched the ground, churning the air beneath his feet causing the earth to move a little when he did touch it. Akamaru followed Kiba much slower than normal, for it is usually Akamaru that is in front when they run. Tonight however Kiba just ran as if a demon where after him, not caring if anyone else where around to witness him leaving the village and running to nowhere. When Kiba finally stopped to breath and take-in his surrounding, pain eloped his form. It started in his chest and worked its way outward toward his limbs. He could hear his bones cracking in several places, and feel his insides shift around. He felt like throwing up any food within his stomach but just dry heaved instead. His hospital clothes started to shred as his body expanded into a new form, larger and more powerful than his human form. The wolf now in control of the form it held but just for this single solitary night. The wolf smelled another cousin close by and waited for it to show its self. It was Akamaru, he watched Kiba transform into a wolf much stronger and bigger than himself. <br>\r\nWhat will the wolf that is also Kiba do?<br>\r\nWill it attack Akamaru?<br>\r\nOr will it befriend him and explain what has happened to Akamaru's master and friend?</span></div></div>",
