They got here very early because none of them could sleep the night before because of their excitement!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was Randy, the confident one, Ken, who usually fussed over what was happening but usually deferred to what Ken wanted in the long run, then there was Jeff, the quiet but manipulative one, John was immature, and Paul was just shy and quiet no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went on several rides, but it was still early. Then John saw some girls standing in one of the lines. \"Hey! Let's go on that ride!\" Of course, as a teen boy, he was looking at just the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Ken said, \"You just want to talk to the girls! That is a girl's ride. It is not a thrill ride! It won't be fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff liked to tweak Ken when he could, \"So? It might be fun if we meet some pretty girls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, all but Randy agreed to go on the ride. It was actually boring to them until they got to a dark tunnel. It was pitch black and they couldn't see their hand in front of their face. Then suddenly, lights were flashing and they were soon dizzy and disoriented! It was do deeply disturbing that they got off the ride and were outside without knowing how they go there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had been the last ones off. As they were trying to get their heads together, Randy walked up to them and said, \"Hi! My name is Randy. Did you girls happen to notice four guys getting off of that ride?</span></div></div>",

Each wanted to scream as they realized what had happened, but they found they couldn't. When they finally caught their breath though, Ken, who was not a cute brunette in a jean skirt said, \"Randy? Randy! It is us! I am Ken, or at least, I was!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandy shook his head, and somehow he knew this pretty girl was telling the truth! \"How? How did this happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn, now a pretty blonde girl said, \"Well duh! It was the ride! We need to talk to someone and get them to change us back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandy frowned as he said, \"Good luck with that. They closed it after you got into the line. You were the last ones I saw come out.\" They did look, and sure enough, there was nobody who to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen was ready to cry, \"Now what can we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandy could tell how upset she was and felt the need to comfort her, \"Don't worry Abby. They can't keep it closed all day. It is still early. We can find something to do and we will check back before lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen looked up, \"What did you call me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandy blushed, \"Um, sorry Ken. I don't know why, but Abby came out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen shook her head. \"Its okay Randy. The strangest thing is it felt right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they all agreed to move on. The biggest difference between the girls being their hair. While John was a natural blonde, and Ken had long chestnut hair, Jeff had long, dirty-blonde hair and Paul had short brown hair similar to Ken's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings got stranger as the time passed. Ken got shorter, but by lunch, the other three girls were much smaller, and looking younger. Then Paul came up to Ken and said, \"I am scared. May I hold you hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen looked down at her, \"Um, sure Erin.\" Somehow they both felt better that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ate lunch, and it was only after they were done that the realized that they had ordered three kid's meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked at each other. Randy finally said what they were thinking, \"What is going on?\"</span></div></div>",

How much farther could this go mommy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen/Abby smiled at her, \"Don't worry honey. I sure we can fix this.\" Then she stared at Randy. \"Did she just call me mommy and I just call her honey?\" He nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Randy snapped at John, \"Sandy! Stop teasing Erin! Leave your sister alone!\" They all froze. They stared at each other a whiled and realized that Randy and Ken/Abby seemed a bit older also, like in their 20's now. Randy said, \"Let's go and fix this soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, they had traveled far from the ride that had changed them. Randy and Abby looked at the map and found the shortest way. As they walked, the three girls seems to get younger by the minute. They passed some kiddy rides and just like that, John/Sandy said, \"I want to go on that ride first!\" Before anyone could say a word, she bolted for the line!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby groaned and pointed at Jeff, \"Sharon, you stay here with your dad!\" She did not even realize what she had said until she was almost caught up with John/Sandy. When she got there, John/Sandy threw a tantrum until Abby was so embarrassed that she gave in, \"Okay, but only if you take your little sister on the ride too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn/Sandy looked at Paul/Erin, who was now getting quite small and sucking her thumb and groaned, Aw mom! What if she messes her diaper or something on the ride?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only then that they realized that you could see a bit of a diaper bulge showing under her cute little sun dress if she moved the right way. Abby was firm, \"We need to get moving. Either take her on the ride or we leave now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn/Sandy was not happy, \"Oh, okay.\" But she was not happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandy walked up to Abby, \"I hope you don't mind, but since Sandy and Erin were going on a ride, I told Sharon she could go on one too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at him, but then said, \"No, I suppose that is fair.\" She could have screamed on the inside because what she was thinking was, 'He is a good dad.' Though that was not the part that bothered her. The bad part was when she thought, 'I wish I could give him a boy.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the girls got off of the rides, Jeff/Sharon looked to be about seven and had long, straight dirty blonde hair to her waist and was wearing purple shorts and a pink t-shirt that said 'Girl Power!'. John/Sandy looked about four and was wearing a blue skirt and a powder blue t-shirt with pink writing that said, 'Daddy's Princess' and had wavy bright blond hair just past her shoulders, and Paul/Erin looked to be about two-years-old with short brown hair and was wearing a pink sundress with Ariel the mermaid on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby gasped and said, \"Randy! Look!\"</span></div></div>",

Randy quickly looked at his left hand, and sure enough, he had one on as well! He picked up John/Sandy and said, \"You carry Erin! We have got to get back to that ride now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before he could stop her, Jeff/Sharon had run to another ride. As soon as he put John/Sandy down, she ran to a different one. Paul/Erin was fussing and went over to a stroller that they suddenly knew was theirs! She sat down and fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen/Abby said, \"Randy. What are we going to do? I don't want to be a wife and mother! I am supposed to be a guy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was almost in tears. Randy hugged her tight and said, \"I know. It will be alright Abby.\" Suddenly, Randy felt something strange in his crotch. It was an intense sexual release, as though he had just dumped his load, and the sexual feelings were totally focused on Abby. He heard Abby gasp. He looked down at her, \"Abby. Something strange just happened. I don't know what it was.\" He could tell his pants were not wet, so was it real?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen/Abby gasped, \"Oh my! I, I felt something too. It felt like, well,\" She had felt like she had been penetrated, and then felt something warm enter deep inside of her. She was not sure what disturbed her more. The fear that she knew what that warm feeling inside of her was since it was now leaking from her pussy, or the fact that she loved the way it felt! \"I, um, I need to use the restroom.\" She had to go clean up! When she did, she confirmed that what was leaking out of her could only have come from her husband. \"Husband?\" She wondered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got back, Randy had corralled the girls, who seemed to have stopped changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby took Erin back into the bathroom to change her diaper, and when she came out, Randy looked at her and said, \"As if we need it, we have more problems.\"</span></div></div>",

Her abdomen was protruding out in a way that could only indicate one thing! \"I look, well, I mean, well it looks\u2026\" She could not say it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandy said, \"You look like you are pregnant Abby.\" <br>\r\nKen/Abby was in shock a moment. Then she began to move fast. She strapped Erin into the stroller where she was sleeping. Then she looked up at Randy, \"You hold the girl's hands and let's go! We need to get back to that ride!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen/Abby was thankful that her pregnancy did not seem to progress any further. Somehow along the way she knew that she was almost four months pregnant. The girls whined, but Randy drug them along, carrying both of them at one point. It was getting late when they got to the place where the ride was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them but Erin, who was still sleeping, stared. Where the ride had been was now a bunch of souvenir shops and food vendors with an open seating area! It was Jeff/Sharon who spoke first, \"Does this mean we are going to stay like this? Are you going to stay my mommy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey could not talk. Finally Randy said, \"Come on honey. I think we need to head back to the room and figure out what is going on.\" He put his arm protectively around Ken/Abby, who did not protest, but only nodded her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room they went back to was different. It was a suite with two larger bedrooms with king size beds. From the luggage they could tell that one room was for the girls, and the other for Randy and Ken/Abby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls jumped around on their bed for a while. John/Sandy said, \"It is not so bad being a girl. I kind of like it. Sides, I get to play again!\" But soon, all of them were soundly sleeping. Randy closed their door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at Ken/Abby, who looked very upset. He held her tight, and she held him back. \"I am sorry Abby. I know this has to be hard on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, she said, \"It is not your fault. You were the one who tried to talk us out of going on that ride.\" She hugged him tighter, \"But I have a feeling this is permanent. There is no going back.\" She looked up at him, \"And if I have to be pregnant, I think I would really like to know what it feels like to, well, to do what a couple does to get pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandy said, \"Are you sure? I mean, really sure?\" He desperately wanted to make love to his new wife, but he loved her too much to force her. When she nodded, that was all that it took. He began to kiss her passionately! And to his surprise, she was kissing him back! He picked her up and carried her into their bedroom. He made sure to lock the door just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour of intense passion, he was laying on his back, and Abby had her head on his chest. She had enjoyed what they did so much that she ceased to think of herself in any male terms anymore and she said so, \"If you can make me feel like that every time, I not only am glad I am a woman now, I don't even mind that I am pregnant!\" She stroked his chest, \"I just hope I can give you a boy this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stroked her head and smiled as he said, \"If not, I guess we will just have to keep trying!\" He was a little surprised that she did not protest that idea the way he thought she would!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they snuggled in bed, there was the knock of small hands on the bedroom door, and attempts to open the locked door.</span></div></div>",

Doesn't it bother you at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled, \"Yes, at first, a lot, but now now. My biggest complaint is the lines in the bathroom that come from women needing to sit down to pee. I was really missing being able to use a urinal when I had to stand in line!\" She kissed her husband again, \"But now I am glad to sit down to pee, because it means I have what I need to be with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore knocking made them get moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the door, Jeff/Sharon and John/Sandy were the ones calling.

We need to find that ride and get changed back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn/Sandy stopped as she heard her sister, \"Stop doing what? What do you think they are doing? I thought they were just asleep like we were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff/Sharon shook her head, \"No, they were doing, well, what mommies and daddies do to make babies.\" As she spoke, her head tingled. Some things were getting harder to remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn/Sandy said, \"Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff/Sharon found that she could not specifically remember. Frustrated and unwilling to admit that, she said, \"You know. They take their clothes off and kiss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn/Sandy said, \"Ewwwwwww! That sounds gross! Why would they do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was becoming clear to Jeff/Sharon that they were loosing information the longer they were in these bodies. She asked John/Sandy, \"I, I don't know. But it makes the mommy have a baby, and if we don't change back, we could be mommies some day!\" She saw John/Sandy shrug, \"Don't you want to be a boy again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn/Sandy shrugged again, \"I don't member what it was like. If I cut my hair an dress like a boy, will that make me a boy then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff/Sharon said, \"No! Boys have a thing between their legs that let's them stand up to pee. Girls don't have that so we have to sit down to pee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn/Sandy looked like she remembered something, \"Oh, yeah. That was nice, but girls have nicer clothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff/Sharon saw what was happening to them and began to pound on the door again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, Randy came out and Jeff/Sharon said, \"Daddy! We need to get back to the park and look for that ride before it is too late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, \"We will honey. And we will let any of you girls go on the ride if you want to, if we can really find it again, but your mommy wants to stay the way she is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff/Sharon looked shocked and said, \"NO! She can't! What if we all have to go in for it to work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn/Sandy said, \"So we stay girls. Is that bad? I no care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul/Erin was giggling and clapping her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandy held her, \"Let's find the ride first sweetie. If we do, we will discuss it then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby came out about then and the got the girls ready and went back to the park. On the way, John/Sandy saw some fairy costumes with a wand, fake wings and a tiara and she insisted on getting them. Randy and Abby bought a set for each of the girls, though they kept the wings off of Paul/Erin because of the stroller. Little did they know the wands had real magic in them!</span></div></div>",

That is, until she was in line for a rid with John/Sandy that they had insisted going on. There were two boys behind them that were bullies. The bullied all the kids around them, including the girls. They kept teasing John/Sandy and Jeff/Sharon about being little fairies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff/Sharon had enough, but the boys were far to big to consider fighting in her small, weak, girl body. She waved her wand as she mocked them, \"I wish that every time either of you are mean to someone or disobeyed your parents, you would get more and more weak and girly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys laughed. One said, \"Keep talking like that you little fairy and I will pluck you wings!\" The other shoved Jeff/Sharon. Just like that, both of them found their hair sprouting out until they had luscious long hair to their waist, and then the shorts they were wearing turned into short skirts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked at each other and at themselves. The bigger boy got mad, \"I don't know how you did this you twerp, but undo it right now or else!\" He grabbed Jeff/Sharon by the arm. At the same time John/Sandy said, \"Hey! Leave my sister alone you bullies!\" She tried to do something but the other boy grabbed her arm and twisted, then pushed her away so hard she fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, changes began to happen. They boys t-shirts turned into a halter top on the one and a crop top on the other, both very feminine. Both found themselves suddenly wearing high heels, though they did not notice at first because the shrank by the same amount. The bigger boy did notice that he suddenly did not have the strength to keep his strong grip on Jeff/Sharon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy said, \"It must be that wand! Give me that you little fairy jerk!\" Jeff/Sharon resisted him as they struggled for the wand. The other boy struggled to keep John/Sandy out of the fray. The more they fought, the more feminine the boys got, and with it they became smaller and weaker until both had the appearance of cute girls around the age of five or six. At that point they realized that they were doing and stopped, but it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey now both had to look 'up' at Jeff/Sharon. They checked under their skirts and found that they were still boys, though nobody could tell from looking at them now. The one said, \"No! Okay! You win! We are sorry! Please change us back!\" The looked embarrassed, \"Boys can't go around dressed like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn/Sandy giggled, \"You are right. Let me see if I can fix that!\" She waved her wand and there was a sparkle around the boys. If possible, their skin and hair looked softer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger one grabbed at his, well now her, crotch, \"She turned us into real girls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both begged, \"Please change us back! Please! Please! Please!\" They were crying like girls now too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff/Sharon said, \"You can change yourself back. You said you were sorry to us, but when you apologize to everyone you were mean to here today, you will change back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new girls gasped. \"But how can we find them all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff/Sharon smiled, \"That is your problem, but you better start soon if you hope to find them at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new girls ran away, not realizing that their clothing and behavior were slowly becoming more and more girly as they went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn/Sandy smiled, \"These wands work for real! Let's have some more fun with them!\"</span></div></div>",

In her baby voice she squealed, \"Real!\", as she waved the wand around. Suddenly, the characters in the parade began to change. For some it was not a big change. The Cinderella character reshaped into a living version of the movie Cinderella, and the same with the Snow White character Others like Mickey and Mini turned into real, part-human, part-mouse versions of the characters, as the beast turned into a real beast and Hook turned into a real captain Hook. It might not hove been so bad, but the Mini character was a thin teen boy who now found himself a female mouse, and the male who was in the Princess Fiona costume because of the large head and heavy costume who ended up a very beautiful and very female version of a real Fiona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Erin did not like some of the monsters, so she waved her wand again and yelled, \"No bad. Princesses!\" At that point, the guy who had moments before been a real ogre found himself a very lovely Mulan, captain Hook became Ariel, and the beast became Princess Jasmine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was panic among the characters at first, but then John/Sandy smiled and said, \"Good job sis! Let me fix the rest!\" With a wave of her wand, nobody cared about the changes anymore, and like a movie scene, all of the new princesses began to sing and dance and continue with the parade. Even the past males like Fiona, Mulan, Ariel and Jasmine found themselves unable to stop from dancing, sining and prancing around in very feminine and princess-like ways, blowing kisses to the people they passed. Jeff/Sharon wondered if the Fiona character would turn into an ogre later or not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls had some more fun with the wands, giving not only themselves beautiful princess costumes, but also everyone around them except for their 'daddy'. That might have been okay except that they did not care who, so many men and boys found themselves in beautiful gowns and dresses, with well done makeup and lipstick that would just return even if they tried to take it off, as long as they were anywhere near Disney World.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandy and Abby sighed, \"Come on girls. We have not found the ride yet.\"</span></div></div>",

Randy and Abby were in love, and Erin had quietly decided that she wanted to start life over as a girl, especially if Randy and Abby were her daddy and mommy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff/Sharon and John/Sandy however were not so sure. But it was fun right now, and the magic wands made it more interesting. In fact, Jeff/Sharon used the wand to produce a hand-full of lollipops. Half pink and half blue, which she offered to anyone they passed along the way. She giggled as the first couple to try them found out they were very special. The woman had chosen a blue one and the man a pink one. As they walked and ate them, they began to shrink. Soon, where the woman had been, there was a little boy dressed as Captain Hook, and where the man had been was a little girl in a Tinkerbell outfit. They looked at each other in shock, but before they could scream, something tingled in their heads, and instead, they smiled and went away skipping and holding hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of the delayed effect, Randy and Abby were not aware that a wave of children, from toddlers to pre-teens, were running around behind them. The girls on the other hand were having a great time handing out the lollipops! They especially loved it when they gave two, tough looking, redneck men some pink lollipops, and watched them turn into twin, five-year-old girls with long brown hair and dressed in Cinderella gowns, right down to the glass slippers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family finally found the area where the ride had been, but as they found before, it was no longer there. However, there was a new ride for children that was not there before. After a long discussion, Jeff/Sharon and John/Sandy decided to go on the ride and risk what happens next.</span></div></div>",

He felt the words on his lips, his eyebrows raised for maximum bewilderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, his hands went to rest on his hips as he fixed Randy with a playful grin. \"Nobody like that. Are you sure they're the people you should be looking for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blinked in surprise. His voice was higher in pitch and there was such a distinctly flirtatious tone to it. Did that come from his mouth?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn brushed long blonde hair out of his eyes. He didn't remember it getting this long. He glanced at the brunette next to him. Wasn't Jeff supposed to be there? Yet instead of asking questions, John leaned on Not-Jeff's shoulder to peer at Randy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! We're a looooooot more interesting to talk to. Or not talk to. Either's fine by me as long as you're fun~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandy smiled nicely at the two girls. They were pretty stunning. \"You definitely seem like interesting people to me. I wouldn't mind talking more if I wasn't waiting for my friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul straightened his glasses, which he could've sworn weren't nearly this powerful a few minutes ago. He glanced down at himself to see that he was wearing a huge sweater, which covered almost everything about himself. He got the sense that something was different below that sweater but he felt a distinct sensation that it wouldn't be appropriate to remove the sweater. As if it protected from being leered at or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff and John were supposed to be in front of him, yet a brunette and a blonde were flirting heavily with Randy. The brunette who wasn't Jeff wore an outfit that looked deliberate and manipulative in a way he was struggling to define. She wore a short skirt, but not too short, wore a top with some noticeable cleavage, but not too much cleavage, and what make-up he could see was placed to emphasize the lips, for reasons he couldn't understand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde, who wasn't John but was standing where John should be, had this energetic and girly spirit to her. Long hair, more overt clothing, and a purse with a whole batch of Disney pins attached to every free space. She screamed immature, but in a different way than John was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh trust us, we've met before,\" grinned Jeff. He didn't know why he was teasing Randy like this and, more importantly, why Randy was buying it. \"But we can reintroduce ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff pointed to himself. \"I'm Jenny.\" He gestured to the blind John. \"This is Jordan.\" He gestured behind them towards Paul. \"That's Paula.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul squeaked when Randy looked at him, hiding himself among his hair. His hair had gotten longer too...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the worrywart is Kendra.\" Ken had been struggling to pay attention, puzzled as he was by his own changes in appearance. His hair was still short, but it was styled into a ponytail. He wore practical jeans, but his t-shirt had become a tank top. His chest was substantially bigger and it was only now that the others were realizing the newfound girth of their chests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen blew a hair from his eyes, glancing at Randy without much amusement. \"Are you guys done playing around? He probably fed that line to every girl that walked through before us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandy lifted up his hands in mock surprise. \"Honest to goodness, just looking for my friends. So you haven't seen them?\" Randy was starting to suspect they had snuck away with some other girls they'd run into.</span></div></div>",

His hand reached forward to stroke Randy's chest, give him a little excited jolt. Jeff glared at the movement. How come \"Jordan\" got to make the first move? Randy approached him first. He began to reach over herself, determined to be the first to tease and toy with Randy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly for Ken to suddenly grab John and Jeff's hands. \"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, haven't seen them, pal. We really gotta get going to the next ride.\" And ignoring the girls' protests, Ken dragged John and Jeff off, Paul following quickly behind. Sighing, Randy focused back on the ride. Where were they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only within the safety of the ice cream shop that Jenny and Jordan were finally released from Kendra's grasp. \"What the hell was that for? We were having fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen rolled his eyes. \"Not my kind of fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan pouted. \"Randy had no clue! We really could have made him blush.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny huffed. \"She's just jealous because Randy didn't even look at her. It's cause of that attitude she's got that she doesn't have a boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo giggled as Ken felt his face go red. Randy just wasn't his type! \"So you <i>were</i> interested in Randy? Our Randy. The Randy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny primped her hair. \"I mean, have you <i>seen</i> Randy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan giggled again. \"Like, what an absolute-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment that Jeff and John seemed to spark back into Jenny and Jordan. \"...hunk. What the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen gestured pointedly. \"What the hell is right. Have you been listening to yourselves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff rubbed her forehead. \"N-no yeah, I see your point. It just felt right to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It <i>still</i> feels right to say. Like, this is freaky right?\" John twirled a hair nervously. \"Like, I'm weirded out, but I also really wanna go flirt with Randy some more. Or do my nails? And both of that feels normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff nodded. \"Kind of? I mean, I just keep thinking- I mean, look at me!\" Jeff struck a hip. \"This is horrifying! But instead of losing it, I just keep thinking things like \"I wonder if I could get Randy to buy me a shirt\". I'm freaked out that I'm not freaked out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen frowned. \"That... kind of makes sense.\" He didn't want to admit it, but he found he didn't really care if the other two flirted away, as long as it didn't get in the way of his own goals. He'd always considered himself a practical person, and flirting with boys suddenly seemed like a waste of time instead of something he was inherently opposed to. <i>If I'm gonna date anyone, I want to get to know them first.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly things started clicking into place. John, the immature macho man became an immature girly girl. Jeff, the manipulator, became one of those flirty girls who just wanted the boys to buy her stuff. And Paul...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen glanced at Paul, uncomfortably hiding in her sweater and hair. \"And Paula? I mean Paul...a. Dammit, I can't say the other name. How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul squirmed nervously at all the eyes on her. \"I-I don't know. I used to be comfortable around Randy b-but now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blush covered her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff glanced from person to person. \"Well this is bad, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But kinda cool, huh?\" John was fussing with Jordan's hair, already looking and posing at the camera in her phone. \"I mean, how often do four studly boys become four hot-to-trot girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious, girl?\" Ken didn't even seem phased at the slip of the tongue. \"We need to find a solution, ASAP. Or do you want to be stuck like this forever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen paused, before shaking his head. \"No, and that's what worries me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe it's not so bad.\" Jeff's little mind was spinning once again as a grin crawled up his face. \"This can't be permanent, but the odds of this being a first-time thing are pretty slim too. Girls must come out of that ride all the time. But the lack of complaints must mean everyone turns back to normal eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-maybe they stop complaining because of their minds getting... frazzled?\" Paul fussed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And yet no reports of missing persons as Disney World? Randy obviously remembered us, so clearly our lives haven't changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen pinched the bridge of her nose. \"What the hell are you suggesting this time, Jenny? Jenny. Dammit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff grinned and wrapped an arm around her compatriots. \"I'm saying, girls, that we have a rare opportunity to enjoy ourselves as completely new people at the happiest place on earth. No one knows who we are and, clearly, there's no way this can last forever. So why not <i>embrace</i> our feminine beauty and enjoy it while it lasts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen groaned as John squealed in delight. \"You're insane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious, I think we're all quite stunning beauties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen wanted to protest but she had to admit, she was genuinely stunned and flattered by the compliment. Despite herself, she was getting convinced. Paula wasn't much better, a red blush covering her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh no Jenny, there's no way I could match how you and Jordan look....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn pointed to Paul. \"Ohhhh, at the very least we have to spend some time convincing our sweet little chipmunk how <i>cute</i> she is! She's sooooooo adorable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen struggled to regain her composure as Paula was reduced to stammers and blushing. \"Okay, we'll put it to a vote. If we get a 50/50 split, we'll split into two groups and do... whatever works for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff grinned. \"Now you're speaking my language.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Who's in favor of what?\"</span></div></div>",

The park was designed for comfort, after all, and it was hard to deny that she was getting comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as stranger as it was to admit, there was something... nice about doing the girly things Jenny and Jordan wanted them to do. It wasn't quite familiar but it felt like returning to something natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was why she could only smile as Jenny and Jordan searched through all the dresses at the Castle Couture shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwww these are all so cute!\" Jordan squeed. \"Look at how many classic dresses they have!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Jenny gushed. \"If I was a little girl, I bet I would have been all over that Bibidi Bobbity Boutique too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen rolled her eyes as even Paula started to fawn over the dresses. \"Those aren't really efficient to walk in you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny scoffed. \"You're thinking too Kenny and not enough Kendra, honey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm far enough Kendra as I am, thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of that!\" Jordan pointed a finger right at Ken's nose. \"We're here to be our girl selves, so you gotta do it too!

Do what feels right girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen really couldn't believe his friends. They had to be deluded. \"Riiiiiight. And how would you have me do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all pauses to think over this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What's your favorite Disney princess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, we're all drawn to our favorites, right? Paula's practically drooling over the Snow White skirts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bright red appears on the sweater clad girl as she quickly shoved a dress back on the rack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Jordan, lovely as ever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan grinned as she lifted up a Jasmine ensemble. \"That girl had every boy's eyes on her. You know what I'm going for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny snorted. \"And me, well, I'm clearly an Ariel gal.\" And surprisingly, Jenny's focus was indeed on the human Ariel outfit, rather than the more suggestive mermaid outfit Ken expected. She couldn't help but guess that Jenny vastly preferred the part where Ariel didn't have to say a word to twirl a boy around her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny's arm of conspicuous manipulation curled around Ken's shoulder. \"You're just so wound tight while we're exploring the amazing world of girlhood. Wouldn't you like to join us? C'mon, think about your fav princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen shook her head in disgust. She really didn't get these people at all. How could they just ignore where they came from? They couldn't mess around forever, even if it was a little entertaining. But the looks of her so-called friends were firm. Ken wasn't getting out of this without making a judgment call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced over the outfits bitterly. Snow White. Worked hard and then trusted a stranger and got poisoned for it. What an inspiring tale. Sleeping Beauty? Ugh. Gave into a spinning wheel curse and made the man go through a whole epic quest that she slept through. No thanks. Cinderella? Honestly, did that girl even want the prince? Ken always felt she just wanted to go to a swanky party and got caught up in a royal scandal. Mulan and Alice were alright, but they weren't princesses. Plus Mulan gave up the chance to run an army at the end! Thanks, but no thanks. Elsa? Yeah, freeze the world because you didn't learn how to communicate. Honestly, all these Disney princesses were absurd and they offended Ken's surprising new passion for a good female hero. She just  couldn't understand the appeal at all for these-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes fell on a yellow dress. Belle's dress. Beauty's dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogically, her mind screamed \"no don't you dare. It's about Stockholm Syndrome for pete's sake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she didn't think that was true at all anymore. The Beast and Belle genuinely bonded. It was only after he stopped being so rude that they began to fall in love, a fact she was suddenly intensely aware of. And Belle was smart, logical, like her. She and the Beast spent all that time together, learning about each other, bonding with each other. No nonsense whirlwind romance. A whole year of slow building, of rising love and affection. Belle wasn't like the other princesses. She was smart and clever and caring and sweet and she did everything she could to make her relationship with the Beast work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelle was Kendra's favorite. No question about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendra didn't even realize she was stroking the dress until three faces grinned at her with delight. Kendra's face turned bright red as she quickly hid her hands behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you looking at?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny grinned. \"A girl who's found her first dress~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen crossed her arms. \"You're being ridiculous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come ooooonnn, embrace it!\" She forced Ken's face to look at the dress, letting the light of Kendra's secret passion shine right into her eyes. \"Can't you feel the warm comfort radiating from it? Doesn't it just feel right to give in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could imagine herself wearing it, spinning around in a ballroom, a handsome gentleman she had months to understand and trust in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-its just not practical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doesn't have to be. It's for your pleasure.\"</span></div></div>",

Let's get you some ice cream and then we'll head out. Does that sound nice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the two girls wandered off to the front of the store as Ken and Paul looked on in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well that was easier than I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul was sure Jeff had something up her sleeve, even if she was currently wearing a sleeveless outfit. But before she could voice her concerns, she noticed another boy staring at her. The thoughts quickly zipped from her head as she hid before Ken in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn line for the Main Street ice cream, the two pary girls were in a fiercely hushed argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you wasted our chance to have fun! Now Kendra's gonna drag us to boring places to do boring people things! That's boring!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we're doing it as a group,\" Jeff insisted harshly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A boring group!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A <i>group</i> that has to make group decisions. With all of us there, we can outnumber Kendra with votes and ideas. Get her distracted and confused by the sights and sounds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn scrunched up her Jordan face in confusion. \"Which means....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which means we can <i>all</i> have fun. And all it takes is a little smooth talking to throw Kendra off her game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn's smile rose in understanding. \"Which means she and Paula have to have fun too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff snapped her manicured finger. \"Precisely.\" And in an instant, she shifted gears to flutter her eyelashes at the server and flirt her way into a free scoop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes, the four were reunited by the Micky Mouse statue, licking their treats while Kendra examined the map with intense vigor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should probably return to the original ride. That's where this whole mess started, maybe it can get us back on track.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff and John shared a glance as they shifted to sit closer to Kendra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we do need to be thorough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's lots of places around the area to check out too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows if there's a soda or something that's causing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ride could be a coincidence. The change could've been caused by anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we can't leave any stone unturned, can we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen glanced at the two demons on her shoulder in something of a wild confusion. They were doing something, she'd be burned too many times not to know, but they were also prying on her fussy nature. What if there <i>was</i> something they missed?</span></div></div>",

Even if they suddenly appreciated the other rides a lot more than they did as men, the duo certainly didn't want to go through the ride all over again. Not at the risk of losing this so soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen gestures to the entrance of the princess themed attraction. \"Come on, get in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now hold on.\" Jeff's sly Jenny mind was moving a thousand miles a minute. \"How can we be sure this won't make things worse?

We'll split into two this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff grimaced. Her out voting gambit had been used against her and she wasn't particularly pleased to see it. But the game had gone the other way.

Not only did her gambit force them right towards the last place she wanted to be but she just <i>had</i> to draw one of the shortest straws of the batch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, those are the rules, Jen. Saddle on in there,\" Ken shrugged. Jeff knew she was living this up. This was punishment for getting further with Randy, she just knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was tearing up, her hands grabbing Jeff's in a panic. \"I-it'll be okay! We won't lose you, right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, don't you fret,\" she waved a dismissive hand. \"I'll come out just as stunning and hot-to-trot as ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she stomped into the ride once again, Paul trailing behind anxiously. The shyer girl couldn't help but notice with her newfound interest the details even in the lines to the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride was like a carriage ride, where the girls stepped into the seats as animatronic horses guided them through a variety of Disney castles. Perky voices sang about wishing and finding true love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul was much more enraptured than the previous trip through, but all Jeff could do was scowl. \"You are enjoying this, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul jolted. \"Wh-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at you. Enjoying this stupid kid ride.\" She sneered. \"But it makes sense. You really haven't <i>developed</i> much, have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe innuendo smacked Paula right in the head. \"Wh-why does that matter...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny, and she was in pure, catty Jenny mode, leaned forward into the seat smugly. \"Well, its obvious that you can't get any real man's attention. I mean, look at yourself. You're nothing but a little nerdy, disgusting, fat little mouse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each word, Paula felt herself retreat into the chair. She wasn't that big... her sweater just... made her look bad. Or maybe she made herself look bad. She wasn't a beauty like Jenny or Jordon, or even Kendra. She didn't feel she had to be, she was happy just being their friends. Even when she was Paul, she didn't mind not being the handsome piece of meat of the group. But Jenny made it so hard to like herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to tear up. \"I-I don't understand....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny smirked again, ego stroked from her defeating another worm. \"Its clear to me. You just can't stack up to a wonder like me. Few can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula brushed away at her wet cheeks. \"I.... I wish you were nicer.\" She didn't mean to say that out loud and immediately squeaked in alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny glared. \"Well, I wish you weren't such a mousey little nitwit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magic of Walt Disney World was a curious thing. Wishes could be granted or ignored depending on a multitude of factors. A previous visit on a particularly magical ride could grant the wish of \"hot girls\" to four eager boys with little trouble. What could the magic change this time?</span></div></div>",

Pieces of fabric were stretching to cover what was once seductively placed and possibly inappropriately shown curves. Her short shorts extended down her legs until the seam vanished and became a tasteful, light blue, shin-length dress. Her tank top shifted into a bright blouse. And more noticeably, her hair cascaded downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula felt quite the opposite. She felt like, somehow, she was <i>growing</i>, her hair shortening near the top of her head as her sweater all but vanished. Her own top hid a sports bra and her long pants now displayed a surprisingly fit pair of legs. Her size had increased at least a foot, towering over the smaller Jenny. Paula's fragile form had shifted entirely into an athletic amazon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd suddenly the world came back into focus as the two blinked in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny gasped in horror, delicate hands grasping her face. \"Oh Paula! I'm so sorry!\" Her voice was distinctly sing-song, each word almost like a comforting melody. \"I shouldn't have said those horrible things! You are nothing but a sweet, wonderful girl and it was horrid, absolutely horrid of me to say otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula rubbed the back of her neck awkwardly. \"Eh, no big fuss. Besides, yer talking to the toughest girl in school.\" She flexed an arm, a grin rising easily around her rough-and-tumble voice. \"Nothing like being called \"mousey\" would ever get me down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny patted Paula's hand comfortingly. \"Of course dear. Nonetheless, I <i>insist</i> on treating you to a meal after our excursion. Its only nice and proper to apologize for such rude behavior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula shook her head in amusement. \"Yer too sweet for your own good. I worry about ya. If any punks give you trouble-\" and she demonstrated by slamming a fist into her palm. \"I'll give 'em the old one-two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny giggled. \"Oh, I don't need anything like that. All I need right now is to greet our friends with open arms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula laughed a booming laugh. \"Nothing wrong with that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as soon as the carriages reached a halt, the tomboy and the Snow White-wannabe hopped out of the ride and back into the light.</span></div></div>",

That's the purest kind of wish there is. Now everyone, get ready. They wanted to change their past. That's going to be tough, so stay strong!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan shrunk a little as her hair pulled itself into a ponytail. Her mind reeled as new information flooded into it. She could remember her time as John, but now she could remember another world where she had been Jordan. In that life, she was, if not a nerd, a smart girl. She didn't go in for competitions, but she loved helping her friends. She was kind of a group mom. Where John had contributed to whatever the group was doing by lightening the mood, Jordan was always dependable to pull her weight and then some, not to mention have some helpful information on whatever they were doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen, no, Kendra's brain felt like it was about to explode. She could remember going to different countries, eating food Ken had never tasted before. More importantly, she could feel her friends' influence on her. Her muscles toned as she remembered how she'd let Paula drag her to the gym and on runs. She noticed that she was now wearing a pink dress and smiled. Truth be told, she'd be more comfortable in shorts and a tank top, but Jenny had wanted to match, and besides, a dress wasn't so bad. She still had the Mario tattoo she got in Japan on a dare from Randy. Most importantly to her, she had her best friend Jordan at her side. Jordan and she had been through so much together, and she'd learned so much from her. They'd truly had a magical relationship together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world came back into focus as the two looked at each other. \"Well then,\" said Jordan. \"It looks like we've figured out how this ride works.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"If you have the same memories that I do, you remember being more willing to try new things and to have fun, especially with your friends. I' know I remember being smarter and more helpful. God, I was the worst as John.\" \"Don't say that! You were a wonderful man. A bit of a goofball, but everyone needs a goofball in their life!\" \"Fair enough. Anyway, I'll bet Paula wanted to be able to stand up for herself more. Couldn't say how Jen got to where she is. Maybe she asked to be more likable. At any rate, we all got what we wanted. This is a wishing tunnel! We became girls because we wanted to meet, ahem, 'hot chicks.' It certainly has a sense of irony. Anyway, now we know how to undo it!\" \"Oh, yeah, sure.\" \"It's going to be tough getting the others to agree to it, but I think we could figure it out. I feel terrible for how I treated you.\" \"I feel terrible too! Truth be told, I think that there's a lot of fun to be had in our situation!\" \"Really? I wasn't going to say anything but...\" \"I'll tell you what. Let's meet Paula and Jenny and make a new plan there.\" \"Sounds like a plan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got out, Paul and Jeff rushed to meet them. \"You look so beautiful, Kendra!\" squealed Jeff. \"You seem to truly carry yourself like a proper woman.\" \"I kind of feel like one too,\" said Ken. \"I'm glad we're all on the same page,\" said Paula. \"Now what say we decide what to do next? This is a nice ride and all, but there's a whole park out there!\"</span></div></div>",

But the thing is as you cook more often you start to just know the recipe by heart and start adding your own things to it. By the time you become competent at cooking you stop needing to look at a cook book for things you already know how to make. Jon (son) in her delusions thought that she had the recipe for Nikujaga down. The problem was although in theory the recipe was simple, Jon (son) never really prepare much of anything before only knowing the visible ingredients from her past memories of the meal and the vaguest idea how to put it all together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Linda\" got out the onions, the potatoes, and the pork and cut them up rather sloppily, it being a small miracle that she did not cut herself with the knife. She put the ingredients into a frying pan, and that's where the trouble started. \"Linda\" suddenly felt a need to relive herself and figured the ingredients would be fine for a few moments unattended. Of course the bathroom trip took a little longer then expected when \"Linda\" saw that her make up was a bit smudged and decided to touch up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes passed when the imposter smelt smoke, warning bells going off in her head. \"Linda\" rushed downstairs to see the stove-top and the wooden counter tops near it were on fire.

Their parents had all agreed to go together, so they were very happy that they were enjoying their time with friends. When they had gotten off the Dumbo ride, they pondered what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should totally ride Space Mountain next!\" Tim said.<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Michael replied. \"I'm not waiting in that long line!\"<br>\r\n\"Well, what else is there to do?\" Michael asked.<br>\r\n\"Why don't we ask Robert?\" Kevin suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert was Kevin's older brother. He was tasked with watching Kevin and his friends while their parents could relax and browse the gift shops. They went over to the bathrooms where Robert was waiting, only to see Robert wasn't there. \"He probably had to go\" Kevin said. As the other four waited for Robert, Joey noticed a door marked \"Cast Members Only\" that was slightly ajar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, let's go in here!\" Joey called. \"But we're not allowed in there\" Danny said. \"Oh, come on!\" Joey begged. \"It'll only take a minute. Besides, nobody will ever know!\" \"I don't know...\" Danny muttered. \"What are you, chicken?\" Joey teased. This set Danny off the edge. \"I'll show you who's chicken!\" And with that, Danny marched through the door. The other boys followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was much bigger than they thought. There were boxes upon boxes of different props. As they were looking around, Kevin stumbled across an open crate. \"Hey, look at this!\" he called to his friends. The group gathered around the crate and peered inside. Whatever was inside was covered by a heap of packing peanuts. \"What do you suppose is inside?\" Michael asked. \"I guess there's only one way to find out...\" Kevin replied. He reached inside and pulled out...</span></div></div>",

A stray lock of long blonde hair fell across her face, pulling it forward she gave a shuddering breath, and tucked it away behind her ear.

Again, her hands shifting downwards. Hesitating at the last moment, unwilling to confirm the size of her expanded ass. It didn't help, as her hands brushed against her wider hips, the -swish- of her silk gloves against her satin dress. It was swelling outwards from her taut, toned, and tiny waist.

And she liked what she saw: Hairless, creamy smooth, long... Grinning, Merida's eyes wandered down, and focused on the crown jewels of Cinderella's outfit, the glass slippers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were completely transparent, the heels raised enough to fully showcase the beautiful blonde's utterly perfect feet. From the creamy tops, to her amazingly high and deep arches, leading down to her perfectly proportioned and pedicured toes, and she could even peek at Cinderella's smooth soles. So enticing was this sight that Merida almost couldn't bring herself to look away; no wonder the Fairy Godmother had chosen glass slippers for the girl! All of the princesses had feet to die for, but it almost seemed like Cinderella's were a cut above the rest. Now it was Merida's turn to feel envy... and covetousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting Cinderella's skirts drop, Merida slipped an arm around the blonde's waist, and nuzzled against the other beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don' worry, luv...\" she whispered into the blonde's ear, almost purring. \"<i>Ah'll</i> protect ye...

Aye, Ah can do that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving behind Cinderella, she groped the girl's chest and backside briefly, clearly enjoying having an outlet for her desires.</span></div></div>",

I've got her fairy magic too, he thought in stunned silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flames build, growing a brighter more emerald green. Then they rose up from her fist, and shot downwards at the same time. Unclasping her hand, a staff formed from the fire. With an oaken thud, the base of the staff hit the ground. A circular ripple of flames spread outwards, fading as the circle grew. But Michael clutched at the staff, to stop it hitting her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe staff... The staff, just felt right in her hands. She felt power coursed through her veins, as she felt her perceptions, every sense expand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe even felt the beginning of Danny's change forming as a knot in his stomach. Her eyes flickered with a malevolent glee, as she saw the uncertainty spread across his face.</span></div></div>",

High and feminine, that lowered become more throaty and powerful. As Merida turned, she saw a women limned in green light. Her arms high and wide, as electricity rippled over the surface of her body.

A slightly nerdier frat boy looking worried and a black haired girl looking a bit disinterested completed the group of four.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if some sort of instinct kicked in, Helen looked at the group in that sort of motherly, disappointedly way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys know you shouldn't be back here.\" Helen said, her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right.

The entire group changed their focus to Maleficent, who had her eye on the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How wonderful. What are your names, children?\" Maleficent said, with a clearly evil intent in her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me for being rude. I'm Bret, and this is my girlfriend, Allison.

He felt like a seventies star, and should be wearing a shark tooth pendant or something else rather gauche. The tickling, creeping sensation from his head was more distracting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching his hands up, he ruffled his hair trying to dislodge the thing... whatever was brushing his scalp. But there was nothing there. As he let his hands drop back down, an embarrassed smile on his face, two locks of hair dropped across his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, he tucked them behind his ears. Only after noticing their different colours. Not merely shades or tones, but the entire spectrum. One had been white and the other black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the feeling that his clothes were crawling over his skin. He grabbed wildly at his hair, hoping, praying that it was his imagination. But already it was multiplying becoming thicker and fuller, curlier more full bodied. With a sigh, Bret couldn't deny it was both black in one hand, and shocking white in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting to hyperventilate, he spotted that his hands were covered in fine satin gloves, a sort of pinky red colour, and far too small to contain his chunky hands and thick fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes wandered up from the gloves, up the sleeves, the speckled sleeves, dotted like a dalmation's coat. Oh, god was he turning into a dog. His breath caught, until he saw wrinkles. It was fabric, it was wrinkled material, it wasn't his skin, it wasn't his fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he couldn't deny how different his body felt now. His trousers felt snugger, and his boots reached further up his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, a brief high shriek burst from his lips. He had a cleavage. Frantically, he tried to smooth it away, surely it was a trick of the light, or the way the fabric was lying.... or something .... or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensations both from her bust and her hands confirmed that Bret was now fully a woman. From the crown of her wild hair to the tip of her pointy boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't need to check. Her trousers, or leggings, catsuit... was it a catsuit. She wasn't sure what it was called that she was wearing. But it clung tightly to her skin, and left her in no doubt that she didn't bulge. Mr Happy was only a memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA puff of smoke formed from her fingers, dancing snake like, before settling into a straight line. A diamante cigarette holder formed in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/d2/90/b4/d290b422add5946ac0d2b32d79317a99.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736...</a></span></div></div>",

He would've been fine with staying at EPCOT or The Animal Kingdom, but to his misfortune, his family decided to stay at the Magic Kingdom, since his 11 year old sister, Kelly, was such a big fan of the Disney Princesses, whether it was the classics like Snow White, Aurora, &amp; Cinderella, or the newest generation of Disney Princesses, like Rapunzel from Tangled, &amp; Elsa and her sister Anna from Frozen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the end of the second day of vacation, Eli snuck out the suite his family was residing in, which was inside the iconic Cinderella Castle, wanting to give himself a breather, especially since this was when the Magic Kingdom was closed for the night. After wandering around the vacant streets of the Magic Kingdom, he accidentally stumbled upon the entrance to the wardrobe room, where the employees of Disney World would get in costume for some of the theme park's live shows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as he slowly walked among the rows of various Disney costumes, Eli accidentally tripped on something on the floor, just as he quickly catched himself from hitting the floor hard. From there, he quickly found out what exactly tripped him: Belle's golden yellow ball gown dress from Beauty &amp; The Beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he wasn't exactly a fan of the Disney Princesses, Eli was secretly a big fan of Belle from Beauty &amp; The Beast, since she was very intelligent for a Disney Princess, as well as being very confident and optimistic, along with not being concerned about her appearance or other's appearances, able to look past how people appear and into their hearts, not to mention being quite obstinate when it came to staying her points, upholding her opinions, and maintaining her ideas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a way, it very much reminded Eli of his own personality, which would explain why he liked Belle so much, since he didn't view women and other people as property. However, he wouldn't mind giving that jarhead Gaston \"the finger\" for being such a egotistical musclehead, which would pretty much put a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to give his favorite Disney Princess some respect, Eli slowly stood back up onto his feet and cautiously approached Belle's iconic dress, carefully cleaning it from any stains he unintentionally delivered onto the ball gown's pristine silky smooth cloth. Finally, after spending a few minutes of cleaning the dress, Eli hung the dress back up onto the rack it was displayed from, with a proud look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, just as he was about to head back out the way he came, Eli.....</span></div></div>",

Shortly after noticing that Belle's dress was gone, Eli then began to hear what sounded like Belle humming the song \"Be Our Guest\" somewhere in the wardrobe room, as he reached the end of the hallway and cautiously turned his head from left to right, checking if there really was anybody in here with him, but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was there that Eli noticed Belle's dress was laying on a chair in front of one of the makeup mirrors, as if someone had planned on wearing it. While still hearing the sound of Belle's humming, Eli carefully approached the chair and makeup mirror, intended on putting the dress back where it originally was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as he picked up the iconic ball gown, Eli began to have this strange train of thought in his head, as if it was tempting him to actually wear Belle's dress. At first, he spoke to himself and thought, \"No, t-this isn't right...I-I shouldn't be wearing a dress like this.\" Then again, he wasn't exactly the kind of person that was masculine, since he was scrawny, which spread the seeds of temptation even further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, during last Halloween, a female friend of his made Eli dress up like a girl as part of both a dare and part of a Halloween costume party. However, as he was holding up the dress, Eli looked up toward the mirror in front of him, surprised at what he was seeing before his very eyes....</span></div></div>",

Then again, Eli noticed that Belle was wearing the exact same green dress she wore when Beast gave her his enormous library, along with sporting her trademark low ponytail, which was tied in her signature sky blue ribbon bow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mean to offend you, but...are you feeling alright?\" Belle asked, just noticing Eli simply staring at her. Fortunately, Eli quickly snapped out of it, looking toward the approaching Belle and answered, \"Oh, um....I'm sorry about that. It's just that I...I have actually met you in-person, Belle-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn accidental slip of the tongue, Eli quickly covered her mouth with both hands, making Belle curious as to how the transformed teen knew what her name was. But then, in response to what Eli had said, Belle looked toward her and asked....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After all, just like in the movie, Belle had managed to stump Eli there for a moment, throwing an intelligent curveball. Besides, you knew very well that the United States wasn't born yet in Belle's time period, so how could she know about the country's existence?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n In an attempt to answer the Disney Princess's question, Eli nervously stuttered a little (since she was ACTUALLY talking to his favorite Disney Princess) and said, \"But, um...H-How did you-\" \"Know that you were from this faraway land? *giggle* Well, you have the same appearance as me, along with a voice that sounds exactly like my own voice. Second, you suddenly appeared unexpectedly, as if you had formed out of thin air. And finally, you happen to be aware of who I am, as well as knowing my name.\" Belle replied, speaking to Eli in a slightly assertive but non-threatening manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...I-I don't understand. How could you know what the United States is, Belle? It wasn't even born yet.\" Eli asked, obviously becoming just a bit more confused as to how Belle had become aware of the very country Eli had originated from. So in response, Belle gently held Eli by her hands, being compassionate and understanding at the same time, then spoke toward the transformed teen with a caring smile on the brunette's face and answered, \"Well, this probably might be a surprise to you, miss. But apparently, you are not the first person to, um...how should I phrase it? Originate from a different world or a different time period, to be more accurate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelle was definitely right about one thing; This was a legitimate surprise to Eli, not realizing that she wasn't the first person to unexpectedly get themselves magically transformed into an exact copy of a Disney character, then transported into the same world as them. So, looking back at the brunette Disney Princess, you spoke to Belle, carefully choosing your words wisely, and asked.....</span></div></div>",

Is that an abbreviated name for Elizabeth?\" Belle asked, showing one of the key aspects to her personality, since she was known to be optimistic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Eli began to blush, as she revealed the truth about herself and answered, \"Actually Belle, I, um.....my name isn't short for Elizabeth. I mean, I-I don't look the part right now, but to tell you the truth, I.....I-I was actually once a guy. Where I come from, Eli is a boy's name, Belle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Oh my, I.....I deeply apologize for your misfortune, Eli. I, um....I originally had thought you were born a woman.\" Belle said, obviously a little embarrassed herself for a moment there, her cheeks blushing in reaction. Since she was her favorite, Eli reassured Belle by putting her left hand on Belle's right shoulder and replied, \"It's...It's alright, Belle. I, um....wouldn't exactly call myself a girl anymore, since well...I look exactly like you. Anyway, um....not to sound mean, but...you were about to answer how you even know that I'm from the United States?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as for how I am able to know about the kingdom you originated from, Eli.... Apparently, one of my friends, Cinderella, happened to have become entangled with a similiar situation, which occurred at her own castle. Surprisingly, both the guests and servants had become aware that there were two 'Cinderellas'. Fortunately, this matter was resolved in identifying the real Cinderella, while the second Cinderella was allowed to stay. Though, I believe that this Cinderella lookalike confessed a honest and truthful explanation to the original, which allowed this duplicate to stay with Cinderella and her Prince.\" Belle explained, going into detail about the incident, as well as confirming that she wasn't the only Disney Princess in this alternate world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, this made Eli just a little more curious, wondering if this alternate world had some of the other Disney Princesses and their home kingdoms, like Princess Jasmine &amp; Agrabah from Aladdin.

Apparently, a few of them explained to us that they were unwillingly transported to our world by magic, despite said magic changing these people into exact copies of us, minus a few possible differences in several of them, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few...differences?\" Eli asked, unsure what Belle was talking about. So in response, Belle looked back at the transformed teen and answered, \"For example, Rapunzel currently has dark brown hair, which was a side-effect from cutting her ever-growing blonde hair in order to defeat Gothel. However, the duplicate Rapunzel sports the same blonde hair that the real Rapunzel originally had, only the duplicate's hair grows at a much slower pace than the original, but it is just as lengthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Well, I guess that is much different from what I expected.\" Eli said, understanding that the events in Tangled had already happened. \"*Giggle* Yes, well at least this has made Rapunzel's situation much easier to identify the original Rapunzel and her duplicate.\" Belle replied, finding a little bit of humor in this unusual paradox she and her friends had found themselves in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, this somewhat made the transformed teen curious about something; If the events in Tangled had already occurred as Belle mentioned earlier, could there be a possibility that the events in Beauty &amp; The Beast had already happened? More specifically, the curse that befell the Beast, the castle, &amp; it's residents? Was the curse lifted like in the movie, or was there a possible chance that said curse was still active?

What you see defies logic and everything you know. There just below your neck sitting on your chest is what appears to be breasts, big well tanned female breasts.

You make it the transportation center and amazingly a bus for your resort hotel is waiting there. It's not till you're on the bus and sitting that your heart starts to slow down. \"Mommy, why did we have to leave. You said we could watch the fireworks tonight\", your daughter cries. You lean over and quietly say, \"Why do you keep calling me mommy? I'm your daddy. You remember, right?\" She looks at you curiously and matter of fact states, \"I remember, daddy, but you have boobies now so you're a mommy, my mommy. The genie made my wish come true. Princess Jasmine is my mommy.\" You suddenly remember the blue guy. You look over at your reflection in the window. \"Oh shit\", you mutter to yourself. You look just like Princess Jasmine, well not exactly. You look very much like the busty cast member that was playing Princess Jasmine, somewhat exaggerated though. The big difference is your clothes. They've turned into what can only be described as a modern interpretation of Princess Jasmine from the movie's clothes. It's a little more revealing than you're comfortable with. You don't even seem to be wearing a bra and it feels like you're probably wearing a thong. You then notice you've been carrying a purse the entire time. \"How is this even possible\", you say out loud? \"The nice genie made my wish come true\", you daughter answers giving you a hug. As crazy as her answer is, it's the only thing that comes close to explaining your transformation. Part of you says you should go back to the park and find the blue man genie. Another part is still refusing to believe any of this is real. Another plausible explanation is that the smoke contained some kind of hallucinogenic and you're on a very weird trip. That actually seems more plausible than a blue magical genie at Disney World. \"Then why does my daughter see me as Princess Jasmine\", you ask yourself? You then wonder if she really does. Your ex-wife was the experienced drug addict, not you. You figure you could just be hallucinating all of this, even your daughter saying that you're Jasmine. You figure your choices are, believe a genie did this and go back to the park and find him, or it's drug induced hallucination and go back the hotel to sleep this off.</span></div></div>",

Come on, I can't stay like this for three days.\" This time he laughs and retorts with, \"You may find it harder than you think. Don't think of this as a burden, but an opportunity. You are a princess. Money is not an obstacle. Show your daughter a good time.\" You frown at his apparent certainty that you will fail and state, \"We'll see about that.

I am over 5000 years old, so I do get forgetful.\" He snaps his fingers and vanishes. \"Wow\", you hear your daughter exclaim! You look down and see Emily has become olive complicated dark haired version of her previous self. She looks like a miniature five year old version of your current self. \"I love it. I look like you now mommy, but without boobs\", she shouts! You turn red and whisper, \"Honey, don't shout, boobs.\" \"Sorry, mommy\", she replies just as the first fireworks go off. You sigh and think, \"Three days stuck like this. Well, sure beats permanent. It's all for Emily though, so it's worth it. I'd do anything for her.\" Something about this thought triggers an uneasy feeling, but you shrug it off. You're certain you can make it three days without falling in love with another man. Just the thought of it disgusts you. What bothers you is the genie's certainty that you would fail and stories you remember about them being tricksters. You'll have to be on guard for everything.</span></div></div>",

Mark doesn't miss a beat and says, \"Bartender, whatever she wants on my tab.\" He looks at you and says, \"I apologize, I saw you hesitate looking down.

Need to shoot him down fast, after I get my drink of course\", you think to yourself. You order your drink. \"So, having a good vacation\", Mark asks? You smile and reply, \"Been an adventure so far. I'm really here for my five year old daughter. She loves Disney World. This is her first trip.\" You figure throwing the fact you have a kid out there will dissuade this guy.

Disney World is for, like, three year olds. Not for 17 year olds like us.\" Patrick quipped as he studied his map.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just thought it would be a nice, fun day.\" Emma said, gritted through her teeth.

It's old, and ancient, and out of touch with what's cool.\" Patrick said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like this relationship.\" Emma muttered under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust one year ago, Emma and Patrick seemed like the perfect couple. Emma couldn't remember a happier time her, or for Patrick. They had known each other since their youth, and had decided to start dating at the beginning of high school. And it was great. But recently, the magic is gone so to speak. They can't help but see each other as stupid, or silly, and they are constantly bickering. Both of them want to regain the spark they had back in the beginning, and there have been points where it's calmed down. But right now, the bickering seems to be at an all time high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma suggested they take a day at Disney World, which was only 40 minutes from their high school, in order to get away from the pressures of high school. In order to relax. But right now, it didn't seem to be working. Emma felt like this could be the end. She couldn't break up with someone at Disney World, could she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I just wish Patrick and I could be together forever.\" Emma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there were any place that wish could come true, it would be here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to Patrick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. Fine. Let's have fun.\" said Patrick, defeated. \"Where should we go first?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma wanted to go to Fantasyland. But she knew Patrick would never go for it.</span></div></div>",

Nicole was now just a little flat-chested girl, dressed innocuously in a girl's skirt with a light blue Frozen shirt branded with Elsa on the front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she went to rubbed her tear stained eyes in confusion, she unexpectedly brushed the side of her brunette hair which she now discovered was in pigtails.

Besides her simple pair of woman's shorts, she was also wearing a Frozen shirt but with Anna branded on the front instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole was perplexed, how did this happen? She was the mommy......but now Abby was? That didn't make any sense, she was the one that had taken Abby to Disney World not the the other way around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's nice to meet you two,\" Derek cut into her thoughts as he turned and looked down on her. \"It looks like little Nicole has collected herself from the harrowing experience well enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBitterly, Nicole was going to let this man have it but to her dismay it all came out in a whine, \"I'm a <b>BIG</b> girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can see that clear as day!\" Derek joked with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Nicole yelled \"Abby's the little girl not me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole instinctively turned to the woman who held her little hand for approval but only saw a wave of red flash across Abby's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole. No one has called me Abby ever since I was your age <i>little one</i>,\" Abigail stressed the last two words as she talked down to her. \"You take playing house way too seriously sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek hand waved the drama away with a hearty laugh, \"Let the girl play house, It's the Magic Kingdom after all! I know my little guy here was just whining about me calling him Christoper like he's a grown-up or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shock little Nicole turned wide eyed to the little boy standing across from her who wore a red Cars shirt. The blond hair boy was of a similar age to Nicole if not a bit younger, Nicole could have never imagined that he had ever been a grown man before. His boyish features and attitude hide any hint that he was anything more than a cute kid enjoying Disney World with his daddy.  Was that what she looked like with Abby being her mommy now? She found that thought more cute and comforting than distressing which only then worried her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the two adults turned children locked eyes with each other the overhead speakers drowned anything she could have said to her compatriot in a spooky ghostly voice, \"Right this way to the <i>Boarding Area</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek winked at her mommy while he motioned for little Chris to take his firm hand to move forward with the group of tourists around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a similar force from her grown daughter move her forward little Nicole wondered what she should do.</span></div></div>",

She felt so silly, childish for not even picking up on her dramatic transformation in age. Some part of her in her also worried for her little Abby who had seemingly, unbeknownst to either of them, taken over Nicole's former role.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething in Chris' eyes told her he had answers, at least more than she had. If she could just...slip....free from her mommy's grasp she could get to Chris and quietly ask him what's happening before Abigail found her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe deftly relaxed her fingers from her mother's hand and quietly sneaked away into the crowd ahead of them. Among the forest of adults and bigger kids, Nicole's short height of 42 inches came fully into effect. Abby had been 5 years old after all, did that really mean she was 5 too? Passing by a group of elementary school aged sisters that dwarfed her in size, that seemed likely to little Nicole.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole Jacobs had gone from a successful career woman to a silly little kindergartner. This was Abby's life not hers, she felt like a bad girl stealing her own daughter's youth from right under her and that idea excited the woman turned girl in a way that frightened her more than the scary sounds and ghosts of the Haunted Mansion did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she found Chris, she quietly tapped his shoulder to draw his attention away from his daddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy was adorable, Chris was the kind of little boy she wanted to raise someday. His bright blond hair still bowled around his cute dimpled face but his green eyes betrayed that a semblance of a man inhabited the young boy's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You too?\" Chris whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you Derek's daddy?\" She asked in a hush tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris nodded, \"I was Derek's age and he was my age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same.\" Nicole told him, \"When did you switch ages?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris seemed just as confused as she was, \"Didn't it happen during the rides?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NICOLE!!!!!\" Abigail yelled over the crowd, instantly dispelling the enchanted atmosphere for the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in big trouble.\" Chris said in a bit of a loud taunt before realizing how childish that made him sound to own his embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caught the attention of Chris' son turned father who looked down onto the regressed woman, \"My, my, Nicole I thought I would see you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole pouted, \"I'm sorry Mr. Derek.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek smiled, \"For what? I should be saying sorry. I'm so jealous my little baby boy is more popular with the ladies than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis put a grin across little Chris' flushed face. Just like with Nicole, it was clear that Chris was begrudgingly enjoying being treated like a little boy by his own son. The role reversal was more intoxicating to either of them than any amount of alcohol could have possibly been to them in their old lives as grown-ups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek, ignoring either of their reactions, called out to Nicole's mommy, \"Abby! I caught Nicole over here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank god!\" Abigail said with relief as she approached them before addressing Nicole, \"Baby why did you leave mommy's side?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Abby.\" Derek winked at her again, \"I think we're both old enough to know what's happening here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail smiled despite her obvious frustration but before any of them could say anything to one another the ride attendant spoke to them \"Are you four together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek made a sly grin to Chris and Nicole before looking to Abigail, seemingly allowing the woman to give the final say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I do believe we are.\" Abigail said hesitantly, \"Can we fit together in a single car?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride attendant looked nonchalant, \"With how little your kids are? Not a problem if they sit in your laps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris and Nicole both shared a bewildered look upon their regressed faces. Not in her wildest dreams did Nicole think she would be sitting comfortably upon the lap of her own little Abby. Chris' new daddy took initiative as the car was opened for the group and picked up up the once fully grown man easily and carried the little boy into the far end of the bench before sitting him firmly over his lap. Chris' little legs dangled innocently over the car's floor. Nicole could hardly see his reaction before Abigail walked past Nicole and sat herself in nearest end of the car's bench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe patted the top of her curvy thighs innocently to the once full grown woman, \"Come on Nicole! Come sit on mommy's lap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the pressure of the queue behind her, Nicole stepped into the car and was quickly lifted onto Abigail's lap. With her little legs dangling over the bench and her back comfortably relaxed against Abigail's big boobies, little Nicole felt absolutely mesmerized by the sensations overwhelming her. Those feelings only went into overdrive when Abigail leaned in a gave her regressed mother a lovely long smooch across the young girl's earlobe before whispering, \"I'll protect you Nicole, just enjoy the ride baby girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the car's door closed and the ride officially began Nicole wondered if Abby was a better mommy than she ever was. She was hard-pressed to remember when she had ever held and cuddled with Abby like the grown up Abigail was doing with her right now. With the enchanting effects of the ride beginning to change her and Chris' mental state, she considered if there was any hope of resistance. She wanted to be a grown-up again, a manager with responsibilities, and most of all she wanted to be a better mommy to Abby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Abigail was being to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet the return to childhood felt so appealing. She wanted to be a kid again, a kindergartner with no responsibilities, and most of all she thought that Abigail was the best mommy in the whole wide world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no escape possible, Nicole made her choice.... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Damien had always been a bit of an \u2018emo\u2019 kid. He dressed all in black, dyed his hair, and had a few piercings too. Ever since his sisters were born, he had been pretty depressed. He hated how his parents never paid attention to him anymore, instead focusing on his siblings. He didn\u2019t want to admit it, but he was jealous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, despite his dark appearance, Damien did love Disney World. His parents had taken him several times many years ago, before his sisters were born, and it was his first time back since then, and his sisters first times at the park in the first place. He hated how his dad just kept videotaping their ecstatic reactions. It annoyed him, but he understood. His parents had new favorites now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was there, he at least got to ride all his favorite rides. His mom had taken his sisters to go off and ride more kid-friendly ones, leaving just Damien and his dad. Even though he pretended to be moody at having to be babysat, he secretly enjoyed being able to spend some time with him. This was his first time since he was a kid that his dad was alone with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether they rode on Space Mountain. Damien had so much fun on it, and was so excited about trying out the rest of the park, he hadn\u2019t noticed that he was a bit shorter and some of his facial hair had disappeared. He didn\u2019t notice that his most recent piercing, which he got in July, seemed to vanish. He felt a bit strange, but brushed it of as motion sickness as he dragged his dad off to more exciting rides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext they rode on Splash Mountain, then Big Thunder Mountain, then the Peter Pan ride. Damien was having so much fun; he hadn\u2019t noticed he regressed back to 12. He felt a little more energetic now, and a bit shorter, but it didn\u2019t bother him for some reason. His clothes were feeling bigger too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the Seven Dwarves Mine Train and the Barnstormer, Damien felt much more happier and more vigorous than ever. He actually hadn\u2019t felt like this in a long time. His clothes definitely felt looser though. Did he lose weight? \u201cHey dad?\u201d Damien asked his father, who was walking with him, \u201cDo I look\u2026 smaller, to you?\u201d His father looked at him, \u201cHmmm\u2026 Not really. You look as chubby as always.\u201d. That made him feel better. Wait, chubby?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast time Damien checked, he was pretty thin. When he went through puberty, he had lost a lot of his \u2018baby fat\u2019, becoming lean and, in his own opinion, quite handsome. He looked down at himself and noticed that he was pretty pudgy, this was probably the only reason his clothes still barely fit him because his usual S clothes would be considered an XL by kids standards. And he was definitely shorter. Damien froze as he looked at himself. \u201cUhh, dad, can I please go to the bathroom?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy yourself?\u201d Samuel laughed. Damien was confused but nodded awkwardly. \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll wait outside.\u201d Damien thought it was odd how clingy his dad seemed. He liked the attention, but was this really the place for it? Regardless, he rushed into the bathroom and looked in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, he was definitely younger. He looked about 10 years old now, to his shock. His black hair had reverted to its natural brown color and was much shorter now, looking like a typical tween haircut. All of his piercings were gone. The biggest difference was that he seemed to gain back all the weight he had lost during puberty, and was now a chubby, stocky 10-year-old boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck?!\u201d He gasped. For some reason his mouth had automatically corrected \u2018hell\u2019 to \u2018heck\u2019, and his voice was higher. He poked his cheeks in disbelief, before rolling up his shirt and playing with his tummy. \u201cHow did this happen?\u201d He wondered aloud. He wasn\u2019t sure if he liked being this young or not. Worst of all, could he change back? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was still the same were his clothes, which hung baggily around him. His black shirt and ripped up jeans were loose, and hung around his waist exposing his boxers, but still the same, but they still felt awkward to wear. As Damien wished that his clothes fit a bit better to his big boy size, they suddenly started to shift before his eyes, shrinking and changing color. His shirt turned red as the Avengers logo and colorful cartoon versions of the heroes suddenly appeared in the middle of it, while his pants turned dark blue and shrank into shorts. He could feel his boxers turning into briefs, which he could see were decorated with pictures of Captain America. Finally, his plain, dark boots shrank to Velcro-strapped red and white ones with what appeared to be lights in the soles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe now looked like an average 10-year-old boy. He stared at himself in the mirror. What was he going to do now? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They started making towards the Canada Pavilion while Linda looked at her map to see what attractions it had. However, Peter was the first to point out something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we look at the gardens?\" he suggested to everyone's wonderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Ian asked. \"I really want to go see that movie-looking thing over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!\" Peter wined back. \"Can we at least look at it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else didn't feel much need to argue, so they just reluctantly agreed. As they walked over to the Victoria Gardens, Peter started to feel a bit weird. For some reason, he felt a little out of place with his current crowd. He was only ten, the second oldest of the bunch of children, yet he still felt way too old to be around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, I am the only teenager out of everyone,' he reasoned to himself as his belief came to be true. His age grew all the way to sixteen and his body grew with. Where he was once 4'3'', he was now about 5'6'' and weighed enough to prove it. Strangely, his muscles didn't grow that much with him. Peter looked like a pretty weak teenage boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this is the garden?\" Daniel asked. \"It's pretty, but I don't see much entertainment out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll understand when you're older,\" Peter laughed as he admired the imagery. He was never one to truly appreciate fine decorating, but the garden was looking rather beautiful to him. For the first time since they visited the resort, everything felt peaceful. Peter could even feel the wind blowing through his hair, though he didn't feel said hair lengthen to his back in wonderful volumes and didn't even notice it turning from a light blond to a very dark brown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...enough of that,\" Ian said. \"How about we head on over to the next country?\"</span></div></div>",

He could see geese any day of the year, in any part of the country. For some reason, he waited until he was at Disney World to become fascinated by them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZachary Roman won a contest, granting him VIP passes to attend Walt Disney World for six days. He got to bring his family, plus three friends. It would have been the trip of a lifetime if not for Brandon. Brandon, being nearly half the age of the older boys, was a drag. On day one, he wanted to ride all the kiddie rides. They all had lines two hours long, and they ate up the entire day. On day two, they finally got to try Splash Mountain, but the final drop scared Brandon so bad, he had to go back to the hotel. Zack and his friends begged his parents to take Brandon, leaving them at the park, but they refused. Even a place like Disney World wasn't safe for four unsupervised boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now day five, and everybody was touring Epcot. They were stalled by Brandon on the bridge into the World Showcase; eleven pavilions decorated to emulate eleven different nations, all circling an artificial lake. It was a 1.2 mile walk through all eleven countries, not counting any visits to attractions, rides, shops, or performances. It would take several hours to see it all, and at Brandon's pace, they'd be lucky to see four.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happiest place on Earth, my butt,\" Matt said with a sneer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Disneyland,\" Joe said, correcting his friend. \"Over in California. We're at Walt Disney World.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Joe. Nobody likes a know-it-all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, c'mon,\" Aaron said, trying to stop the squabbling, \"just try and have a good time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sick of <i>trying </i>to have a good time! I want to actually <i>have</i> a good time.\" Matt said, his frustrations growing. \"We only have, what, a day and a half left? What have we done so far? We've done a bunch of piddly baby crap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe interjected. \"I mean, it's a kid's amusement park. Most everything was designed for little kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt gnashed his teeth. \"Joe, I swear to god, I will throw you over the railing and into the lake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron shook his head, \"Zack, I'm not trying to dump on your brother, but could you please just ask your parents once more to let us go on our own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe nodded, \"Yeah, I checked the park rules and everything, you only gotta be 14 to be unsupervised. We qualify for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt piped in. \"They take Brandon, we have fun, I won't have to cram him into the overhead compartment on the flight home. Everybody wins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack sighed, \"Guys, I asked them five times since we walked through the front gate. They're not budging. They said if I asked one more time, they're leaving us at the hotel tomorrow and taking Brandon alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys all groaned. The entire vacation was like this. Everybody was at each other's throats. It was now day five of Zack's vacation, but Brandon had so far dictated everything they got to do, see, and experience. Zack wasn't happy. His friends weren't happy. And Brandon didn't mean it, but he knew he was making them unhappy. This made him unhappy, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's an important rule at Disney World that isn't listed anywhere. It's not listed, but it's the most important rule at the park. And everybody must follow it. Simply,  Nobody is allowed to be unhappy. Sometimes it's as simple as employees making the visitors smile, or giving them a free treat. Other times, as the boys were about to discover, this meant more drastic actions.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't until Zack's parents looked up from their park map that anyone noticed his absence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying their best to remain calm, Brandon's mother went off to find a park employee to help search. His father orchestrated a plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay boys, split up into pairs, fan out and try to find him. He couldn't have gotten far.\" A creeping smile gave away Zack's delight. \"And remember, you're looking for Brandon. No rides. Text one of us when you find him.\" The boys all agreed, but silently, they all had the same idea. If they would happen to stumble upon Brandon, great. Until then, they had full freedom to roam around the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Aaron paired off with Joe to search half of Epcot, while Zack paired off with Matt to search the other half. Surely, Brandon would be fine in Disney World of all places. In the meanwhile, they could have some fun. Somebody would eventually find him. There were thousands of cameras all over the park and hundreds of dedicated employees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd soon, there would be five more.</span></div></div>",

Not that Matt was actively helping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's ditch and go on Test Track,\" Matt implored Zack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Matt, we promised my dad we'd at least try and look for Brandon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll be fine. He's at the world's biggest playground. He's probably having the time of his life. Let's go do something fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know, he's probably fine, but we gotta at least try and find him. Let's at least stay at the World Showcase, all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, fine,\" Matt said, tucking his hair behind his ears. It had been a few weeks since his last haircut, but he didn't think it had been that long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was contemptuously silent as they wandered around the British pavilion. He didn't care about such... such... well, maybe he was just having a bad day. He was so concerned with Brandon and the five bad days at Disney, he never stopped to consider today was a brand new day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt took another look around. And voila, the World Showcase wasn't so bad. The pavilion was nice, although a tad cliche. The facades of the buildings triggered a strange sense of deja vu. Why European cafes and promenades were registering such joie de vivre was uncertain. It's as though the theme park had carte blanche over what he considered the creme de la creme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many odd word choices, Matt thought to himself. He was feeling odd. It was his own brain, his own thoughts, but it wasn't his normal rationale. He shook his head in confusion, releasing his hair from behind his ears. His hair was indeed longer now. What's more, the deep brown locks seemed much lighter now, almost amber. Surely, just a mirage from la soleil et la chaleur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matty?\" asked Zack, not realizing he used such an effete nickname, \"are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Matty said. \"I feel d'accord, mais... non, I'm okay.\" He corrected himself. Zack just shrugged off the gibberish, assuming it was more grousing about Brandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's keep looking for Brandon,\" Zack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oui,\" said Matty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we. You're not worming your way out of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they crossed the bridge into the French pavilion, Matty's shoes began to change. The tongue and laces of his sneakers wisped away with each step, leaving the top of his feet exposed. A few steps more, and his socks disappeared too. Had anyone cared to look at the young man's feet, they would have noticed he was wearing red, slip-on flats.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The French pavilion filled Matty with a sense of what could only be described as nostalgia. Something about it's simulated cobblestone streets and the fake Eiffel Tower made his heart swell with pride. Strange, as he had never left the United States in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's tres belle, isn't it?\" Matty asked Zack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess so,\" Zack said, though he wasn't looking at the park. Something about his friend seemed strange. Not just his hair, not just his speech, but his appearance. His face looked different. A little older, as though he were in college, not high school. But his body remained unchanged, no taller, no more buff, and not hairier. If he was getting older, why didn't he look any more mannish? It must be some sort of side-effect from being tanned under the hot Florida sun, Zack reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, regarde!\" Matty ran up to a shop selling pastries and desserts. Zack couldn't help but smile. It was certainly a change from Matty's previously sullen demeanor. Maybe it was time for a little snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two waited in line, sizing up the various options in the display case. Everything looked so good. Yet with the incredibly high theme park prices, not to mention the high fat and sugar content, they knew they could only afford one each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack chose a chocolate eclair, mostly because it was the only one he could pronounce. Matty opted for a strawberry mille-feuille, which he was able to order with perfect affectation. When they received their desserts, Zack reached for his wallet, only to have his hand swatted away by Matty. He opened his wallet to produce a credit card. With a quick glance, Zack realized something was wrong with Matty's ID. It didn't look like any learner's permit he had ever seen before. It was all pink and purple, and the photo on it didn't look anything like Matty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair found a table and began to dine. Zack, hungry from the anticipation, took one giant bite of his eclair. Matty held his layered pastry daintily between one finger and thumb. The little bite he took was still enough to make his eyes roll back in delight. He adjusted himself in his seat as his hips started ballooning out. With each bite, his rear end grew wider. Past 32 inches. Then 34. Finally, with one last sugary nibble, Matty's behind was an ample 36 inches. His pants accommodated his new wider physique, but Matty paid the changes no mind except for an occasional shift in his seat, whenever demanded by his growing derriere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Matty,\" Zach said, \"you've got a little...\" he motioned to his lips. Matty had a little strawberry drizzle still on his lips. Matty attempted to wipe it off, only to smear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better?\" he asked. Zack shook his head. Matty tried again, vigorously wiping his mouth with his napkin, only to smear it further. Zack found it funny how bad a job he was doing. After a certain point, Matty's lips were completely covered. His mouth was a bright, glossy red. Zack lied and said he got it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up from the table, Matty adjusted the hem of his shirt, trying to adjust to his new pear-shaped physique. His changes were becoming more pronounced and unmistakable. Somebody was about to notice things were amiss.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zack took the wax paper and napkins leftover from the snacks, dropping them in a nearby trash can. Walking back to the table, he was confused. The crowds were large, but he assumed Matty would hold onto the table a little longer. Instead there was a strange person sitting there. Zack could only see the back of her head, blonde hair down to her collar. There was no point bothering the stranger. Zack instead looked around for where Matty went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon,\" a strange man said. He spoke with a thick French accent. \"Eef ah could, a minute of your time, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now,\" Zack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange man held up his hand in defense. \"Ah am a portrait arteest for ze park. Ah make peectures of ze guests. Eef you are interested, ah have made a portrait of you and your... Is she your mother? Your aunt?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack looked at the man's picture. There was a caricature image of himself seated at the table. But the strange woman he was partnered with was a mystery. Who was that sitting across from Zack in the image? Certainly no one he had ever met before. Though her face did look somewhat familiar. Particularly the red lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack almost involuntarily turned his head to the strange lady at the table. She had turned around to eavesdrop on the conversation. \"Ooh, tres bien,\" she said. The woman at the table looked exactly like the woman in the portrait. Except it wasn't a woman. Not yet, anyways. It was Matty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCertain parts of his boyhood identity remained, such as his eyes and nose, but not much else was there. His hair was longer now, past his collar and honey blonde.. Any muscle definition he had was gone, leaving a willowy frame. His face was softer, his mannerisms were more delicate. He wasn't just turning into a girl, but a woman. How much further would this transformation go? How much of the original Matty was left?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack grabbed Matty's hand and pulled him out of the crowded cafe, looking for a more private area to discuss their situation. As he did, he felt Matty's soft, smaller hand. No teenage boy had hands like that. Zack could almost feel the pointed fingernails growing. Matty said something, possibly in protest or confusion, but Zack didn't listen. All he did hear was the portrait artist shouting as he left: \"Eef you change your minds, preents are $25, available until ze park closes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Zack backed Matty against a wall so that he could see the full effects of the transformation. He looked to be in his early thirties now. His square jaw was filed down into a diamond chin. His shorts were pulled up over his navel, splotchy in color between their original red color and their new royal blue. The legs were flaring out, like a pair of culottes. His tee shirt remained unchanged, but was now tucked in. He was definitely more woman than boy now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maddy,\" Zack said, unaware of the shift in identity, \"I need you to calm down. Something super weird is going on. Do you even recognize yourself right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhysically breaking away from Zack's grip, Maddy looked down. To him, he looked the same. \"J'ai l'air bien,\" he said, in a much higher voice. \"Tu est compl\u00e8tement \u00e0 l\u2019ouest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maddy, stop. You're speaking French. I can't even understand you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Qu'est-ce que c'est? Je ne parle pas fran\u00e7ais.\" Maddy placed his manicured hands on his enlarged hips, thrusting his chest forward in defiance. It was flat for now, but Zack feared it wouldn't be much longer. The u-neck was already starting to expand outward. He could see more of Maddy's shoulders and clavicle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddy tapped his foot, waiting for a response from Zack. Zack continued staring, seeing the loose fitting tee become more snug with each passing second. The logo on the front was fading into nothingness. Zack stared in shock, not admiration. Not that Maddy could tell the difference. Despite having no breasts, Zack's prolonged, unapologetic gaze towards Maddy's chest was still rude. He slapped Zack in his face, swept his bangs out of his eyes, and stormed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am\u00e9ricains...\" he grumbled, walking off in a huff.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the large mass of park-goers, it was difficult to keep track of one person. Much less one person who's personage was changing. Zack shoved his way through throngs of families, around children, under balloons, trying his best to follow Maddy. The park was simply too big and there were too many people. Zack almost resorted to shaking down every blonde woman he saw. One of them had to be Maddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse-moi,\" came a voice behind him. \"Are you lost?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maddy?\" Zack said with a shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I 'elp you find your freends? Your familee?\" Maddy's brain was being overridden with park protocol. Maddy wasn't just an adult. She wasn't just a woman. She was an ambassador of The Walt Disney Company. That meant being helpful and cheerful at all times. And this little boy seemed especially troubled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack stood bewildered at the image before him. Gone was the muscle-bound hothead who had dreams of playing college football. In his place was a woman. She had breasts now. They weren't huge, but they were there. He tried not to stare. He couldn't risk Maddy storming off again. They were nestled quite cozily inside a white, form-fitting top. Little cap sleeves covered her shoulders, and a scoop necline gave them just enough air to breathe. It was Disney World, after all. Nothing tasteless allowed. Especially from the staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skirt had billowed out, forming a nice bell shape. A sharp royal blue, vibrant and striking. The hem bounced playfully at the knee, sometimes catching the breeze of all the people walking by. It ended tapered at a slim, trim waist. Zack could see the indentation of her navel through the shirt's thin fabric. As they were speaking, her blonde hair was swept to the side, gathering together, forming a loose side-ponytail, draping casually over her right shoulder. The elastic band appeared from nothingness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maddy, come on, man. Think. There's still got to be a little bit left of you in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah am sorree, 'ave we met?\" Maddy's brain was overwhelmed with memories, flooding out all images of Zack. She saw thousands of people every day. One particular park guest triggering this kind of emotional response was especially odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to still be in there. We both flunked Mrs. Henderson's seventh grade math class and had to make it up in Summer School. Think back to last Halloween. We stayed up all night playing Nintendo. Think back to the hotel this morning. We all yelled at you for taking a twenty minute shower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne half of Maddy wanted to pull away from the young man, obviously delirious from the sun. The other half was enraptured by his presence. What exactly was he saying that had her so bewitched? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack stared the woman in the eyes. Trying to find his lost friend. Maddy stared back, trying to find any sort of truth in his words. She knew it was nonsense; in Grade 7, she was living on another continent. This boy wasn't even born yet. And yet, she somehow needed to believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Zack?\" she asked, almost trembling. \"Ah do not know what ees--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bright shimmer, Maddy's eyes shifted from their standard brown to a bright blue. Zack jumped back in shock at the sudden metamorphosis. Maddy blinked a few times, trying to regain her train of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you saying?\" Zack asked. \"Say it again. Say it, Maddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I... Ah am sorree. Ah must retoorn to work.\" Maddy walked off in with an air of determination. She was heading somewhere specific. Somewhere she needed to be, and promptly. Zack followed her, occasionally calling her name, trying to rescue her once more. But to no avail. He wasn't sure whether Maddy was ignoring him, or completely unaware of his presence. Maddy wasn't sure, herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two arrived at a little shop selling imported bottles of French wine. Maddy went inside, behind the counter. A work apron was there, waiting for her. She slipped it on, over her head. There, on one of the straps, was a nametag. \"Madeleine,\" it read. She smiled a beaming, toothy smile. Her teeth were polished, gleaming, and perfect. She made small talk with the guests, helping them choose the proper vintage for their tastes. If they asked, she'd point them towards the restrooms or park attractions, knowing full well the layout of the park where she has worked for fifteen years. Sometimes they'd ask about her native France, and she would recount details of the small village she grew up in. It was the amiable hospitality and superb customer service that was expected of Walt Disney World.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack tried his best to get Madeleine's attention from the door. Another park employee prevented him from entering. An unaccompanied fifteen year-old wasn't permitted inside a store that primarily sold alcohol. It was Florida law. Twenty minutes ago, the clerk running the register was an unaccompanied fifteen year-old boy. Not that you could tell from looking at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited, hoping something would happen. Maybe Madeleine would remember who she once was. Maybe the transformation would reverse itself. But the longer Zack spent staring, the less likely such a miracle would occur. There would be time later to freak out, panic, and question what exactly had happened. For now, he still had to find Brandon.</span></div></div>",

Joe was providing the commentary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you know that the intent of the World Showcase was to form governmental partnerships with their respective countries?\" Joe asked. \"The idea was, countries would pay for the development and maintenance of their pavilions. In exchange, they get to show everybody the beauty and culture of their country with a Disney seal of quality. And then after ten years, they could either continue the partnership or a new country could move in. But that idea was too complicated and fell through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, that's great Joe,\" Aaron said, half listening. The two were in the Japan pavilion now, and Aaron was entranced by the Taiko drummers. They were putting on quite an energetic presentation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe adjusted the sit of his Hawaiian shirt. The sun was getting higher, and the temperatures were getting warmer. \"Oh man, these guys are great,\" Joe said. \"You know what's weird though? That despite the traditional clothes, choreographed Taiko drumming was invented in the 1950s? I think that's cool how much of Japanese culture is a hodgepodge of past and present. Plus the future, I guess. Gundam robots are cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe could have been reading off the cure for cancer. Aaron wasn't listening. He was too busy watching the drummers. He didn't even notice Joe starting to shrink. His clothes started tenting, just hanging off his body as the teenage boy shrank down to a mere 5'1\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I like living in America, don't get me wrong,\" Joe said, \"But if I could live anywhere else, I think it would probably be Japan. I've never really considered it before. I always assumed it would be Ireland because, y'know, I'm Irish and I wouldn't have to learn a new language. But nah, there's a healthy tech industry, beautiful landscapes, a world-class environmental initiative, not to mention the entertainment industry. Yeah, Japan would be great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron still wasn't listening. He blocked Joe out completely. As Joe continued speaking, realizing his words were falling on deaf ears, he turned his attention elsewhere. He didn't stop talking, no. Joe was a fount of knowledge. He liked sharing it, whether anyone wanted to hear or not. If Aaron didn't want to hear it, that was his loss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Japanese don't even call their country Japan. They call it 'Nippon.' It's like when you use translation software online? And sometimes it works right, but sometimes it spits out gibberish. That's what happened. By the time westerners heard of the country, it got all muddled around, bouncing from language to language, turning from Nippon to Japan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe was talking with his hands more than normal. He usually kept them shoved in the pockets of his shorts, but now it felt wrong somehow. He was now accenting his speech and his thoughts with gentle hand movements, as though he was trying to engage a crowd. Had his hands been less animated, perhaps Joe would notice his skin softening and his nails growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of names, in Japan they don't have first names and last names. Well, I mean, they do, but not like we know them. The first name, the given name, comes last. The last name, the family name, comes first. Most Asian countries do that. Like for example, to the western world, I'm Joe O'Donnell. But in Japan, I'd be O'Donnell Joey. Though you'd still call me Joey like normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron wouldn't normally call him Joey. Nobody had called him Joey since he was four years old. For some reason though, he could only think of himself as Joey. That was his name. It wasn't five seconds ago, but it was now. Just as his normally tousled, wavy hair existed five seconds ago, but was now becoming straight.</span></div></div>",

It was built in the 7th century. It's a world heritage site. The real one, I mean. This one here opened with the park. Although, it should be noted, the blue roof is an aesthetic choice made by Disney to make the building more eye-catching from a distance.\" Gesturing grandly at the tower, Joey's short sleeves began elongating, reaching down to his elbows. They flapped around as he gesticulated, but Joey ignored them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued. \"And it looks particularly nice against the Japanese maples. All the trees in the World Showcase are non-native to Florida, but instead representative of their respective countries. Our groundskeeping staff works extra hard to compensate for the change in climate and soil.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our staff?\" Aaron asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean <i>the </i>staff. The Epcot staff. I must have misspoke.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drummers finished their show with a bow, and the crowd began to disperse. Most of the crowd, anyway. A small number of people surrounding Aaron and Joey stayed put. Aaron was slightly confused. Maybe there was another show starting? There didn't seem to be anybody coming onstage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should get going,\" Aaron said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right,\" Joey said. \"There's lots more to see. For example, to our right is a replica of the ceremonial hall of the Imperial Palace.The coronation and ceremonial halls are two of several buildings on the castle grounds, the home of the Japanese Emperor since Tokyo became the nation's capital in 1868.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey, did you Google all this or something?\" For as long as Aaron had known Joey, he had been a brainiac. He knew all sorts of stuff, but most of it was surface level. The kind of things they would ask in Trivial Pursuit. Aaron didn't peg him as an expert in any specific area, least of all the history of Japanese architecture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, I don't know. I watch a lot of game shows. I think it kind of snuck in,\" Joey explained with a smile. His skin looked different. Joey had always had rather fair skin, but now he was looking pale. Almost ivory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron shrugged it off. \"Do you want to go into the palace? I don't know what's in there, but--\" he stopped himself. Why even bother making an assumption when the facts were available. \"You know exactly what's in there, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes,\" Joey said. \"On the outside, the building resembles the Imperial Palace. On the inside, it is Mitsukoshi Department Store. There are many Japanese items available for sale inside. Let's take a look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron followed his friend as they walked towards the store. Looking up at the tall building, Aaron suddenly found himself staring directly into the sun. He had previously been in the shadow of a nearby tree. Now the sun hit his eyes almost directly. He blinked a few times, trying to recover. He saw a lot of spots, but through it all, he could have sworn he saw Joey's red shirt lighten in color to a hot magenta. </span></div></div>",

Joey made sure to use softer, slower gestures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey gracefully gestured with his right hand, allowing the grandeur of the store to be admired. He felt almost like a hula dancer with the slow, purposeful motions. Likewise, Joey felt subconsciously obligated to keep his fingers connected, pointing with his full hand. He reasoned that some cultures considered pointing fingers to be rude, and since he was at a tourist hotspot with visitors from many different nations, he should be courteous. He had convinced himself that utilizing the Disney Point, used by all other park employees, was a completely voluntary action. He couldn't stop if he tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey smiled as he presented the shop's interior. \"The Mitsukoshi Department Store is named after the oldest department store in the world, founded in 1673 in the city of Tokyo, then called 'Edo'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron was struck by the size of the complex. Disney World had no shortage of gift shops, but most sold souvenir clothes and plushies. This store was the size of a football field and had just about anything Japanese Aaron could imagine, short of Nissans and televisions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Joey,\" Aaron asked, \"do you think my girlfriend would like a parasol or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey stared ahead, almost indifferent to Aaron. \"Take a moment to admire the wooden sculpture in the center of the store. It is a replica of the carved cypress statue from the original store. It represents the corporate motto, 'Service With Sincerity'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's great. But seriously, do you think she'd want a paper fan? Maybe one of those kitten statues with the raised paws?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey, again, did not respond. \"If you are of legal age, be certain to experience the saki bar near the rear of the building.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey, man, would you knock it---\" Aaron was about ready to smack his friend upside the head, when he noticed his red lips standing in stark contrast to his fair skin. His hair was inky black and starting to drop past his ears. The hem of his Hawaiian shirt was longer now, reaching down almost halfway to his knees. Had it not been so loose and flowing, he may have noticed the slimming of his waist or widened hips. What was happening?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron stared at Joey, who seemed to be staring off at nobody in particular. More like he was observing the various shoppers as they milled around the store. Aaron realized they were the same people who were standing around them at the stage. Had they followed them both in? Seeing Joey undergoing some sort of identity crisis may have garnered some stares, but nobody seemed to be paying Joey any attention. And yet, they followed him all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jori,\" Aaron said, oblivious to the shift in name, \"what's with your... everything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prease, feer free to shop-u whire,\" Jori said, suddenly unable to pronounce their L's. \"We wirr continue in ten minutes-u.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJori returned to their silent observation of the store, hands neatly folded in front of them, crossed at the wrist. The pastel nail polish now matched the faint purple hue of Jori's shirt.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Aaron always considered himself a peacemaker, never trying to raise trouble. Sure, Jori needed help, but this was a rather unfortunate and embarrassing problem. The fewer people who were aware of his plight, the better. How would Aaron even bring up the subject? 'Help, my friend is turning into an Asian lady'? Aaron would be locked up in the loony bin. Indeed, Aaron decided, a calm and patient approach would be best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes wouldn't be that long. It was enough time to work out a plan. Maybe even figure out what's going on. Maybe even reverse it. Aaron milled around the store, hopelessly looking for any clue to his friend's predicament (not that he would ever find any), occasionally glancing at Jori's hexed state. By now, Jori's shirt was hanging lower than his shorts. He could be walking around pantsless for all Aaron knew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps Aaron was standing too far away, but the buttons on Jori's shirt seemed wrong. They were supposed to be fastened straight down from the neck, but they seemed angled now. They were going slantways, diagonally across the right breast. Had anyone noticed or cared besides Aaron, they would see Jori wearing a completely crooked and too long shirt. He looked like he was wearing some sort of tunic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ten minutes expired, Aaron regrouped around Jori and the growingly familiar group of strangers. He was running out of time. Jori's face was was now sporting folds and lines near their eyes and cheeks. Aaron hesitated to call Jori old, but even with soft skin and a delicate frame, it was apparent Jori was no longer a high school student. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jori,\" said Aaron, trying to get his friend's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kori, if you prease,\" Kori said with a smile befitting someone in the service industry. \"You have question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Aaron said, trying not to scream. \"Lots!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One rast stop-pu,\" Kori said. \"Prease continue out-se door-eh, to-se lake-u.\" As Kori turned to exit the door, a sash gathered itself around their waist. Not that Aaron was looking specifically there, he knew with certainty Kori's tunic was hanging loose off their diminishing frame. But then, unless his eyes were deceiving him, a bright blue sash was now holding the tunic tight against a remarkably narrow waist. That sash couldn't just be fastening the rear, could it? No, it could not. But where did it come from, if not materializing as Kori turned? Aaron hoped this final stop would be a short one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKori led the group out to the fence surrounding the large torii gate at the lake's edge. \"This gate is fashion after-se one found off-se coast of Itsukushima Isrand in southern Japan. Gates are common sight in Japan, usuarry seen at entrance to both Shinto and Buddhist shrines.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buttons on Kori's tunic were gone now; compressed closed by the sash around their waist. Not even the waist, but under the breasts. And Kori certainly had breasts now. They were small, but they weren't hiding. The floral Hawaiian pattern of Kori's original shirt was still present, but the pattern's background was now a soft mauve, accented by deeper blues along the hems, matching the sash. It was clearly silk now, with a distinct sheen under the sun. As the sleeves and hem extended further one final time, Aaron realized his friend was sporting an elegant kimono. On anyone else, it would be lovely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKori continued their well-rehearsed dialogue on Japanese culture and architecture. No longer mere trivia, this was an expertly rehearsed speech. The facts were recited with the kind of presence and confidence that only comes from practice. And Kori had practiced it. Kori had delivered this speech seven times a day, five days a week, 50 weeks a year, for the last fourteen years. At least, that's how she and everyone at Disney remembered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron had a history of tuning out Kori's many ramblings He was doing so now. Not that he was doing it for the same reason he normally would. Usually, Aaron was bored or disinterested. Now, Aaron was distracted, focusing on Kori's physical and mental changes. He wished he could focus. Even if it was a diminutive woman's voice with a strong Japanese accent, it could very well be the last time Aaron ever heard Kori speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKori's wrapping up her speech. Aaron probably has time for one carefully worded question. Where does Aaron talk to her?</span></div></div>",

Kori paid Aaron no mind, assuming he lingered to further admire the surroundings. Kori's next tour started in 30 minutes. With nothing to do in the meanwhile, Kori headed back to the cast members area for a short break. Aaron would have none of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, stop, don't go,\" He asked the departing woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So sorry, se tour is done,\" Kori said. \"If you have more question, a new tour wirr begin soon. Haruki-san is very knowledgeabre about park-u.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kori, please. I don't know how much more of this I can take. Look at your clothes. Your body. Your face!\" As Aaron pleaded with his friend, the last remnants of Kori's original form began to fade. Her eyebrows got thinner. Her nose became smaller. Her ears stuck out less, resting closer to the sides of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I do not understand...\" Kori muttered, becoming slightly scared at the tall American boy. He was becoming louder, and more aggressive. Kori had, unfortunately, encountered many American men who acted like this. But none ever said the words he was saying. All the same, she hoped a security guard would intervene soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're one of my best friends,\" Aaron said, his hands folded in desperation. \"Please tell me you're all right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I...\" Kori's fear began to melt away as strangely familiar memories of Aaron began to float to the surface. She didn't know the boy. She couldn't recall a single moment they had ever been together. If she had a thousand guesses, she would never recall his last name. But she knew him. And that was enough. \"I think I'm going to be fine, Aaron.\" She smiled. Not the ebulliant Disney employee smile, but a natural one. She breathed a contented sigh and closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron didn't know what to do next. Kori seemed to remember a little bit. More than she had before. Was it over? Was she done, or was she changing back? Or would it start again? Kori closed her eyes in a moment of tranquility. They were the same eyes Joe had this morning. When she opened them again, the folds around her eyes were gone, leaving them in an unmistakable Asian shape, slightly upturned, and remarkably beautiful. There was nothing left of Joey in body or in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe departed, walking back to the cast member's area. She had stopped for... something. She couldn't quite remember. An American boy wanted something? Yes, that was it. What was it? Something was right? No, more likely something was <i>to</i> the right. She must have been giving the boy directions somewhere. Most tourists need directions. Disney World is a big place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron was relieved his friend was safe, if not exactly present. But he was so close. Maybe he could try again. \"Stop,\" he said chasing after her. \"Joe, you love telling people things. You love answering questions. You can't resist. If you're still in there somewhere, you gotta answer me. Don't you know who you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who I am?\" she asked. What an odd question. Suddenly, it dawned on her. Of course! No wonder the poor boy was confused. She hadn't been wearing her name tag. Reaching into a pocket discreetly hidden on the kimono, she found the missing element. She was glad she could correct this mistake before a supervisor noticed. She was a dutiful employee of the park and hated getting into trouble. She affixed the name tag over her breast, showing it off so Aaron could clearly read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaori!\" Kaori read her name aloud with a smile. She posed, flashing a v-sign with her fingers, the way Japanese girls had done since she was a little girl. It was a little cliche, especially for a woman her age, but for whatever reason, the Americans really liked it. She typically posed this way whenever guests asked for photos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaori smiled, knowing she helped this American boy, and in return, he helped her. She opened a door marked 'cast members only' and stepped inside, never to be seen again. Aaron simply saw the back of her lavender kimono and jet-black bob disappear as the door closed behind her. Aaron considered chasing after her, but no. Apart from getting tackled by park security, it would just be a waste of time. Joe was Kaori now. Aaron wouldn't be saving his friend, he would just be terrorizing a Japanese lady who couldn't recognize him any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would be the normal thing to do in this situation? Cry? Scream? Run? Curse? Aaron looked around at all the happy families and couples and tourists. They were all having fun. He didn't want to ruin their vacation. Not that he could if he decided to. Aaron couldn't process what he just experienced. He walked off, nowhere in particular, his mind free of all things. He couldn't understand it, so he just didn't think of it. But it was so crazy, he couldn't think of anything else. He just started walking, hoping things would start making sense again soon.</span></div></div>",

How many people could be changing? Is everyone at least staying human?\" He pointed at a pair of squirrels running around the branches of a tree. \"Those squirrels could be your parents! Hi Mister and Missus Roman,\" he said, waving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock it off!\" Zack said, slapping his hand down. \"Look, if we're gonna save Joe and Matt, we gotta figure out what's going on. But we can't do it here. We're not safe here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do? Make a break for the hotel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. First we should split up. We were all grouped up this morning, and were fine. Matt and Joe changed when they paired up with us, right? Being in pairs must be dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. split up. Meet at the entrance. But, hey, Zack...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your parents are in a pair.

People paid top dollar and waited in lines for hours to see the wonders that Disney World offered. Brandon was seeing none of that. He was in the least desirable place in the entire park. Brandon was in the security office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young boy sat with his hands folded in his lap. He didn't mean to cause any trouble. He didn't mean to cause any harm. All he wanted was to find his family. He heard his brother and his friends being mean, so he took off, running in shame. He realized that was a mistake. He didn't know what to do after that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlone in the Mexico pavilion, he took a ride on the Gran Fiesta Tour. Brandon's family and their search party couldn't locate the boy, hidden away on the enclosed dark ride. While the remaining park staff were informed to look for a young, lost boy matching Brandon's description, the Gran Fiesta Tour ride operators never considered Brandon to be that boy. One eight year-old looked indistinguishable from another, and Brandon did not appear to be lost. The ride operators assumed he belonged to the family either in front of him or behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride made Brandon happy for a little while, but he was still an eight year-old lost child in a big, strange, unfamiliar place. He wanted to find his family. Being such a young age, Brandon was short in stature, easily intimidated, and didn't always think things through. There was no logical way to find his family amongst the thousands of strangers milling about. By his rational, he needed a better vantage point. And to get that, he needed to climb the giant Mayan pyramid sitting in the center of the pavilion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is when the security team found him. They immediately noticed an errant child climbing the structure despite the well-placed \"Do Not Climb\" signage surrounding the pyramid. They coaxed Brandon down, and quietly escorted him backstage, into the security office, all without disturbing the other park guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Brandon waited, sitting alone in the featureless detention room. If he was in trouble, he sure felt it. Was he going back to his parents? Back to the hotel? Was he kicked out of Disney World altogether? Goodness, was he under arrest? Brandon didn't know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, the security team who apprehended Brandon and the security team who were searching for Brandon would be in quick communication. Brandon's parents would be swiftly reunited with their child, politely reminded about stranger danger and park policies, and be sent on their way. The story would be a happy ending for Brandon then and there. Unfortunately, a technical glitch prevented the security staff's walkie-talkies from working properly. The problem was neither electrical or digital. It was caused by the same magical source that was turning boys into women. Brandon was left alone because Epcot needed Brandon alone. Epcot had plans for Brandon. </span></div></div>",

So much worrying had produced so little. Now his mind was stuck on the security office. The office was cold, sterile, bland, and boring. Brandon didn't dare move, and his mind kept playing tricks on him. For instance, every once in a while, he could swear the walls were moving. Not fast, but closing in on him all the same. He couldn't prove it, but with each passing minute the room seemed to be getting smaller. It was an illusion, though. The room was not getting smaller, he was getting bigger. By this point, the young boy had grown to age twelve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bench he was sitting on also seemed to be tormenting him. It was just wood and metal, but every so often, it felt as though it were cushioned. He would squirm and fidget out of impatience, and his eyes would be drawn down to the bench. Nothing about it should seem so plush. And in fact, nothing was. The bench, like the room, remained unchanged. The only difference was Brandon. His age and height were both increasing, but they were not alone. A taller Brandon meant a heavier Brandon. His rear end was collecting fatty deposits, swelling in size, providing the softness Brandon was experiencing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad Brandon not been preoccupied by his fear, he may have noticed one element of the office that had changed. The computer screen on the desk had shut down completely. It wasn't facing him, but the silence of the electrical stirring could have been noticed. The computer part of the computer was gone from underneath the desk. Vanished. Disappeared into thin air. All that was left was the monitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon felt a chill rush over his body. His outfit for Florida was a Mickey tee-shirt, some jean shorts, and a pair of black sandals. They were great for walking around in the muggy Florida heat, but in the air conditioned office, they were making him quite chilly. He rubbed his arms for warmth, noticing they felt more toned and muscular than he ever noticed before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of metal hitting metal snapped Brandon out of his bodily observation. He couldn't tell what had happened, but it sounded like something broke. Technically, it had. The armrests of the security guard's chair had fallen off. Not that they were damaged, it was simply the next change. They snapped off the metal frame and disappeared from the room before hitting the carpet. Brandon was tempted to investigate the sound, but was still afraid to leave the bench. The security guard was quite clear in his instructions: \"Wait here, don't move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Brandon waited. He waited, trying to ignore the changing room, oblivious to his changing body. Something was bound to happen sooner or later. He just didn't know what.</span></div></div>",

Now as his age crested to sixteen, they could rest flat on the floor while his back rested up against the wall. He was five feet tall now, which would be rather short for a 16 year-old boy, but Epcot had no plans on keeping him a boy much longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer a diminutive child, his clothes were now tight on his body. His body was growing, but his clothes were not. His tee-shirt showed off his navel and stomach, stopping just above his belly. The sleeves were tight on his shoulder, hardly even reaching down his arms. His shorts sat low on his waist and high on his thighs. He was much too young to carry a wallet (at least he was when he got dressed this morning), but it didn't matter now. There was no chance a wallet, or much of anything, would fit in the teeny pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes were slow and subtle, Brandon hadn't even noticed. Not that he didn't have the chance. The boredom was overwhelming, and Brandon decided he had had enough. He couldn't handle it anymore. However long he had been detained, it felt like days. He couldn't take it anymore. He had to do something. Maybe as long as he didn't do anything too loud or nosy, he wouldn't get in any trouble. Just to be safe, he'd avoid peeking in the desk or the supply closet. Although, he was curious about the desk. It looked like metal when he came in. Now it looked like it was wood, and painted white. He reasoned it was an optical illusion, and didn't think about it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon stood up off the bench. No alarms were going off. That was a good start. He took one step, then another. He was fine. He could have free range of the office. He breathed a sigh of relief. He looked around the room for any sort of distraction. Something on the floor caught his attention, hiding behind the wastepaper basket. It was bright red, and stood in stark contrast to the dull blue carpet. Somebody had left her purse behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe security guard was a burly, angry guy; this purse couldn't have belonged to him. Maybe another park guest was detained earlier today and left it behind? Possibly. But if there was a cell phone inside, Brandon could play a few games until the owner came back for it. And if the guard came back, Brendan could just drop it under the bench when he wasn't looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously, Brandon looked inside the purse. There was some lady stuff inside, which didn't interest him. But oh what luck, there was a cell phone hiding amongst the make-up. It was an iPhone with a pink rhinestone case. It was super girly, and Brandon felt kind of embarrassed holding it, but it was better than no phone at all. The funny part was, on the back of the phone, written in gold cursive, was the name \"Brendan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy would such a girly phone inside a lady's purse have a boy's name inscribed on it? More than that, it was almost his own name. It was an awfully big coincidence. Brandon was often called Brendan my mistake... wasn't he? It certainly seemed like something he remembered, but the longer he thought about it, the harder it was to recall. Why would he be object to being called Brendan? That was his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrendan turned on the cell phone, but no luck. It was password protected. He dejectedly put the phone back in the purse, but didn't put the purse back. He felt that he should, but didn't. He tried to reason why he should hold onto this purse any longer. What reason would a boy want a woman's purse? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe... Maybe he could find gum inside the purse. Women sometimes carried gum or breath mints in their purse, didn't they? Yes, he concluded. That was a good answer. Brendan could keep the purse because he was looking for candy inside. Brendan joyfully opened the purse again, digging around, looking for anything sweet. As he rested the purse on his thigh he didn't even notice how daintily he crossed his legs at the knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rummaged through the cosmetics, thinking he succeeded, but no. What he thought was candy was just a bottle of mint colored nail polish. The same color which was, at that moment, beginning to appear on his toenails. Brendan paid his feet no mind. He didn't even notice. How often does one look at their feet anyway? Not often. Brendan hadn't even noticed his black, velcro sandals had become white, strappy sandals with a buckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing in this purse for Brendan, but still, he held onto it a bit longer. He wasn't holding it, he just kept it by his side. For some reason, he felt a little more comfortable with it by his side. He didn't want to have a purse, but he felt as though he ought to keep it. In case the owner came looking for it, he reasoned. \"I found your purse,\" Brendan would say, and she would say \"Thank you, Brendan,\" and Brendan would be a hero. Despite his body aging past age 18, he was still thinking like an eight year-old.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brendan stood up and stretched, arching his back, letting his taught tummy strain as new muscles formed in his abdomen. Not an overwhelming six-pack, but enough to highlight his slim, trim physique as his waist pulled inwards, giving him a flat belly. Kegel muscles were also developing, though they were dormant for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrendan itched at his chest. His shirt, as tight and form-fitting as it was, was still rather comfortable. Until now, it felt like a second layer of skin. But now there was some irritability. He couldn't quite describe it. It was as though there was a sock, leftover from the laundry, tucked under his shirt. Except the sock was squirming around his body like a hamster through a maze. And every now and then, there would be a rough poke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bra that was forming around Brendan's flat chest needed room to grow and expand. But Brendan's childish fidgeting made the process unignorable. The underwire couldn't help but prick him. If he had simply sat still, this process would be over and done with fast and painlessly. Just as simply as his briefs shifted into panties mere moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreparing to return to the bench, Brendan was shocked to discover it was missing. The spot where it once sat was empty. It were as though the bench were sucked up into the wall. How could a piece of furniture up and vanish, he wondered. He was oblivious to the office chair's wheels disappearing, it's central swivel-component becoming rigid, splitting into four individual feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrendan was getting sick of this. It was one thing to keep him locked up in a security office, but now this room was turning into some sort of fun house. He wasn't going to stand for this one minute more. He went over to the door, finding it to be locked. He pounded on the door, demanding to be heard. \"Hello!?\" he shouted to nobody. \"Can ennyone hear me? Jou neet to open dis door right now. Sometheen weirt is going on. I... I... \" Brendan gasped at his own voice. As much as he tried, he couldn't bring himself to speak correctly anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe he could call for help. The phone was still locked, but he remembered 911 calls could always be made in an emergency. He didn't know if 911 could help him, or if they would even believe him, but he was going to try anyways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached into the purse for the phone once again. As he reached, the various baubles in the purse arranged themselves in a precise way. As Brendan's hand reached inside, it aligned perfectly with two bracelets and a ring. But he didn't care about the bangles or the shiny stone adorning his hand. He needed assistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could dial, a text message popped up. \"D\u00f3nde est\u00e1s?\" it said. Brendan didn't speak Spanish. He didn't know who this was, or what they were saying. \"No estas lista?\" a second message said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrendan felt like he was going to faint. His mind was rushing, filling with dread, and it felt as though his head was getting heavier by the second. In fact, it was. His hair was growing rapidly. Wavy tresses were stretching down the back of his neck, turning dark, mahogany brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nowhere else to rest, he sat himself down on what was once the office chair. Brendan didn't care anymore what the officer thought. After all, Brendan was now in his mid-20s, and practically the same age as the guard who arrested him. He wasn't afraid of the little pendejo anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat down on the backless chair, surprised at how high up we was sitting. It was more like a stool than a chair. He faced the monitor, which was now almost three feet across and four feet high. He had never seen a computer monitor this size in his life. And why would he? No one would need a monitor like this. Brendan could partially make out his reflection in the screen. It looked awfully dark. Monitors weren't designed to be reflective, it was just a byproduct. Brendan was surprised at what he saw. He was definitely taller, and lean. He was older, and his hair was longer. But something was amiss. Was he not supposed to look like this? If only he could see more clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifted up his sunglasses. Brendan forgot he was wearing them. In fact, two seconds ago, he wasn't. But with the monitor no longer being a monitor, and the desk no longer being a desk, there needed to be some reason why Brendan could not see himself in a vanity mirror. It made more sense that Brendan was wearing sunglasses indoors than anything else. And so, Brendan was wearing sunglasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he perched the oversized sunglasses on his head, with their thick white frames and dusky tinted lenses, he could suddenly see much better. The monitor finished shifting into a mirror, and Brendan could see himself properly. His narrow face with a pointed chin, his elegant nose, his thick, full lips. That was his face. He couldn't imagine any other. What he saw was real to him, and not strange in the slightest. Neither was his golden honey skin, shining with a warm tan glow. The kind of pallor that couldn't be gained by a week in the sun, but only by genes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother notification from the phone. There were three messages now. Brendan read them again. \"D\u00f3nde es you?\" said the first. \"Not es you lista\" was the second. Then came the third, the new one: \"Casi es la hora\" it said for a brief second. Brendan must have blinked, because he looked again and it said \"Casi es la time.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brendan fiddled with the phone a little bit, feeling a ever more comfortable holding it in his hand. He rubbed the pink rhinestones, feeling the embossed lettering on the back. Six letters were solidly affixed. The seventh, the final N, was peeling right off. It was no more secure than a sticker on a piece of wet fruit. As Brendan unknowingly rubbed the errant letter from its position, it flaked away, leaving the name \"Brenda\" in its place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone vibrated once again. Another text message. \"Llegas tan late! Get dressed ahora.\" Brenda looked down at his clothing. He was dressed. Granted, the crop top and hotpants he was wearing were different than the shorts and tee he was wearing an hour ago, but they were still clothing. He was dressed, wasn't he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over at the storage locker. What was once a cold, metal cabinet for office supplies was now a bright wardrobe, matching the vanity in style and color. Curious, Brenda opened the wardrobe up to find what was inside. Sure enough, there was an outfit waiting for him. Wrapped in plastic, freshly laundered and pressed, hanging from the closet rod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda removed the dry cleaning bag and was shocked to find a white dress with embroidered flowers. This had to be some sort of joke, he rationalized. The room, the furniture, the purse, the phone, and now a dress? It had to be a joke. Somebody was recording him, surely. He would be a laughingstock on Youtube in a matter of hours. He threw the dress on the floor and returned to the vanity, crossing his arms in a huff. They would have to get up pretty temprana in the ma\u00f1ana to fool him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took another look at himself in the mirror. His caramel skin, his pouty lips, his dark hair, his long hairless legs, his wide hips, his dainty hands and feet... What would he ever be wearing a dress for? It was ridiculous. He looked again. He began to see the cracks around his eyes, the lines around his smile, the splotches on his skin. His age was creeping into the early thirties, and the telltale signs of aging were coming with it. And along with the physical signs were the mental conditioning. Just as Brenda hadn't noticed his developing adult body, he didn't notice he was thinking like a 32 year-old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda looked down at his outfit. The tight shorts showing off his plump rear. The belly on display for the world to see. More skin than a person his age should be exposing. At a family theme park, no less. What had he been thinking? This outfit may have been stylish in his teenage years, it may have been trendy in his twenties, but for someone his age, it was awfully tacky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe he should change. No, he definitely should change. It wouldn't be so bad to wear a dress, would it? What was a dress anyways? A permanently closed bathrobe, basically. He was alone, somewhere private. No one was around to judge him. And of course nobody was recording him. That would be simplemente loco. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda walked back to the wardrobe, picking the outfit off of the floor. The cheap, commercial-grade carpeting had softened to a plush white. It almost matched the dress, except the carpet was further changing, taking on a pinkish tint. Brenda undid the button on his shorts and shimmied the garment down his legs. The gyration of his hips as he wiggled loose the tight clothes would unnerve any onlooker. His privates were still noticeable through the front of his panties, bulging out unmistakably. Aside from the bulge, Brenda's lower body was the envy of any woman and the desire of any man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shirt came next. Brenda tucked his thumbs under the cap sleeves, careful not to scratch himself with the elongated nails. He pulled straight up, getting the tee ensnared in his hair. He tossed the teeny Minnie Mouse shirt onto the floor with his shorts. He ruffled his hair, trying to get the wavy locks to fall back into order. His hair reached his shoulders now, and was super thick. Thick, but luxurious. Even under fluorescent light, it shone and glistened like onyx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bra on Brendan's body was strapless, bound tight around his flat chest. With no breasts to support, it simply felt like a belt he was wearing far too high on his body. He didn't remember putting a bra on this morning, but Brenda was having trouble remembering a lot of things. His name, his age, his home, his family, how he got to the park... He had ideas. He had vague recollections. But the hazy memories that were fading were in stark contrast to the new identity rapidly forming. It confused him too much, so he didn't think about it all. He just admired how good the virginal white bra and panty set looked against his mocha skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe undid the zipper in the back of the dress and stepped inside. He hesitated for a moment, as if some little voice in the recesses of his mind was compelling him to stop. He laughed it off and pulled the dress up. The dress fit rather oddly with no straps to go over his shoulder and no bust to support it. But with some careful positioning, he managed to keep it in position as he pulled the zipper shut. He felt the zipper caress his backside as it was drawn upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dress was pure white, cleaned to perfection by the Disney World laundry service. The embroidered flowers popped in contrast with vivid red, violet and yellow hues. The skirt was tiered, ornamented with lacy frills that shuffled and shifted as he moved. He secretly liked the way it sounded and played with his outfit for a few moments. A flouncy ruffled layer fell from under his arms, draping down over his chest, hiding his lack of breasts. A similar ruffled layer sat just above his sandals. Brenda looked himself up and down. He looked so good. Why was he ever so apprehensive about wearing a dress?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brenda sat down at the vanity. He picked up the phone and typed in the four digit passcode without thinking. He fully intended to reply to the mystery individual. He wanted to type, \"I'm ready to go. Whenever you're ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem was, as Brenda sat there, phone in hand, he had a hard time parsing the words. Some of them he knew. 'I'm,' 'to go,' and 'you're' were easy enough. But the rest he had to stop and think about. He knew the words, he was saying them in his head, but his fingers weren't typing them. It was almost as though he had difficulty spelling them. But that wasn't quite it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the phone, trying to formulate the sentences properly, when a lock of hair cascaded down over his eye. He brushed it back like second nature, but caught a glance of himself in the vanity mirror as he did. The woman staring back wasn't him. He slowly turned, trying to realize exactly what had happened. This wasn't him. This wasn't his hair. This wasn't his face. Those weren't his hands. This wasn't his body. He was supposed to be an 8 year-old boy, not some 36 year-old woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soy una womeen!\" Brenda shrieked. He threw his hands up to his mouth, surprised at his own voice. The accent, his vocabulary, his tan skin, it was all making sense. He wasn't just a woman, he was a Mexican woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no, no...\" he repeated to himself. His hands shot to the back of his dress, determined to remove the vile garment. This fingers tried with great futility to liberate him, but he simply could not find the zipper. It was nestled somewhere between his shoulder blades, but he either couldn't reach it, or could not be found among the draping collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought struck Brenda. The dress had no sleeves or collars. He could simply pull it off, up over his head. Like a giant shirt. Brenda grabbed the hems of the tiered skirt and pulled upwards. Had he not been alone in the dressing room, everyone would be in full view of his panty-clad legs.He struggled and groaned as he tried to get the flowing mass of fabric up over his head. Between all the fluffing material and the tightness around his waist, Brenda simply couldn't make any progress. He dropped the skirt down. He sat down at the vanity again. He looked at himself in the mirror in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was red from all the physical exertion, but now he looked even older. Almost 40. He was older than his mother. How much older was he going to get?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock at the door. Somebody finally realized Brenda was trapped inside. He would finally be free of this prison. He bounded up, racing to the door, opening it with a big toothy smile. He never once considered what was waiting for him on the other side.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brenda opened the door. Four ladies were staring at him, smiling. All were wearing dresses exactly the same as his. \"Ahi you are,\" said one of them. \"Vamanos. Estaremos late,\" said another. Brenda understood what they were saying, but was recognizing fewer English words. They wanted him to come with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to protest. Metamorphosing into a stranger was terrifying in private. To do so surrounded by others was much worse. Were these people also changed the way he was? No, he realized. These were real women. And he looked just like them. He was dressing like them. He was talking like them. Now he was expected to act and intermingle with them. He wasn't just changing, he was being assimilated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ladies, actually, had no idea about what the park was doing to the boy. As far as they knew and remembered, Brenda was always a coworker. Brenda worked for Epcot longer than any of them, and at age 40, was their superior. It was why they all shared a dressing room while Brenda had one to himself. Their hands were clean. They had no idea today was a strange day for Brenda or anyone else. To them, the only oddity was Brenda's reluctance to get changed and meet them on time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda tried to evade his coworkers and make excuses why he couldn't leave. The ladies wouldn't accept his pleas. Two grabbed his arms and began pulling him. The other two pushed his shoulders, encouraging him to walk. Brenda took one last look over his shoulder at the dressing room. Any indications it had once been a security office had long disappeared. His purse, cell phone and other personal belongings were safely locked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive raven-haired women walked through the corridors to the park. One walked much more reluctantly and unwillingly. The loose bodice of his dress was becoming tighter as the mammary glands beneath his skin grew. He had breasts now. They were small for a woman his age, but far too big for the little boy he was supposed to be. Try as he might, Brenda was having a harder and harder time remembering his old life. He couldn't remember his friends, or his bedroom, or what state he lived in. He remembered other things now, like how to use a curling iron, and attending ESL classes, and where his car was parked in the staff parking lot. How old was he supposed to be? A child, he was sure, but the real number was long lost. He could only remember the number 43. Brenda cringed, realizing he was now older than his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Por qu\u00e9 est\u00e1s acting so rara, Brilmda?\" One of the girls asked. He knew exactly why he was acting weird, but how could he explain it? These women were thinking so little of him at the moment, and he didn't want to make it worse. And what did 'Brilmda' mean? It didn't sound like any English word, but he knew it wasn't Spanish. Oh no, Brilmda realized, his name had changed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrilmda needed to calm down and compose himself. Yes, he was in a bad situation, but drawing attention to himself wasn't helping. He gently pulled his hands out of the women's grips and walked, matching the gait of his colleagues. His enunciated hip movement couldn't be seen beneath the dress, but he could feel them naturally rolling with each step. As age lines grew around his eyes and on his forehead, he wondered just how far his changes would go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women surrounding him were chatting, laughing, sharing stories of their families and friends. All in fluent Spanish. Brilmda kept up with every word and detail. He didn't dare join in. His changes were only skin deep. He could reverse this somehow, he convinced himself. He had to fight any mental changes. He focused on his interests. Riding his bike down really big hills. Playing soccer after school was over. Bringing sangria to the neighborhood picnic. No! Playing video games in the basement. Watching LPs on Youtube. Day trips to the outlet mall for shoes and earrings. No! Playing with the neighbor's puppy. Gorging on pizza and wings. N-no? Driving to the Indian casino and playing the slots. Singing along to Selena while stuck in traffic. Sunday Night Wrestling on TV. No! Paint your own pottery classes. Book clubs with trashy romance novels. Saturday afternoons at the Go-Kart track. No!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ladies stopped walking. Brilmda, not paying attention bumped into the young lady in front of him. Brilmda recognized the door. The theme park was on the other side of the door. The women all adjusted their hair, checked their outfits, and made sure their dresses sat right on their bosoms. Taking the hint, Brimlda did the same. Although his dress still seemed rather loose on his B-Cups, it sat as properly as it possibly could. There would be no slippage, and that was the important part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ladies donned big, cheesy Disney smiles and walked through the door. They had kept the Disney World crowds waiting long enough.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brilmda tried to calm himself as he moved through the crowd of people. Flanked on all sides by identically dressed women, he couldn't flee if he wanted. He was so mortified, he didn't dare risk drawing attention to himself. His outfit was conservative (it was Disney World, after all), but was still a strapless dress. He felt so exposed. His legs, his breasts, and his hips were all modestly covered, but still visible enough to paralyze him with fear. He hated this. He didn't want anyone to see him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls kept walking until they reached an alcove by the pathways. A mariachi band was playing an upbeat song, entertaining the gathering crowd. The women lined up in front of the band, taking a pose as the band finished their current song. Brilmda finally realized what was expected of him. He was supposed to be a dancer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrilmda didn't know how to dance. He had never danced before, especially not to such foreign music, and doubly so not as a woman. And now he was here, in public, in front of dozens of people, expected to perform. And he was wearing a dress. There was no way out. Brilmda tried to usher himself to the far end of the dance line. Maybe if he was on the outskirts, fewer people would notice him. The other ladies, confused by this action, ushered him back to the center of the stage. Brilmda was sunk. Not only was he on display, not only was he expected to dance, he was supposed to be the leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe band began playing. What could he do? Brilmda was stuck. He resigned himself to his fate. Just move to the music, try not to trip, and maybe nobody will notice too much. They were all tourists. They wouldn't know what authentic Mexican dancing looked like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrilmda grabbed the hem of her dress with one hand and let the draping layers of her underskirts show. The dress was full; he would need to purposefully trip to even expose the slightest bit of skin above his knees. He rhythmically waved his hand around, letting the motion of his outfit move kinetically with the music. The linen fabric and embroidered flowers felt so familiar between his fingertips, as though he had felt such a thing every day for thirty years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he saw growing smiles from the audience, he began to incorporate hip movements and leg movements. As he spun, he saw the two women to his left matching his movements. He spun around again, the other direction. The two women to his right were also in step. Brilmda had no idea what was happening. He was supposed to be making everything up off the top of his head. How could this all be choreographed? Was he somehow doing this correctly? How could he possibly be dancing such a perfect baile folklorico?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't stop to think. He got this far without thinking, it would get him the rest of the way. Thinking would only distract him. He just kept twirling his skirt and moving his feet along with the music. He let himself get lost in the music. Dancing and twirling to the delight of an audience. And a new audience, every day. An audience who would never get bored, who would always want to see more. What a delightful task it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrilmda kept dancing, kept twirling, and kept smiling. He didn't care anymore if anyone thought it was foolish. He didn't care he was on display. He didn't even pay any attention to the weight of his breasts, full and heavy, sagging, as their natural perkiness diminished in middle age. They were his breasts. He had them since he was a teenage girl. Why pay them attention now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the song stopped, the ladies posed. Beneath her toothy smile, Brilmda deftly wheezed, trying to catch her breath before the next song began. At just past 50, her spirit and energy were as vivid as ever, but her body was slowing down. She could still dance better than any of her coworkers, and she had no plans of retiring soon. She just needed an extra moment to let her aching joints and tired muscles rest, that's all. With each shallow inhalation, Brilmda could feel tightness in her waist. It was her control-top panties, snapping back into position amidst all the sweat, the agitation of the dance, and the disappearance of any exterior organs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little girl in the front row said something to Brilmda. \"Yurp ridd he,\" she said. Brilmda didn't know what that meant. She tried to think about it. She had to translate the words in her head. \"Eres bonita\" she eventually decoded. That's what the girl meant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrilmda wanted to thank her, but felt uncomfortable saying the word \"gracias\" to the child. She might not understand. Brilmda tried to think of a way to express his feelings in a satisfactory way. \"Thane queue,\"  she said to the child. The child beamed in delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wutt zyorn aim?\" the child asked. \"Cu\u00e1l es tu nombre?\" Brilmda deduced. \"Me llamo Brilmda,\" she wanted to say. \"Mine aim hiss Brimelda,\" she said. Her name sounded odd. Speaking two languages often made certain things sound odd. It's not as though her name was magically changing. That would be ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe music started again. Brimelda waved goodbye to the little girl and fell back in line. She grabbed the hem of her skirt and began dancing once again. She loved this. She wanted everyone to see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone's about to find Brimelda. Who is it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The crowd shifted in size. Patrons were coming and going, watching the scene, enjoying the music, then moving on. But such theme park entertainment is designed to be temporary. Park guests are attracted to certain areas at certain periods for certain amounts of time. This draws crowds to shops and restaurants in the area, and away from overcrowded attractions and paths. Disney World was like a machine, and Brimelda and the girls were just another cog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter fifteen minutes, the mariachis took a bow, the ladies waved goodbye, and all retreated back to the employee area. It was important to relax and cool off between sets. Brimelda was perused by a security guard as she retreated. At first, he seemed unimportant. Just another face. Then Brimelda started to remember him more and more. Memories of him formed as a common figure in Brimelda's life, just like everyone in the Mexico pavilion. They were her coworkers, she saw them every day. Still, this particular security guard seemed unique. The closer he got, the more important the man felt. As though he had a very large role in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Brimelda,\" said the guard. Brimelda was happy to speak with someone who spoke her language. She didn't have to translate anything in her head before she talked. \"I heard you got in a little late today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's so strange. I don't know what happened. I must have lost track of time. One minute, I'm going about my day, the next, the girls are texting me, asking where I am, and practically knocking down the door to my changing room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. You're a hero to them. They don't want to see you fired. Speaking of which, don't let the boss see you without your name tag.\" He pulled a name tag from his pocket, giving it to the flustered dancer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Imelda</i>\" it said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pinned it above her left breast, careful it wouldn't get lost in the folds of the fabric. As she did, an unyielding pressure came from behind Imelda's eyes. If felt like someone blew sand in her face. She clamped her eyelids in pain, but the stinging sensation disappeared instantly. Her uncharacteristic blue eyes had turned dark brown, completing the last physical change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you talk with mom last night?\" the guard asked. \"What did she say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImelda nodded with a smirk. \"She said she and dad would be flying in on the thirteenth. They're staying at the resort, but skipping the parks. Then she went on, as usual, chastising me for never getting married and having kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They mean well, but they come from another era. They want you to be happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's annoying,\" Imelda said. \"I thought you having kids would get them off my back, finally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, you know mom. You were her favorite. When you moved to America, she was in tears. When I moved here, she didn't even take me to the airport.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's agree that we're happy to see dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two shared a laugh and parted ways. Imelda was happy to work with her little brother, Diego. As an immigrant, she spent years trying to fit into a strange new country. It took a long time, and it wasn't easy. Ten years later, her brother moved to Florida. She sponsored his immigration, got him a job in the park, and helped him acclimate. It was a luxury she never had. And since then, Diego got married, fathered four kids, earned many promotions, and knew it was all thanks to the love and hard work of his big sister. He would be nothing without her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImelda's eyes turned to the giant pyramid. Had Imelda known the events which transpired a mere hour ago, she would remember the significance. Diego was tasked with apprehending a young boy who was climbing the pyramid. The kid's parents were nowhere to be found, so the delinquent was locked inside the security guard's office until they could be located. But the boy and the office disappeared along with all memories of the incident. Diego would be figuratively nothing without Imelda. But Imelda would be literally nothing without him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime to transform someone new. Two boys left. Who's turn is it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Aaron tried to blend into the crowd as best he could. Maybe he wouldn't transform if he couldn't be found. If he ran too fast, it would be suspicious. They'd find him immediately. But if he walked too slow, he would spend more time in the park. The more time he spent in the park, the better odds he would transform anyways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made it through four pavilions so far. Nothing terrifying had happened yet. No strange thoughts, no strange changes, no strange feelings. None yet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as though Aaron forgot how to walk normally. He tried to match speed with the tourists around him. But they were all milling about, visiting the shops and exhibits and shows. This was a theme park, after all. Nobody besides Aaron had any intention of making a speedy exit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prospect of turning into a strange woman bothered Aaron. It was a terrible fate, yes, but it wasn't the only thing bothering him. Aaron had reason to be miserable. Everyone else did not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around him were people looking, feeling, and acting miserable. Some people were exhausted from walking all day. Others were fatigued from standing in the sun too long. There were people upset with the crowds. There were people upset with the high prices. There were people hungry, and thirsty, and tired of carrying souvenirs all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorst of all was the garbage. People were so wasteful and sloppy. A few candy wrappers here, a few discarded napkins there, a few empty cups everywhere else. The park staff was doing their best to keep the park clean, but it was an uphill battle. Aaron gathered a few disposable paper plates left on a bench, depositing them in a nearby trash can. It felt good to help, even a little bit. It made him forget about his poor circumstances. It made him forget about Brandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Brandon, Aaron thought to himself. He was only a little kid. Aaron said things he didn't mean, and acted in ways he shouldn't. He was supposed to be a role model. He wasn't angry at Brandon, he was mad at the circumstances. Aaron couldn't swallow his shame.  He promised he would never treat Brandon as the annoying little brother of his friend Zack again. He would treat him right. He would be courteous. He would friendly. Of course, first things first, he would have to find Brandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo easy task. Brandon no longer existed. And in a few minutes, neither would Aaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron walked into the next pavilion. Adorned back to front with tall arches and golden roofs, the scenery was unmistakable.  He was in China. The savory smells wafting from the restaurants were intoxicating, but Aaron was on a mission. He needed to escape, and fast. Nothing could distract him. Not dancing dragons, not leaping acrobats, not choreographed warriors dancing with swords. The only thing Aaron wanted to see was a sign saying \"Thank you for visiting, Come back soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron stopped in his tracks as a plate of pork lo mein was dropped at his feet. A clumsy tourist had tried and failed to snake their way from the Lotus Blossom Cafe to a nearby picnic table. They got caught in the crowd, lost their balance, and dropped their entire lunch on the ground. Another inch, and Aaron would be wearing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nearby park employee saw the incident, sympathizing with the poor diner's misfortune. The employee whisked the guest away, back into the restaurant. They were being escorted to the front of the line for a quick replacement. It was a marvelous display of compassion, but it didn't clean up the mess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron looked at the mess in front of him. He considered trying to flag down a janitor, but there were none in sight. Aaron steeled himself, bent down, and scooped as many noodles as he could back onto the plate. He popped into the restaurant, dropping the inedible meal into a nearby trash bin. Ironically, this is when he spotted the custodian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe custodian stepped outside, and swept up the remaining mess before anyone could step in it. Aaron looked around for a place to wash his hands, but couldn't find any. His hands were sticky with soy sauce and didn't want to accidentally smear that gunk all over the door handles. Surely there was a bathroom nearby.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Aaron snaked his way around crowded tables and hungry patrons. He needed to find a restroom to wash his grubby hands. Surely there was one around somewhere, but he couldn't find it. Desperate to clean his hands, he found a spray bottle and a clean rag sitting on a bussing station. A few quick spritzes from the bottle, and a wipe with the rag, and his hands were clean. Aaron was so pleased to finally feel clean, he didn't notice he shrank two inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen feet to his left, a clumsy kid spilled their Coke on their table. The poor child's father jumped up startled, trying to avoid the soda spilling on his pants. He tried to sop up the spilled drink as best he could with his napkins, but it was ineffective. Looking up, he saw Aaron holding the rag and spray bottle. He sheepishly gestured at the situation, clearly needing assistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron gladly helped the man out. He soaked up the soda with half the rag, sprayed the table down, and wiped it clean. The father was absolutely grateful, taking his daughter back to the soda fountain for a refill and a tighter lid. Aaron dropped the spent rag into the bus tub, and was about to deposit the spray bottle too. But then he noticed another table to his right. A family had finished their meal, but left all their garbage behind, There were easily a dozen people standing around awkwardly, holding full trays, looking for a place to sit. And these uncouth people couldn't bother to clear their table. Shaking his head, Aaron gathered up the plates, napkins and plastic utensils, stacked the trays and deposited the garbage in the trash can. Immediately, a new family sat at the cleared table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much,\" they said to Aaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're welcome,\" Aaron said. Such a nice family. But it was time to go now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" said a new voice. Aaron turned around. A harried woman carrying a two year-old infant in one hand and a large diaper bag over her shoulder was talking to him. \"You're completely out of plastic spoons. Can you help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron sized up the situation. He had to get moving, but this lady literally had her hands full and there was no restaurant employee in sight. It wouldn't take too long to help her out, right? Of course not. Aaron walked over to the self-serve counter, taking note of the empty spoon holder. Aaron considered how he could fill it. On a whim, he kneeled down to peer inside a cabinet. Doing so, he felt the fabric of his jean shorts under his knees. He didn't pay it much consideration, but he didn't think his jorts were that long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened a cabinet, noticing boxes of napkins, lids, sauce packets, chopsticks... and sure enough, plastic forks and spoons. He grabbed a handful, placing them into the serving receptacle. The stressed woman breathed a sigh of relief as Aaron handed her a clean spoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, you've made my day...\" she paused, prompting Aaron for his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Aarong,\" he said, confused by the words coming out of his mouth. Why did he add a G to the end? He must be tired, Aarong convinced himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Aarong. I hope my daughter grows up to be as helpful as you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady and her daughter left, returning to their table, both smiling. Once again, Aarong was happy to help. He looked down, realizing he was still carrying the spray bottle from earlier, and a clean rag. He didn't remember bringing them along. He was so surprised he was still carrying them, he didn't notice his shorts reaching a full inch below his knees. He certainly must be tired. It was time to go.</span></div></div>",

He couldn't quite put his finger on it, but there was something wrong about this restaurant. He needed to leave, and he needed to go now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked through the restaurant, he passed another table covered in refuse from departed diners. He tried to ignore. He tried to walk on by. But Aarong couldn't make it three steps before turning around and bussing the table. He collected all of the garbage, deposited in the nearest garbage bin. He put his hands on his hips, satisfied in a job well done. His hips felt wider than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down to examine his body, but was frightened by what he saw. Not so much his brand new birthing hips reaching out a few extra inches; he didn't get a chance to see them fully. He was too distracted. In his hands, he was once again holding the spray bottle and rag. He dropped them in fright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew for certain he left them behind. There was no logical reason he could be holding them now. As the bottle crashed to the floor, a little bit of cleanser spritzed out. Aarong couldn't feel most of it. Only a little bit on his shins. The rest was absorbed by his shorts which were now grown halfway down his calves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was clearly wrong. Aarong needed to get out of the restaurant and out of the park. He wanted to run out the door, but couldn't sprint with all these park patrons surrounding him. He moved as fast as he could to his right, but only found a dead end. He tried going left instead, but only found another wall. He was lost. He was all turned around, and couldn't find the exit no matter where he looked. The restaurant was huge, and seemed to be getting bigger. It didn't help that he shrunk another two inches in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAarong searched and searched, but could not locate the exit. He did, however, locate the restrooms. He didn't need them now, but they were a welcome sight. He could escape the crowds, compose himself, calm down, and think rationally about how to escape this labyrinth of a restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bathrooms were unisex with a big male/female sign on the door. Aarong entered and splashed some water on his face. The cold water felt good against his hot skin. He toweled off his face, not noticing how much straighter his hair looked than normal. He wanted to throw away the paper towel, but couldn't. The trash bin was overflowing with discarded towels. He looked around the bathroom, and there were paper towels everywhere. On the counter, on the floor, crumpled up in the sinks, everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAarong was disgusted by the sight. He could just ignore it, but what if somebody was outside waiting to come in? They'd see the mess and assume Aarong made it. No, he had to clean it himself. He found an empty trash bag in the supply closet and began collecting all the waste. When he collected all that, he emptied the trash bin, adding a fresh liner, and depositing the full bags through the convenient trash chute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sign on the wall next to the bathroom door. \"This bathroom last cleaned:\" followed by names of park employees and the time. Sure enough, the last cleaning was an hour ago. Aarong felt obligated to sign his name. He wrote as neatly as he could, but when he was done, the letters looked as though they read \"Airong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAirong considered scratching out the name and trying again. But when he reached up to grab the pen, he couldn't. His hands were full with a spray bottle and a clean rag. He let out a scream, threw the cursed objects as hard as he could, and ran out of the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad Airong looked back while fleeing, he would have noticed the unisex bathroom sign was now missing. There were two bathrooms now, one for each gender. And Airong had stepped out of the ladies' room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does Airong go looking now</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Airong could feel his sanity slipping away. The park was playing tricks on him. It was deliberately confusing him. A confused person was easier to manipulate. How much longer would this last? Airong rubbed his temples, not realizing how much his hair had grown. Not long, but it was definitely covering his ears now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he couldn't find the front door to the building, maybe he could find the back door. The park staff had to come and go from somewhere, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAirong made absolutely certain his hands were empty, and entered the door marked \"Staff only.\" With each step, his pant legs inched closer to the floor. The tailored hem stopped properly at his ankles. They could no longer be considered shorts in any sense. He was wearing full-length pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time was different, however. His slacks weren't growing; they were already reached the proper length several minutes ago. The pants had stayed the same length. It was his body that was shrinking. Airong dropped a final three inches. He now stood a diminutive 5' 1\" tall. Rather short for an American teenager, but an appropriate height for the person he was becoming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAirong nervously slunk through the commercial kitchen. Wait staff were taking orders from the window. Chefs were operating fryers and stove tops. Knives were flying, chopping meat and vegetables. Everything operated like a well-maintained machine. Airong was preparing himself to be screamed at. Somebody would notice him and order him out of the kitchen. But no one did. He breathed a sigh of relief. How fortunate that nobody noticed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch was not the case. Everybody noticed him. Nobody thought he didn't belong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving through the kitchen, Airong found storage cabinets, refrigerators, closets, and many other doors, but none of them led outside the restaurant. He was just as lost inside the kitchen as he was in the dining room. Worse still, his eyes were beginning to hurt. The dining room was naturally illuminated by sunlight. It was inviting and comforting. The kitchen was lit by harsh fluorescent lights. The contrast hurt Airong's eyes. Everything he saw was beginning to grow muddy and dull. His blue pants were looking black. His white shirt was looking yellow. And his usual pale skin was turning tan. If he had a mirror, his brown would look darker than it had ever been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was just about to leave the kitchen in defeat. Before he could, a voice yelled at him. Airong jumped, startled. The man operating the dishwasher needed his attention. Airong didn't know quite what he had said. He didn't speak Chinese. But he knew, somehow, it was directed at him. Airong shrugged, unable to help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dishwasher calmed himself down and replied in a heavily accented voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go take seese tarays to se floh,\" he said, motioning at a stack of trays sitting on a drying rack. There was limited space at the dishwasher's station, and everything was stacked upon each other. He needed to make room to continue working. The trays were cleaned and dried, and didn't belong here any longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAirong was conflicted. On one hand, he wasn't supposed to be back here in the first place. On the other hand, if he was going to be wandering around a restricted area, it was important he not make any enemies. He'd better do as he was told before he got in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAirong picked up the stack of trays with both hands, bracing the weight against his chest. Rather than feel the hard plastic slam against his ribcage, something was cushioning the force. His shirt and his pectoral muscles were there, sure, but that wasn't it. Something soft and pillowy was underneath, stuck underneath his shirt. What was he feeling and why was it so sensitive?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't stop to find out. There would be time later. Right now, those trays needed to go out... someplace. Airong wasn't quite sure where he was going with all these trays, but there was only so many places to try. Obviously trays didn't belong in the kitchen, so he walked back into the dining area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a tray wouldn't help the patrons if they've already moved their food, so they must belong near the ordering stations. Airong walked behind the counter, nobody blinking an eye as he entered another restricted area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd trays would have to be easily accessible to each counter clerk, so they'd be in a neutral spot away from the cash registers. Probably somewhere near the pickup window. Sure enough, Airong let his feet guide him to a near-empty stack of restaurant trays. They were exactly where he determined them to be. Airong had completely rationalized away brand new memories of the restaurant's layout and operations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAirong dropped the clean trays in their proper spot, freeing his arms. Rather, momentarily freeing his arms. As he turned around, ready to leave, he felt his fingers grabbing something. He reached up, bringing his hands to eye level. Unbelievably, it had happened again. Once more, unwillingly, his hands were clenching a spray bottle and a clean rag. He tried to rid himself of the infernal items once again, but this time was different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Airong had thrown the items before, he was alone. Or, at the very least, not in striking range of other people. Now, he was swamped on all sides by restaurant workers. No one thought twice to Airong being behind the counter, but no one was expecting him to launch projectiles. This time, as Airong threw items aside, there would be consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?</span></div></div>",

The poor counter clerk stumbled, lost his footing, and dropped an entire plate of food right on Airong's shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry,\" Airong said, trying to help the poor man up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh,\" the clerk said. He wasn't hurt, but he was dazed. He spoke something in Chinese, which Airong couldn't understand. He couldn't understand, except for the last word. The word was, \"Careful.\" The clerk said it with perfect diction and inflection. He had no trace of accent. Airong was confused. Why would he speak an entire sentence in Chinese except for the last word?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason it sounded so proper was because nobody thinks they speak with an accent. It's always everybody else who speaks with an accent. As the physical changes continued, Airong's mind was beginning to learn Chinese. The man spoke Chinese, and Airong could understand him (partially, at least). He had no accent because he wasn't a Chinese-American immigrant speaking a second language. He was speaking his native tongue with his native inflection. A tongue and inflection which Airong was beginning to share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAirong was so ashamed of the accident he caused, he scurried out from behind the counter. He was covered in General Tso's sauce. For the first time today, he wasn't alarmed he was holding a spray bottle and rag. He sighed and accepted it. The bottle held an all-purpose cleaner, and that's certainly something he needed now. He found an empty alcove of the restaurant and dabbed away as much of the sauce he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sauce was a goopy, orange mess. Everywhere Airong wiped, he seemed to spread the sauce around more. When he began, it was just a splotch over his stomach. But now it was up, around, and all over his shirt. His belly, his sides, even his sleeves seemed to be turning a rich shade of golden yellow. Airong wondered if he even managed to spread the stain onto his back. He had, not that he could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings felt specifically odd around his chest area. As he grazed over his breasts with the rag, something was just plain wrong. What was wrong with his breasts? He didn't want to fell himself up in public, especially not at Disney World, but there was something amiss. He felt his right, then his left, but couldn't quite piece the puzzle together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs an elastic band materialized from nowhere, snapping against his chest, Airong realized the problem: His breasts were fine. It was his bra that was the problem. It felt as though he was wearing the wrong cup size. His tiny little breasts were bouncing around like a peaches in a paper bag. That was it, he was sure of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere would be time to fix this later. He had been wearing this bra all day hadn't he? And he didn't even notice until now. Right now, he had to get clean and get back to work. He felt his shirt with the back of his hand. The stain was still there, but it wasn't sticky at all. He would simply have to accept he was wearing a yellow shirt now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought about what he said again. It was time to get back to work. Back to work? Back to work doing what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still looking for the exit, sure, but didn't he have to do something else first? A voice, deep within his psyche was screaming, \"No! No! You need to leave now! Before it's too late!\" but that voice was growing more quiet with each second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAirong tried to rub his forehead, accidentally bumping his forehead with the bottle he was holding, once again. He set them down, gently this time. He gently nudged his side swept bangs away from his eyes as his hair shifted fully to jet black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get a grip,\" Airong told himself. \"You're fine. You are okay. You are still alive. You are not going crazy. Your name is Airong Channing. Your name is Airong Channy. Your name is Airong Chan. Your name is Airong Chan. Your name is Airong Chan...\" Airong stopped his self-affirmation. He was trying to calm himself down by repeating his own name, but it only made him more agitated. Why did his name sound so wrong? He said it a few more times to be certain. \"Airong. Chan. Airong. Chan. Airong...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt like a fool. No wonder it sounded so wrong. He was putting his family name at the end of his given name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your name is Chan Airong. Your name is Chan Airong. Your name is Chan Airong.\" That was better. He smiled, calm, collected, and happy. Airong sauntered back into the main dining area, ready to tackle whatever challenges awaited him. Bottle and rag in hand.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pushing in a chair, Airong stubbed his toe. It hurt for a moment. He was concerned he may be bleeding. He looked down, making sure his feet were all right. More than all right, his feet looked fabulous. The little wispy hairs he had been growing since puberty started were gone. His tiny little toes jutted out from his sandals, shrunk down to a lady's size five. Each toe was adorned with a perfect ruby topcoat. He didn't remember getting a pedicure recently. Or ever, for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs proud as he was of his feet, he was also ashamed. He was working at a restaurant. Wearing sandals was just asking for trouble. He could slip, or burn his feet, or stub his toe, as he just did. Airong cursed himself, wondering how he could be so foolish and irresponsible. It was no matter, as the hard rubber material of his boyish sandals was swelling, growing, and changing material to canvas. His heels were already covered by the time he lifted is head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAirong began wiping a pair of greasy handprints off the window. He kneeled before the glass, feeling the tug of his trousers. The denim had long since withered into a thin cotton fabric, but the slacks continued to sit low. Concerned he may be displaying something improper, he paused to hike his pants up, over his hips, letting them sit on his waist as they should. He made sure to pull his underpants up along with them. He was mildly ashamed to be wearing so called \"granny panties,\" but it's not as if anybody would ever see them. They were comfortable, and he needed free range of motion for all the bending and stooping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAirong kneeled down again, the velcro straps of his shoes vanishing to anyone who noticed. The sides of his feet were now covered. He cleaned the window, stood up, and dusted debris off his uniform. With each movement of his hands against his pant legs, the fabric bunched ever so slightly. After three swipes, each pant leg sported a pressed crease reaching all the way down to the cuffed hems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wiped a bead of sweat from his brow. He had cleaned every table in the restaurant. But enough diners had come and gone, it was time to start again. He fixed his side-swept bangs, making sure they stayed out of his eyes. This morning, a young boy on vacation with his friends put styling gel in his hair. This morning, Airong recalled using a scented aerosol hair spray, which was still holding remarkably well. Not that he needed it for the rest of his short pixie bob. It was short enough to graze the top of his ears and the nape of his neck, but not long enough to be jostled throughout the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a very practical haircut. It matched his practical panties and his practical shoes, which now covered the tops of Airong's feet. Airong reminded himself the virtue of practicality. He wasn't a little kid anymore. He was 18 years old. He had to be a role model. Especially at Disney World. If a little kid came up to him, he would need to act as reliant as any other 23 year-old. Besides, at age 26, acting immature would cause speculation and gossip. Airong didn't want that. In his 29 years, he hated being the source of gossip. Whether it be the childhood rumors from his grade school days in Guangzhou, or the time he wore a low-cut blouse to his 32nd birthday party. He didn't mean anything by it, he was only celebrating. He wanted to feel young again. But at 35, he had to accept the days of his youth were behind him. He was an emissary for Disney now. He had to work hard. He had to work fast. And a showy haircut was impractical for a 38 year-old restaurant employee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAirong stared idly at his feet, momentarily caught in memory. He wiggled his toes, remembering the pedicure he got from the girls at the salon last Tuesday. His toes were completely covered by the casual, slip-on shoes he wore, but it was no matter. They matched his manicure, and those red nails shone all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled as he turned and came face-to-face with the restaurant's front door. He paused. Something deep in the back of his head was telling him to leave. Leave and never look back. And strangely, as much as Airong loved this restaurant, he wanted to listen. Gripping his rag and spray bottle in his hands, this was his chance. If he wanted to flee, he could... but does he want to?</span></div></div>",

Was that why he was so desperate to find the exit? Yes, Airong decided. Yes, he must leave the restaurant, and fast. Airong threw his spray bottle and rag down on the ground, darting through the restaurant doors. Everybody stayed far out his way. This lunatic was in a hurry to go somewhere. Woe be to whoever got in Airong's way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran ten feet. Then twenty. Then thirty. He was back in Disney World. He was back at Epcot. He had all the freedom he wanted. He could go anywhere, do anything, be anyone he wanted... Anyone at all. Airong looked down at his body. His clothes were designed and tailored for a woman. His skin and hair were soft and ladylike. He could feel his feminine curves under his clothes, especially as his breasts inflated to their proper size, filling his bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to leave so quickly a moment ago. And now that he had, what had come of it? He had left the restaurant, but now what? Was he still forgetting something important? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was he going? There was nowhere to go. Who was he looking for? No one was there. Why was he in such a hurry? There was no rush. Who would he be? Who could he be but himself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAirong tugged at the collar of his shirt. The u-neck was stiffening, rising, becoming a mandarin collar, splitting and forming a cheongsam-inspired blouse.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around. Dozens, no hundreds, of happy park guests were all around him. Some eagerly sniffed the air as they walked. The kitchen's ventilation hoods were broadcasting the tantalizing smell of pot stickers and crab rangoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hungry passersby forked off their previous paths. They filed into the restaurant. Their mouths were watering. The aromas couldn't be ignored. And there were still tables to be cleaned, trays to be collected, napkin holders to be stocked... Airong couldn't leave. It wasn't the restaurant that needed him. It was the guests. Airong had to help the guests. It was in his nature. Before he ever started changing, it was in his nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a moment of sudden clarity, Airong knew what had to be done. He excused himself to a nearby janitor's closet. Sitting on a shelf above the mop sink was exactly what he was looking for. He unclipped the safety pin, gently fastening it above his breast. \"Meirong\" said the name tag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeirong closed her eyes, letting them shift into their proper shape. She was a full-fledged Chinese woman from the inside out. She walked back into the restaurant. She saw her spray battle and rag, cast aside carelessly on the floor. She picked both up, and went to work, cleaning, helping guests, and most importantly, enjoying herself. Making other people happy made her happy. That's who she was.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now, he was all alone. He was at one of the most popular and heavily trafficked vacation spots on the planet, but he was still all alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack couldn't control his own feet. We could walk just fine, but the masses of tourists engulfed him, inadvertently controlling where he went, and how fast. It was like he was adrift at sea, at the mercy of the currents. No matter how hard he tried to stop or change directions, he couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found himself lost and disoriented. He couldn't even tell where he was anymore. All he could see were the backs of baseball caps and tee shirts screen-printed with Winnie-The-Pooh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could sometimes see the tops of buildings, lamp posts, and an occasional view of the lake, but mostly it was just people. He couldn't deal with the crowds. He didn't know if he was moving right or left, or backwards or forwards, or around in circles. He couldn't tell how far the park's entrance was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, finally after a tumultuous tour of the World Showcase, bereft of all visuals, he was free. He found an opening and took it. He looked around, seeing people enjoying slices of pizza. Zack had somehow wound up in the Italy pavilion. What's more, surrounded by shops and restaurants, Zack couldn't find the pathway back. He was trapped in some sort of courtyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what's more, his shoes were starting to change. Zachary Roman was soon going to be Roman in another sense altogether.</span></div></div>",

It was the same thing that happened to Matt. The same thing that happened to Joe. And he didn't see it happen, but he felt certain it was the same thing that happened to Aaron and Brandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this it? Was the end of him? In ten minutes, he'd be more woman than boy. In twenty minutes, he'd be gone. He couldn't fight it. He couldn't stop it. God only knows if it could be reversed. He tapped his foot on the concrete walkway. He could hear his soft rubber soles becoming solid with every tap. Zack knew he was stuck. He would have to accept this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to accept this, but he didn't have to smile as it happened. If Disney World wanted him to be a smiling, happy, brainwashed slave, they were going to regret it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack entered a nearby restaurant. He was surprised; as classy and elegant the outside was, the inside featured a lot of exposed brick and stone. It looked rather old, but in a rustic way. The Tutto Gusto Wine Cellar prided itself on its atmosphere, recreating the image and feel of an Old World wine bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack was sure he would be thrown out at any minute; everyone around him was enjoying glasses of wine, and he was a fifteen year-old boy. He was wearing a pair of women's black leather flats, but he was still a 15 year-old boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scusi,\" a voice came from behind him. Zack was preparing himself for the worst. A waiter tapped him on the shoulder. \"We are-a very busy, could you please take-a the order for table 19, per favore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack felt a gust of air conditioner hit his ankles. He could tell the cuffs of his socks were starting to creep up his legs. This is what the park wanted him to do, huh? Be a barmaid? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I won't,\" Zack said. He left the waiter, standing in place. He paused, confused for a moment. Thinking nothing of it, the waiter resumed serving the park guests. He forgot almost instantly meeting Zack. The brief moment before he did, he couldn't imagine why he asked the young boy for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack found an entrance to the kitchen. Tutto Gusto was a smaller restaurant, serving only sandwiches, small plates, and lighter fare. But Disney World didn't believe in doing anything small. The kitchen was still top of the line, well stocked, and fully staffed. Once again, Zack braced himself. Any minute, somebody would yell at him to get out. No such admonishment occurred. He didn't belong here, but he didn't not belong here either. The staff saw him, they knew he was there. They were all neutral to Zack's presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scratched the back of his leg with his other foot. He had a mosquito bite that had been bothering him all day. As he scratched it, his socks felt considerably thinner, and were at least halfway to his knees. He could look and confirm, but what good would it do? He knew what was happening. He paid it no mind. He still needed to cause mischief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Zack find in the kitchen?</span></div></div>",

His mind was still his own, and he had no knowledge of the kitchen's layout. It had to be somewhere, though. Every kitchen in the world had it somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smettila di scherzare!\" a voice came from behind him. \"Devi servire i tuoi tavoli.\" Zack didn't even bother to turn around. Whoever it was could either throw him out or leave him alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" he said, \"I don't speak Italian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aggh!\" the voice said in pain, \"Zackina, you are-a feisty one. Why do-a you play with my heart so much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack saw a gallon-sized bottle of blue liquid. It was precisely what he needed. He picked it up, still refusing to acknowledge his pursuer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have never met you before,\" Zack said in a cold register. \"I'm a fifteen year-old boy, and my name is Zack. Not Zackina..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe line cook who was shocked. He couldn't have-- no, of course not. It was a mistake, and nothing more. He had for the briefest of moments mistaken the young boy for a grown woman. Were his eyes playing tricks on him? Was it the heat and stress of the kitchen? He returned to his station and resumed chopping vegetables. He put the incident behind him. Zackina wasn't even a real name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legs of Zack's shorts were long and billowed. They flared with each step, a multitude of fabric swallowing his thighs and knees. What hair he had on his legs was gone now, replaced with two toned, tanned legs. His socks were up well past his thighs and he could feel the pressure engulfing his pelvis and waist. They were pantyhose now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to keep moving. There was the door to the restaurant ahead of him. Another five steps, and he'd be outside. Nobody noticed him. Nobody was stopping him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he left though, perhaps there was more fun to be had in the restaurant. So many people here, oblivious to what's going on.

Suzy sighed, she was supposed to spend an entire week here, but now all she had gotten was a t-shirt, a few pictures, and a wave from Cinderella and she\u2019d spend the rest of her so-called vacation like she spent all her time; alone and with only her imagination to entertain her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since Suzy was little, Suzy had always been a very smart girl, at first that was okay, but as Suzy entered elementary school she was quickly labeled a teacher's pet, and all her friends abandoned her, Suzy\u2019s mother and father said sooner or later Suzy would make new friends. However, as Suzy waited and waited for new friends to arrive she found herself quite alone; her parents always working and her brother wanted nothing to do with her. Suzy found solace in her imagination; creating adventures for herself, and her toys were Suzy\u2019s only means of entertaining herself until she discovered Disney. All of Disney\u2019s movies had such cool characters, and it wasn't long before Suzy found herself escaping reality through Disney magic. Suzy would also imagine herself in the stories and find friends within the many characters in Disney. Suzy sometimes wished she was in a Disney movie as they were always filled with people who stuck together and lonely people who could find happiness and friendship. However, it sometimes occurred to Suzy that like ice powers, talking fish, and magical hair that could heal such people and miracles could only happen in movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPoor child,\u201d said a voice. Suzy looked up at her food, and she saw two women approaching her; one was slightly overweight with black hair, and the other was thin and blonde. \u201cPoor, sweet child.\u201d The black haired women went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe has a severe problem,\u201d the blonde woman agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho, who are you?\u201d Suzy asked. \u201cJust so you know my brother is right over there!\u201d Suzy pointed to a nearby table where her brother was flirting with some girls not even looking in her direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be scared,\u201d the blonde woman soothed, \u201cwe\u2019re here to help you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name,\u201d the black haired women entered the conversation, \u201cis Mary and this is Sara.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe,\u201d Sara responded, \u201care witches, and we can help you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way,\u201d Suzy got up from her seat, \u201cI saw The Little Mermaid, I know what happens. You offer to magically to take all my problems away, and then you take away my voice and try to take everything from me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are a wise child,\u201d Mary complimented, \u201call magic comes at a price.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOurs is no different,\u201d Sara added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever, if you come with us to meet our sister we can tell you our plan, then we\u2019ll talk about payment,\u201d Mary explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy should I go with you?\u201d Suzy demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said it yourself, you saw The Little Mermaid it is true magic got Ariel into trouble but did she not end up in her happily ever after?\u201d Sara questioned. \u201cMagic is only a tool, and though it always has a price it can bring happiness, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re offering you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren't you tired of being alone?\u201d Mary inquired, \u201caren't you willing to take the chance?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzy looked over at her brother who still wasn't even checking on her.

Eventually, Suzy saw several small, old, and poorly maintained figures of the seven dwarfs. \u201cWhat is this place?\u201d Suzy inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBack when families brought their food to the park this was a picnic spot,\u201d Mary explained. \u201cFamilies would come out here and picnic near their favorite dwarf, there\u2019s also a model of the seven dwarves cottage which is where we\u2019ve set up shop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Suzy questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, park employee\u2019s started dressing up as characters, and it became more common for people to take their lunches to them. Finally, when they opened all the restaurants, this picnic spot became less and less popular, so they finally took it off the map and never bothered to clear away the statues,\u201d Mary summarized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe found the cottage and started doing our magic there,\u201d Sara finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara and Mary led Suzy further through the forest and to the cabin, the witches led Suzy inside. The witches had indeed made themselves right at home, the dwarves shelves and tables were now covered with potion ingredients, on their piano was a large black book of spells, and the magic mirror hung over the kitchen window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome in, come in my dear,\u201d a new voice announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzy looked and saw a third woman with red hair. \u201cHi,\u201d Suzy greeted, \u201cmy name is\u201d she began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no need for that dear,\u201d the third witch assured her, \u201cmy name is Agatha, but you may call me Aggy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Agatha,\u201d Suzy responded, \u201cI\u2019m here because.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh poppet, I already know why you\u2019re here,\u201d Agatha smiled. \u201cNow, you are lonely, and your brother doesn't care about you, luckily we can fix both problems.\u201d Agatha waved her hand, and a projection of Kyle appeared on the magic mirror. \u201cNow listen up honey, we can brew you a potion to turn your brother into a girl younger than you,\u201d the projection of Kyle suddenly shifted into a five-year-old girl wearing Kyle\u2019s shirt like an overlarge dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d Suzy watched, \u201che\u2019d be my little sister?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Agatha responded, the projection of little girl Kyle was suddenly joined by a screening of Suzy and the two began running around happily. Suzy also noticed that the little girl Kyle was now wearing a little girl\u2019s dress. \u201cNow, listen dear, this is important all magic has a price, and this is no exception; if you do this you take away your brother's life, all he was will be no more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it will kill him?\u201d Suzy inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all dear, Kyle, however, will remember who he is,\u201d the projection of Kyle stopped playing and crossed her arms in anger. \u201cThe potion will work until the moment your plane home takes off, got that? The moment your flight home takes to the air. Now, if you can get your brother to want to remain as a little girl he will become one permanently, but if he doesn't he\u2019ll turn back, and he\u2019ll always remember what you did to him. Now keep in mind dear, everyone will know Kyle existed, and even if he wants to stay a little girl you\u2019ll still be taking what he has away from him, that means you will become responsible for your new sister, and you will have to make sure she gets a good life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019ll have gone through 11th grade for nothing, he\u2019ll have to break up with his girlfriend, and he\u2019ll never be the star of the boy's football team,\u201d Suzy thought aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Agatha clarified, \u201cso, what do you say?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her hair shot back into her skull, becoming soft peach fuzz. Her teeth receded into her gums, a painful process Jane recalled. Baby fat returned to her body, as her face became much rounder. Within seconds, Madeline was a little baby no older than six months. She wore a red onesie and a disposable diaper, and like Jane, she sat in a stroller, sucking on a pink pacifier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jane found herself kicking her legs excitedly, giggling happily. She had her best friend back. This was going to make being a baby again much easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What happens now?</span></div></div>",

Her shoes and socks had completely vanished, and she was now barefoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mom?\" said Jane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before either girl could answer, Jane heard her brother running toward her.

You want to test run your first time behind the wheel of a car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky butted in, \"There's no wheel dummy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That attitude Ricky is why you're riding in the back with me.\" Jane scolded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mom!\" Ricky whined before the teenage girl placed a finger up to his lips to shush him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you choose this ride sweetie.\" Jane said to him, \"But this will be a good experience for your big sister and you'll bother her up front.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm an adult!\" Ricky whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Ricky you are a big kid now\" Jane pulled the bigger man into a hug, \"but you aren't acting like one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane kissed him on the cheek, \"We can be nice and snug together in the back. Isn't that better than being being with your sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess.\" Ricky sighed with a childish disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren soon found herself in the front of the car alongside Bobby who looked like he was going to play at teaching her the works. She giggled at the thought, the anxiety of the high speed coaster relieved somewhat in her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready Speed Racer?\" the boy said to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got this Dad.\" Karen smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was a positive to this surreal role reversal for the Karen, it was seeing how her Jane and little Bobby act as adults. She knew in her heart they were their own unique selves, not just carbon copies of her and Richard. Jane was more outgoing and controlling than she ever been as the mom and Bobby seemed so laid back compared to Richard's high-strung nature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe...</i>Karen considered before the ride suddenly started leaving the woman sized teen immersed in the moment.</span></div></div>",

Her adult worries blew away in the face of the wind just as her screams did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each turn the Harper family took on the Test Track, so too were they turned. Karen, the middle age woman she still was, was slowly reverting to the height and proportions of a 15 year old girl. Her legs and arms shrunk every so slowly to match the proportions of a blossoming teenage girl. Her mature hourglass figure remained but dissipated in scale to realistically match her new adolescent height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God Dad!\" Karen said exhilarated, \"That was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fun right?\" Robert asked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer little Bobby wasn't so little anymore. Boy he still was, Bobby now had the height and width of a very tall man. One that dwarfed her in her new girlish height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for letting me sit up front!\" She thanked her boyish dad with a quick kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you enjoyed it Karen.\" He returned an innocent smooch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren rather excitedly got out of her seat when locks where undone and she stood up to take in her transformation. The drop in height was far more impact than she had anticipated and she felt a bit of vertigo to what her brain was long used to experiencing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright Karen?\" Jane called out to her. \"You're not having a moment right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed flooded Karen's face, \"No, no Mom! It's just the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane now stood at a woman's height. While she still looked teenage girl to Karen, Jane's new height cemented in Karen the reality of her own change of perspective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ride?\" Jane asked, \"You sure Karen we can go to the ladies room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking slightly up at her own daughter brought with it acceptance to Karen that she wasn't in charge anymore,  \"I'm....sure Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!!!\" shouted Ricky as he nearly tripped out of the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren couldn't help but laugh at Ricky, He looked cute and ridiculous all at the same time. Middle aged as he was, he was now the size and proportion of every other 5th grader at Epcot. His mature vacation clothes looked all the more silly on his childish frame despite perfectly fitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren walked up him and gently kept him balanced by his little shoulders, \"You alright there shortie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky chuckled, \"Look who's talking princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Karen asked before catching a glimpse of herself in a reflection. Her soccer mom appearance made her look just as childish as Ricky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're turning into kids again.\" Ricky admitted with half a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You certainly are little boy.\" Karen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky ignored the jab, \"But what about our kids?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your parents are right here Ricky.\" Robert informed him by lifting the boy sized man high into the air before bringing him easily back down to earth. \"Did you enjoy the ride son?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Dad.\" Ricky answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ricky and I had a blast playing backseat driver.\" Jane commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we going to do Soarin' next?\" Ricky asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Karen's turn to decide.\" Jane said as she turned to Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The family had reached Soarin' and with a Fastpass they managed to get aboard the ride fairly easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whimsy which had elevated a girlish excitement in her was long gone with her talk with Ricky but maybe this calming flight through the sky would help.

I have so many regrets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Karen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was so mean to my little brother and I was even worse to my mom.\" Jane elaborated. \"She didn't deserve any of it, she was such a sweet and gentle woman.

I was so messed up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A wish</i>, Karen had no evidence but something about that statement confirmed in her everything happening. It was Jane that had wished her and Ricky into their kids. Unintentionally most likely, but that was how the wish must have turned out.

It was becoming clear to her that Disney World itself, through some magical means, was doing everything in its power to keep the Harper family together. The permanence of the divorce coupled with Jane's wish made it so that neither she nor her husband Richard were going to leave Epoct with their adulthoods intact. Frozen Ever After was going to turn her and into a bigger Frozen fan than Jane ever was. She knew that now, but if she could break the altered memories of her grown children. Just so they knew how much Ricky and her loved them as their parents, she was willing to switch places with Jane as the family's bratty teenage daughter. Just so they both knew she had once been their mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here we are Karen.\" Jane finally said, \"Frozen Ever After.\"</span></div></div>",

More upsetting than this, however, was the fact that Jane began to realize that she had already used her diaper. She had felt the urge to go to the bathroom before the transformation, and now that it had happened, her smaller body apparently couldn't hold it any longer. She was now wet and sitting in her own waste. Suffice it to say, she was not happy, and so she started to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her parents immediately came to her side, and Robert tried to calm her down.

Her innate baby instincts must have kicked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Karen reached forward and picked Jane up out of Robert's arm. \"Richard, dear,\" she said, and Jane was stunned to hear how sweet she sounded toward him; the intent behind her wish seemed to have been met. \"Watch Robert while I go change little miss stinky here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of course,\" said Richard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then diaper bag in one arm and little Jane in the other, Karen carried her daughter to a nearby restroom. Once inside, she laid her down on the changing table.

Then her mommy took out a package of baby wipes and began to wipe her butt. After subsequently powdering her, Karen took out a clean pink diaper with designs from the movie <i>Frozen</i> and wrapped it around her daughter's waist. After taping it on, she buttoned the onesie and lifted Jane into her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"All right now, little girl,\" she said. \"Let's go join Daddy and big bro.

As Jane was carried out by her mommy, she couldn't help but ponder the fact that her parents and brother were all treating her like she had never been any older than ten months old.

When she said she wished for things to be like when she was younger, she hadn't even been that serious and this was definitely not what she had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah,\" said Karen. \"And the sooner we get her inside, the sooner we can get her changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then with Robert helping Richard unload their things, Karen took Jane and the diaper bag and entered the house. Once inside, they were greeted by Megan, Jane and Robert's seventeen-year-old cousin who had been housesitting. Megan had been Jane's best friend back when they were both teenage girls, but now . . . The instant, Megan saw Jane, she looked at her with adoring look that Jane had been getting used to getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah, Aunt Karen,\" she said. \"You're back. Hi there, Janie,\" she added, her voice raising in pitch. \"Did you have fun, baby girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She was a little cranky,\" said Karen. \"I'm thinking she was too little to enjoy that trip. We'll go back when she's older. Now if you don't mind, Janie had a little accident on the way over here, and I really do need to get her changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Without further ado, Karen carried little Jane past the door which she knew led to her bedroom and into another room -- the one that should have belonged to Robert. Jane mentally cursed; now that she was the baby instead of Robert, she was stuck with the smaller room. And when they stepped inside, it was immediately clear that it had become a nursery. The walls were now painted pink, there were toys all over the floor, and to either wall was a crib and a changing table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Partly from the discomfort of needing her diaper changed and partly from just being fed up with all this, Jane opened her mouth and started bawling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's all right, sweetie,\" said Karen. \"Mommy's here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She walked over to the changing table and laid Jane down. As Karen prepares to change Jane's diaper, what happens?</span></div></div>",

She could tell immediately that Robert now remembered that she had been his fifteen-year-old big sister, despite also remembering her as being his baby sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Whoa, Jane,\" he said, and Jane could hear a lisp to his voice. \"This is weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Welcome to my world, little bro,\" she said, with a similar lisp. \"But Mommy and Daddy still think our ages our normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(She wasn't sure why, but for some reason she couldn't help but use childish terms like Mommy and Daddy in spite of remembering her teenage ages.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, until right now I didn't remember you weren't my baby sister,\" Robert pointed out, \"so I guess that makes sense. And it also looks like we're headed back to kindergarten in the fall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah,\" said Jane. \"But it might be fun growing up as twins. And who knows? We might like being little kids again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robert smirked. \"You're just happy you're not in diapers anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jane smiled. \"Kinda,\" she admitted. \"But still... this was a carefree time in our lives. It might be fun to relive it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robert giggled. \"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After talking some more, Jane and Robert decided that, not knowing how long this would last, they would try and enjoy being little kids again for as long as it did. Not to mention, there was a chance it would be more fun here as five-year-olds than as older kids. It couldn't hurt to find out....</span></div></div>",

As she grew older, her brother grew younger. It did not stop until they had switched places. To her relief, Jane aged up a full ten years -- not as old as she was before, but close enough. Her golden had grown out and was now tied up in a pair of orange pigtails. Most of her grown-up teeth had now grown in and were now lined with braces. She had lost most of her baby fat, but had not yet developed the womanly curves that would come when she hit puberty. She also had a cute baby face, making it clear that she was still a little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But she was not as young as Robert: his hair had shot completely into his skull, and his teeth had completely receded into his gums. He was now too young to walk or to talk, and Jane now had to carry him in her arms. It was a complete reversal -- now she was a ten-year-old girl holding her baby brother. This might suck for him, but she could feel elated. At least she wasn't in diapers anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When the light faded, she saw that, like before, her clothes had changed with her. She now wore a light blue <i>Frozen</i> T-shirt and a matching blue skirt. For footwear, she had on a pair of blue flip-flops. Holding him in her arms, Jane could see that Robert was now dressed in red onesie, and since she was holding him, she could feel that he wore a disposable diaper underneath. As she rocked him, she could see that he was sucking on a green pacifier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What happens now?</span></div></div>",

Richard always loved the animatronic figures, and Robert loved just how thrilling it was. They always rode it together. Karen wasn\u2019t really a fan of it, neither understood why. There was just a sense of magic to it. Robert had worried they might not be able to go on it this year with a new baby, but was quite pleased with this development. Richard was also expecting it, and breathed a sigh of relief when Karen left with Jane. His wife was just a little too suffocating sometimes. Plus, he had been promising Robert he\u2019d take him regardless, so he was happy he could keep the promise to his son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were waiting in the queue, Robert looked up at his dad, \u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re getting to go this time.\u201d Richard just smiled \u201cWell, I said we\u2019d go, didn\u2019t I? It\u2019s a tradition after all. My father and I rode it every year, and now the two of us can ride it together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know, but you and mom have been so busy with the baby\u2026 I just thought, y\u2019know\u2026\u201d Richard laughed and ruffled his son\u2019s hair, to his embarrassment. \u201cIt\u2019s a tradition that we ride it every year. We\u2019re not going to let a new baby get in the way, you know that, right?\u201d Robert grinned and nodded as Richard continued, \u201cWe\u2019ve been riding this since you were in diapers too, y\u2019know?\u201d Robert laughed, \u201cDad, you know I don\u2019t remember that!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep! You were always so cute too! Just giggling at the song and how you\u2019d laugh and pee yourself when we went down the drop... Sometimes I wish we could go back to that time.\u201d He teased as Robert blushed and looked down \u201cDad, c\u2019mon, that\u2019s embarrassing... But y\u2019know, with you paying so much attention to Jane, I wouldn\u2019t mind it either\u2026\u201d he half-whispered. Richard grinned wider at his son, \u201cIf it makes you feel any better, I was the same way as a toddler, at least according to my dad. I don\u2019t remember it either, but\u2026 It\u2019d be nice to be young again... Always appreciate your youth while you can, Bobby. There\u2019s something you can\u2019t get back when you\u2019re older.\u201d Robert chuckled \u201cFor some reason I have trouble imagining you in diapers\u2026 or peeing yourself on the waterfall. But\u2026 yeah, I know. I\u2019ve been kinda jealous about Jane. She doesn\u2019t have to worry about anything, and you\u2019re always paying attention to her. I wouldn\u2019t mind being little again.\u201d Richard sighed and gave a sympathetic smile, \u201cI know how you feel sport, I\u2019d like to be little again too, but we at least have this to make us feel younger. And if it makes you feel any better, you\u2019re still my favorite.\u201d Robert perked up a little, \u201cThanks Dad.\u201d He grinned. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As four boys who had never been out of the state, it was as close to Fame as they were going to get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think this is what the real Hollywood looks like?\" Asked Oliver as he looked down this fictional Hollywood street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.

In fact, it took them a long time to be able to go to Disney World for the first time, even though they lived in the state. And so they could only imagine what it would be like to have all the money and fame to go where you want to go and do what you want to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, don't you wish we could all be famous?\" Martin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" said the other three boys simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp, we have a lot to see.

Dave's white golf short slowly constricted until it was a bright yellow tank top.  Dave's long khakis crawled up his legs until they stopped far above his thighs.  The new shorts darkened into a deep blue while the material itself morphed into denim.  Finally, the edges of the shorts frayed a bit to be more stylish.  Normally, none of these new clothes would fit a grown man.  Dave had however shrunk in stature and frame until he was the size of a freshman girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark's clothes were also changing!  Mark's short-sleeved shirt and shorts grew together into one long dress.  Next, the clothes ditched their old color scheme for a nice pink sundress.  Mark thought it looked nice.  It was important to appreciate fashion.  That's why Mark and Dave had spent hours picking out just the right clothes for their trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may roll your eyes as me but your still my little girl.\" Jack smiled as he adjusted the large handbag that hung over his new light purple blouse.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, when is this ride gonna start!

After a few short minutes, Rachel hopped up and down at the sight of a bunch of animals. There were cheetahs, lions, gazelles, and okapis nearby. Rachel had been mesmerized by the cheetah chasing a gazelle, and Matilda watched the gazelle's lithe movements. The okapi, shy like Ingrid was, came near to her, as she stood in awe. Nicole was creeped by her friends' viewing of the animals, but a lion on a cliff caught her eye and she was captured by its beauty. The lion leapt off the cliff and the other animals seemed to follow. The lion jumped at the safari vehicle as it followed, snapping the four girls out of their confusion. At the end of the ride, they felt a bit sick, so they leaned in an alley near a building and relaxed. Suddenly, Ingrid felt a tug on her hair. Her short hair lengthened to cover her entire body like a cocoon. Her arm was swallowed by her blonde hair, which was beginning to turn brown. White and black lines crisscrossed over her hair in strands. Next, Matilda felt her arm fall asleep. She shook it, and her braids came undone, bobbed, and lengthened. Each time she shook, it surrounded her even more. Nicole tried to stop her, but she couldn't hear. Her ears had folded in and hardened like solid rock. She was enveloped all of a sudden, and her hair-cocoon turned a dim cream. Rachel was next. Her long hair grabbed her arms, and a needle and thread appeared. She was forced to spool the thread with her needle, and her arms were moved quickly back and forth. As the thread was put on a spool, her hair turned golden and extended. When her hair let go, she was wrapped up. Nicole jumped and leaned back, as Rachel's hair had a stray sandy strand that gripped her and cocooned her in a fraction of a second. Her screams of \"SHIT! AAH!\" were picked up by a walkie-talkie nearby. An officer heard her and came all the way from EPCOT only to find a cheetah, an okapi, a gazelle, and a regal lioness all curled up and passed out in a cornet behind a building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEND</span></div></div>",

Her co-workers told her that nobody relaxes better than the Americans. Being accustomed to such a high-profile lifestyle, as one co-worker spoke, they practically build places to relax even further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei couldn't believe that. That was until she stepped into Downtown Disney. There was no shouting, no fighting, clean air, and a generally happy atmosphere with colorful characters decorating the merchandise every shop sold. The Asian woman lifted her sunglasses to get a full view. The place was just as beautiful as she is. Mei stood at an average height of an American woman, not Asain, including the average Asain female build. Tall, yet skinny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing she was worried about, as a different co-worker told her, was that American's expect people to have big appetites. The portions they served at an average restaurant for lunch could feed an Asain family for at least two days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei would soon find out that these Americans don't joke around with their food. Whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was shining brighter than ever. So she popped her sunglasses back on. Dressed in a loose white T-shirt, black shorts, basic sneakers, and a cute ladybug bookbag.

When Mei approached, the server unintentionally towered over her. Since Mei had never experienced bowling or American cuisine. She recommended Mei start off with the Bowl n' Burger combo which came with one game of bowling and a burger conjoined with a basket of fries. As Mei was seated, she watched the server walk with grace and a swish of her voluptuous hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodness,\" Mei felt a little jealousy creep up on her. When her co-workers spoke of the portions Americans ate, all they described were how they were like blobs. Such as the ones from Wall-E. Mei never imagined the food travelling to all the right places. She placed her hands on her hips. In comparison, narrow and flat were the words that came to mind when she looked at the waiter. Round and wide. Just like the women from Disney films. Except the waiter was a little fuller figured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>To start a new game. Roll the ball.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe electronic voice from the TV screen caught her attention. Mei shook her head back to attention. It was rude to stare at somebody, in every national custom. Mei picked up a light ball, around five to six pounds in weight and rolled it down the lane. The ball certainly didn\u2019t travel well because it ended up in the gutter without striking a single pin. Mei felt even more certain that she didn\u2019t throw it right from the throbbing in her fingers. \u201cI\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's your burger basket!\" The server smiled with her peppy voice, \"If you need anything else. Just give me a holler.\" Mei didn't force a smile like she usually did with other waiter's. She even caught herself staring at the server\u2019s backside again. \"Oh goodness. These American's...and this food.\" Mei gasped at the incredible size of the portions Splitsville served. The burger and fries had to be at least twice the size McDonald's in Japan served.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike any human would do with any food. They take the first bite to indicate the first impression. Mei had taken her within seconds. Meat, cheese, lettuce, mayo, and ketchup. Oh, man. Her taste buds really seemed to enjoy this. Once again her co-workers were right, if American's were good at one thing, they knew how to make tasty food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the game, Mei snuck a few bites of her burger and fries before rolling the ball down the lane. The taste was excellent before, but now it started to grow on her even further. She hoped it wouldn\u2019t blow up into a full blown craving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew it. The game landed on the tenth frame. Mei prepared her roll and sent it speeding down the lane. Her eyes widened in anticipation only to shut close in disappointment. Only one pin ended up knocked over by the balls weight. This is basically what people would call a gutterball. However, Mei couldn't be mad. She had lots of fun and during she tasted her first American cuisine that tasted absolutely divine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei plucked the last few fries from the basket and peeped at the scoreboard to see her score.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You can have the occassional swear, and of course the romantic encounter, but let's keep it light on the hardcore profanity and sex, alright?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- I'm going to allow weight gain in the story, but only if it is to a realistic extent. I don't want any characters becoming 900 pounds. The 300 pound range is perfectly fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Have fun! Disney is a big place. So go wild!</td>",
