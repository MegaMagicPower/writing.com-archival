Her reactions are all over the place, though mostly she is overjoyed to be even taller for her age. Or for any age, for that matter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA 14 year old girl with the name of Carly is a bright, and happy girl. Straight A's in all classes, never seems to be down about anything. Well..... except her height. She didn't like being a 'mere' 5 feet tall. She has always had dreams of being a giantess of miles and miles of height. But she never wanted to be mean. She had wished like mad for the past 9 years. All I can say is, be careful for what you wish for!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA 15 year old by the name of Mara, had always been tall for her height. Seriously, she was 5 feet tall in 3rd grade and by 9 th grade, was a tall girl of 6' 9' . She thought she had her big puberty growth spurt already and should not be growing but maybye another inch. She knows she won't hit 7 feet. That is, until the REAL growth spurts begin to happen. She had always been really tall for her age. But now, she is taking it to new heights!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis 18 year old girl, whose name is Minnie, and was only 4' 9\", she felt betrayed by puberty and she hated all the wisecrakes about her name. Don't mess with her though! She can be mischievous! Well, all I can say is, her name is soon to be ironic.</span></div></div>",

You are just happy you can drive you dad's car instead of your sister's (shudder) VERY little girly bike. Jen did that on purpose. She has nothing else like that at all,  so you knew. Your bike was still being repaired at the shop because some car who was not paying attention, plowed into him. Thankfully, you didn't get hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n So you are walking down aisle 5, heading for the register, when you bump into a... a.... little girl with red hair? <br>\r\n\"Are you ok? Where is your mom and dad?\" Your friend named Jake, was just watching this.  \"I AM 18 FREAKING YEARS OLD! OH MY GOODNESS, IF SOMEONE MISTAKES ME ONE MORE TJME FOR A LITTLE GIRL....\" She left the end unspoken trailing off as she can see your face, though bewildered, did not mean bad. <br>\r\nShe helped pick up all groceries that didn't bust. Which was everything except the milk. Of course. Jake's parents were gone for the month, so he was staying at your house for the month.  So, as Jake went to grab another carton of milk, and the overhead speakers said \"Clean up on aisle 5.... Clean up on aisle 5\" You say to the girl \"I'm sorry, it is jusg that you look like... well....\" \"A little girl?\" She said. You nodded. \" Why, puberty? Why did you betray me?\" She half-yelled. Jake gets back with a fresh carton of milk, and you say to Minnie \"See you around.... I guess. Stay away from guys named Mickey. She gave you a playful slap on the face and you pretended like she dropkicked you across the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say to Jake in the car \" I can't wait for the basketball game tomorrow \" and Jake says \" I'm referee\" When all 5 of us are together and about to play b-ball, he usually referees, because he is the shortest of us 5. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe now is a good time to tell you about his anxiety problems and ADHD.<br>\r\nHe is usually talkitave and hyper.<br>\r\nBut his anxeity has it's problems. He has five stages of anxiousness. <br>\r\nStage 1: Repetitive acts of fidgeting<br>\r\nStage 2: Pops knuckles (or attempts to) multiple time in a row.<br>\r\nStage 3: Situng with is arms around his knees and holding his hands together in sorta like a chain or link<br>\r\nStage 4: Basically, Stage 3, but he is rocking<br>\r\nStage 5: Faints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have never seen him go to Stage 4, never mind stage 5. He says he has only gotten to Stage 4 a few times and has gotten to stage 5 only once in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter unloading the groceries, eating dinner, and washing the dishes, they headed to bed. Jake was sleeping on a row/pile of pillows with a blanket, of course, so he can stay warm, on your floor. You both fall to sleep almost immediately.  Tommorow.......</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You had a dream about Minnie last night. The only 3 indicators that it is really her, is her hair (she is a red head), her eyes, and her voice. \"Not so small now, am I?\" She said. She was so big, that, to her a skyscraoer looked to be a normal person, size wize.  But, a real person, was like an ant compared to her! You wake up to uour alarm clock, and after your usual routine, you walk with Jake, and your 15 year old siser to school. You get out your history books from your locker, and you turn around, smack into somebody and hit your head, hard on the ground. \"HEY WATCH WHERE THE HECK YOU'RE GOING, YOU- Charlie?\" \"Minnie? Are you new or...\" \"Been here since 9th grade\" Minnie replied. \"Same\" You answer. Did she look.......... taller? You put it off as your brain still trying to regroup. After school, you are out on the court, Minnie in the bleachers. She had asked if she could watch. The 3 friends that was not Jake, didn't see her. That is,  until the ball rolled in her direction. Carl said \"Hey, little girlie, why don' you run on home to your mommy and daddy. \" Minnie replied with \" OH MY GOD, I AM 18!\" Paul replies to that with \" My 9 year old sister has more curves than you!\" The 3 that is not you or Jake all snickers at the last comment. Jake than says \"Guys, stop she is about to break I am warning you!\" Than Danny said something idiotic \"I bet you can't even get the ball in the hoop, while you are standong right next to it!\" I could see her snap, and I could tell Jake went to Stage 1, repetitive fidgeting. Then Minnie says \"If I can't get the ball in the hoop, from the free throw line, five times in a row. I will wear a girly dress tommorow. However, if I do, than you have to shush about my lack of height or lack of anything, you 3 must wear pink, frilly, princess dresses tomorrow ar school. Even if I can't see you because we are not all in the same classes.\" \"3? There is 5 of us here\" \"Charlie, nor Jake has said anything bad to me, so they dont count\" She takes the ball and steps up to the line. The shot's up, at it sails through the hoop. \"Lucky\" \"She can't do it again\" She then steps back up to the line, at the ball sails cleanly through again The latter comment is repeated but with a very nervous \"Right?\" at the end. Minnie then shoots the ball in a 3rd time, then a 4th, then a 5th. All 4 boys, and you, have dropped your jaws on the ground. \"Now, remember our bet!\" Minnie says to Paul, Carl, and Danny. \"How have you not made the basketball team?\" Jake asks, bot in one of his stages of anxiety anymore. \"I got rejected every single time. Do you car to guess why?\" Though you knew, and you're  almost positive that Jake does too, you both shake your heads. After that, you and Jake part ways with Minnie, after agreeing that all 3 of y'all walk to school together tomorrow, and you head home to a uneventful dinner, and a dreamless sleep. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You yell \"Who is it?\" \"The President. Or the candlemaker.\" Recognizing the voice as Minnie's, you open the door. She is looking you in the eye, and she is looking straight in front of you! You cough as you half choke on your coffee. Minnie asks \"Charlie, are you alright? You look like you just saw a ghost!\" Jake had moved beside you when you started the commotion. You could see he was in Stage 1 of his anxiety. \"I'm fine, some coffee went down the wrong way.\" \"Come on, Let's go!\" says Jake. \"School is closed because there is a bomb threat and the police hvae to make sure that it is not real.\" Minnie said. Oh. Jen, your sister, just left. \"Hey, I know!\" You say. \"What?\" Minnie and Jake said at the same time. \"Let's go up in my room and I'll tell you.\" All three of you go up to your room. \"First things first\" says Jake as he exits his anxiety zone and is now not even fidgeting. \"How in the world, did you grow 16 inches in one night?\" Jake finishes. \"I don't know. But, I have the feeling that this is not the last one. I feel that I may be a Giantess. If I do I promise to be nice and gentle, but if you do bad or if you push my buttons, then someone is still going to get a deserved, verbal chewing out.\" Minnie replies.You ask \"So you think you will be the next 50 foot woman?\" Minnie replies with \"No, not even close at all, like a galaxy will be like a neutrino compared to me. As in evergrowing, you two. I feel my jaw hit the floor and I look over and I see that so did Jake's. \"Well, why don't we talk about this plan of yours. That's why we came up here in the first place.\" So then you say your plan is......</span></div></div>",
