            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brian sighed to himself as he walked through the park, wishing he had something positive to think about. It was a bit depressing to take his nightly walk through the forest near his home if he was just going remind himself about his confidence issues. Brian tended to be on the shy and timid end of the personality scale, and it usually meant that he avoided talking to people or making himself the center of attention, or much attention at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking retail had been a nightmare, and being shy and never being able to present himself confidently had lost him one job already, and he sometimes just wished that he could be somebody else, or at least someone a bit more outgoing. It wasn\u2019t like he didn\u2019t have friends, but he wasn\u2019t the type to approach somebody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had tried the bar scene, but being unable to look anything but awkward had made that unsuccessful. In all honesty, it wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t have the looks for it, as he tried to remind himself. Tall, Short brown hair, square jaw, fit body, face that didn\u2019t look like it had been hit by a sledgehammer, it was mostly the fact that nobody wanted to go for the guy who looked like he\u2019d run away the moment you tried to talk to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, if he was just going to whine to himself about his problems, he felt like he shouldn\u2019t bother coming at all, and put it out of his mind as he enjoyed the cool breeze passing by his jacket and the atmosphere of the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Most people would have found the place creepy at night, and not a place they\u2019d find themselves in unless they had a flashlight and were looking for notes pinned to trees, but Brian had been coming for years, and had gotten to the point where he didn\u2019t even bother using the torch he brought half the time, preferring the relative lack of light of the stars and moon thanks the relative lack of light-pollution compared to the rest of the town, and his night-vision to navigate around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe figured that he had better head back, and began to head towards the footpath when he spotted a small glint in the corner of his eye on the ground, and not the normal glass glint of a discarded beer bottle. He moved closer to it, and it seemed to be some kind of necklace. Somebody\u2019s lost jewelry? He fished it out of the thick grass, and instead of jewelry, it was a circular rock with a hook on the end and a circle cut out of the middle on a necklace with two large pearl-like balls on it, and for some reason it reminded him of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared at it for a second before remembering what it was. A magatama, he believed? That was the correct name for it, right? It actually reminded him of the one worn by a character in the Ace Attorney series, and come to think of it, the necklace looked exactly the same, as far as he could remember, what with the color and the extra balls next to it on the necklace. Probably just a coincidence, he thought to himself. He couldn\u2019t imagine why you\u2019d have a replica of it though, it wasn\u2019t exactly like magatamas were a popular fashion accessory. Or at least the last time he checked, he wasn\u2019t big on fashion.</span></div></div>",

And it was a bit too big for his jeans\u2019 pockets, so he put it around his neck, feeling a bit self-conscious despite the empty park. He was ready to tear it off if anybody came near when he began to feel very odd in a way he couldn\u2019t quite explain, like his skin was trying to move on its own volition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to ignore the feeling, but it got stronger as he went on until he started to feel sick to his stomach and doubled over, a sharp spike of pain going through him. He let out a slightly high-pitched yelp as it hit him, leaving as quickly as it came, Brian panting as he brought himself back up. What the hell was that? If that happened again, he\u2019d probably have to go check himself into a hospital or something, and in the middle of the night too\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brushed a bit of hair out of his eyes, the sensation of it bothering him, before he realised that his hair wasn\u2019t long enough to even touch his eyebrows, let alone his eyes. And was his hand smaller than usual, or was he just crazy? In fact, everything seemed slightly smaller\u2026 It was probably just an effect of whatever had affected him before, he reasoned, ignoring his slight lack of balance as he wandered through the taller than usual trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt the long grass brush up against his ankles, which was odd, since he was wearing jeans and perfectly normal shoes, and hadn\u2019t felt anything before. One of the legs must have been pushed up. He looked down and bent over to correct the issue, before staring in amazement at the sight of his jeans\u2019 legs slowly receding upwards, already starting to approach his knees, looking more like shorts at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven crazier than that was the fact that his leg hairs were quickly disappearing, leaving smooth legs that, by the look of them, were growing thinner, Brian able to feel them growing more slender, a slightly painful feeling as his bones and muscles rearranged themselves. Even his shoes were melting away, the heel growing thicker and blacker as the entire top half disappeared save for the usual straps of a pair of sandals, leaving a pair of black sandals adorning his suddenly smaller and daintier feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Brian was starting to panic. Whatever the hell was going on had to be a hallucination, or a crazy virus, or something, clothes didn\u2019t just disappear like that. And what was happening to his leg? Whatever was happening, he was clearly not well, and he resolved to get to a hospital as quickly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he took a brief glance down again, and to his dismay he saw his jacket quickly shrinking away on the front, growing looser around his hips as the sleeves shrank back to just past his elbows, growing larger and more open, the material seemingly changing to a softer one. A quick look at his shoulders revealed that the back was perfectly intact, but from just past his shoulders down the jacket failed to cover his entire front half, and seemed to be turning a deep purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Do the mental changes begin?</b></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brian almost discarded the altered article of clothing as he stumbled onwards, for some reason stopping himself before he could take it off. And for some reason he was glad that he had stopped himself. After all, he liked this jacket. Why did he like this jacket? It was really more of a weird coat now anyway, which was kind of neat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering between worried thoughts about why he was just accepting his new coat-thing, he almost bumped into a park-bench, starting to reach the outskirts of the forest. He sat down onto it, trying to calm down and figure out just what was going on, almost burying his head in his hands before he noticed how much smaller they were now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, so unless it was a hallucination, clothes didn\u2019t just change on their own, and something was going on with his body. Again putting aside hallucination, it couldn\u2019t be some weird disease. Which left what, magic? Aliens? He ignored the part of his brain telling him to look for a more down-to-earth explanation, and thought back. What had started this? He was feeling fine today before now, and it all started right after\u2026 His eyes rolled down to the magatama on the necklace he was wearing. Was it that? No, that was stupid, it wasn\u2019t a magic necklace, magic didn\u2019t exist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n But it\u2019d be really cool if it really was a magic necklace.  Some part of him thought, and before he could question why he just thought that he gave as gasp as his waist painfully cracked, pulling in as his hips pushed out, giving him what he embarrassingly admitted was a much curvier figure, his hips, while remaining fairly thin, swelling out to more feminine proportions. He also noticed that his jeans had stopped shrinking at above-his-knee height, his jacket/coat having grown longer to almost reach it, and had faded to an odd cream color, losing its denim texture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, so magic, he thought to himself. He was turning into someone or something else, because of magic. That\u2026 Was kind of amazing, when he really thought about it. After all, that meant that magic really was real, and that\u2026 He stopped his slightly excited train of thought. It was like a much more excited person was talking, and he again wondered just what was happening to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe readjusted his position on the park bench, having apparently shrunken again while he was sitting. When he stood up, he guessed that he was at least a head or so shorter, and probably would have only barely reached the shoulders of his normal height. At this point, he found himself less panicked and more interested in where this was going, and his fingers went up to touch the supposedly magic necklace adorning his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment he touched it, he felt a jarring pain in a very personal area, and a familiar feeling replaced with a different, more feminine one. He immediately surveyed the damage, and with no idea how to feel, acknowledged one fact to herself; she was now female. She wasn\u2019t quite sure how to put that to herself, it sounded ridiculous even in her head, unconsciously having automatically changed pronouns when referring to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing over her changes so far, Brian realized she really only had one major part of his torso unaffected, and as if on cue, his shoulders painfully pulled closer together as her chest pushed out, nipples growing larger as pectorals turned to small but very apparent breasts, obvious through her t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, so she was a girl. She had just magically turned into a girl. Magic was real and it apparently did that to her. And she wasn\u2019t freaking out. In fact, she was kind of\u2026 OK with it? In fact, she was actually kind of excited to see what would happen to what was left, all thoughts of going to a hospital abandoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, her newfound patience and willingness to see the last of her changes unfold paid off, as her t-shirt seemed to merge with her jeans, the material of both growing thicker and softer, the legs of her jeans forming together into a loose skirt, the feeling of wearing what was now a dress slightly embarrassing to Brian, although one she found felt strangely natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dress parted in the middle before being quickly bound by a large sash that formed around it, tying many times around it into a v-necked kimono-esque garb, the sash forming a large ribbon on the back, the color changing to a darker purple than her coat, differentiating itself from her cream dress. Underneath it a small bra formed over her breasts, and his boxers formed into a much more suitable pair of underwear for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelieving her changes to be complete, Brian was about to move again when she felt her face begin to contort, his lips growing slightly thicker as her nose shrank and her features rearranged themselves into a much more feminine form. Her hair darkened to a shiny black as it grew much longer, reaching almost halfway down her back, a small bun tying itself up at the top of her scalp, bound by a purple pearl-like orb similar to the ones on her necklace. Her hair straightened out into long bangs reaching almost to her eyes, while two more chest-long bangs grew down the sides, adorned with two more pearls at the ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting another minute to see if she would change any more, her original fears completely forgotten in an excited interest in what had happened to her, she searched her clothes for any pockets, finding some on the inside of her coat, relieved to find that her phone and wallet hadn\u2019t fallen out or disappeared. She went for her phone\u2019s camera, but realized that it was too dark to get a clear picture, and checked her wallet for her driver\u2019s license, wondering if it would have changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even in the dim light, illuminated only by a single lamppost ten or so meters away from her, she was able to make out herself on her driver\u2019s license, if not any of the words on it. And instead of his usual face staring back at him, it was the face of a young girl that couldn\u2019t have been older than seventeen or eighteen, and thinking about her odd clothes and the magatama, she did seem to look like a non-anime version of the character Maya Fey, as crazy as it still sounded to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe meant, she had turned into a video game character, which was amazing! Was there a reason for it? Could the necklace do it again, but with somebody different? The thing was incredible! She slowed down for a second, thinking that the character of Maya had been what he was picturing while she was holding it and putting it on. Was that it? She had turned into somebody else just because she was thinking about it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thinking about turning into somebody else, she thought back to her problems that she had been thinking about just before she picked the magatama up. It felt like it was somebody completely different she was thinking about, and couldn\u2019t imagine herself in any of those situations. Being shy, not being able to talk to people? She was fine at doing that! She realized that she seemed to have gone through some kind of a personality adjustment while she was changing, and she couldn\u2019t see anything wrong with it. After all, she was who she was, right? She gave a quick smile at the thought, considering what had just happened to her. That definitely wasn\u2019t something set in stone anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe supposed she should be thinking more about what would happen to her after this, but right now, she wanted to take this new body for a test run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What should she do?</b></span></div></div>",

Hopefully nobody would pay too much attention to the fact that she was dressed like an anime character, she thought to herself as she headed back into town, looking for somewhere to get a burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Later...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian finished off her burger, wondering if she should still call herself that. Should she get a new name or something? Probably not, she thought, that was probably going too far. Besides, she\u2019d have to figure out what was going on with her new life before that, see if it was any different. She sat back in her chair, glad that the diner was empty at the moment. She had gotten a few odd looks from the staff and the couple of customers, what with dressing like an anime character and looking a bit strange, but her youthful appearance meant that it was never raised, and they paid her no mind after she sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reviewed her situation, thinking things over. Since she was a few years younger, would she be back in school now? She had been in college when she was male, and she found the idea of having to spend another year or so back in high school a very unappealing one. Then again, she\u2019d probably do a bit better this time around\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped that train of thought, deciding to think about something more important or interesting. Here she was, having been turned into a fictional character, and she was worrying about whether or not she was back in school. Great sense of priorities, Brian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fictional character did bring one thing to her attention. Maya Fey was a medium, with the ability to spirit channel, and essentially turn into other people, albeit with a few complications. Did that mean she could do that too? Was that something her necklace could do? Hell, it was worth a shot, wouldn\u2019t be any stranger than what had already happened.</span></div></div>",

Luckily the place had a small room leading to both bathrooms, and nobody had seen her blunder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the privacy of the bathroom, she went up to a mirror, and began to focus, wondering exactly who she should focus on.

This time it spread all over her body almost immediately, Brian wondering if the glow she saw over herself in the mirror was her imagination or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what wasn\u2019t her imagination was her hair starting to lighten, the black taking on a red tint that seemed to be brightening into a pink one as it began to become slightly wavier, her fringe brushing itself out of the way, and bringing Brian\u2019s attention to her shifting facial features. Her nose shrank slightly, while her eyebrows thinned and her eyelashes grew larger and longer, her eyes losing their large child-like look and gaining a more mature, almost seductive look to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips began to plump up, going from thin to lush in seconds, a self-assured smile going over them as she admired her new face. <i>Beautiful.</i> She thought to herself. <i>Much better than that old one,</i> she added on, before frowning slightly. Sure, her previous face had been different, but it wasn\u2019t bad, was it? <i>Whether or not you want cute, or beautiful,</i> she concluded, before wondering exactly why she was thinking of that all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe redirected her thoughts to her tingling body, and moreso her widening hips, growing a few inches wider while her behind grew considerably larger, large enough to have a slight jiggle to it in tighter clothes, or not at all. As her thighs grew a bit curvier, her waist grew thinner as her chest ballooned out, going from almost flat to large and bouncy, enough to push the front of her shirt open and expose a considerable amount of cleavage, straining her small bra to its limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrain cupped her new breasts, and rather than attempting to hide her chest, she actually widened the gap in her clothing a bit more. Thoughts of modesty left her as she thought to herself<i> If you have it, flaunt it.</i> By this time, a part of her mind had realised that it was going over some changes and was attempting to fight back, although it was being quickly overrun by her new impulses, and its attempts to get Brian to cover her chest back up were doomed from the start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also noticed that she seemed to be two or three centimetres taller, and coupled with her curvier lower half, her skirt had gone from above the knee to just below her ass. Just how she now liked it. The change in height also redirected her attention to her head, where her hair had fully faded to a bright shade of pink, managing to look natural rather than dyed, despite being a naturally impossible colour to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had also waved out to the sides, each part flaring out particularly wide, her hair now only reaching her shoulders in length. While her previous hair had been shiny and well-kept, this looked like a lot of time and care had gone into it, and she was very pleased with the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her changes complete, Brain gave a girly pose, before the resisting part of the brain reminded her that just an hour before, she had been <i>male</i>, for god\u2019s sake, and now she was posing in the mirror, and exposing cleavage, and she was worried about how much she seemed to be admiring herself\u2026 However, her new persona pushed back harder, and shoved those thoughts of her mind. <i>This is better</i>, she declared to herself, giving a cute and flirty smile to herself in the mirror. She could act like a child, or she could act like a woman, and she knew which one she would pick. Who cared what she <i>used</i> to be? She was going to do what she wanted, <i>now</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the strain it put on her chest, Brian took the time to remove her bra altogether, putting it away in one of her pockets. I would make things smoother later. Unnoticed to her, her eyes flashed, changing to a deep brown colour, as the last of her previous personality disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What does she do now?</b></span></div></div>",

All she had to do was simply wait now, and hope that she wouldn\u2019t have to wait too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for her, she indeed didn\u2019t wait long, as a man in his mid-twenties entered, wearing a plain t-shirt and jeans with messy brown hair, and not unhandsome features. Not that she paid much attention to his physical profile. He wasn\u2019t repulsive, and that was what mattered. She waited for him to order, before moving over to the table he had sat down at. It wouldn\u2019t do to do this afterwards when he eaten a pile of cheap fast food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey cutey, you look lonely.\u201d She said in a cutesy but flirtatious tone, the man looked up, slightly interested in her bright pink hair, but more focused on her invitingly open shirt and her obvious attempt to come onto him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI might be. What\u2019s your name?\u201d He asked, allowing her to wrap an arm around his shoulder as he stood up. In response, Brian reflected on her appearance and smiled. It seemed appropriate to match her new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApril. April May.\u201d She said. She didn\u2019t bother getting his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later, Brian pulled her lips away from the man, ready to enact phase two of her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re good. Care to take this somewhere a little more private?\u201d She said, winking at him as she removed herself from his grip, putting her breasts back into her shirt as her face flushed red with arousal.

He still looked surprised, but not unhappy. April unzipped his pants and practically ripped them off. This underwear stood before her, a throbbing erection sticking straight up at her. She paused for a moment. <i>Do I really want to do this? Sure, I enjoy being a smoking hot chick, but am I seriously going to fuck a man in a parking lot? I was a man just a few hours ago. Is screwing and stealing the right thing?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fuck the right thing,</i> a familiar voice in her head replied. <i>What did the right thing do for me before? I tried to play the nice guy, and all it got me was loneliness and heartbreak. With this power, with this body, I can get whatever I want. I'm going to fuck this man, and I'm going to enjoy every second!</i> With that moral quandary behind her, April reached beneath her dress and pulled off her panties. She had to wonder why she bothered wearing them in the first place. Just like her bra, they really only stood in her way of getting what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached in and withdrew his cock from his underwear through the flap. She'd never seen a man's cock from this angle before, and she had to admit this man's equipment was impressive. April looked into his eyes, and saw they were burning with lust. Time to take him. She slithered above him, their crotches aligned, and slid herself onto his cock. She moaned in pleasure, never having felt pleasure like that before. There was a hard, hot, throbbing cock inside of her, and what made her shudder with pleasure was that she was still the one in control. April looked down at the man she had mounted, his eyes glazed over with pleasure. She smirked down at him, then started to move up and down his cock, really riding him now. It was then that it hit her she hadn't broken a hymen, but she immediately rolled her eyes at that. Brian the geek might have been a virgin, but April May was anything but.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril started riding him faster and faster, aligning herself so he was hitting an extra sensitive part of her pussy. She was getting close to climax now, and she could feel her breasts bouncing up and down as she moved, jiggling with the motion. It turned her on even more. She moaned lustily, realizing the truth: she'd become a walking, talking, fucking personification of sex appeal. And she loved every goddamn second of it. Out of nowhere, she felt her hair start to lengthen, she was turning back! She had to stop it, and went even faster than before. It was that feeling, that amazing sensation sent her over the edge, into an orgasm. It was the most beautiful feeling in the world, so much better than her days as Brian masturbating to internet porn. Why use material like that when she could get sex whenever she wanted? As she came off her high, she noticed some things. She was still riding the man as fast as she could, and from the look on her face he was getting close to coming himself. Far more interesting was the fact her clothes had changed; now the actual outfit of April May from the games. April smiled lustily at that; the ensemble highlighted her impressive sex appeal even further. Before she could continue to consider that, she felt him cum inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped abruptly and looked at him, he was smiling, but clearly not all there. Before he could react, April slid off him, swiped his wallet and keys from his pockets, and kicked him out of the car. Before he could even start to stammer an exclamation, she had turned the key in the ignition, and was out of there. She smiled satisfactorily to herself. Apparently that orgasm was just what she needed to stay as her new amazing self. Now she was off to...</span></div></div>",

April parked her new car in the lot, and walked over to her home. She drew more than a few looks from passing men as she did, which make April very happy. Once inside the sanctity of her own home, she looked around. It hadn't changed at all from how it was that morning when she was a he, so the magic didn't extend that far. She wrinkled her nose at the smell. She'd have to change this place on her own. She checked her pocket and found her wallet and the magatama. The wallet had changed, now a bright pink with a heart-shaped clasp. She opened it to find that her driver's licence had changed once again. It had updated to her new look, and the picture was one of her winking at the camera while showing off her extensive cleavage. April made a mental note to try that sometime soon.

It gave her face the appearance that she was definitely younger, but no less mature or sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe expected her body to lose the curves she'd grown to love, but nothing of the sort happened. Her skin grew a shade paler, and she dropped a few centimeters in height, but that was it. She stood there, looking into the mirror, her change apparently already done. Looking at her reflection, April couldn't keep herself from giving a large smile. She was definitely more like Maya, but not in the areas that mattered. She started striking poses in the mirror, showing off her sexy frame while still looking innocent and cute. <i>That's how you really snatch a guy,</i> she thought, <i>let him think you're cute and harmless, then pounce.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made her pause. Had there even been any mental changes this time around? Well, she noticed as she started looking at herself from other angles, bouncing on her heels as she did, she had more energy than before. Her appetite for the carnal side of things might have actually grown a little, and now she was wondering why she didn't take a few more of that guy's stuff before driving off. Her fingers were fast, and he wouldn't really miss them anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, apparently what happened did more than make April her default form.

She really had to get that series out of her head if she was going to do this. Her own appearance didn\u2019t help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich brought her attention to another thing. If she could turn into other people, then maybe she could turn back into a man? It was worth a shot, at least\u2026 Unable to keep the series out of her head, she pictured Phoenix Wright, waiting for the tingling to begin as she hoped she didn\u2019t look too silly with the anime hair he had. However, no feeling game, and after a minute, she tried again with Miles Edgeworth, again hoping that this wouldn\u2019t be one transformation where she inherited his fashion sense. Again, no feeling came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she doing something wrong? She tried again, this time picturing a random female character. The tingling immediately began, and she desperately banished the image from her mind, the tingling stopping with it. After what had just happened, it probably wouldn\u2019t be a good idea to do this when she wasn\u2019t at home. After all, with the mental changes that occurred, she didn\u2019t exactly want to go through that again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, she apparently couldn\u2019t turn into any men. Great. Still, at least she had her options open on the female front. Her spirits went up went she thought to herself <i>holy crap I can turn into whoever I want as long as they\u2019re female magic is awesome</i>. She left the building, deciding to head home for the night, wondering just who she\u2019d start with next.</span></div></div>",

Although it probably had no basis in reality, she was paranoid about somebody seeing her, since she still didn't know if her new identity was fully retroactive, and if his neighbors would wonder what some girl was doing in that one guy's apartment. Her license had changed, so she really needed to make sure. The question was, would it also change while she was changing forms? She sighed, deciding to think about it later. She was tired and she just wanted to take a shower and head to bed. She dug through her pockets, relieved to find that her keys were still there, and unlocked the door, flicking on the lights as she went inside. She wasn't sure if she should be surprised or not at the fact that her apartment looked identical to how she had left it, somewhat messy and small. She had been half-expecting it to reflect her new body or life, but it was perfectly normal. Booooriiiiiing. She collapsed onto her so, magatama pressing into her chest slightly as she groaned. Why her? She had just gone for a walk and now she had freaky body-changing powers. So far she had been changed into a character from a video game, turned into another video game character, and then nearly slept with some random guy to steal his stuff. It was the changes to her mind that bothered her the most. Something she might not want to do might suddenly seem like a great idea once she changed into another identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned over, idly playing with the magical talisman. On the other hand, her powers were really cool and who knows, her life might be better off as a slightly younger girl who happened to look like a three dimension version of a video game character who could turn into other women from the same video game series. Or from any series, maybe. Maybe it was the fact that the characters she turned into had an established personality that she knew and could imitate that made her personality change when she turned into them? She wasn't quite sure what the true extent of her powers were, and if the fact that the magatama matched the character of Maya Fey was just a complete coincidence that he had over-thought. Oh, who cared. She wondered if her wardrobe had changed. She couldn't exactly run around dressed like an anime character all day, even if not having to wear pants was surprisingly comfortable, but she didn't exactly think that the considerably taller and noticeably more male Brian's clothes would fit the much smaller and if-she-might-say-so-herself cuter Brian. She dragged herself off the sofa and headed for the bathroom, intent on not coming out until you couldn't see the other side of the room through the steam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What now?</b></span></div></div>",

But for better or worse, she wasn't really interested in doing any exploring of her new body. She just looked at herself and felt normal and natural, like she had been female forever. So much for the mystery of womanhood. She gave it up and grabbed a towel from next to her pile of clothing, undoing her hair's bun at the top of her head and the part that was tied near the bottom of her hair. She had a lot of hair, she realised. A lot more than she was used to. She wished that she had turned into someone with shorter hair, although the first character that came to mind who fit that description was Franziska von Karma, who was kind of a bitch and had bright blue hair which would look incredibly silly anyway. Man, she really had to think of some other series.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned on the water and waited for it to heat up, fiddling with her magatama while she waited. While she probably shouldn't take it into the shower with her, for some reason she really didn't want to take off her person. Hoping that it wouldn't suffer any sort of damage or wear from the water, she stepped under the hot water, sighing appreciatively as she was quickly soaked, brushing her now almost eye-obscuring hair out of the way. She had to admit, she wasn't sure if it was her new body or if it was just her finally relaxing properly, but the shower felt wonderful, and she closed her eyes, letting the water wash over her. Minutes dragged on in her state of bliss, steam filling the room as she unwound further and further by the second. Her hands briefly closed around the magatama, warm and slick to the touch, as she decided that right now, everything was absolutely perfect, and she didn't have a care in the world. As a result, she didn't notice the slight shimmer, as her idle thoughts had an unintended consequence. Perhaps if she had a mirror she might have noticed a small mole appear below the corner of her left eye, but even then it would have been too late to stop what happened next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs began to slowly grow longer, Brian's short stature becoming less apparent as the ground grew further away, the different obvious, but not enough for Brian to notice that anything was off. Her overall height didn't change after her initial growth spurt, but her legs lengthened as the height was put mainly into her legs, her thighs slimming slightly as her hips grew minutely larger. Her breasts swelled an inch, but her narrowing shoulders gave her a very thin, straight frame, rather than the hourglass that her previous transformation had granted her. Her long, dark hair began to lighten as it began to retract upwards, seemingly growing in reverse, going from brushing the arch of her back to falling just above her shoulders, turning first grey, then to an unnatural silvery blue colour, her locks of hair losing their square cut in favour of a pointier one, parting on the right to sweep across her forehead, at least when not completely drenched by the shower that she had lost herself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body matured only a year, but her face matured greatly, her chin and nose growing sharper as her eyes shrank and narrowed, giving her a shrewd, cunning look, albeit a beautiful one as her eyelashes grew longer and darker. Her lips grew fuller as a brief smirk overtook them, her normal gentle expression being replaced with a cold, confident one, seemingly made for it rather than the warmer expressions that her face had been previously adorned with. Her transformation complete, she took a deep sigh, and reluctantly turned off the shower, the room full of steam as she grabbed a towel. She ran it through her hair, not really caring that she had been in the shower for an inordinately long time. It had been a nice shower, and she was feeling a lot more confident in herself now that she had had some time to relax. Things like what she was going to do about adjusting to her new life didn't worry her, since she was sure she could easily take command of her new life. She toweled herself off for a minute before catching a glance of herself in the foggy bathroom mirror, noticing that she seemed to look distinctly different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What does she think of the change?</b></span></div></div>",

But rather than panic or get upset, she instead let her towel fall away as she appreciated her suddenly more mature body. Franziska von Karma, eh? It explained why she was feeling a bit more confident. She really had to get away from the Ace Attorney characters, but perhaps not this one. She gave a quick turnabout as she examined herself closely, her shorter hair being easier to deal with. She was quite happy with these changes, and felt that it suited her a lot better than that childish body she normally had. The same age as this one, and yet this felt so much more mature. In fact, this body seemed to have cleared up all of the flaws of her old one, from body to mind. She didn't just see a girl standing there, she saw herself, and she was perfect. Perfect skin, perfect body, perfect mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe toweled herself off for another minute, fingering the magatama clinging warmly to her chest. She wondered exactly what the extent of this object's power was, and how to exploit it best. Assuming she wasn't restricted to fictional characters, she could theoretically give herself whatever personality and body she wanted, as long as she fixed the problem of her time in a form being seemingly limited. And in fact, why stop with just herself? What about altering other people? Was that something she could do? Perhaps she could use it to improve somebody, or give them a state of mind more likely to see things her way, if she felt like manipulating somebody's mind was a thing she was alright with exploiting. Well, in her personal opinion, this sort of power couldn't have gone to a better person than herself. She looked in the mirror, and considered turning them into a particularly fetching woman who suddenly came to mind. Or perhaps even...</span></div></div>",

She seemed to be a bit full of it in that form, but having so much confidence in herself was quite nice. She actually wouldn't mind giving it another go, or keeping it as one of her more permanent forms if she solved the time limit problem. She might have to do something about the bright blue hair though. That was sure to attract attention, although her very Japanese dress had already done a pretty good job of that on the way home. Thank god it was the middle of the night. She figured she should probably do something about her nudity, and finished drying off, putting her dress on loosely. Despite her long shower, she was feeling pretty tired, and yawned as she wandered into her bedroom, collapsing onto her bed. Maybe it was using the magatama that had tired her out. Whatever it was, it would have to wait until tomorrow morning, she decided as she quickly drifted off, wondering what awaited her in the morning.</span></div></div>",

The transformation that happened to her body, still wearing those medium's robes, wasn't unlike something from the games, as her body stretched and elongated, getting taller than it ever had before.

Her new Maya body didn't exactly have more skills than she'd had before, but there was more confidence now, a feeling like she could be doing better.

She could use the skills earned from certain bodies, like Mia's, to work in new fields with new skills, like becoming a real lawyer.

Those comments really stoked Maya\u2019s inner fire, doing her best to reign in the sadistic personality as best she could. \u201cIf you want me to do anything as personal as that, you need to do more than just donate a little. No, you need to send me, let\u2019s say, $200, and a picture of what you really look like, holding up some paper with what you want on it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe command had been given, and within a few minutes of laying on the bed Maya\u2019s phone vibrated, and she checked it to see the first donator had done what she\u2019d asked. The real person behind the username was a skinny, underfed and undertanned geek with long, stringy red hair. The sign he was holding up asked her to \u2018Insult him\u2019. \u201cFirst one: CharNaznable, I could never love you. You\u2019re a disgusting, geeky waste of my time. The idea you would even think for a moment that you could send any kind of message, to me, is absolutely insulting.\u201d</span></div></div>",

This was going so much better than she had hoped, and part of her wished it would never end. But then Maya saw the picture of who\u2019d sent the money, and she froze. The donor was a somewhat overweight young man, just out of college, with brown hair just long enough that it looked like it needed to be cut, and the desperation for validation in his eyes that Maya used to see in the mirror before finding the Magatama.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn\u2019t the only thing she recognized in the picture. The man, holding a sign also asking for insults, without specifics, was Dennis, an old friend of Brian\u2019s. They\u2019d spent years together, playing games and going to comic shops and conventions. When she\u2019d been Brian, Maya had gone to Dennis\u2019s home, and his family\u2019s home for several Thanksgivings, when going to see her own family had been unbearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now that same Dennis was watching Maya without knowing it was his friend, watching out of lust, and wanted her to insult him to everyone in the stream. The parts of her that still identified with Brian, and with Maya for that matter, didn\u2019t want to do it. She could refund the money and end the stream. But that would hurt her reputation, the more Dahlia more of her argued. Plus, he was literally paying her to do it. Clearly, he wanted it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Really, there was nothing Maya could think of to counteract that idea. So, with a sadistic smile on her face, she looked into the camera and started. \u201cOooh, Dennis. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re doing this, sending me all this money just to talk to you. Of course, you\u2019d need to pay me, since otherwise there\u2019s no way I\u2019d ever say a word to such a fuat, disgusting pig pretending to be a person. I bet you had a bribe your date to prom too, if you had one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last detail was actually true, Maya knew Dennis had paid a girl to go to the dance with him. Throwing in something that specific might have been a little dangerous, but it also added fuel to what she was doing. It also made it more fun, and Maya was starting to get really wet, really hot and bothered as she continued her verbal assault. Looking in the chat, she saw Dennis had said something there, freaking out about how great this streamer was. \u201cI am great, Dennis. Which is why I wouldn\u2019t touch your pasty, geeky body if my life depended on it. Throw as much money at me as you want, and I wouldn\u2019t want to stay in the same room as you for more than a minute.\u201d Her words were so harsh, but it was clear from the chat feedback that Dennis, and everyone else there, was loving it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you\u2019re touching your disgusting cock right now, Dennis. You\u2019re touching yourself to me. Good. Spurt out some of that rank, festering goo you keep in your body. Do it to me, to me telling you how worthless, pathetic, and insignificant you really are.\u201d But the sound of her voice started changing at those last words, and Maya looked down to see she was rapidly changing back to her regular form. The chat was blowing up again, more than ever before since last time the change happened there weren\u2019t nearly as many people. Once fully back to her Maya self, she pouted at the camera. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, you guys! I said some really mean things, huh? Though, that was more Dahlia, and it\u2019s your fault for choosing her. Still, from I can see, I guess you enjoyed it, huh?\u201d There was a lot of affirmatives in the chat, mixed in with some people wishing she\u2019d channeled someone else.</span></div></div>",

Brian decided to head home for some sleep before he would have to get up for work in the morning. He pocketed the Magatama, he could have sworn it warmed up a little as he put it in his pocket, however he wrote this off as his mind playing tricks on him. He went to apartment and laid down on the couch, he didn't bother taking off his clothes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe woke up slightly before sunrise and brushed a bit of hair out of his eyes, strange, his hair wasn't usually this long, did it have a sudden growth spurt overnight or did he just misremember it's length? He got up off the couch and began to head to his closet, for some reason his body felt very light and he went off balance every few steps, his clothes also felt a bit more loose.  He opened his closet and looked at a small mirror he had. He stared at it for a few minutes in shock. Staring back at him was the reflection of Maya Fey from the Ace Attorney franchise, she was wearing her usual spirit medium attire. He DEFINITELY didn't go to sleep wearing those. He raised his hand to his hair, the reflection did the same. He looked at the long hair and while doing so he took note of how small and dainty his hand was, in fact, his entire body was now small<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon closer inspection of the reflection Brian noticed that around his neck was the Magatama he picked up last night. At this point, Brian was starting to panic. Whatever the hell was going on had to be a hallucination, or a crazy virus, or something, People don't just  transform into young girls overnight! Whatever was happening, he was clearly not well, and he resolved to get to a hospital as quickly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he took a brief glance back at his new reflection. This may be a good thing. His entire life he had been the shy guy, he desperately wanted to be someone else and now he had the opportunity. He could start his life over as a cute girl, maybe act a little more outgoing. However, at the same time he was worried that this Magatama would change him more, maybe change him mentally. He didn't want that to happen, so he should probably go and get some help. What does he decide to do?</span></div></div>",
