I don't remember feeling too worried, it sounded like it was on the other side of town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I met my first zombie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt emerged in a crackle of leaves, staggering out from behind a tree. I'll never forget it. It was a guy, bit older than me maybe, probably a drunk or druggie I thought. I stopped walking. It came for me, slowly, moaning a little. I tried saying \"you all right, mate?\", but as soon as a lamp lit up the torn and blood-soaked clothing I knew he really was not all right. He was so far from all right that he was approaching \"all right\" from the other side of death. A strange metaphor, maybe, but that's what being in a 'zombie apocalypse' does to your vocabulary, I guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSorry, I didn't say, my name is...</span></div></div>",

Right, so it's staggering towards me and moaning, y'know, the whole zombie thing, and I've seen the movies, played the games, but it's still pretty freaky right? So I kick it in the chest, making sure it doesn't grab me or anything. Zombie falls over, and I'm thinking: right, to kill a zombie, you gotta take out its brain. How'd I do that? I <i>could</i> have stamped it, but I'm not the kind of guy who likes to crush skulls with my feet, undead or not, and it could've bitten through my shoe or something. Plus, I'm a coward, so I kick it flat when it tries to rise and I leg it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know, right? Didn't kill my first Zed.

'Course, halfway down a bin gets knocked over and this figure stumbles out of a doorway. I was bricking it, but I had the sense to check behind me that I could still escape. Going back could mean crucial minutes lost, so I decided to run up to get some momentum, and plant a kick in it's chest. So they fall over, and start shouting drunkenly at me. I'll tell you, I felt a right dick, so I said sorry and tried to help the guy up. He was having none of it, and when some guys holding guns and wearing something over their faces ran into the alley from behind, I dropped the poor sod and ran for my life. Just as I turned the corner I heard gunshots. Dunno where they were aimed, but I can tell you, as a guy who's never been in a real fight, let alone a gunfight, and has just met the hungry undead for the first time, those shots were <i>LOUD</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must have been distracted, 'cause I took a wrong turn and had to backtrack. Thankfully nothing hostile was in sight so I sprinted up the road and got to the back of my house without serious damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swear, I must have tripped over every damn plant, bike and garden tool we had. But I made it to the door anyway, and fumbled with my keys for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door was unlocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, being a terrified idiot, I ran in, screaming WE GOTTA GO. No reply, I ran from room to room. The house was empty, thank god. Then finally my brain took over, and I shut the windows, closed the curtains and locked the front door, leaving the back door unlocked in case I needed to leave in a hurry. But where the hell was everyone? Yeah, they had left a note on the kitchen table for me, saying that they couldn't reach my mobile etc, and were very worried etc, and were driving up to Mark's place, 50 miles north of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks, folks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, I thought getting out of here would be a good idea. I grabbed my rucksack, spilled all my school stuff on the floor, and shoved in some clothes, head torch plus two handfuls of batteries, some food, jacket, sleeping bag etc. I also leant under my bed and took out the air rifle I hadn't used in years. Okay, what else..? Oh right, crowbar, first aid kit (I really wished I'd taken the course...), Swiss army knife and mobile phone I'd left off in a drawer. Well, how would I know tonight of all nights the zombie apocalypse would come?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn most important of all, two packets of menthol &amp; eucalyptus gum and my old, battered MP3 player.</span></div></div>",

The sounds of clawed hands on doors came soon enough, with the moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>jeez</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the movies, they had done the fear, the horrible deaths, the tension of a siege. But they hadn't factored in the sheer noise the zombies made. I mean, the movies weren't exactly for educational purposes, sure. But they were the only thing I had to go on, and I found myself cursing them for not being realistic enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are few things as scary as hearing, not just seeing, the things bash at your door and claw the windows. Really, I should have got out there and then, but it was so absolutely, brain numbingly terrifying that you don't notice you're scared. You sit there, hypnotized as windows smash and bloody bodies come pouring into your living room. It sounds stupid, but I had to fight the urge to just lay into them with my crowbar. The whole horde. I wanted to take them all on. Who did they think they were? Breaking into my house?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, I know. <i>dumb.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got myself into the kitchen, closing the door on the roiling mass of gore-covered dead. For some reason the light was off, I was left in the dark, only a streetlight outside prevented me from being totally blind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDidn't cross my mind any dead would come in through the back door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was, until it tried to eat me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hands, gripping my shoulders. Teeth in a black maw, opening for my throat. This was where my survival instinct <i>finally</i> came to me. I brought my fists together, low,  and as it came for me I brought them up with all my strength and adrenaline, between its arms, breaking its grip and landing it a hell of a blow on its chin. It staggered back, slipped on the homework I'd poured out of my bag minutes before, giving me the chance to finish it off with a thrust of the crowbar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst time homework was of any good to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't have time to gloat over my victory, since the door holding back a hungry horde gave way. It was sheer luck in the dark kitchen that I avoided the flailing grip of torn fingers. And luck again there were no more waiting for me in the garden. I grasped for my bike in the light of the streetlight, found it, and made good my escape up the avenue before I joined the shambling procession bursting out the back door.</span></div></div>",

I pelted up the road faster than I'd ever cycled before, guided by orange streetlights and the headlights of vehicles strewn all over the street. I could vaguely hear shouts, screams and shots, but I was only really conscious of the path I had to take, through the crescent, bypass the clogged high street by cutting through the car park, where I had to skid around a four by four to avoid a silhouette which was staggering along wheezing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to scan the car park for danger with only one streetlight far up ahead. I kept hitting curbs and skidding on something slippery, which I hoped wasn't blood, I couldn't see any bodies anyway. I halted before the gate, threw my bike over and followed it, looking about in case anything was following me, but it looked like I hadn't attracted any attention from whatever was going on on the high street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI passed a few warehouses and the fire station, where the light streamed out of the garage. The truck was out, and I had I been religious I'd have prayed or something for the poor blokes. I wheeled through the massive doorway and looked about me. I had thought 'fire axe' right away, but there were only tools and grease. The door to the station itself was locked, and I could hear or see anyone through the glass. I pedalled away up the road, away from what was left of my hometown.</span></div></div>",
