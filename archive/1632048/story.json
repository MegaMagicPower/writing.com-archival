Returning your mind to the present, you notice a castle in front of you, and your curiosity is peaked. You walk up to the door, cautiously opening it and stepping inside. As soon as you close the door, you feel a strange tingling sensation, and suddenly things seem bigger to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Wait... no, you're just smaller! How the hell did that happen? Well, at least your clothes shrank with you. Swearing in confusion, you try to find a place to calm down and get your bearings when the door opens again, and in walks that sexy lavender cat that you've masturbated over for 3 years... oh wait, that's just me. Blaze closes the door, and stretches some, when she stops... and sniffs the air. Then, she slowly turns her head... and stares right at you.</span></div></div>",

You felt around and confirmed you were still inside her womb, feeling the familiar soft and squishy walls. As soon as you did this you heard your new master pur, she obviously felt you even in there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You stopped for a bit to see what she would do, after her purring ceased she talked down to you; ' oh, your finally awake, I take it you enjoyed your rest?

Despite how warm and oddly comfortable her womb was, you still felt a primal fear of being confined inside a small space, and a drive for survival. You frantically felt the walls around you in a futile attempt to find an exit; causing your new master to giggle. Of course the cervix was one, but Blaze had no intention of letting you back out through there. Your distressed psyche fumbled around for a cohesive thought eventually falling on a rather pressing question; \"how am I still breathing?\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You felt yours eyes widen as you asked yourself this. The immediate answer was an umbilical cord, but you prayed it wasn't. The thought of having your stomach and lungs connected to hers both disgusted you and brought even more dread as you realized that if this thought was true, you would either be unborn, or fully dependent on her for the rest of your life. You shuddered a little at the though before looking down and seeing...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Well... this is the first time I've written something like this. I've noticed... actually, no stories I've read that have dominating Sonic characters have had Blaze in them, so I'm drawing one up, with your guys' help. Note: I will provide the first chapter of the Male Human Path... read that, then use that as a template for the rest of the paths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuidelines (These are important!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. It's only the main character, and Blaze the Cat. Don't have anyone else in... it's called 'Blaze's Slave' for a reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. No transformations, and no scat, please? Other than that, hey, I don't mind what is added. Paws are encouraged, and I'd like this story to go that direction, but I can't control that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. If we go toward paws, then I'd like them to be bare, if at all possible. EDIT: Shoes and stuff are fine now. What was I on when I wrote these?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. The main character can be a human or a Mobian. I'll provide that choice first page, yeah? Cool<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Obviously no size altering, except for the Main character getting smaller at the beginning, but other than that... no.<br>\r\nEDIT: I'm actually now very fine with perhaps Blaze getting bigger... Gotta assert her reign, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6.Spell check is mandatory. One or two misspelled words is fine, but no chapters written in barely readable text, please? Oh, and if you do want to write a chapter, make it longer than one paragraph, unless it's a choice chapter. If it's a choice execution chapter, then try to detail it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Swearing is fine, just don't go overboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. No bullshit endings. Pardon my language, but I have seen too many of them. A bullshit ending is defined as (using this as an example), Blaze suddenly decides to kill the Main character, or something like that, and the story just ends there. Please, none of that. EDIT: I'm allowing killing the main character, just make it good and not a sudden thing. Preferably at the end of a chapter chain, the option will become available. After all, one can only displease their goddess for so long...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9. I am a fan of interspecies relations, so if the main character is a human, and Blaze wants to do something sexual with him, I am all for it. If the main character is a Mobian, I'm still for it, but I'd prefer the sexual stuff to stay with the human path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPardon me if the guidelines seem to be a bit harsh, but I like fair to high quality stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoy!</td>",
