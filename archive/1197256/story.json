            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your name is Kylie, and you were almost bursting with excitement! The small mountain town you lived in was usually completely boring, with nothing much to do in the way of excitement. But this summer, you had heard a new theme park was opening up! You had always dreamed of an amusement park coming to your town; it would be the perfect way to liven up the area. You and your anthro wolf friend, Judy, had planned to visit the park the very day it opened -- and that day had finally come. You were now driving along on the hour-long trip to meet Judy at the park, for what you expected to be your funnest trip in years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the park was in a bit of an odd location. Usually tourist traps like these tend to be well-advertised, but this one seemed like it was trying to be as far out of the way as possible. The path to the park was composed of completely empty back roads, with nothing in sight but forests. You\u2019d never been around this part of town before -- in fact, you didn\u2019t know this kind of area existed. It was about as far away from the rest of society as it possibly could be. You didn\u2019t pass by any buildings along the way, or even any other cars. There wasn\u2019t even any billboards advertising the park. You couldn\u2019t imagine a place this hidden away could get very much business. It was so far out of the way, in fact, that you were growing worried that your map may be wrong, until you finally see the silhouette of a ferris wheel over the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you drew closer, you finally got a good look at the park. You were expecting it to be kind of dump, but it actually looked like a real park. There was a huge ferris wheel and some rollercoasters visible in the distance, and above the entrance was a huge steel sign, \u2018<b>THEME PARK OF THE HUNGRY</b>\u2019. The only thing that worried you was how old it looked. The paint was peeling off the buildings of the park, with huge bushes and vines overtaking their walls. You were worried it was abandoned until you saw the employee manning the ticket booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou parked, and judging from the absence of other cars, it seemed like you were the first one here today. You got out and stood on the concrete in front of the park, waiting for Judy to show up before you went in. It was taking her a while, but you remained patient, as this park was so strangely positioned that it was easy to get lost on the way here. After a few minutes, you get a text message from Judy herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><div align=\"center\"><span class=\"cgrey\">\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550</span>{ /center}<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">| Where are you?

If she wanted to play mind games, she can mess with someone else. You were just here to enjoy the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approached the ticket booth, the first thing you noticed was a total lack of ticket prices being listed. The second thing you noticed was the employee at the booth. His eyes were dark, like he hadn\u2019t slept in a long time. He had long black lines along his face, as if he was some kind of puppet, but at second glance it seemed like it was just face paint. You approached him, trying to keep up a cheerful demeanor despite growing more uncomfortable. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cHello!\u201d</span> You smiled, half-heartedly, leaning on the counter. <span class=\"cborange\">\u201cCould you tell me how much tickets cost here? I\u2019m not interested in a membership or anything, I just want to-\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cOn our opening day, all visitors get in free,\u201d</i> He interuppted, not even turning to look at you, his voice eerily monotone - almost robotic. <i>\u201cHere\u2019s your ticket.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cOh, uh, great!\u201d</span> You laughed, a bit confused, as you took the ticket. You eventually work up the courage to ask, <span class=\"corange\">\u201cBy the way, why does this place look so, uh\u2026 worn down? Didn\u2019t it just open today?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cThe original park is old. Older than you could possibly imagine,\u201d</i> He replied in that same indifferent tone. <i>\u201cWe\u2019re in the process of restoring it to its former glory.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cAlright, well, uh, thanks!\u201d</span> You waved as you walked past, stepping into the park itself. You wanted to ask the employee more questions, but he kind of creeped you out. You guessed he wasn\u2019t very good at his job. The park itself was only more ominous. A completely empty amusement park was creepy enough -- it was even creepier when the place looked 100 years old. But you try to be optimistic; you had the whole park to yourself! Since you never had the money to actually rent a park, this may be a once in a lifetime opportunity. You grabbed a map from one of the stalls, a map that looked just as old and tattered as the rest of the park. You figure you only had an hour or two to yourself before the rest of the guests would arrive, so you had to make your first ride count. There appeared to be three different sections of the park -- where to first?</div></font></span></span></div></div>",

It lived up to its title - the water appears murky and green, you could hear frogs ribbiting and crickets chirping, and the air smelled pungent. It was just like a real swamp! At first, you got a bit disappointed. You didn\u2019t expect that there would be a water park, so you didn\u2019t bring a swimsuit. Fortunately, the rules oddly specified that clothing was optional in \u201cthe Swamp\u201d, so you just stripped naked and left your clothing on your chair. It\u2019s not like there was anybody around, anyway, and you didn\u2019t want to overheat in the sweltering heat of the swamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stretched as you relaxed on your chair for a bit.

From the looks of them, they were the biggest water slides you\u2019d ever seen! You were sure glad you weren\u2019t afraid of heights. You climb the stairs easily, as you don\u2019t have to worry about any lines. When you get to the top, you notice that there didn\u2019t seem to be any employee overseeing the slides. You also notice that the slides are so high that their bottom halves are completely obscured by the tree canopies. Thus, you couldn\u2019t see where the slides actually led. But they had to just lead into one of the swimming pools\u2026 right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the slides were huge, they were limited in numbers. There were only two, in fact; a grey one and green one. The grey one, \u2018<span class=\"clgrey\">Hippo\u2019s Pride Slide</span>\u2019 advertises an interesting gimmick. Apparently, along the slide, there are multiple paths that can be chosen. In order to make it to the bottom of the slide, the riders need to choose the correct paths. It doesn\u2019t specify what happens to those who choose the <i>wrong</i> paths, but it is implied that their fate has something to do with hippos. On the other hand, the green one, \u2018<span class=\"clgreen\">Serpentine Slide</span>\u2019 has an even more vague set of rules. All it recommends is to \u2018make it out the other side before it\u2019s too late\u2019!

Whenever you had the time and money, you made a point of going to visit whatever amusement park you could.  Your favorites so far have been Cedar Point in Ohio and Walt Disney World (you would never admit it out loud, but you have had a crush on Princess Jasmine ever since the first Aladdin movie.  It may have just been a tigress actress, but it was still a thrill to see her in person), but this one sounded promising.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe rides had been featured on a lot of travel shows, and the food was famous in cooking shows as well.

One was a fat-bellied tiger named Michael you had befriended on your first day in town.  He had a reputation as a very successful predator, as his large gut attested to.  The other was an absurdly well-hung stallion named Dorian with a reputation as the biggest Cassanova on campus.  (You thought he was absurdly well-hung, at any rate.  You aren't averse to an encounter with a cute guy, and you feel you have rather impressive 'equipment' yourself, but Dorian was built like hyper-fetish art online.  The rumor was that he could eat people with his cock...) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou grin.  All in all, it looks like things will be interesting today.

You had decently sized equipment yourself, made thicker by your fat, but you weren't as absurdly over-endowed and honestly couldn't visualize it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou look up at the main statue, and nod at it, tipping an imaginary hat to the lion statue, which was rumored to be the founder of the park.  You then look around, wondering what to do first.  You weren't as interested in some of the rides as most were, since you couldn't FIT in most of them (and besides, you had severe acrophobia, to the point where just LOOKING at a roller coaster made you dizzy) but you were very good at games.  You could always go to the food court, you liked regular food as much as you did prey.  The water park was always promising...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHell, you could just go hunting at the arcade, like you usually do.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tYou decide to head for your favorite hunting grounds, the video arcade.  Plenty of delicious, chubby nerds and the occasional inattentive and bored-out-of-their-skulls worker made for a primo hunting ground.  Waddling through the park, you pick up a snack along the way at the roasted nuts stand to tide you over.  The mousegirl running the stand seemed to greatly enjoy the site of your flabby bulk waddling by, and you make a note of it for later in case you get in the mood for some action as well as food.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou eventually come to one of the many arcades in this park.  It's your favorite because it's inside a building and has bad lighting, perfect for concealing even someone as large as you.  Perfect for making people disappear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCalmly, you polish off the last of the nuts, cramming them all into your mouth at once and crushing the paper cone they had come in.  You throw it away, and saunter into the darkness of the arcade, brief flashes of illumination coming from the multitude of screens.  You smirk, as they make your already impressive bulk look even more sinister.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou carefully take in every detail of the arcade, noting the types of prey at each game station, taking in how easy it would be to sneak up on them.  You tended to prefer smaller breeds, as they were easier to catch and/or overwhelm with your sheer size.  The larger prey are tempting, but you didn't get as fat as you are by taking chances.  That giga-dicked horse you saw earlier was proof-positive that a larger beed could be a pred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou eventually spot two possible choices for your first meals.  A slender, well-built deer playing Dance Dance Revolution, wearing himself out by playing on hard mode but doing quite well, score-wise, getting a perfect win with each round.  You figure that once he was done, you could grab him when he stepped off to rest.  You lick your lips, admiring his muscular frame.  You like eating atheletes, they tended to wriggle quite nicely once inside your belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLooking around some more, you spot a pair of geeks off in a corner by themselves, playing an old Mutation Nation game.  You blink, a little surprised that a game that old was still in arcades, but you guess that this place could afford pretty much any game they wanted.  The two of them looked to be twin brother rabbits, the only difference you could see between them being their outfit colors.  Both were plump, and completely wrapped up in their game, oblivious to anything around them. So engrossed were they, that they didn't notice the squirrel babe that sauntered by them, or that their shirts were riding up their mouth-wateringly chubby bellies.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou chuckle, licking your lips.  There were other possibilities, but those looked like the best places to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter a moment, though, you feel a sudden chill go through you.  Was something watching you?  Something that thought your chubby ass would be a tasty treat?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou bite your lip.  You want to eat someone, but your instincts are telling you it's dangerous to stay... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMaybe you can grab someone before leaving?  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tYou want to leave, your instincts telling you there's something dangerous here, something that might be able to eat you.  But your pride wins out.  You just can't leave empty handed.  Or empty-bellied, as it were.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKeeping to the shadows, doing your best to stay away from where the feeling of danger is strongest, you make your way over to the DDR machine, where the handsome, buff buck is finishing the last bonus level, dancing up a storm.  In fact, he was dancing so rapidly you were amazed his hooves weren't breaking the dance pad.  He was clad only in a pair of jean shorts, his shirt wrapped around the bracing bar.  He had no antlers, but from the time of year, you guess that he's shed them.  A second look shows that he's already developed little nubs of antlers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThat works out for you, as antlers are hard to digest and usually have to be broken off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou stay in the shadows behind the machine, expertly using the flashing colors to camoflague your immense bulk.  Patiently, you wait for the buck to finish, which he did with a flourish, getting a 100% perfect score and cheers from the crowd.  You applaud as well, the buck picking up his shirt and wiping his forehead with it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou lean forward a little.  \"Great job.  You look beat, though, lemme buy you a drink,\" you say, motioning for the buck to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe buck grinned, waving to his friends as he set off with you.  \"Thanks man,\" he said, \"My best score yet, but man I'm beat.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou chuckle, leading him into the darkness behind the machines.  \"Why we goin' this way?\" the buck asked, not suspecting anything yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou give him an honest answer. \"It's easier for me to go behind the machines...  I'd be apologizing every ten seconds if I moved through the crowd.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe buck snickered.  \"Makes sense.  'Cause no offense dude, you got a massive ass.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Among other things,\" you quip without missing a beat, \"Care to guess how I got this big?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe buck shrugged.  \"Should be pretty obvious.  I mean, a big fat tiger...\"  The buck trailed off.  You smirked, and turn around.  The two of you are behind a racing game with enclosed booths, big enough to hide you both.  The expression on the buck's face is priceless.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Aw shit...\" he says, looking directly into your golden eyes, a 'headlights' effect kicking in, locking him in place.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSmirking, you reach down and grab him, opening your jaws wide and shoving the buck into them headfirst.  The buck finds his head inside your hot, wet maw, your steamy breath, stinking of past meals, washing over his face.  Gagging a little, he tries to bring his strong, muscular arms up to push his way free, but you have both some muscle of your own underneath your vast amounts of flab, plus you have a good grip on his arms as well as leverage in your favor, the buck held up against your soft, flabby chest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPurring, you push the buck's head further into your jaws, until you feel your throat grip him.  You then swallow, feeling the buck's head get pulled inward.  You work the smaller male's shoulders into your jaws, murring and slurping at his bare chest.  You're still a bit nervous about the presence in the arcade, but you're determined to enjoy this meal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe buck, meanwhile, is struggling desperately, wriggling desperately against the hot, wet gullet that surrounded him.  He wondered fearfully why no one was helping him, why no one noticed the huge tiger eating him.  He wailed, a swallow bringing him into the tiger's gullet up to his elbows, the tiger's paws releasing him now that he was stuck.  He then struggled even harder when he felt the tiger working at his jean shorts to remove them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou grunt a little at the trashing legs, but you don't let that stop you from pulling off the jean shorts and underwear of the buck.  You set the jean shorts aside, feeling a wallet in them, and toss the underwear in with the shirt you had discarded in the trash.  You hear the wails of the buck inside you, and chuckle inwardly, loving the way the sound vibrated in your greedy body.  To tease him, you slurp at his bare crotch, amused when you feel him get aroused.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs much as you'd like to tease him until he came, the edgy feeling wins out.  You swallow his hips, and slurp up the bucks kicking, wriggling legs easily.  You lap at his hooves for a moment and then gulp them down, sending the buck to his fate inside your cavernous belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou belch, patting your huge, fat stomach, which hasn't grown at all from the meal it just ate.  That's part of why you like being so fat, as it makes it easy to keep a meal 'under wraps.'  You feel your powerful stomach start to churn, the buck desperately wriggling about, kicking at your bellywalls as he starts to be digested into more fat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSmacking your lips again, you look through the buck's wallet, finding a decent amount of cash and a few credit cards. You break the credit cards and put the cash in your own wallet, stuffed into your tight-fitting cloth shorts (which also double as a swimsuit), and toss the shorts away in the trash.  Meals didn't need clothes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFeeling more confident now that someone is in your belly, you have an internal debate with yourself about your next move.  Do you try for the bunny boy twins that were so wrapped up in their game?  It's close to the door, and the game is arranged so that you could overwhelm them without anyone seeing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOr do you give into your instincts and flee?  There are other people in the park to eat, no need to risk getting eaten yourself...</span></div></div>",

You've never felt a feeling of danger from that area of the park before, and it'd be a good place to discreetly relieve your growing hard-on.  You chuckle, patting your massive gut, purring at the struggles of the buck as he slowly succumbs to your digestive processes, and saunter up to the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe queue is thankfully short, and you are soon inside the mansion.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou grin widely.  This attraction isn't like your normal haunted mansions, where there's a set path to follow.  It's more of a wide open sandbox, which scares available in almost every room, scares that get progressively worse if you're dumb enough to stay.  The 'horrors' were designed to eventually heard you to the exit, the actors all skilled enough to scare even the hardiest of guests, the special effects almost Hollywood-quality.  If someone was foolish enough to stay in a room long enough, they would be ejected from the house via a trap door, which sent them on a slide to a pit of rubber balls to catch them.  It bypassed the gift shop and restaurant at the exit of the house and the better 'scare' rooms, so it was considered a foolish thing to stay in a room long enough to activate the trap door.  It had a reputation as the scariest haunted house attraction in the country. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBut it also had another reputation: as a primo makeout spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere were a few 'monster-free' areas, where people would sometimes go to have sexy fun.  And you knew where all of them were.  Perfect to find some relief for the growing tent in your pants (and if you were lucky, some action as well, and maybe a meal).  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou decide to visit some of the scare rooms first, so you don't give yourself away by heading straight for the makeout spot.  You notice a mother rabbit and her teenage daughter come running out of a room upstairs, screaming and giggling.  They are then chased down the hallway into another area by a 'spirit' under the floor making the boards bulge up as it went after them.  <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\tGrinning, you head out of the main lobby, where a deliberatley cheesy voice is 'warning' people of the dangers, and head for a nearby room.  You find yourself in what looks like a lounge, with tables, a piano, and a bookshelf nearby.  Almost immediately the creepiness starts, the candles igniting themselves, the cigarette case on one table opening by itself, a cigarette floating out and lighting on one of the candles, an invisible figure seemingly 'smoking' the cigarette.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou feel an excited chill go through you.  You'd been in this room before and still hadn't figured out how they did that...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA piano started playing, the song one that had been going through his head for days.  Another dose of creepy.  You grin, you love this house... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnd then a voice began whispering in his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t~We know what you did.  We know what you did.~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt's creepy as hell, but you love it.  You always did like horror movies, and this house was like a living o...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t~We know what you did in the arcade...~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOhshit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t~We know what you did to that buck...~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOhshitohshitohshit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t~We know WHAT YOU ARE...~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA ghostly hand gripped you on the shoulder.  You promptly haul your ample ass out of the room, moving faster than anyone your size had a right to, not wanting to deal with that any further.  Still, it was a great scare... This place never failed to impress.  <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n===============<br>\r\nElsewhere...<br>\r\n===============<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA voice snickered.  \"Preds are always easiest to scare,\" said the younger female voice, \"Especially big successful ones like that.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Still,\" said the older female voice, \"He's good.  He instinctively knows to avoid areas where preds big enough to swallow him are.  And even with you in the arcade, watching him, he managed to get a meal before escaping.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe younger voice purred.  \"You think we might be able to use him in the new attraction?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe older voice chuckled.  \"I think so.  If he can get away with eating ten prey, at least one per attraction, without getting caught, then we'll make the offer.  I know you'd like it, since you've been crushing on him ever since you noticed him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Moooom...\" the younger voice said.  \"At the very least, let me give him the ability to reform on his own...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe older voice chuckled.  \"Relax.  My main objection to the other ones is that you were too young when you tried to date them.  You're an adult now, so you can take responsibility for yourself.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"That, and you want more grandchildren,\" the younger voice giggled, \"Not that you need any more descendants, since you're pregnant AGAIN.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Your father and I have a healthy relationship, nothing wrong with that,\" the older voice chuckled.  \"Maybe you and this nice young boy will have a healthy relationship too.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe younger voice giggled.  \"That'd be nice, honestly.  But let's see if we can get him recruited for the new attraction we're planning, first.  He should be safe there, since none of the people that are actually dangerous to him, me included, can actually fit in the haunted house...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====================<br>\r\nThe Haunted House...<br>\r\n=====================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou cautiously visit the other rooms, and thankfully there's no scares that taunt you with your earlier meal.  Discreetly, you make your way towards one of the safe rooms, in this case an employee break room.  Sighing, you relax a little and start to reach under your huge, heavy belly to relieve your raging hardon.  One of the hazards of a heavy diet of living flesh is that it felt SOOO good to have someone wriggling inside your belly, which meant you got hard at inappropriate times...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOption 1.) You pull down your shorts and pleasure yourself, working off some of the sexual tension from your delicious venison meal.  You then go looking for a meal, since you feel relatively safe here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOption 2.) A slender, sexy tigress, a waitress from the restaurant, comes into the room to take a break.  She's more than willing to help you with that raging hard on, and so you have your way with this willing beauty... and then you eat her.  Fun and a meal, can't beat that.</span></div></div>",

Her trim, athletic figure is topped off with a pair of large, round breasts, which to your pleasure you can smell are real.  You're a little embarassed, but you have a good explanation ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThen you get another surprise.  \"Didn't know that the spookies were that much of a turnon.  Or are you just here to work off a prey woody?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou grin.  \"Second one...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe tigress nodded.  \"Relax, I know how it is.  But don't worry about it, I'm more than in the mood for a quick tumble.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou smile.  This is working out better than you thought.  Granted, you have every intention of eating her after you have some fun together, but no need for her to know that.  This is shaping to be a very good day.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You sure you can handle this?\" you say, shaking off your shorts, revealing your thick erection.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe tigress snickers, but you can see she's impressed as she licks her lips in lustful hunger.  \"I've fucked fatties before.  Don't worry big man,\" she said, getting down on her hands and knees underneath your heavy gut, \"I'll make sure this big fat rod of yours gets lots of lovin.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGrowling softly, you lean up against the wall as the tigress takes your manhood into her mouth and suckles it eagerly.  She unbuttons her top, and begins to give you a boobjob in addition to sucking you off. You groan, the tigress eagerly pleasuring your thick maleness.  After a few minutes of this, you let out a yowl of pleasure, unleashing your thick load into the pretty tigress's mouth.  She greedily gulps it all down, licking her lips and chuckling.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"That was great,\" you say, pleased at the blowjob.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I ain't done yet, handsome,\" she said, \"I haven't had a man since I broke up with my last boyfriend, and I mean to make full use of this fat pole while it's here.\" You feel her shifting underneath your massive belly, undressing even more.  You feel a tightness around your malehood and realize that she's stuffing your thickness into her cunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou laugh.  You can't help it.  You've had good days here before, but never this good.  You enjoy the tigress's body as she lets you fuck her, your heavy belly jiggling with each thrust of your hips.  Biting your lip to hold back a loud roar of pleasure, you let out another thick load into the tigress's tight, gripping womanhood.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Damn that was good,\" the tigress said, not coming out from underneath you.  \"I wouldn't mind meeting up with you again.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Neither would I,\" you admit, but since you plan to eat her you rather doubt that will occur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe tigress grinned as she crawled out from underneath your heavy gut, panting and sitting next to you.  \"Thanks,\" she said, \"I've been needing that for a while.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"My pleasure,\" you say, \"In every sense of the word, my pleasure.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe kisses you, and patpats your immense stomach.  \"Enjoy your meal, big guy.  I better get going,\" she says, reaching for her clothes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou smirk, and put a hand on her shoulder.  \"Enjoy my meal?  I think I will, thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe tigress blinks.  \"What are you do...\" she starts, her fur starting to stand on end as she notices the hungry look in your eyes.  She tries to get away, but you have too good a grip on her, one that becomes even firmer when you grab her by the arms and pull her up onto your thick, heavy belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"No... No please,\" she begged, struggling to get free, your belly too soft to get a good purchase on, \"Please, don't eat me!  I'll... I'll be your breeder slave, anything, just DON'T EAT ME!!\" Your hot breath washes over her, carrying the scent of your partially digested meal, a preview of her imminent fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou just lick your lips and stuff her face first into your gaping jaws, slurping over her face and muffling any further pleas for help. Her slender shoulders fit easily into your massive maw, the screaming of the tigress muffled completely by your thick layers of fat.  Swallowing, you work more of her upper body into your slavering jaws, her immense bosom squishing into your gullet with a pop.  You murr, slurping at those soft, furry mounds, teasing her nipples and gnawing at the delicious, fleshy globes.  You feel her wriggling inside you, whimpering and screaming at your touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDelicious.  Plus, you're very glad that they're real, as implants tend to give you the runs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLingering a little while longer on her immense bosom, which bulges your cheeks out cutely, you swallow, feeling those soft bulges go down your throat.  You easily slurp up the kicking, struggling tigress's slim belly, her curvaceous hips and firm rump popping into your jaws next.  You unashamedly plump her sex with your tongue, feeling her mewls of fear and pleasure inside your ravenous gullet, the tigress squirming about helplessly inside the clutching, slick-fleshed walls.  <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\tSince you felt no dangerous presence here (aside from that rather disturbing encounter in the one room), you take your time, delving deep into her sex, savoring her juices and bringing the tigress to climax, her legs kicking about desperately as your tongue molests her, her toes curling cutely when she came.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter her climax subsides, her legs droop a little, going limp.  You take advantage of this, slurping up those slender, sexy legs until just her feet are in your maw.  You tickle her heels with your tongue a few moments, making her wriggle some more, and swallow them down, sending the tigress to her doom inside your belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe tigress slid into your ravenous gullet with a sickening plop.  She screamed desperately as she was pressed against the still digesting remains of the buck, the former predator now no more than a meal for a gluttonous tiger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs you finish off the tigress, you hear someone yell, \"AAAHH!  BLOB MONSTER!  BLOB MONSTER JUST ATE SOME GIRL!  ITS TENTACLE TRIED TO GRAB ME!!\" and then run away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter polishing off the tigress, you lick your lips and belch in satisfaction, amused by what you had heard while eating.  You feel under your massive belly, and chuckle, realizing you have a woody again.  Deciding you don't care, you pull your shorts back on and loot the tigress's wallet, stealing the money in her wallet as well as an employee access card.  You never know when it might come in handy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou wander out of the break room, several people looking curiously at the door, including the wolf and giga-dicked horse you saw earlier.  As all of them were preds, they just smile knowingly at you and move on their way.  The horse, who apparently has a date with him, discreetly high-fives you as you pass by him.  You just smirk, your fat belly still not bulging from the meal added to it, and move along through the rest of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====================<br>\r\nElsewhere...<br>\r\n==================== <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Nice,\" the elder female voice said, \"Very smooth.  Love the swallowing technique.  Plus, he got sex out of his prey, which is always a plus.  Should be fun to see what he does with that access card.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe younger female voice seemed confused, though.  \"What's a Breeder Slave, Mom?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe elder female voice chuckled.  \"Well, some preds like to play with their food.  They become breeder slaves, providing young for their pred for as long as they can keep their interest.  Almost always they get eaten in the end, usually with most of the kids they provide.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe younger female voice chuckled.  \"Hmm... Any guys ever end up a breeder slave?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe elder female giggled.  \"Oh, I've had a few.  My lovely mate is the one who sired YOU, though.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe younger female grinned.  \"Sounds like a fun concept.  Still, this just makes me like that big fat stud even more.  Most preds get weird about eating their own kind, but he gobbled up that tigress without hesitation.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe elder female nodded.  \"If he can keep this up, he'll be perfect for the new attraction...\" </span></div></div>",

You pass through the various rooms, enjoying the various scares that appear.  Plus, there's the tremendous satisfaction you get from feeling the tigress thrash about in your belly, hidden completely from view by your fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA measure of a good haunted house is how well it can terrify you.  And this house manages to do just that.  You were in a room with several other furs (including a tasty-looking muscular, athletic mare you were thinking about eating), a kitchen from the looks  of things.  Near one wall were heavy metal pipes, with a sign with a cheerful face on it saying 'grab me!'  The moment everyone one of you did, the floor collapsed, everything falling into a dark void, leaving just enough for a foothold (barely, in your immense case).  Everyone in the room just barely managed to hang on.  Once everything had fallen in, a low rumbling started coming up from the floor, as a pair of demonic eyes opened up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThen the teeth appeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThen they started getting closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"HOLY FUCKING SHIT!!\" screamed the mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"EVERYONE MAKE THEIR WAY TO THE DOOR!!!\" you scream, your danger sense suddenly going wild, cursing yourself for not sensing it earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEveryone hastily makes their way towads the door, a chubby hamster losing his grip and falling off.  The demonic mouth opened up, eagerly accepting the hamster, a tongue coming out and pulling the screaming morsel into its mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"KEEP MOVING!!\" you scream, praying that you can climb out the doorway.  One by one, the others reach the door.  Most get out, but a couple slip and fall into the ravenous maw below.  Finally, you reach the door, and grab onto the edge, struggling against your huge gut to try and pull yourself up.  You don't feel regret for eating people, even in this situation, but you decide in this moment that you HATE IRONY and REALLY don't want to be eaten here!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=============<br>\r\nElsewhere...<br>\r\n============= <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe younger woman blinked.  \"I thought there wasn't anything in there that could hurt him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe elder woman chuckled.  \"So I was wrong.  He must have found a way to fit himself in a room.  Good trick with the collapsing floor, though.  I'll talk to him later about it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe younger woman bit her lip.  \"Think he'll make it?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe elder woman shrugged.  \"That tiger you're crushing on?  Maybe, maybe not.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe younger woman shook her head.  \"I hope he does.  I really like him...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe elder woman patpats her daughter comfortingly.  She's interested herself, but if he does get eaten, oh well, life goes on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOption 1.) You're having trouble getting up, but to your surprise (and eternal gratitude), a buff bear and the mare you were thinking about eating earlier help you, pulling your heavy self up and out of the room.  The three of you rest outside the room, which in the instant you are fully out repairs itself as if nothing happened, and discuss what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOption 2.)

The problem is, the floor has dropped to the point where only your chest and shoulders were above the doorframe.  You grab on and struggle to pull yourself up, digging your foot claws into the wood, praying that you could scramble up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTo your horror, however, you can't get a good grip, can't get your huge, prey-fattened stomach over the doorway.  Clawing desperately, you struggle to get up, the pred in the floor getting close enough for his breath to be felt on your ass.  You hear another fur behind you get grabbed, and whimper, struggling to get out. You can almost hear the tigress digesting away in your vast belly laughing at you, knowing that you're about to be eaten alive...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t...And then something you never expect happened.  The mare you had been thinking about eating, along with a burly bear with a light Russian accent, reached down and grabbed your shoulders, starting to pull you up.  The two braced themselves on the door frame, yanking with all their might to save you.  Not really understanding why, but by no means questioning their kindess, you struggle as best you can, your claws tearing up the wall as you are slowly, but steadily, pulled up onto the floor.  Once your belly is past the gap, you scramble the rest of the way through and kick the door shut.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe three of you collapse on the floor, panting for breath.  Behind the door, the sound of furniture moving and a loud creaking, as if a large door were closing, followed by a click came through the doorway.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You...\" panted the bear, \"Are FUCKING heavy.  I really hope that's a prey gut, because I really don't want to have to have saved a lazy fatass.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou roll your eyes.  \"Trust me, all of this flab is from people I've eaten.  But thanks for saving me back there...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"No problem,\" said the mare, rubbing her arms, \"Granted, I'm not gonna wanna LIFT anything heavier than a stuffed animal for a long while after this...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe three of you laugh, and slowly pick yourselves up.  You poke your stomach, and smirk, \"Thought I was done for, didn't ya?  Well, ha ha to you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe bear snickered, while the mare ignored you both.  She looked into the room again, and gagged.  \"Oh, for God's sake...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou and the bear look at the room, only to find that it had reset to exactly the way it was before the floor dropped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe bear snorted.  \"Looks like the rumors are true about this place, then,\" he said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe mare smirked.  \"That just makes it interesting, Bobby...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBobby growled.  \"I'd rather eat than get eaten, Sally,\" he rumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You and me both, brother,\" you mutter.  Meanwhile, you noticed a notebook, a marker, and some tape inside a nearby desk.  \"I'll fix whomever that was,\" you say, picking up the notebook and writing something on it.  Bobby and Sally looked on curiously as your tore the page out and taped it to the door, giggling when they read the sign. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"OUT OF ORDER\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Beautiful,\" Sally said, \"I love it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou chuckle, proud of your work.  \"Now that that's done,\" you say, \"I'm getting out of here.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Amen,\" Bobby muttered, \"C'mon Sal, let's get out of here, go on a couple rides.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"And then back to the hotel room for some more rides,\" Sally said, whickering.  \"You wanna join us?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou shake your head.  \"Nah, I'm too big for most of the rides.  Plus I got really bad acrophobia.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBobby shrugged.  \"Then how about we meet later at the hotel?  Neither of us are averse to threesomes,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou actually had to think about that one.

Heading over to the door, you swipe it through the lock, which opens up and allows you entry.  (You have to squeeze your flabby belly through, but not by much.)   You head in, looking around the 'Employees Only' area.  It's about what you expected, a drab area with some dark, Halloween-y colors and decorations for atmosphere.  There's lockers of varying sizes (including some, distressingly, that are much larger than you), and what looks like a lounge with some large, plush chairs of various sizes, a PS3, XBox 360, and Wii, and what looks like a commissary that connects to the main restaurant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t'Not bad,' you think, 'I wouldn't mind working here m'self.'  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou look around, seeing a large, branching tunnel with several staircases.

You're terrified at first, but thankfully, he's not here to eat you.  He's taking the rest of the day off to help a friend who's family is in the hospital, but doesn't want to leave the room unattented.  He admires your trickery and decides to ask you to fill in, saying that you can keep whatever you take off people you eat, and promising to put in a good word for you with the management if you want a job for real later...

All the paintings are rigged up over security cameras.  The sign's already been removed,\" he said, \"and I've already had a meal from that room.  I'm just impressed that you had the guts to try and stick it to me after nearly being eaten.  Most survivors just panic and run.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou shake your head, starting to calm down.  \"Panicking just makes you even more careless you were before.  I've had several meals that were on the run and panicking, all of them not looking where they were going until it was too late and they became bellyfat.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe panther nodded sagely.  \"True, true.  Hey, listen, can I ask you a favor?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou blink, confused.  \"Um... If it'll ensure me not getting eaten, then okay.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe panther sighed in relief.  \"I promised a friend of mine I'd be there when she checks out of the hospital today, and I got clearance from the bosses to do so.  Problem is, I don't got anyone to cover for me in the trap room.  You mind filling in for the rest of my shift?  You look like you got the stomach capacity,\" the panther asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou look through the darkened hallways leading to the trap rooms.  It's a tempting offer.  Plus, if it came down to a choice between possibly annoying a panther large enough to eat you by saying no or getting free meals, then the choice was obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Sure thing, sounds like fun,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe panther grinned, and nodded.  \"Thanks, I owe you.  Hey, if you're interested in working for us for real, put in an application before you leave.  It's fun work, plus I get a paycheck bonus for referring someone.  You can keep whatever you take off of anyone you eat, I'll put in a good word for you with the bosses.  I'll even make sure that you get a free room tonight with no pred charges, in case you want to stay 'til tomorrow.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou blinked.  \"'Pred charges?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe panther shook his head in amusement.  \"You wouldn't believe how many preds try to get a free room by eating a tenant.  Like I said, the paintings are security cameras, so we charge any pred that thinks they can sneak a free overnight stay by eating someone.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou grin weakly. \"Thanks for the tip,\" you say, the panther chuckling and walking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"My room's 7U on the first floor,\" he says, \"A costumer there will help you get set up and show you how to trigger the traps.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou nod, and waddle into the hallway, relieved that you weren't eaten and eagerly anticipating the meals to come.  </span></div></div>",
