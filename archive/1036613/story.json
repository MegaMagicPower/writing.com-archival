A horrified exhalation interrupts your mix of defiance and pleas as the back-rest telescopes slightly, stretching your abdomen discomfortingly and pacifying your attempts at temporary respite in that quarter. To make matter even worse, a pair of straps shoot from immediately below your ribs and across your upper hips, locking your entire, ticklish belly helplessly in for some much deserved tickling.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Now that's more like it! Come on, little boy; howl for me!\" Your laughter reaches a new pitch as the effect of the fresh restraints are felt.

He looks over at you and looks back at the door.<br>\r\n\"I was minding my own business when a letter comes to my door.  I thought it was just an invitation so I put it off to the side.  I started to get suspicious when I noticed that I got the exact same letter three or four times.  I guess it was a mandetory meeting so I finally went to this address.  It all looked pretty ackward due to the location, but it got worse.  I was thinking about turning back until I was knocked out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I woke up restrained to some sort of chair with my arms hanging over me and my feet chocked at the ankles by cuffs putting me in an uncomfortable position.  I felt even more scared with my shirt taken off.

I don't know how but was able to find my ticklish spot on my feet and he never left that spot alone.  Just when I thought it was going to end like that, someone came into the room and request that Tortelli work on another patient in the next room.  I took a deep breath and rested for a moment, but the person there took his place and scraped at my feet again. Thankfully he wasn't as bad as the person before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After a few menacing hours of excrooshiating tickling, he then stopped and answered his cellphone.  That was my chance and I took it.  I tried my best to get out.  I broke out of the left arm lock and then the right.  After that I broke open the locks on my ankles and I covered the guys mouth for a few seconds until he fell unconscience.  I could barely walk, all that tickling left my feet feeling numb.  I strapped the guy to the chair and noticed a panel as I was walking away.  He woke up and looked around I then pressed a big red button and a bunch of hands popped out of the ceiling and tickled every nerve on that guys body.  he was full of tears and I started to feel bad, but I just left the room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I then noticed the cellphone on the floor and there was still someone on the other line.  I picked up the phone and said, Sorry, you friend here is being vigorously tickled right now, he'll you back and hung up the phone.\" The wolf started laughing and you laughed along with him.  \"I think it's safe to go outside, are you ready kid?\" he asked.</span></div></div>",

Each glove, you realize, right before they contact, is covered in tiny bristles of various sizes and textures, longest on the fingertips but receding and becoming smaller and finer on the palms. She digs her hands in hard, squeezing at your pects tenaciously. Each movement of her hands is amplified by the nastly little hairs, which stiffen and align vertically from the way they're being rubbed against your skin, tickling hellishly. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Not agahahahahain!

Try to escape. Exert yourself. In the end, you'll only wear yourself down. And then, when you don't have the strength to resist any more... \" She says, voice dropping to a husky whisper as she leans over your body, putting her mouth to your ear. She has a hand on either of your sides, just below your underarms, squeezing with her entire hand at a time. It tickles horribly- but it's like a pulse, blasting through you every other second, interrupting your attempts at breathing normally each with each explosion, forcing you to take rapid, stuttering breaths almost useless in recovering your strength. Pinned beneath her weight, you can't even squirm, have to just lie there taking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Poor wittle boy is just too tickwish on his little ribs- But I wonder where else he's ticklwish?\" She taunts, lifting her head to tickle your neck with her teeth- and slowly inching her hands northward. You leave off your twisting, suddenly tensing up in alarm and concentrating solely on bringing your arms down. \"Probabwy in his twapped widdle...\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Heheh-Please, no, no... Not there...\" You whisper in fear, trying to bite back the giggles. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Underarms!\" She yells triumphantly, tearing her hands into your armpits. You bellow at the resumption of ticklish agony, straining to get away. Here, the full power of her hand-wear is revealed, as the stiff protrusions on the end of her gloves easily reach from one end of your underarms to the other with one swift little motion of her hands, digging deep and leaving long, select sections of nerves tingling, unlike the overall blanket tickling you had suffered earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Ahahahahahahahahahaha! Sy-st-hahaha-hop! Pleheahease! Ahahahahaah!\" You scream, the tickling having  reached new heights. Resting her elbows against a sensitive spot in your sides, she soon falls into an easy, practiced beat, strokeing and scratching away rhythmically. Her fingers drag down from the lower reaches of your biceps, gaining pressure and momentum as they descend, pressing in their hardest when level with your chest, in a specific little niche positively loaded with nerves, briefly relaxing as they brush your sides, before racing back up to begin the cycle again. Her thumbs are perfectly braced for the procedure over you nipples, slowly rubbing away and occasionally flicking idly, subtly arousing you with acute, painful slowness.           </span></div></div>",

Clean Gatomons feet on ticklish way. Best you use the soapy water from the buckets here.\" Turtelli shows the buckets to you and the brushes. \"First the stiff, then the soft brush, big to small. And be slow, that she can love it, each bristle is worth to be felt by her sensitive feet.\" Turtelli smiles and walks to the door, smiling. \"Do it right or i will think about watching you curling on the floor of laughing.\" The boots stroke your soles and you giggles and goes over to Gatomons feet and looks at then, how she struggle. \"Please, don't be too hard to me. He tickle-wash me now since three days. I can't anymore.\" You looks at her feet and wet them in fear, what Turtelli had said. Gatomon giggles and twist away. \"Please, not tickle me.\"  </span></div></div>",

Pulling out the stopper, she smiles wickedly as she holds it precariously over your torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what this is?\" she asks.  You shake your head meekly that you don't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is an oil that will make you twice as ticklish as you are right now.  There's no sense in resisting me, you may as well just take it.\"  With that, she pours half of the bottle on your chest and stomach.  Setting down the rest back on the table, she comes up to you and begins to rub the oil into your body, taking special care to rub it into your armpits and your six-pack abs.  As the warm oil is caressed into your body, you begin to squirm under her gentle touch.  This alone feels like it's too much for you, and she hasn't even started tickling you yet!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready or not, here it comes!\" she declares suddenly.  You start to protest, but her skilled hands immediately go to work on your helpless frame.  You scream with laughter as she tortures your underarms, tickling with her nails up and down the upper arm into the pit.  After nearly ten minutes of that horrible torture, she shifts down and begins assaulting your abs, using a single finger to trace the out line of each one.  Ever so slowly she dances the finger into your sensitive navel, causing you to lose all control.  To make matters worse, she begins to attack your ribs with her other hand.  You try to demand that she stops, but you can't get the words out without any air.  After what seems like endless hours, she lets up just long enough for you to catch your breath, and then she begins to trace her nails around your nipples.  You giggle and moan at the same time, noticing in between laughs how arousing it feels.  You can possibly think of a worse torture...but clearly she can.</span></div></div>",

You were tied to a bed with heavy-duty titanium rope. You charge up all your strength to try and break the rope, but it fails. You see that your firearms are gone. In the corner of your eye, you spot a knife. You try to move as closest as possible to it, but you are nearly immobile. You try to use your mouth to get the knife but it doesn't work. Suddenly the door bursts open. It was Renamon. \"Well... crap.\", you say. \"I was nice to you. You had no reason to beat me. Now you'll pay! You won't get out of here until I say so. Oh and as you can see, I placed a knife there, just to laugh at you!\", Renamon laughs evilly with a sinister smirk on her face. She then proceeds to your feet, which is your weakest spot. She slowly inches her wiggly fingers nearer you your extremely sensitive feet. She then starts to scratch your feet with no mercy. You instantly start to break out maniacal laughs. The tingles dispersing all throughout your body were slowly draining your sanity. Were you able to see daylight again? Will you be Renamons tickle slave? Did you lose the game? Are you trapped here for all eternity? If not, then how long will you be here? A week? A month? A year? A decade? A century? A millennium? An epoch? An eon? All these questions swirled in your head while Renamon ruthlessly tickles your sweet spot. She then positions herself atop your stomach, and plants a kiss on your lips. She then brushes your sides with her furry tail while she tickles your armpits with no sign of sympathy. You laugh helplessly. While she tickles you, she starts to sing:<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the game, let me start off by saying. Neither your knowledge or consent is required for playing. Here's the deal you dont have a choice, you can lose the game by the sound of a voice. And when you lose, you gotta announce it, just be about it. Yeah, thats right, stand up and shout it. Now that you lost, you can never win, 'Cause the minute you forget it, you are playing again. Heres the coolest and cruelest thing I could do, say that I just lost the game, and now you did too. You see that person? The one who just said hi. You will now lose the game every time they walk by. The reaction is chain, once you get the game in your brain, the aim is insane, you can only claim to maintain your sanity. As the object is forget it exists, but if the game never leaves, tell me how can it be missed? You think, You lose, there is no way to win. Thats the way the game is played let me say it again. You think, You lose, there is no way to win. Oh Crap, I LOST THE GAME is the phrase you keeping.\"<br>\r\nShe then intensifies the tickling while she sang that grave song. <br>\r\n\"Don't get it twisted. The mission is to inflict association, between losing of the game and their favorite radio station. It's fact, just like that, they're trapped, with no way to escape. It's a snowball effect with the baddest of habits to break. Here's the part of the plan that you must understand. Make it personal, don't write Game on the palm of their hand. 'Cuz we all got palms, and even after the ink is gone, the memory of its presence will forever live on. May I suggest, or what I've heard works best, stick a simple sticky note on the drivers side head rest.

You gained strength and managed the push of Renamon and break the roped. You then run as fast as you can for your life. Surprisingly, you ran very very fast. You not only gained strength, but also agility. You then rush through these cursed hallways. For some reason, you feel a tickling sensation in your hip. You keep running as fast as you can, and you can see the light of day. At last, you are finally getting out of this hellhole after so much time from being tickled. You run at your fastest speed which is, 85mph and with all your strength, you purge through the steel door and end up in the threshold of Bing's Tickle Mansion. As you see the light of day, you run farther and farther away from that horrid feather-infested sh!thole. You put on some regular clothes, a METAL SLUG 3 shirt, a green sweater, some pants, and sunglasses. You then took a train to New York. You made a stop halfway through and got some weapons at the Mo's Fo Shizzle Weapons. You then take another subway train (F), and wait for it to stop at Parsons Boulevard. While you were waiting, you spy a Gatomon looking at you. You look back at her and you say,\"What do you want? What can I do for you?\" The Gatomon shyly replied, \"Well, are you ticklish?\" \"Oh hell no. Please, don't. Not on the train!\", you reply to her unorthodox attempt to tickle you on the subway train. She then hollers back, \"That's not a very nice way to talk to a girl! I'm gonna have to teach you some manners!\" She inches into your feet and you yell, \"Back up! Don't even think about it!\" You take out a set of dual colts. Gatomon then runs up to your belly and swipes away your hand-guns and holster. She then pins you down on the floor and mercilessly tickles your oversensitive belly. \"WAHAHAHAHAH! WHY DOES THIHIHIS KEEHEEHEEP HAPEHEHENING TO MEHEHEHE! WAHAHAHAHA!!!\", you wail in the almost deserted train car. After what seemed like countless hours, the train stops at your desired location. You then quickly grab your weapons and skedaddled out of there as fast as you can. You ended up in a chase with a cat girl. You ran past Dunkin' Donuts, Met, and Checkers. You were desperately tryiong to get away from her. You get up to one of the apartment doors, 83-37 and make your way to the 2nd floor, where you live. You burst in your home,. closed the door, and before you can lock it, Gatomon pushes through. Great, you have a tickle addict in your own house, and even worse, you are in a sexual position with her atop your soft, round belly. \"How can this get any worse?\", you whine in fear.

Got it? Also-' \" The recording cuts of, and SF's high pitched mechanical buzz resumes. \"Thus, I shall have to take you to the nearest restraint chamber for tickling post-haste.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGatomon looks disappointed but not overtly bothered by the sentence.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"All right then.

I still think that whoever locked him in there in the first place ought\u2019a take the rap instead of me. \" To your slight annoyance, SF doesn't even bother to restrain her as it whirrs back down the hallway with you in it's stead-fast grip.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Several turns and a flight of stairs later, the robot leads the way into another room.

Still proving immune to your struggles, SF casually rolls across the over and binds you to a cushioned device shaped like a divan, with you feet straight out in front of you in a set of stocks on one end, and wrists bound up on either side of your head as you sit more-or-less 'up' a the other. Finally, it removes the impromptu gag from around your snout and helps Chloe lock her hands between her paws into a set of stocks, before scooting wordlessly out the door.<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Well then, this is annoying.

She pulls back your fleshy toes and skittles her other paw down your foot. What did you do to deserve this? She circles your foot and brushes along the outside edge of your sole. Why won't she stop! You want to die. You wish your feet were not your own. She brushes the bases of your toes, and that's the cincher. You scream like a girl and beg when you can, but it will do no good. How could such light touches drive you mad? You can hear her talking, but you can't tell what she is saying with your blood pounding in your ears.

From the way the digimon in the middleof the chamber-actually, it's really more of a circular bulge in the corridor walls- is ordering around several other individuals-not all just mons-she must be important. I takes you a second to recognize how she seems familiar... Then you realize she looks alot like Ranamon, but with a darker, bluer skin tone. That would explain the unique outfit, and the group of disembodied hands, either carrying and/or ferrying items, jotting down notes, or some other menial task. Maybe their related or something. \"We're going after her? How are we supposed to nab her? 'Specially when she can summon those hand, and is surrounded by her entire entourage?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Relax. I don't want to mess with her. Actually, yu' see that other Gatomon over there? She tortured me when I woke up. I admit that a bunch of the stuff I used on you earlier comes from recently learning it first hand; <i>her</i> hands. And now I want to see just how ticklish she is!\" A human, wearing a short-skirt and a tee- walks up to the Ranamon look-a-like. She's carrying a clipboard, and looks nervous about something. They talk, and suddenly Ranamon yells at her. You manage to hear: \"Escape...moron...cell #87?...two...find them...firstly...\" She snaps her fingers, and the dozen hands leave off what they were doing to move up to the human. Appearing quite scared, she backs away from the ghostly pack, shaking her head. After a moment of aiming, they all fly at her, a pair going to each of her arms and legs, hoisting her off the floor and stretching her out at just above waist level. 'Ranamon' saunters up beside her, and reaches a signle finger down, slowly drawing up her hapless underling's shirt and exposing her cute belly. The girl, seeming quite desperate, says something else, making her superior grin maliciously and start to trace lazy spirals over her belly. The human starts giggling uncontrollably, and the mon orders two of her spair hands in to go at her plaything's sides, while the others pair slips off her shoes. She steps back though from the victim writhing in midair, and gesturing to the girl, smiles at the Gatomon, enjying the spectacle with the rest of those gathered in the chamber. She eagerly scratches at the humans bare soles, and the new struggling and pleading produced has the other assembled humans, anthros, and mons laughing along tauntingly. While pulling her toes back and brushing in the tender areas between them with her long, fuzztipped tail, she turns back to the Ranamon resembler. They talk-something which doesn't hinder the torturous, capable gatomon in the least, despite being distracted- and then the smaller mon bows and leaves, letting an eager cobra takeover. The gatomon hurries straight towards the hallway where you're lying-in-wait. \"Perfect! We'll reach out, nabb her, and then drag her in here. With those other fiends distracted, we'll be miles away before any of them get suspicious.\"Exclaims the friendly gatomon.  Still thinking this to be an unnesecarry risk, you tense, bringing your arms up. Humming to herself happily, and occaisionally firing longing stares back at where the hapless human's being disciplined, the small mon strides right up to you. Fear of getting caught lends you extra speed, and you have one hand on the unlucky gatomon's shoulder, the other on her mouth, and are dragging her in before she has a chance to yell. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her frantic squirming ceases abruptly and her eyes go wide when she notices her holders, particularli the gatomon, grinning triumphantly. A sudden increase in the volume of the unlucky girl's laughing and pleading for mercy in the room proper reminds you where you are, and you glance up nervously as you pull the tapestry across abit farther, helping your accomplice pull the prize into the deep shadows of the alcove.       </span></div></div>",

He walks over to you and then grabs both of your feet. \"That's a nice pair, almost like a Meowth's,\" he says, \"What do you thin of mine\". He flashes his feet right in front of your face by about one foot. You examine each of his feet: they are big and wide; flat soled; four toes; paw pads on the toes, a big one on the ball, and one on he heel. He wiggles his foot a little and you can feel a cool aura coming from his body, then he pulled his feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe asks, \"Now how should we get started?\"</span></div></div>",

Reaching up with one hand you give a quick stroke down his left sole. The reaction was immediate and strong, he tried to jerk away but his feet where kept perfectly still by the restraints. Building some more confidence you reach up with both hands and start scribbling all over. \"Mmmphhhhahahaha\" he cries as you find a particularly sweet spontaneous just under his big toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly two metal cuffs shoot out from the chair thing and secure your hands where they are. In shock you stop tickling and try to struggle free. Your so distracted that you don't notice as to cuffs for your feet and a muzzle lower down from the same device and before you know it you stuck standing up without being able to move your legs or feet, your hands trapped underneath the wolf feet and a muzzle stopping you from speaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you give up on trying to escape a small screen lowers on the screen where words that read a s follows: <i>and so the games begin. Serves you right for being so cruel. Now here is what your going to do. If you look up you will see a small key hole behind the wolfs feet. Once a key is inserted and tuned you will lowered and released. However the only way to get that key is to pump water into a tank behind you and the only way to get pump the water is to get the wolf to struggle up and down which if you look up again will move the seat he's attached to up and down which is attached to the pump. And finally the only way to make him struggle is to...well...I think you can finger it out. Finally if you don't make it with in 2 minuets then you will be looked into a chamber with some devilishly ticklish devices for an hour. Good luck</i> and with that a timer flashed up onto the screen and started counting down from 2 minuets. The device your attached to suddenly lifts you up and starts moving forwards at a steady pace. Looking in front of you, you see a small chamber filled with brushes: all perfectly placed to get to all of yours and the wolfs ticklish spots. With a muffled apology you begging to tickle the wolf feet in Ernest. He starts struggling and on the screen you see a percentage appear and slowly rise. But it's rising too slowly and you need to kick it up a notch. With another muffled apology you get out your claws and start tickling under and between his toes. He goes completely wild, bucking and shaking, the percentage is rising at a steady pace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach 30% but you only have a minuet to go. A sudden brushing feeling on your feet caused you to jump as you look down to see the device had taken you over a line of rotating brushes meant to distract you. But it did the opposite for as you laughed and bucked it helped you to tickle the wolf harder. Once you finally passed over the brushes you noticed through watery eyes that it was 99% full with 30 seconds left. A few more strokes to his feet and you heard a 'clink'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe key landed in a small trey next to your bound hands. You stopped tickling a picked it up as fast as you could, you where almost at the chamber! With some difficulty you positioned the key in line with the key hole. Just before you could slot it in though, some more brushes came up and tickled your feet again causing you to jump...</span></div></div>",

The tickling on your feet had stopped but you knew that that was only going to be for a few more seconds. The screen mocked you with <i>what a shame you where so close </i> before moving up and out of the way of the brushes that where turning already. Being clad in just you underwear you started feeling very venerable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you entered the chamber the tickling began. All of your ticklish spots where attacked at once. Your armpits, ribs, sides, tummy, legs, knees and feet where all tickled into oblivion. As the doors to the chamber you felt brushes on them begin to tickle your back and the behind of your knees. \"Mphahahahaha!\" You screamed. Some brushes popped out by your fingers and for a bit you thought they where going to tickle your hands but then you realised they where to tickle the wolfs feet who was just as exposed as you and receiving a similar treatment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour was finally up the tickling stopped. You where moved out of the chamber and dropped to the flaw along with the wolf. With his mouth now free he simply said \"you idiot\" before passing out with you following soon after. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up you found the wolf sitting next to you. In his hand was a note. Sitting up you asked him what it said. \"Oh hello your finally up. The note says this-<i>well you failed miserably at that game, if you continue like this you'll never escape. But never mind here's your next game; down in the crematory lies Derek's girlfriend. She if undergoing some tickling of herself and it will really kick off of you don't make it too her in an hour. Here's a little clue: she LAYS in a place with ETERNAL DARKNESS but with NO SPACE to move in.\" Once your ready go through the door your time will begin. This is a team effort by the way</i>-. Now I was going to leave you seeing as you tickled my feet and dropped the key but it looks like I need you to save my girl friend. Neither of us has a choice as it looks like we need to win these games to escape. Come on.\" Then, without offering you a hand he stands up and walks over to the door. You get up and meet him there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen step through the door you gasp: the next room is completely different. There is a very realistic graveyard. The was mist, graves, moss and even a sky! (Although if you looked very carefully you could make out a roof) you stepped forwards and the warm, hard stone floor of the first room turned into damp squishy mud under your paws. To your right was a stand holding two feathers shaped as long swords. The wolf walked over and picked one up. With a sly grin he turned to you and used it to tickle your belly. You giggle and back away. \"Now we're even\" he says still grinning. You relax a bit as it looks like he's forgiven you. \"But I wonder what these are for\" he continues. You look around and see a note attached to the stand you pick it up and read it out loud \"use these feather swords to fend off the living dead, who are as ticklish as you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had you finished the note 7 hands burst from the ground and out climbed 7 zombies. They began to zombie walk towards you however instead of moaning \"brains\" and reaching out to rip you apart they where moaning \"tickle\" and making tickling motions with their out stretched hands making their intentions quite obvious. Quick as a flash you grabbed your 'sword' and along with Derek you began to tickle the zombies. You tickled the one closets to your right who giggled before tuning to dust. Within no time you had both defeated the zombies. \"Well that was fun but we better get moving now. My girlfriend Lucy is in trouble. She's obviously trapped in a coffin in one of those mausoleums.\" He said pointing to 3 of them. You where quite impressed at how quickly he solved the small riddle as you had only just come to the answer 5 seconds ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you both ran towards to the structures you where constantly attacked by zombies and now all battles where as easy to win as the first. At one point a zombie hand shot out from the ground and grabbed your ankle causing you to fall face first into the mud then before you know it there was a zombie pile on whilst more hands came out of the ground to help hold you down and tickle you. The one that tripped you up took great joy in tickling your paws/feet (whatever you want to call them seeing as yours an anthro). You couldn't move your sword and thought you where doomed until Derek saved the day and tickled all the zombies into dust. Another time you where both overpowered and gang tickled by countless zombie hands. It was only by pure look that you landed next to Derek's sword and was able to fight them off enough to grab the other and for you both you to run away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally reached the mausoleums you where both panting, covered in mud and had wasted a lot of time. But you felt like you had bonded with Derek quite a bit and thought you could now call your selves friends. \"Right then it will be one of these building, which do you think it is\" looking up you see symbols above the doorways. On one of them was a zombie shape so you ruled that out quite quickly. But you couldn't decide which one was correct. There was a picture of a coffin which is what she was trapped in but the other had a symbol of a female who ,according to Derek, looked eerily like his girlfriend Lucy. Which do you choose?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All the hapless wolf tied to something on the cieling can do is grunt, thanks to the muzzle around his snout. You get the message from his frantic squirming, though, and call up \"Hold on! I'm gonna get you down.\" He's too high up to start untying right away, though he's been forced into wearing an odd boot-contraption that holds his feet together and taunt, with the toes pulled back and restrained individually by silvery metal. They're dangling just within reach of your fingers, but you dismiss the idea of tickling him and start looking for a way to scale the nearby wall. You find an ample supply of convienient handholds in the rather grimy wall, and you nimbly scale them with your freshly obtained claws. You reach his height, and see that he's actually sitting in something like a chair/harness, suspended from a hook built into the vaulted cieling. There's even a broad rim around it at the seat-like part that you should be able to stand on while you untie him. You glance at the hook, checking to make sure its secure, then coil and spring.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You agilely land on the device, barely shaking it, and look for the best place to commence sawing at the ropes with your sharp little fingers. Something on the back of his shirt catches your eye, though, and you snatch it off with one hand, hanging on with the other. Confused, you read it aloud. \" 'So, you're the merciful type, eh? FYI, all of his binding are made of firm steel, and should be quite hard to remove. A single, special key in a compartment beneathe his seat will instently loose all of them simultaneously when inserted into the compound lock behind his neck. IT, however, can only be opened by a certain pumping motion activatible solely by him, and can only be obtained by tickling him when you've locked your shins into the special restraints. Now, you had best hurry up, as the vault doors will close in approximatley one minute, and the machine's timer is set for an hour! Good luck in the game!' \"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Game?/!\" You repeat confused, but then lurch as the hook in the cieling starts moving backwards, along some kind of towline, and a pair of sliding metal doors located directly in line with you on the wall clang open. In the cubby space revealed inside, you can make out dozens of revolving brushes, strategically located to press in to the helpless wolve's immobile ticklish spots. Panicking, you start pulling frentically on the chains holding him, but notice that his over-arm tie is connected to a large, bizarre looking lock that all the chains seem to lead to. Rembering the note of whoever set this up, you look down and see a metal box bolted to the bottom, next to two cylindrical metal tubes leading off the platform at an angle. You sit down, thrust your feet through and close them, hearing a small 'click', then another from within the machine, and look at the box. You notice a thing resembling a pump leading from the harness throught the seat and into the box, and realize the note was right. Only he could open the compertment by moving a certain way. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The horrible little closet space is getting closer-you can see two huge twirling brush heads aimed specially at where your own feet are secured-and mutter an apologie. The wolf is squirming desperately, trying to get out before you reach the 'vault'. You reach up and begin hurredly scratching your fingers on his underarms. His eyes go impossibly wide, he yips through the gag, and starts squirming with amazing energy. Seeing a meter attached ot the side of the box start to fill up and change colour, likely demonstrating how far there was to go until the box opened, you move your fingers to his bare ribs, kneading hard. His struggles only increase, and seeing out of the corner of your eye that the brushes are coming closer, you are far to desperate to stop. You lean forward and start nibling in one exposed arm, swinging your tail to brush it against his belly, anything to get him to squirm harder. The meter fills, and a smaller side pouch unfolds. You snap the curiously shaped tool out frantically, and insert it into the mechanism holding the both of you. You nearly drop it-as the brushes finally contact your feet and the overwhelming pulse of nerve-burning sensations causes you to shake uncontrollaby. You muster the concentration to give it a final twist as the doors start to swing closed, and gasp in releif when bothe they and the horrendous tickling feelings stop. Panting from releife, you wrench your feet free, saying; \"Sorry, pal. It was the only way to get us out of here.\" He, also gasping for breath now that he's removed his muzzle, replies: \"No problemo. C'mon, let's get out 'o here.\" You jerk in surprise, when the doors and machine start moving again, but it's merely backing out and lowereing you to the floor. When you stand to leave, you notice something-another note- on his chair seat. You read it and show it to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Dear Brian,<br>\r\n      As you are likly aware, you and whoever was bold or unlucky enough to activate the last game were not the only ones,ah, <i>invited</i> to this facility. Sylvia's is among our other sbjects, and is currently being held not far from here in the building. The removal of this note activated a timer, which is portable and equipped with a  clue, that will show when her own tortuous tickle will commence. You of all people should know how sensitive she is. May you be luckier (or equally lucky)on this game!<br>\r\n      Sincerely, Jona Crammor</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Beside you, you hear the wolf, aparently named Brian, groan. \"What kind of sick bugger are we dealing with?\" He says softly, before turning towards you. \"Sylvia's my girlfriend. She's insanely ticklish. Please, will you help me find her? And it might be easier to escape this torture chamber if we work together.\" He pulls a dmall device form its slot in the back of the seat. It looks kinda like a watch, with a six-digit neon number witch reads: 00:59:34 and decreasing. Presumably, you have just under an hour to find and free Sylvia, if you so choose. Below the numbers is a small panel, etched with the words  <span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\">'Limitless darkness in a tiny space, the terror of claustrophobes and bane of taphophobes, and the last resting place of nearly all dead.

Before you could think of anything Pichu put his hand behind his back as if he was get something that he had, you start to get curiously worried when as it hand was behind it back it gave an evil sinister smile. While still smiling it pulled out it's back a feather, now you're confused. It walked toward your left foot which was level enough on the ground for Pichu to reach it, \"You're not going to do what I think you're going do.\" You utter. Pichu gave a kind nod, \"No, you can't\" you beg. Then Pichu started brushing your sole with feather, starting form the ball down to the arch. Your sole was so sensitive that you couldn't hold in your laughter, and your toes wiggled and curled up. You tried to pull your feet out of shackles on the chair, but your feet are too massive. Pichu continued making you want get to so bad, then Pichu stopped. Pichu walked to your right foot, he examined your right foot to find the most sensitive spot, You could see him gently massaging your right foot to see which spot wiggles your toes the most. He found that spot was the spot between your toes, you can only wonder what he was doing. Then Pichu got close to that spot with his mouth, stuck out his tongue, and gently licked between you toes. Both disgusted and helpless you let out in a big laughter, still wanting to get out of the situation. Then the Pichu licked the wrinkles of you toes then on your arch. You are uncontrollably laughing and sweating in extreme fear that this never end. Then a whistle shoot across the room, and Pichu stop. You were greatly relieved that it was over, you try to catch your breath while really tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pichu ran to where the whistle came from, the leaps into some cat like hand paws, you could see the rest of the body hidden in shadows. One paw was holding Pichu and the other was gently petting it along it's back. \"Good job, that will do.\" the mysterious voice says to Pichu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" you ask in anger. The being walked front and you see a little cat girl, \"You can call me Gatomon. Now, what do with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"If you touch me I'll...\" before you can continue she gagged you. \"You're coming with me.\" Gatomon said, \"You can meet the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She put down Pichu, and then kneel down to your feet and inspected them. She grabbed your plump right foot, then stroke her cheek out the sole. You are too tired to comprehend this. Very nice feet, some of the best I've ever seen, there plump and warm. She got you out of the chair and tied your hands and feet together, you were too tired to react.

She wasn't wearing the gloves that she had, you can see her soft furry hands (regarding the fact that both hands have scars on them). When you calmed down a little bit she said,\"I see you like my paws, and I like your feet. Let's see what happens when they touch. Gatomon first got  you a TV set and turned it on.

You tried to scream, you got her attention but your voice was too inaudible, she gesture her shoulders in confusion, turned back and went to your feet.<br>\r\n On the TV set you saw her put the tip of her paw fingers on the balls of your feet and slided downward, she did this more than once. This feeling was both calming and ticklish. She moved her hands a little faster and wiggled her fingers, now the feeling is just ticklish, you started to chuckle. She stopped, you looked in the TV to see her just lift her hands, and then revealed her nails, you got scared. She tickled your soles with her nails. You laughed harder and harder as she slowly applied pressure. She stopped and walked to your face. \"Your not tearing yet\", she said with a sad face, then she got a sinister smile and said,\"Let try the pressure point Pichu told me about.\"</span></div></div>",

Caressing the soles, you realize just how soft and warm they are- just as feet should be. They do not flinch or react, but they are very much alive. You drag your fingers along the sweet soles in slow swipes and scritch along the outside edges. You grab the feet from behind and curl them up towards you. A deep sniff takes in little scent, but you like what you can smell. You slide your broad, wet tongue from heel to toe, and you love it. You suck on the ball and cover the whole sole with your tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're doing it all wrong!\" claims Meowth, who is now standing to your right. \"You have to make it tickle, remember.\" He puts one paw on the right foot's sole and another beneath it, and drags them together. He repeats this a few times before adding wiggling fingers. Then, he digs his paw into the sole. \"Try it on the other foot.\" You dig your hand deep into the arch. Then, you trace the ball with a single finger and follow each wrinkle with a kind finger. Meowth is standing on the other side of the pair, now, and he is licking the sole like a cat would lap up milk from a saucer. You pull back the toes on your foot and scrape along the fleshier part. \"That was delicious! Now, the real fun begins for you.\"</span></div></div>",

Then, I'll let you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a recording,\" says Meowth, although his mouth doesn't move. The voice echos in your head. Your entire point of view flies out of the chair and up. You can see your body (your Charmander body, that is,) in the chair looking over the feet. From this view, you can finally see what is going on. Your Charmander body has no feet! Meowth starts unbinding your wrists, and you know what is coming next. Your point of view flies right up along side your former head, and your former wrists rest on your heels. You can feel the fingers drum on your soles this time, although you still cannot move them. The tiny hands begin to caress your soles, and it is then you realize just how sensitive they are. The skilled fingers drag along your soles, and you immediately start giggling, or at least you would if you had a mouth to laugh with. They trickle along the sides of your feet, and you break into a rolling laugh. Before you even begin to lose it, the feet are curled up and your former nose sniffs deeply. You look aweful cute, and the breeze along your soles only adds to it. Your tongue lands on your heel and slides up it, and it feels wonderful. You sigh in happiness when your tongue laps along your meaty foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're doing it all wrong!\" claims Meowth, who is now standing to your right. Your view slides around to your other side. \"You have to make it tickle, remember.\" He slips a paw on either side of your foot and pulls them towards your toes. You yip inside and shutter. Several more times and you have a rolling laugh going. He digs deep into the sole and you scream bloody murder. Worse yet, your old body reaches for your other foot and you brace yourself. You try to pull your feet away, but you cannot move them. You scream for them to stop, but they cannot hear you. You wish it hurt instead, because pain wouldn't be so bad. You want to scream. If you could tear yourself away from your feet, you would. You move a single finger around on your sole, and it tickles. But not as bad as Meowth. He skittles all over your other foot so intensely that you may have well not even been moving. Meowth stops to circle around and pull back your toes. His rough little tongue scrapes alone your sole, and that's as bad as it gets. Your body would be shaking and your throat would be sticking if either was there. Why won't he stop? Why can't you just die and get it over with. Oh, anything would be better. The cruel tongue continues its guerilla assault. Suddenly, you pull back your other foot and scrape your dry, clumy tongue along the ball. It may actually tickle more. It continues on for minutes, never ceasing, never changing. Finally, everything fades to black and you find yourself panting in the chair with a headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations,\" teases Meowth. \"You just tickled yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Keep up that tickling. Harrison, why dont you go and tickle her feet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Brandon.\" He walked to your feet and drew a feather from his pocket. He swirled it slowly up from your heel to your sole, and swirled them under your toes. Tears sprung from your eyes as he decided to saw in between the soft flesh between each digit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Brandon walked over to you and teased you under your chin.

With the vines still tickling your feet, and now starting to tickle other parts of your body, you are not in the best position to be greeting someone else. Thoughts of hope and embarrassment fly through your head. June notices you... and laughs. It doesn't make you feel better, but the thought of freedom is too good to pass up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehey!\" you struggle. \"Cou-could y-y-you hehehehelp mehehehe out a HAHAHAHA bihihit? Please HAHAHAHA!\" It's hard to get all the words out, but you manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune, still giggling, nods her head and walks towards you. \"Careful hahahah of thehahah vines HAHAHAHA!\" Unsure of what she will do, you watch curiously as she picks up a pair of trimmers from the ground and opens them. Ungazed, she steps toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vines quickly withdraw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll except one still holding your wrist and tickling your armpit. You keep giggling, until the vine drops to the ground. You see June standing there with the trimmers shut where the vine used to be. You lean on you knees and breathe deeply for a while, recovering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" you say once you get your breath back. You look up and notice she's wearing nothing but a jacket, bra, and panties. \"Uh, did you forget to dress today?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately blushes and tries to cover herself. \"Well...\" she begins. \"It's a bit of a long story. You see I don't usually need to dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway I'm Detective June Masters,\" she snaps, immediately losing all shame she had a moment ago. \"I came here to investigate some suspicious disappearings that have been happening in this area. This mansion seemed like a good place to hide people, so logically I ended up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Uh, yeah, right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious! Look, do you know if who owns this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I just woke up five minutes ago strapped to a chair in what looked like an interrogation room. I freed myself, hid, and then ran out past two people who were talking about tickling and escape. Next thing I know I'm suspended in the air getting tickled by some wacko vines.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some story,\" she replied. \"I have to trust you seeing as I saw you get tickled, and now that you mention it something tickled me when I snuck in...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway we need to get out of here. You said you snuck in. Where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune turned and pointed back down a hallway. You see a fork further down, and something that looks like an open closet. \"That's where I got the clothes from,\" she replies. \"Then to the left and down a bit is the window where I came in. We should be able to get out that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, let's hurry and get out of here.\" You rush down the hallway with June right behind you. It looks clear... until you turn the corner and see a closed window that's too high to climb out of anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" you comment. You turn around and walk back to the closet. You face June, who shrugs and looks at you, waiting for a direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow there are two ways to go. To the right is the greenhouse you were just in, and you know what awaits you there. To the left is an unexplored area of the house. Both equally likely to lead to an exit. Your choice.</span></div></div>",

It slowly comes to the point that you raise an arm to swat at them, and the weight of hard bodies on it partially weighs it down, inhibiting you.

The one on your right foot has more aimed, quick scratches that would often tickle under and between your toes. Occasional they would reach up legs of your loose trousers to tickle you between behind your knees. Meanwhile the third was going mad on your torso.

He even went as far as to blow a big raspberry directly onto your navel, which knocks your laughter up a few octaves.

It may seem stupid coming back here, but at least you know what's here. The other way might be way worse. Might be better, but it's not worth the risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear someone approaching from behind you. Two people, maybe the same ones from the dressing room. Not wanting to get caught, you quickly dive off the tiled path behind some bushes and trees. You stand up and peak between the leaves at the men passing by, being careful to breathe quietly. The two men turn and you hear a door shut, leaving you alone once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you can emerge you feel something cover your mouth, and suddenly you get jerked back. You struggle with your makeshift gag as you realize the vines are back. Cursing mentally for forgetting about them, you try to run out of the bushes. The vine gagging you still has a grip though, and pulls you back hard. Falling onto a whole bed of vines, you try to get up immediately. The vines don't allow it, and quickly seize your wrists and ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slithering sound returns as vines approach from every angle. Since they've already sampled your ticklishness they can't wait to get more, and they know all your most ticklish spots. You are holding your breath with antication and fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vine touches your side, causing you to jerk. It continues its journey up your side, then across your belly, as you giggle helplessly. Another vine at your knee causes you to jerk, then travels up your leg. Another climbs your ankle and approaches your toes, another slithers up to your elbow then down your arm. The vines keep coming until you are nearly covered in greenery. And then they start tickling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll your most ticklish areas are tickled at once. Vines carress your feet, drawing random patterns and designs on your arches and heels, sliding in-between your toes, even tickling the top of your feet. Further up, vines that have wrapped around your knees squeeze and knead them. Some vines slide feather-like tips across your thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's just your legs. There are several vines tickling your underarms, drawing lazy circles with their tips. Vines knead all of your ribs and their maddeningly soft touches are all over your belly. However they know from previous experience that your belly button is your sweet spot, and accordingly are tickling it relentlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour giggles turned to guffaws, or at least would've had the vines not gagged you. You struggle to get away, but in the end it's a pointless struggle. You sway your body left and right, you buck your hips, you even try shaking the vines loose. It all amounts to nothing, as if the vines are stuck to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to escape the torturous tickles or even vent your reactions, you try to escape somewhere into your mind. It doesn't work though, as the constant and intense sensations coursing through your body keep breaking down the mental barriers you try to put up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA door opens on the far side of the room and you hear a pair of voices coming down the path. The debate with yourself takes place immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could vent all your remaining energy into making a sound hopefully loud enough to get their attention, but doing so would leave you helpless and at their mercy. And once they had you, who knew what they would do to you; probably something even worse than this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand you could try to endure these vines until they let you go - if they let you go - and then resume your quest for an exit. But there is always the chance you would pass out before the vines stopped - and that is if they stopped at all. You're off the path, so no one will simply stumble across you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour choice. Do you make a noise and risk whatever punishment they have for you? Or do you try to outlast the vines?</span></div></div>",

You dangle limply as the vines continue to assault your body, the last shreds of your pants being moved out of the way leaving you completely vulnerable in a pair of boxers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with your compliance the vines stop tickling and start to move you, passing you along, out the room and deeper into the green house. You can soon hear laughter and through blurry eyes you make out at least 6 people hanging from vines. A mix of men and women, stripped to their underwear and all being tickled mercilessly by the same vines that hold of you. One guy looks particularly exhausted, his skin is slightly red from all the tickling and he can barely twitch he\u2019s that tired. However, upon seeing you his eyes light up! The vines stop tickling him and gently lower him to the ground. He passes out instantly but that\u2019s not what worries you. What worries you is how the vines start pulling you up to were he just was. You\u2019re his replacement... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, your ordeal doesn\u2019t start just yet. A vine with a flower on the end comes up and forces its way into your mouth. Your panicked struggling stops when you taste sweet nectar flowing from it, soothing your horse throat and refreshing you. Unfortunately, as well as providing hydration and nutrients, the nectar has another effect. Your whole body starts to warm up and tingle. Your hairs stand on end and you become a lot more aware of the light breeze. The flower retreats and a single stroke of a vine along your sole causes you to yelp and jerk violently. Seems the nectar has made your skin hypersensitive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe break is over and now the vines get to work. Suspended as you are, nowhere is safe! Tips of vines dance along your feet, smaller feelers worming between your toes. Leafs on vines stroke behind your knees as well as up and down your thighs. You try to squeeze your legs shut but sadly the vines restraining you are much stronger.  Some flowered vines use their petals to tickle your stomach and sides. The stomas of the centre one are also able to dip in and tickle your navel. More<br>\r\nvines dance alone your ribs, flick your nipples and play with your arm hair. It is hell. You\u2019re struggles are in vain and leave you a sweaty, dribbling mess. In fact the sweat even allows slicker movement of the vines across your skin. There is nothing you can do but add your manic laughter to the collective laughter of the other captives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery now and again you get a break to rest and to be fed the nectar to sustain you. During one break you notice the guy you replaced wake up. Fearing recapture he drags his aching body away as fast as he can and the vines leave him to it. They\u2019ve got you now after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also have a lot of time to think when not having your thoughts obliterated by tickling. Above you are giant leaves and so you theorise that the plants may be after the CO2 from your breath. You once read that people talk to plants believing that their breath helps them grow better. Perhaps this is why they\u2019re tickling you and making you laugh? It doesn\u2019t help with escaping but it helps keep you sane. The vines can tickle you in so manny different ways there\u2019s no adapting. It\u2019s taking everything you\u2019ve got not to lose your mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you can do is wait until it\u2019s your turn to be released or rescued. There\u2019s still 5 people ahead of you though so you really hope it\u2019s the rescue option. Otherwise you\u2019re gonna be here for a very long time...</span></div></div>",

Yelling at some length, until it devolved into a kind of gibberish mumble that was all that remained to stand between you and despair, your mantra against insanity. Exactly how long you remained incoherent, on the verge of mercifully passing out but for some reason never quite being able to do it, there was no way of telling. Eventually though, something broke through the daze, in which all thought and sensation had been subsumed and superseded by the relentless tickling, something changed. You weren't conscious in the common application of the word to appreciate it, but the vines, King, Queen, and all their entourage,  left off their tickling and gently set you down back on the bed. Someone -several someones- came in and looked over you, talking amongst themselves before dragging you out. Exhausted out of your mind, sweating and tingling all over, you had fallen asleep too quickly to take any notice.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And now you awake, still missing your shirt and footwear, but feeling alert, clean, and wonderfully refreshed. As you alertly sit up, you notice that the comfortable surface you had been left to lie on is a short padded couch, off to one side of a brightly lit, if small,  oblong living room. A door sits promisingly to your left, while to the right the well furnished area gives way to a plainer kitchenette and table, the transition between the two marked by yet another hard wood door, and which in turn opens out onto a large deck via open sliding glass doors. A cool sea breeze blows in, and you stand up fully, wondering what had happened and where you are now.      </span></div></div>",

You feel it would be a wise idea not to lose it , plus looking at the girl in front of you cant resist the chance to tickle her again. You look at her , she has her head down and long blonde hair covers most of her face,<br>\r\nbut can see that she is breathing heavily, getting her breath back from your previous instalment. You gently grasp her left ankle , she makes an attempt to escape from her bounds, trying to sit up , she struggles for a few seconds before giving up and returning to her original position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tighten your grip around her ankle to remind her that you are here and her toes wiggle inside her sock.  You clasp your hand around her foot and start to rub circles on the ball of her foot , the material of her sock moving with you thumb. This does not tickle her much but you continue to do it for a couple of minutes. \u201cHey you , please don\u2019t tickle my feet, if you let me go I wont tell Turtelli, please please\u2026.\u201d She whispers but sensing no chance in your motive she places her head back on the pillow of the chair and lets out a small whimper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou caress her socked foot slowly following its contours before moving your hand to the tip of her sock. You grasp her toes within the sock and notice she lets out a small giggle before gently tugging on the tip of her sock. It gives quite easily and you feel the sock being pulling away from her ankle. Samm lets out a small scream and attempts to sit up in the chair as she realises what your doing \u201c No!, please don\u2019t do that please don\u2019t take off my sock please Please!\u201d You stop and grin at her \u201cThank you\u201d she whispers thinking you have decided against it. You slide your finger down her sole again before grasping her ankle once more. This time however you grasp her sock and begin to slowly roll it off her foot. \u201cNo please please Noooo\u201d she screams as she sees what you are doing \u201cPlease stop please I wont tell Turtelli if you stop please don\u2019t pleassssee\u201d You feel her foot clench trying to prevent what is reality, She desperately struggles with her bonds  sitting up in the hair trying to force them off but to no such avail. Her foot is moving from side to side attempting to escape what you are doing. You smile at this and simply place you other hand on her foot preventing her futile plan from getting in the way of your goal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slams her head back on the pillow of the chair \u201c No No No No\u201d she whimpers as she feels the sock that once covered her foot being slowly removed. You roll the sock of until her heel is completely exposed, You smile and run a finger down it , it is soft and slighty warm. The skin is pale and there are no signs of calluses on her heel. Your fingers move around her ankle and u tickle the newly exposed skin and move up the back of her leg. She lets out a small \u201cHahaha\u201d whilst you do this but it is not long before your fingers take hold of the sock again and begin to roll it off her foot , Samm whispering \u201cplease , please no nooo no , please stop\u201d  whilst desperately struggling with her bonds to attempt an escape or at least prevent you from accomplishing your task, As the sock is slowly removed you reveal her pale arches of her foot and by god their big.. You cant help but slide your fingers up and down her sole , your fingers sinking into the pale flesh. She screams as you do this \u201chahhahaha please stop please ill do anything please no please hahahah\u201d You grin and continue the torture as you find it highly satisfying, You change and begin to stroke the right side of her foot moving your fingers up and down her the arch occasionally scrambling your fingers instead. You repeat this on the other side of her foot , You are enjoying this, Samm lets out more screams of laughter , you wonder how she is able to still able to do so she\u2019s being laughting that hard. Her toes wiggling frantically in the remaining part of her covered foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slide your hand across the top of her foot in a stroking action , Samm stops laughing and you can see from her face that she is enjoying this, You stop and take a mental note of this before your fingers turn to wiggling and dance down the top of her foot before light grasping the sock and continuing to roll it off her foot  You stop as her ball of her foot is exposed you gaze at it for a second before holding her foot with one hand and scrambling your fingers across the newly exposed area. Samm screams and again begs you to stop but you just give her the same familiar grin you gave her before and look away from her gaze. You grasp her wiggling toes and with a quick tug you pluck the sock clean off her foot. You stare at her size 14 foot the skin is pale and looks as if it has been taken care of. Your finger reaches out to touch her sole but you stop yourself. Samm looks up slightly to see what is happening as the tickling has temporarily stopped . You grasp her foot in your hand plunging your thumb into the soft flesh and look at her toes that had been wiggling ever so much whilst in her sock. They are long  but not to thin you stroke the tops of them with your other hand, before sliding a finger between each toe  from the soles direction, Samm whimpers  , you are still holding her foot firmly with your other hand every so often letting your thumb draw circles on her soft sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the door opening and Turtelli walks back in, \u201cArr I see you are having fun , you would make an excellent apprentice , Here I have brought you some food and a drink, You must be hungry\u201d Samm looks at him with whimpering eyes but he just looks away.. \u201c I see you have not finished the punishment\u201d nodding towards your hand positions and her other foot still holding the sock . Samms toes wriggle amongst your fingers and you look at her. \u201cHmm\u201d Says Turtelii as he bends down and picks up the sock that was once on her foot.\u201d I\u2019ll keep this\u201d he states and puts it in his pocket \u201c I can see your enjoying yourself so ill leave you two a while longer\u201d and with that he once more walks out of the door and closes it quietly behind him. You turn your gaze to Samm who looks at you whimpering \u201c Please don\u2019t tickle me, please we can escape together please, I just want to go home\u2026.\u201d What do you do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You laugh in unison, \"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH\" She manages enough of her voice to talk to you, \"GIHIHIHIHVE UHUHUHUHUHUHP ALREHEHEHEHADYYY\" You shout back, \"YOUHOHOHO FIRHIRIRST\" The tickling becomes intense.

You tickle her harder, indicating that she has no other choice, and she finally nods her head in agreement. You pretend to fall backwards, and the girl falls on top of you and grabs your legs. She tickles between your toes and all over the arches of your foot, and after a few minutes, you finally announce your surrender. \"I GIHIHIHIHVE UHUHUUP\" you yell, although you're pretty sure you could've taken more than that. The girl stops tickling, and you manage to wink at her just before Samm and Don Turtelli enter through a large set of double doors. You point your fingers in an, \"X\" and by some miracle the girl understands that the two of you must tickle Samm and Don. Don smugly raises his hands in amusement, \"Bravo, Bravo kids!\" At this point, the girl pounces on him, tickling his raised arms before he could even think about it. Caught by surprise, Samm gets a head start on you before you can attack, and she sticks her sharp fingernail into your navel. \"OHOHOHO CRAHAHAHAP\" you laugh. You don't want to let the girl that you befriended down, so you muster enough strength to flip on top of Samm, and start squeezing her sides. \"STAHAHAP YOHOHOU LIHIHITTLE RAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHSCAL\" You find a little weak spot on her ribs, and you begin to scribble your nail into that spot. She squeals and cackles loudly, tears streaming down her face. \"NOHOHOHOH PLEHEHEHEHAHAHASEE NOHOHOHOT THEHEHEHEHRE ANYWHERE BUT THEHEHEHEHRE\" she begs. In your tickling trance, you realize that you never noticed the girl sprinting towards the open doors of the arena. She calls you over, but you notice Don Turtelli slowly recovering and moving over ready to grab you. In your moment of forgetfulness, Samm grabs your sides and squeezes them with her hands, while simultaneously sticking her finger deep into your navel. Your eyes go wide, and Samm flips on top of your her hyper fast fingers gliding across your stomach, raspberries being blown into your navel. It feels as if she is tickling every inch of your belly. \"AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA I'M SOHOHOHOHORRY JUHUHUHUST LET ME GOHOHOHOHOHO\" you plead. Samm only increases the tickling, as Don pulls out an electric toothbrush, gliding it across the bottom of your belly to your hips. He even uses his other hand to tickle your feet and toes. \"WOAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA OH MY GOHOHOHOHOHOHOD\" The experience is unlike any tickling you've ever experienced. You buck and try to shake them off, but in their enraged state, they don't seem prepared to budge. The girl sighs and sprints over to you, she rips two electric toothbrushes from Samm and Don Turtelli's back pockets, and proceeds to tickle their feet. The two howl and jump up. You manage to slide away, bolting for the doors with your new ally. As you race through the halls of the mansion, you reach an dead end with the only option to choose doors to your left or right. The girl looks extremely distraught, turning from door to door. She turns to you, \"Look- I'm really bad at making decisions, especially in a place with as many tickling twists and turns as this one- you decide for us.\" she says. You scratch your head, as Samm and Don race up not too far behind you. \"I'm gonna tickle the hell out of you twerps!\" Samm shouts.

Then, two arms scribble, squeeze, and scratch all over your ribs, sending you into loud high pitched laughter. \"HAHAHAHAHAHAHA\" Another two arms shoot out towards your armpits, scratching them and dancing all over each rib in a way that makes you go almost mad. \"TURN IT OHOHOHOHOFFF THIS IS TORTUURHURHURHURE\" you cry out. Another arm shoots out at your neck, tickling lightly but effectively. Seeming to never end, two more hands fly towards your hips, squeezing them. Soon both arms find a small weak area on your hips, and begin squeezing that area intensely. \"OH NOHOHOHOHO NOT THEHEHEHRE NAHAHAHAHAHAHA WAIHAHAHAHAHIT\"  Two more hands fly towards your sides, squeezing them, and running rapidly up and down them. You begin bucking and trying to shake the belt off, but it holds on tightly. \"OH MY GOHOHOHOHOD.

This finger has many little fingers attached to it, which stroke and poke at the inner walls of your navel. You shut your eyes  tightly.

Everything goes, but don't inflict any physical pain! Whoever gives up first loses. You may begin!\" A buzzer sounds, and suddenly the girl leaps on top of you. \"Sorry.\" she says, revealing a sexy British accent, \"But I am way too ticklish\" The girl begins tickling all over your armpits. \"HAHAHAHAHAHAH STOP STAHAHAHAP\" You manage to escape her grip and hold her hands above her head, and with your other hand, you begin poking her all over her belly. \"HAHAHAHA NO FAHAHAHAIR\" She shouts.

You laugh in unison, \"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH\" She manages enough of her voice to talk to you, \"GIHIHIHIHVE UHUHUHUHUHUHP ALREHEHEHEHADYYY\" You shout back, \"YOUHOHOHO FIRHIRIRST\" The tickling becomes intense. You tickle her all over her stomach, then her hips. She also goes to your hips, then your knees, but you stop that by sticking your finger in her navel. \"HAAHAHHAHAHAHAHA\" she cries.

You tickle her harder, indicating that she has no other choice, and she finally nods her head in agreement. You pretend to fall backwards, and the girl falls on top of you and grabs your legs. She tickles between your toes and all over the arches of your foot, and after a few minutes, you finally announce your surrender. \"I GIHIHIHIHVE UHUHUUP\" you yell, although you're pretty sure you could've taken more than that. The girl stops tickling, and you manage to wink at her just before Samm and Don Turtelli enter through a large set of double doors. You point your fingers in an, \"X\" and by some miracle the girl understands that the two of you must tickle Samm and Don. Don smugly raises his hands in amusement, \"Bravo, Bravo kids!\" At this point, the girl pounces on him, tickling his raised arms before he could even think about it. Caught by surprise, Samm gets a head start on you before you can attack, and she sticks her sharp fingernail into your navel. \"OHOHOHO CRAHAHAHAP\" you laugh. You don't want to let the girl that you befriended down, so you muster enough strength to flip on top of Samm, and start squeezing her sides. \"STAHAHAP YOHOHOU LIHIHITTLE RAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHSCAL\" You find a little weak spot on her ribs, and you begin to scribble your nail into that spot. She squeals and cackles loudly, tears streaming down her face. \"NOHOHOHOH PLEHEHEHEHAHAHASEE NOHOHOHOT THEHEHEHEHRE ANYWHERE BUT THEHEHEHEHRE\" she begs. In your tickling trance, you realize that you never noticed the girl sprinting towards the open doors of the arena. She calls you over, but you notice Don Turtelli slowly recovering and moving over ready to grab you. In your moment of forgetfulness, Samm grabs your sides and squeezes them with her hands, while simultaneously sticking her finger deep into your navel. Your eyes go wide, and Samm flips on top of your her hyper fast fingers gliding across your stomach, raspberries being blown into your navel. It feels as if she is tickling every inch of your belly. \"AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA I'M SOHOHOHOHORRY JUHUHUHUST LET ME GOHOHOHOHOHO\" you plead. Samm only increases the tickling, as Don pulls out an electric toothbrush, gliding it across the bottom of your belly to your hips. He even uses his other hand to tickle your feet and toes. \"WOAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA OH MY GOHOHOHOHOHOHOD\" The experience is unlike any tickling you've ever experienced. You buck and try to shake them off, but in their enraged state, they don't seem prepared to budge. The girl sighs and sprints over to you, she rips two electric toothbrushes from Samm and Don Turtelli's back pockets, and proceeds to tickle their feet. The two howl and jump up. You manage to slide away, bolting for the doors with your new ally. As you race through the halls of the mansion, you reach an dead end with the only option to choose doors to your left or right. The girl looks extremely distraught, turning from door to door. She turns to you, \"Look- I'm really bad at making decisions, especially in a place with as many tickling twists and turns as this one- you decide for us.\" she says. You scratch your head, as Samm and Don race up not too far behind you. \"I'm gonna tickle the hell out of you twerps!\" Samm shouts.

You have to get out of there, though at the moment you appear to be a little... preoccupied. \"HAHAHAHAHA WHA-WHAHAHAHAT DID IHAHAHAHA DOHAHAHAHAHAHA!?!\" you try to ask, but you wonder if Samm even understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she did, because she relented just enough so you could understand her when she leaned down next to your ear and whispered \"I don't know, to be honest. But I don't care, because now that you're here I'm never going to let you leave this mansion. On top of what the Don has prepared for you, you're going to be my little plaything whenever you get a break. Get used to it.\" With that she laughed, and tripled the intensity of her tickling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you break into peals of silent laughter, you can't help but be angry at the unfairness of it all. Without explanation you are thrown into this mansion, get tickled to death by some spiders in some goo, and now are subjugated to even more tickle torment for no better reason than because your captors wanted this. If there was any chance of escape - ANY chance, you would jump at the opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Samm began to really dig her fingers into your underarms, and coherent thought becomes impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you are on the verge of passing out, Samm stops entirely. She stands up and watches you pant, trying to get air back into your lungs. When you look up at her, she grins and says \"can't have you wear out too early. I'll be back soon, so don't worry. Ta-ta!\" And with that and a flick of her yellow and black tail she leaves the room, closing the deadbolt behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would be a perfect opportunity to try to escape, you decide. No one else in the room means that if you get free you'll have the jump on whoever next comes in. However, even if you escape there's no guarantee that you won't just end up in a trap or another tickling room like the one with the goo. Anyway you're exhausted, and you won't be able to take on anyone in your current state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dozens of vines reach for your upper body, most of them ending in feathery tips. The slithering sounds become even louder as the large green mass approaches inch by inch towards your defenseless form. You try to struggle but the plant is so strong you may as well be paralyzed. The vines come forward and rests on all your most ticklish spots on your upper body. You giggle and tense, waiting for when the torment begins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't wait long. One at a time the vines come to life; gently stroking your belly, sliding up and down your underarms, moving along each rib, lightly itch your sides with the feather tips. At first it only causes you to giggle, but as more and more vines begin to move the more harsh the giggles became. Soon you were giggling uncontrollably, but the plant didn't stop there. Slowly but surely the tickling became more intense; stroking became tracing, sliding became light digging. As the intensity increased, so did your pitch. By now you were laughing like a maniac, occasionally breaking into silent fits and peals of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the plant didn't stop there. As if tickling your upper body wasn't enough, the rest of the vines descended on your legs and feet. The tickling extended down to your hips, thighs, knees, and of course your feet, which were tormented in countless ways. Your eyes, already wet, were now spouting tears like waterfalls. Your laughter grew hoarse and your shut eyes squeezed tighter as you tried to escape from the torture, but all your brain could make sense of was the endless tickling that covered your entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost lost in the sensations, he now noticed a new one. It felt like some of the vines were smearing a thick and sticky liquid to most of his body. With all the other tickling sensations this one only added to the torture, but you fail to acknowledge it as anything more than a new tickle technique. Boy do you have a surprise coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you are about to pass out, the tickling eases up a little but doesn't stop. You're at the end of you rope, but the plant let's up just enough to keep you awake. It takes a long time - especially since the tickling didn't stop - but you eventually regain a little bit of strength. Your laughter can actually be heard now, and your eyes aren't as scrunched up any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever instead of increasing the tickling back to an unbearable amount like you expected, the tickling gradually stopped. It took over fifteen minutes and you kept laughing for a good extra minute since they stopped, but it eventually stopped. You contemplated the idea that the plant may have mercy, but you were still suspended in the air. Not having the faintest clue, you begin to worry. Had someone from the mansion heard you? Surely they must have. Or were you lucky enough that they hadn't heard and you still had a bit of time before someone spotted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll these thoughts are flying through your head so quickly that you don't at first notice when something feels wrong. You don't know exactly why, and it takes a while for you to find the source of your discomfort. There is a new sound in the forest, a constant buzzing that is slowly but gradually growing louder. You try to turn in the direction of the noise but find that you are still paralyzed, and so just turn your eyes instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you see is an enormous swarm of bugs. The bugs don't look like anything anyone's ever encountered before, and they come in varying shapes and sizes. Frowning, you wonder why they are heading towards you. Then it hits you and you realize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sticky stuff before that the vines smeared on your body must be attracting them somehow. Your body was so numb from the tickling that you didn't feel it too well, and you'd completely forgotten about it. Then your spirits crash. The only thing that could motivate such a large amount of insects to go to a certain place so quickly is food, and lots of it. Since the only thing different about you is the liquid, you assume that is the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the vines slathered your entire body in it.</span></div></div>",

You give up entirely, just waiting for the inevitable torture staring at you in the face. Your heart pounds like a drum, your mind is everywhere and nowhere all at once. The swarm is fast approaching...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now it's here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately break out laughing. With all the different shapes and sizes, the bugs remind you of those in the goo pool you saw earlier. The little bugs start their work, sliding in and out of your belly button and nibbling at the walls of it. More bugs snacking away into your underarms, while others eat what's on your feet and in-between your toes. The torment is intensified again because you are completely unable to move and thus do anything to alleviate the torture, only seconds after starting you once again break into fits of silent laughter and feel your tears run like streams from your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tickling is too unbearable, yet you do not fade or pass out. There is no escape from the tickling, and the longer you're tickled the more resigned you become. The hours stretch on, the sun sets, the moon rises, and the bugs still show no sign of even getting close to being finished soon. You cannot think about anything but at incessant tickling that stops you from even trying to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the night dimmed and the sun rose again, and you spent the entire night laughing like a maniac. You're becoming fatigued, but the tickling doesn't let you sleep. Fortunately the swarm seems to have thinned, but the remaining bugs show no sign of halting or even letting up. If anything the remainders intensified the torture you truly believed impossible. Your voice is hoarse, you are weak, and the tickling shows no sign of slowing.</span></div></div>",

Only the smaller, more persistent ones are relentless, and you continue to produce unending laughter from your aching lungs. Your throat is sore too, and you ache all over from your constant, futile attempts at freedom. \"Down fellas, down.\" Somebody shouts bellow you, and you open bleary, partially bloodshot eyes to see who it is. A huge tigress wiht an enormous mane of flaming red hair, holding an incense burner, is standing under you. The bugs reluctantly shoe away from the thick smell, and you start catching your breath. Your strength and sanity will need to be recaptured later. For reasons unknown, the vines relax, and you desperately tear your way free to land at the towering cat's huge foot-paws. \"Th-Thanks,\" You pant, rising in to a push-up position as you struggle to get up. Instead, she reaches down and easily hoists you up with one paw. \"Well, well, well. What have we here? Another Mansion escapee?\" You start to knod, but then her voice hardens. \"Or a spy?\" You frantically shake your head 'no', conscious of the massive piower in the single hand on your neck. \"That prisoner is mine. Give him up, and we may let you go without some punitive measures. Well, none too severe...\" The tigress drops you on  the ground behind her, hand going to something in the belt holding up her loincloth. Across the clearing, Samm casually leans against a tree, nearly a dozen armed anthro cronies fanning out behind her. She points something- it looks threateningly like a gun-at the both of you. \"Come now hand him over. And, well we're here... Drop whatever weapons you might be carrying and walk over to that tree over there.\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Now now, be reasonable... \" Weedles the huge anthro standing over you, making no sudden or threating moves. One of her big arms makes expansive placating gestures, while the other still works its' way deep into her belt pouch.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Of course I'll give you this human-he is Mansion property after all. Its just how I'm gonna do it-Over my dead body!\" She roars, leaping and rolling sideways with amazing agility, while reflexively Samm pulls the trigger on her gun and a ball of crackling yellow energy blasts out. It narrowly misses you, hitting a tree, though oddly there's no evidence of anything having struck it. The tigress finishes her manuevre at the closest unlucky furry, a bobcat, and swings her around with one hand, wrenching her in front by yanking on her gun arm. She clamps down on her victim's smaller paw, and the gun fires a bolt of it's own. Another anthro was charging directly at them, and is hit head on by the missile. She falls to the ground, looking like she's having a seizure. You then notice her face contortted with silent laughter, already tearing up while she shakes on the ground, clutching at her body. You begin to understand what the guns do. A rope net flies overhead, followed by several darts, and you see another goup of anthros-a leapord, a lioness, and a panther- charging in from the brush on the other side of the open space. All are wearing the simple cloth tube- tops and loincloths as the tigress, decorated with numerous beads and small talismans. The leapord spins behind a tree, fitting another net-bolt into her crossbow. As the panther leaped upon another of Samm's affliated anthros, already woozy from a lightly poisoned dart, and the lioness is dropped by some more fire, you come to your senses and scramble for a discarded gun. A body falls past you- the vixen attacked by the tigress, who's now dodging more enemy fire while returning it with what looks like a pistol-sized crossbow with a lot of gears and levers built in. The fox pulls out a smaller pistol from her tight security guard suit, aiming at at the back of the panther gaining the upper hand of her own engagement. You tackle her just in time, and wrest away the gun. She snatches at it, but you fire point blank. She bursts out laughing, shaking form side-to-side, and you decide she's incapicated. \"Fall back!\" Yells Samm, firing frantically at the elusive tigress and backing away. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One of her opponent's missiles, strikes the wolf next to her. It bursts open in a mass of green tendrils, several thick ones tightening around her abdomen while the others start trying to digg in. They seem too weak to do more than prod the lupine, but the frenetic poking and dragging had a strong affect as the unlucky wolf stumnles away into the forest, laughing uproarisly and almost loosing her gun while attempting to get the seedling off her belly. Samm fired off a few more shots, turns and dashes away, the other anthros in security guard suits not engaged or downed sprinting after. T<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0he tigress holstered her hand-held cross bow, strode over and started draging the zebra entangled in the heavy net towards the center of the clearing. Still giggling-a bizarre sight, given her wild appearence- the lioness reagined her feet, noddding at the panther, who was dragging a half-conscious hare. She growled at the Mansion guard struck early in the skuffle, and the furry bolted for the safety of the trees. \"Well, two captured and the rest routed. Another victory.\" Remarked the tigress, staring in the direction Samm had taken. \"And one prisoner receovered, Alkaiah.\"  Pointed out the panther. \"Right, Pyrogomache !\" You are pulled forward. 'Did you escape the Mansion, boy. Speak fast, we have reason to be warry of spies, and don't take kindly to them.\" You rapidly summarise waking in the mansion, freeing yourself, being caught and tortured, escaping again-only to be aprehended by the fauna itself and tickled to the brink of insanity, and then meeting this group. The leapord nodds as you finish your tale. \"I think he's telling the truth. I have met this Turtelli. He's is completely merciless, and is, to my regret, skilled. I can only hope I shall meet him so again...\" She unconsciously fingers her huge net-gun like crossbow. \"Sisters, let's take him back to base. I still think this one might be a spy; there are very few with thte good fortune to mak ei ut of the Mansion. Ever.\" Declares the last of the group, the lioness. \"I still don't trust him.\" \"Agreed.\" Alkaiah reaches into her belt and oulls out a stripof febric, which she winds around your head at eye level. \"You only need to wear this until we return to base. You may call us 'the Resistance', we help people who escape the Mansion, and occaisionally launch raids to rescue prisoners. Now, follow us.\"  </span></div></div>",

Agumon's breath quickens and his eyes are full of fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach your other hand over and brush it along the sole. Agumon flinches a bit and grits his teeth. His foot is warm and incredibly soft, although a little muscular. You curl your fingers down along the sweet arch and he nearly screams.

You swirl your new claws across his ball and down the far side to his heel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nononono!!\" Agumon's voice catches in his throat.

She gently glided her pointing finger up his sole, from his heel, to the middle of his ball. She laid her palm flat on his sole and rub his foot, Armadillomon chuckled while still gagged. She tickled the area below his ball with her nails, as she progressed she used more force and tickled faster. Through the gag cloth you could tell he was laughing louder and he even started tearing. Renamon put two finger between Armadillomon toes and tickled between the toes. You could hear Armadillomon faintly saying,\"Please stop!\", while laughing. She started tickling his belly and sides, up to his armpits. After that, she was done. Renamon still let Armadillomon stay on her leg for a little while to get his breathe. She rubbed his belly and said softly, \"Aww, you look so cute.\"<br>\r\n When Armadillomon got most of his breathe back. Renamon rested him on the floor and walk over to you.

With both hands free to work, you start scratching away really hard now, pressing in deeper. \"Wahaiahait! Sthohohhohohop!  Pleheeheas!\" You ignore his frantic begging, instead discovering a sweet-spot where his arch joins his heel, and press hard into it with your thumb, holding in place with your other fingers.

He steps out into the glowing water and starts looking around. His right arm grabs a gun and starts tracking a fish. His arms follows carefully; he does not blink. He sends out a single bullet and is obviously pleased with the shot. He continues popping fish and pulling them out of the water with his other hand. When he starts walking back, you blow vigorously on the smoldering fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I see something coming there.\" He throws a handful of fish on the fire (and a handful for him is a lot.)

You decide to start on the arch, however, which is facing away from you. You brace the heel with your left hand and gently rake your claws across the arch and to the toes. Glenn lets out a sickeningly cute giggle and his toes wiggle slightly. You  jump your right hand to the toe closest to you and start doodling on the pad. Glenn jumps at the touch and keeps giggling. You keep tickling lighter and gentler, but he keeps laughing. Only a single finger slides around the pad and Glenn's laugh reduces to a whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really wern't kidding, were you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hmm mmm\" is all Glenn can muster without cracking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, you lay into his sole.

You know what you're doing!\" The Gargomon peeks over one of his ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a bit,\" you tease, and run your palms from the center to the ends. \"Go on, relax.\" He whimpers, but eventually his bunny foot relaxes. You slowly reach below the toes, but he curls them up. \"Come on, let me in there...\" You coax the toes open, but the anticipation is killing him. You cup a hand over his middle toe and reach for the meat right below his toe. Glen yips and tries to curl his toe up, but your right hand keeps it out so that your left hand can play on the flesh. His toe overpowers your hand and catches your left hand in the fold. You dart your right hand to his other foot and tickle it all over. You continue to tickle both his feet gently and teasingly until Glenn laughs himself to sleep. After caressing the lovely paw for a short time more, consciousness slips from your grasp. You nuzzle in between him and the overhang and are cuddling his paw by the time you fall asleep.</span></div></div>",

Several Oxi perk up and crowd around you to get a better look. Chattering happily, about ten Oxi plop down in front of you and pile their feet on your leg. Just as you guessed, this is a regular greeting for them. Unfortunately, the weight of all those feet is hurting your leg. So, you unsheath the knife, which glows menacingly in the firelight. They yip and shout and jump away from the knife with several of the smaller ones cowering behind the larger ones. Several more come over to look at the commotion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make them understand, you slice one of your own feet off. Several shriek at the sight, but settle down once they see that you are still smiling. You place your foot a ways out in front of you, but none of them will approach it. You take your other foot off, place it next the the first, and crawl back a short ways. Finally, a small Oxy reaches towards your feet. He picks one up tentatively and examines it. Curiously, he scratches a tiny finger along your sole, which manages to tickle a bit. He smiles at your reaction and starts gently tickling. Your other foot is snatched up into the crowd, and the feet pile up on your lap without any  more hesitation. The knife slides through all twenty-something pairs, leaving you buried in a pile of wiggling oxy feet. You pick up a single foot and quickly tickle the far edge of it. Its rather obvious which one that foot belongs to: the rather large oxy who erupts into laughter. Many reach into the pile to snatch up random feet. The knife soon disappears as well, and several more feet end up in the pile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the time that you are tickling your way through the pile, you can feel your own two feet going through ridiculous amounts of tickling. Fingers skittle up your soles, doodle across your heels, and poke around between your toes. Now and then, a slippery tongue finds its way up your giggling foot. Its a blissful escape to not to have to keep from pulling your feet away. The happy fingers dance across your sensitive soles, and it feels wonderful. Meanwhile, your own fingers reach through the pile and under countless toes. The pile is taller than yourself, and it shakes with laughter. The camp is thick with laughter, and you even see Glenn's foot sailing across the crowd. You crawl your way to it and snatch it from the raving oxis. This time, you show no mercy. Your fingers dance all around the poor sole, which thrashes about with laughter as if to beg for mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tickles last long into the night, and it is not until whoever was holding your feet last had worn themselves out enough to give you a chance to rest. Even as you fall asleep, a single finger circles the ball of your foot ever so gently. </span></div></div>",

You can feel the tension in his toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pudgy, heaving belly catches your eye and you let him have a break so you can watch him breathe.

You waggle your finger in between his toes several times enticingly. Each time his mute laugh rings out gripingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear footsteps coming from outside. You dart your head around the room, looking for somewhere to hide. A large drawer catches your attention. You rush behind the drawer as a figure enters the room; Gargomon begins to squirm frenziedly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With a beaming expression on your face, you turn towards Gargomon, pointing a devilish smirk towards him as he grunts into the gag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, Gargomon, you really are roarin' to go! ,\" she says, turning with a large toolbox in hand before sitting down in front of Gargomon's now squirming paws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly follow suit, before inquiring: \"So, what's in the box?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heavy duty tickling apparatus,\" she responds, while flipping multiple locks open on the surface of the box, \"There's many elements regarding the intensity of the stimulation bring applied, as well as enhancing the sensitivity of such areas,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in to the toolbox, you notice that she really wasn't exaggerating with the term \"heavy duty\". Bulky, robotic-looking devices lined with rotating spinning brushes, thick, large gags, padded blindfolds, steel cords and rope, vials containing various clear liquids, and many other bizarrely unexplainable items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls out a clear vial of liquid, pops the cap off, and begins to smear and massage the clear liquid onto Gargomon's soles. Gargomon whimpers at first, but then seems to enjoy the relaxation provided my the masseuse-like grip of the catgirl, as she kneads her thumbs into his tense toes and soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is one of our highest concentration and strength oils we've developed in our labs here. It will increase the sensitivity of Gargomon's paws multiple times higher than before,\" she says, taking the time to demonstrate this effect by dragging her claws down Gargomon's now shiny and smooth soles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMMPPHUEHPHH!!\" Gargomon exclaims, in reaction to his increasingly soft to the touch paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What other sources of stimuli will we apply to his paws during the tickling...er... experiment?\", you say, attempting to mask the excitment in your voice with the most scientific masquerade you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm glad you asked!\", she says, evidently continuing to be fooled by your thinly veiled disguise, \"Here we have a device that will heat up that oil on his feet in order to further its effects,\". She pulls out a strange-looking metal block, as she tightly straps it to the stocks, covering Gargomon's now cowering and sheepish feet entirely, as he violently struggles to be let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now all we have to do is wait for these feet to heat up, and we should be able to begin!\" She says, flipping a switch on the side of the heater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, are you sure there aren't any other things we can use for the experiment?\", you interject, as Gargomon makes a muffled scoff into the gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look in here!\", you say, as you scuffle through the toolbox and pull out a blindfold, \"Wouldn't this blindfold help with the err... element of surprise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, yes, I think that's an excellent idea!\" she responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wow, that really worked? I wonder what other things I can convince her to use on Gargomon...\" you think to yourself.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 10 minutes later, you've exhausted her supply of tickling and restrainment tools. Gargomon has his ears plugged, blindfolded, and belly being oiled as well. As the heater grows hotter, Gargomon struggles, whines, and moans loudly. Evidently, the heater is well tenderizing his soft bunny paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I really appreciate your passion for accurate and precise experimentation! I can definitely see why you became a scientist...\" she says, blushing. \"Anyways!\" she interrupts, clearly flustered, \"I'm sure we can remove the heating apparatus now, given by Gargomon's reactions to it; we don't want to hurt him or damage any tissue,\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean down to flip the switch of the heater off as Gargomon's struggles begin to grow more ferocious, and his moans and groans increase greatly in volume. Upon removing the device from the stocks, you can see that his paws have shifted to a color of deep pink and red, clearly impacted by the effects of the heat. The thick coat of oil remains covering every crevice of his paws, causing them to gleam brightly in the light of the room, emphasizing the smooth arch and plumpness of his soles. As his toes press against their ties to the stocks, you slowly drag a claw down his shimmering and reddened soles, eliciting a sudden and surprising jerk and cloud of surpressed laughter from Gargomon, as he whines loudly into the gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it's finally time to administer the treatment,\" she says, as she pulls out a skeletal looking frame covered in rotating brushes. She snaps the framework to the outline of the stocks, as the two largest brushes press themselves deeply into the tender flesh of Gargomon's soles. The other smaller brushes cover the balls of his feet, the heels, the sides of the soles, as well as the toes. Some if the brushes are even wedged tightly in between the toes, covering every spot and vulnerability that Gargomon poses. As the frame is fitted into place, the plush and soft brushes just surfacing themselves against Gargomon's hypersensitive flesh elicits a strong reaction where Gargomon struggles and moans against the impending torture he knows he's about to face. Gargomon begins to drool out of the gag, seeming to fully acknowledge and accept his fate and he whimpers and whines into the shiny gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you do the honors?\" the catgirl suggests, gesturing towards a switch on the front of the device. Gargomon begins to shake his head and struggle more, awaiting his treatment with resurfacing opposition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You then see a gigantic anthro dragon with his ankles in a gigantic set of stocks, and his arms chained above him.  The walls are made of stone, and the gigantic dragon has his muzzle tied shut to prevent him from breathing fire.  You look in awe at him before looking down at his feet.  His feet are big, even proportionally to the dragon, and each toe is capped with a black claw.  Around each claw a metal ring is fit, with a strong rope leading to the stocks, essentially leaving the dragon's toes helpless.  As you look down the soles, you notice that otherwise, they are shaped similar to human feet, just gigantic and scaly.  At the bottom of the stocks under the dragon's heels are the letters saying \"Beldorf, Giant Dragon.  Sent to the Tickle Mansion for the offense of crushing several huts and a store-house with these feet.\"  As you look back up at the dragon, he wakes up and looks at you, his eyes adjusting to you.  You approach the soles at Gargomon suddenly notices a note.  \"Hey, here's a note!\" the digimon says, and he reads it.  \"It's from the ticklers,\" the digimon says, and then reads the note out loud.  \"This dragon happens to love being tickled.  His sentence was over a month ago and he still insists on staying.\"  Gargmon blinks.  \"This is one crazy dragon!\"  You look up at the dragon who smiles a bit, as much as the rope allows him to.  You look to your left and see a rope labeled \"Gag Removal\", which is attached to a series of pullies and gears which lead to the rope around the muzzle, a machine that will remove the gag.  You look to your right and you see a box full of innumerable tickle toys, including a feather of gigantic proportions, probably from some gigantic bird.  What now?</span></div></div>",

First Nala was breathless, but then she lets out a big laugh. You softly brush the area where her bely and chest meet, this causes her to start shaking and wriggling. She rolls on to her side and you sit on the floor facing her tummy. You then scratch her tummy with your feet-claws, Nala pounds the ground with her paw for the laughter has left her breathless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n When your done you crawl over to Nala's face, petting her muzzle while she regains her breathe while smiling. When she does she says,\"Okay, now my toesies and then we can leave.\" Nala give you a lick on the cheek, and then you crawl to her hind feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Nala's feet are so long and soft like a pillow, her foot is bigger than your head. You hug both the paws a nuzzle the right one with your cheek, Nala starts shaking and laughing again,\"Your whole body is just too feathery.\" she says. You prop the paw pads on your head, her brown pads are soft and smooth on your head, this make Nala laugh even harder. You just grab her left foot you grab and spread her two right toes then tickle the inside with your beak. This causes her other toes to spread as well, she goes breathless again while trying to say stop. You start to rub your beak on the pad of the ball of her foot, then start brushing and pawing you with her other foot, although your feathers just tickle her more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n When you stop she says while breathing hardly \"Please, that's enough.\" You were considering continuing, but when you see that her eyes are tearing you decide she has had enough. You go back to her face and rub the tears off her cheeks, I'm okay she says while trying to get her footing while standing up. She then sits down and massages her foot in front of you while snickering,\"Sorry,\" she says, \"I can still feel you tickle on my foot.\" That's okay you reply while watching her foot get massaged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After a while you and Nala walk to the door.

I figured you go for the belly or my underarms.\" She says aloud, anxiously nibbling on her lower lip a little. As if she can feel your presence getting closer to her sexy paws, her toes wiggle very slowly as if both enticing and begging you to reconsider at the same time.Watching her paw pads wrinkle and scrunch up as she curled those four toes, it was clear that this was the right choice. Her paws and your fingers were going to meet with one another and become intertwined in a sexy, ticklish dance. It was destiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah. I mean I told you that I have a paw fetish so this is my go to spot. It's the spot that turns me on the most you know~.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I bet you're hardcore into tickling too huh? Nothing makes you feel hotter than taking advantage of a girls paws like mine while I'm strapped down like this, helpless to make you stop.\" Nala says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo. You're good at this. Helpless, defenseless, restrained paws are so sexy to me. The laughter and reactions produced from touching them is unlike anything else in this world~.\" You reply back right as you reach out to stroke a finger along the bottom of her right paw. Nala lets out a cute whine. her tail suddenly going between her legs. It's obvious she's so nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...you can focus on another spot? I mean listen. I won't lie...my paws...are incredibly sensitive so I'm willing to bargain. Maybe I can offer you more sessions in the future?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With your paws? Absolutely. But no there's nothing you can offer me to make me change spots~. Your paws are all mine, Nala. I'm curious. How does that make you feel?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly? Nervous and even a little scared...never had anyone touch my paws like this. I'm used to being in control and being able to pull them away once I've had enough. But now...nothing.,,my paws are at your mercy with these restraints holding them in place for you.\" She replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know? I hear a lot of beautiful anthro girls say that...well not all of them but this seems to be a recurring theme....but it makes me feel excited to know I'm the first one to get your paws like this. Strapped down, sexy, wonderfully ticklish...\" You say back. Scooting closer to her, you press you begin readjusting the bondage on Nala's left leg. She takes this chance to pull away but you regain control. Wrapping some nearby ropes around her leg, you then wrap it around your own body, effectively tying her leg right against your abdomen and chest. The toes on her left paw react by flexing back as if they're scared of what's about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Why did you tie my leg against your body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do this sometimes. It lets me feel a deeper connection with my tickle victims. I like being as close as I possibly can to the sexy paws that I am about to enjoy and occasionally, I like to enjoy them one at a time.\" You explain. Nala's ears flatten down against her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never had my paws controlled like this before...I feel so scared and this is only one paw...you're an expert at this huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you could say that.\" You reply back. Nala's left paw flinches a little, the toes slowly leaning forward and flexing back once more. Her paw is now right near your chin and and all you have to do is look down a bit to get a perfect view. You reach out with your left hand, wrapping it around Nala's surprisingly thin ankle. Her whole body flinches in response. She totally mistook you for a fool, an amateur...someone who likely wouldn't even get a giggle out of her but now...she knew. She knew that she was likely dealing with a very skilled tickler. Someone who lovingly honed their craft with the use of many beautiful anthro girl paws and now it was her turn. She was about to laugh more than she had ever laughed in her entire existence. Words weren't needed any longer. Using the fingers on your right hand, you gently scratched at her paw sole and the reaction was instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KYAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHEHEHEHEHEHEHAHAHA!\" Nala burst into an intoxicating, pretty sounding laugh. You leaned your head close while still lightly scratching at her precious paw bottom and blew some of your warm breath against her exposed toe pads, causing her toes to spread before they curled up instinctively, Her front paws had curled up into fists and she occasionally clawed at the air and the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm.

YOU'RE TOO GOOD! IT'S TOTALLY CRAZY! MY PAWS ARE NEHEHEHEHEHEVER THIS SENSITIVE!\" Nala manages to say through her laugh, her toes very slowly uncurling, flexing all the way back and wiggling before flexing one more time.

She could do nothing to protect it now. This lovely paw had no choice but to accept your tickles, forcefully or otherwise. Nala was really terrified now. She had doomed herself to your lustful desires. Why did she even agree to do this while still strapped down by the bondage? How silly...but for you it was the ultimate boon. You looked down to her right paw which was still strapped down and secure. Turning your attention back to the left one, you could feel the warmth of her leg against your chest and she could surely feel your pounding heartbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking your fingernails, you traced from her left heel, all the way up her arch and back down again. The bondage had just enough give on her wrists to give her the illusion of freedom as she pounded her fists against the table. But she would never get free until you undid her bonds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PFFFFTKYAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! NOAHAHAHAHAHAHEHEHEHAHAHAHA!' Nala wailed with laughter, the four toes on her perfect paw leaning forward slightly before curling. They uncurled a few seconds later before three of her toes leaned forward while the fourth one flexed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a no? Did I just hear you tell me no? Oh my sweet, sexy Nala...I am not even close to finishing with this beautiful paw of yours. You're just gonna have to lay there and take it girl. Not that you have much choice in the matter.\" You say. In between her wild laughing, Nala's tail once again goes between her legs and her ears flatten down, indicating her pure and truthful fear. But you ignored it. In your mind it simply looked cute. What started out as a game for her quickly became a very real paw tickle session that showed no signs of slowing down or stopping. With a satisfied grin, you took your nails and stroked them along the sole of her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NYAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! PLEASE! PLEASE NO! IT TICKLES! AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\" Nala begged sweetly, one of her toes leaning forward while the other three remained in the relaxed position before all four of them suddenly curled, uncurled and flexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl, Nala. I'm glad it tickles. I'm thrilled to know that I'm the one doing this to your beautiful, helpless paw and there's nothing you can do to make it stop~.\" You say teasingly, still stroking up and down the sole of her left paw, taking in the sound of her goddess like laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KEEEEEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHAHAHAHAHAHA! JUST GO GET SOMEONE ELSE! HYAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! THERE'S AN ENTIRE MANSION OF ANTHRO GIRLS! KYAAAHAHAHA! I DON'T EVEN WANT REVENGE ANYMORE! WAAAHAHAHA!\" Nala cackles with uncontrollable laughter, the sole of her paw flexing, toes flexing as well before they blossom into a splay position, and helplessly wiggle before leaning forward.</span></div></div>",

You could tell by his accent and the way he is shaking he is one who scares easily and that he was cold due to the cold floor.<br>\r\n You state, \"Sorry, but I'm going back over there. If you want to get out of here too then you can join me.\"<br>\r\nTimidly he says, \"Okay, but first can we find my shoes, the floor is terribly cold,\" he wiggles his toes to try keeping warmth.</span></div></div>",

His hands clamped tigihtily to one edge as his rather large feet are gripped to the other.  The Pit itself seemed to go down deeper into the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of you looked stunned, a wild idea crosses your mind<br>\r\n\"Hey Yoshi, want to see something funny?

The strange part is that, below the windows for the entire length of the hall, is a long line of feet. Human feet, small furry paws, fleshy dragon feet, long bunny feet, and every other kind of foot sticks out from the walls at an upward angle without even a hint of movement. Yoshi steps ahead of you and looks straight over a set of familiar looking paws and into a window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at this,\" he mumbles under his breath while waving you over. It's bugs bunny! Apparently, he's reading a book while munching absentmindedly on a carrot. Nearby, sylvester is curled up on a bed. And you have their feet, right in front of you. Down in the room, their legs simply end at their ankles; it appears that more fur covers the cutoff as if they never had feet to begin with. The tazmanian devil and Daffy Duck are down there too, although you question the sense behind it based on the boring duck feet standing to your left. You lightly tickle Sylvester's paws, and he stirs in his sleep, chuckling to himself.</span></div></div>",

To say nothing of the culmative wooziness of your wild trip, combined with your rapidly changing surrounding and the bizarre feature/color schemes of the tunnels.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After what feels like it is indeed the several days that the inventor taunted you with earlier, the cart finally slides back our onto the cavernous testing floor, this time in a different corner than the first one.

Your fur is heavily ruffled and Yoshi's scales are faint red all over from the experience, but for the most part you aren't feeling raw with the tickling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As you stand around in the midst of the exotic mechanical paraphernalia, the blue skinned scientist lopes up to you.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And how do you two enjoy <i>that</i>? When you get back, you'll be able to tell the higher-ups we haven't had a cent pass through here that hasn't been well used.\" He says with some apparent pride, though you privately wonder at the value of two massive, tickle-themed rollercoasters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshi speaks up for the both of you. \"Thank-you for showing us your lab; it's quite impressive,  but...\"         </span></div></div>",

As more gas is pumped into the chamber, you can hear Yoshi whimper a bit. Suddenly, he lets it all hang out. His arms and legs thrash all over, as does his tongue, and his tears stream freely.

Her laughter increases several fold and she squirms like a worm on a hook even though the bonds ensure that she's not going anywhere.<br>\r\nYou're actually impressed with the hedgehog-girl - even though she looks like she was more fragile, she's actually a lot tougher than Rouge, who started begging right away and was wrecked by just one tickler. Amy's taking all three of you at once and she's hadrly begging, though her face is red and you're starting to worry if her little body can take all of this. However, if Amy's resilient, then Mina and Sally are skilled. You fancy yourself a pretty good tickler, but you're amazed by the reactions the other two are getting out of her. Clearly, they know her body and have already mapped all her secret spots, a fatal weakness in her plan that leaves her defenseless and quickly erodes her resistance.

Then you feel some rubbing on your feet, it feels very nice and you start to relax. Maybe it wasent what you thought it was. Then it starts you feel some sort of bristle brush start to scrub your feet, it tickles so much. You start to laugh, hard, you thought you would hate it, but for some reason it, dare I say it, feels good. You start to enjoy it but then it stops, you wonder why, but then you feel wetness on your feet. Then you feel more rubbing witch feels good. Then your chair starts to move back, you look at your feet and, they look surprisingly clean, you admire the handiwork they did on the nails. Your chair turns and you start to move forward again until you hit a certain spot, then you start to rise up higher and higher and higher, then you stop your restraints loosen, and you get up. You walk forward looking at yourself and then turning back you the chair, looking at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you like the chair?

A warm red light coasts in from the transparent portals, making you think of sunsets and tropical beaches. Idly, you pause to look out the first.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The window is set several stories up in the building; and the view is incredible. The sight is aided by the grassy, gently sloping terrain outside the window; the site is apparently situated on the apex of a long ridge, with the ground running slowly to a distant deciduous forest. The forest stretches out as far as you can see, becoming lost in open fields and other tracts of indistinguishable terrain; there is a noticeable lack of other artificial structures. While strangely disquieting, you don't draw much conscious attention to that particular detail.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Uphill, the terrain... Stops. In it's stead, the ground plunges down to an ocean, painted in various warm shades, ranging from dour crimson to festive gold, by the setting sun. Said star is in the process of ducking behind the horizon directly opposite the window, forcing you to squint,and already half buried in the molten light of the water. The scene is quite pretty, but it somehow seems strangely threatening when you notice the huge, curved, lightly glowing line etched into the sky straight above. You stare at it for a few seconds, wondering if it's some strange cloud formation, the sunlight shining into your eyes hindering your efforts.       <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh...

At least now I know what you call the moon around here.\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"what do you mean by 'The moon'? I thought I said <i>a </i>moon.

You walk towards the door and grope around for the knob. Naturally it was at your right hand's side, and you quickly found it and turned the knob. When you opened the door, you made a serious mistake. You ran into the jailer, and quickly did a back dash. It was a yellow digimon, specifically a Renamon that stood before you with an alarmed look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What're you doing outside the cages?\" She yelled. Instantly you turned around and made a run for it, and you hear her saying, \"Come back here!\" You ran as fast as you could, and you could see the small crawlspace from which you came. Without even looking back you performed a slide kick into the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit! He got away!\" Renamon screamed in frustration. She pulled out some sort of walky-talky and began talking into it. \"All guards be on alert. There is an escapee running around, a Treecko. Find him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathed a sigh of relief, but it quickly dissipated when you found out you were in the wrong position in the crawlspace. You were on your back, and you were facing the wrong direction. On top of that, the crawlspace was too tight to readjust your position. So you used your arms with some assistance from your legs to drag your body through the crawlspace, using the walls as a foothold.
